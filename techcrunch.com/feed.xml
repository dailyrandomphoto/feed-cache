		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-holmes-2b82778/">Alex Holmes</a> is chairman and CEO of <a href="https://ir.moneygram.com/">MoneyGram International</a>, the global leader in the evolution of digital P2P payments.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Governments around the world have been looking at adopting, regulating and even banning cryptocurrencies since the inception of Bitcoin. Ever since, the crypto ecosystem has been a rocket ship ride to the moon and back (multiple times). Today, it seems that more people than ever have hopped on for the ride.</p>
<p>We’ve also seen a massive shift toward digital platforms across all industries as a result of the pandemic. Political leaders globally have followed suit by taking steps to move their economies in the same direction.</p>
<p>One of the most recent examples is El Salvador, which made headlines by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender (a move that has since been protested by its citizens). In the initial announcement, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvadors-president-says-will-send-bill-make-bitcoin-legal-tender-2021-06-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the country&#8217;s president directly connected crypto as a competitor to remittances</a>, noting this would increase the amount of money low-income families in El Salvador receive from remittances by the &#8220;equivalent of billions of dollars every year.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251666" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			To be an effective form of cross-border payment flows, digital assets must overcome innate challenges that already dampen their adoption ability regardless of a cross-border use case.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Remittances — the act of individuals sending money to support their families and communities back home — make up a significant component of GDP for many countries. In fact, global remittances <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/05/infographic-what-are-the-world-s-top-remittance-recipients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">totaled roughly $700 billion in 2020</a>, $540 billion of which is noted to have been sent to low- and middle-income countries, according to the World Bank. El Salvador <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.TRF.PWKR.DT.GD.ZS?locations=SV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received nearly $6 billion</a> of that. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are estimated to currently make up less than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/remittance-firms-slow-add-bitcoin-despite-el-salvador-move-2021-06-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1% of the volume of global cross-border remittances</a>.</p>
<p>Is cryptocurrency an effective replacement for remittances? No, at least not yet.</p>
<p>The demand for each of our services is a market-specific story, and it’s not uncommon for recipients to still pick up cash despite having real-time digital and cash pay-out options available. This is not surprising, as many individuals who receive remittances have little or no ability to pay for goods and services digitally. Instead, they use retail, bank and other physical locations in the MoneyGram network to access the funds they need.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Digital currencies are certainly an additive factor, and crypto will no doubt have an impact in the years to come. But it will take time, and there are several headwinds to mainstream adoption and displacing cash for the millions of families who continue to rely on it.</p>
<p>For one, cryptocurrency transfers, quite frankly, currently aren’t a cheaper, faster or easier alternative than cash, particularly considering the complexities of converting crypto to/from local currencies.</p>
<p>Specific to El Salvador, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/san-salvador-coronavirus-pandemic-el-salvador-1623416c0ddc7aa238911f8a422b6c8b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remittances accounted for around a quarter of the country&#8217;s GDP</a> and benefit approximately 360,000 households. We know that buying and selling crypto is a much more complicated process than transferring and accepting money via a remittance platform. It is highly unlikely that all of those households are going to learn and adapt to an entirely new payment system soon.</p>
<p>Additionally, to buy goods or services with crypto, the digital asset needs to be converted back into local currency in almost all circumstances. That’s tough for the millions of people who rely on remittances for quick access to funds for essential daily needs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-moneygram-survey-reveals-strong-remittance-consumer-sentiment-driven-by-needs-abroad-and-digital-adoption-301446698.html?tc=eml_cleartime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A recent customer survey</a> found that senders are mainly transferring money to cover the costs for the very basics of survival and well-being, primarily for food (73%), healthcare (59%) and housing (54%). Crypto is simply not ready to be the lifeline that so many of these individuals depend on for immediacy. Crypto can be particularly volatile compared to most local currencies, so we cannot rely on it as a safe haven for those who are depending on $20 to be $20 by the time it reaches them. Look no further than <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/121815/bitcoins-price-history.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin’s price history</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, many countries have yet to recognize or provide legal pathways for cryptocurrency trading/payments, including the United States. The hype makes it seem as if we’ll be paying in Bitcoin for our holiday presents in 2022, but there are <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/11/20/bitcoin-ban-these-are-the-countries-where-crypto-is-restricted-or-illegal2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens on the other side of the aisle</a> taking the opposite approach.</p>
<p>To be an effective form of cross-border payment flows, digital assets must overcome innate challenges that already dampen their adoption ability regardless of a cross-border use case, including lack of utility, expense of exchanges, complexity, volatility, and limited on and off-ramps to local currencies.</p>
<p>I do believe crypto and digital currencies can eventually help streamline cross-border payments. Personally, I also have a great time &#8220;holding&#8221; crypto as an investment and being a part of this emerging industry. However, like most new technologies, digital assets still have their fair share of obstacles to address before they become the norm in global remittances.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: MoneyGram has embarked on a partnership with Stellar that allows digital wallets connected to the Stellar network to access MoneyGram&#8217;s global retail platform.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of high-profile exhibitors are opting out of next year’s CES. Samsung is among those big names sticking it out for next week’s show &#8212; which always proves a good exhibition of the company’s massive breadth in the electronics space, from TVs to washing machines to the occasional robot.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, however, Samsung’s C-Lab division has been its CES secret weapon, showcasing some of the projects built by the company’s in-house incubator. Created by employees who are afforded the ability to create pet projects, C-Labs’ projects aren’t always practical, but they’re often fascinating.</p>
<p>Effectively, they’re things that are traditionally out of the scope of a tech colossus like Samsung. Last year’s class, for instance, included an artificial window and smart highlighter.<a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-to-showcase-innovative-startup-projects-from-c-lab-inside-and-c-lab-outside-at-ces-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> This year’s batch</a> splits things into three categories: C-Lab Inside, C-Lab Outside and projects that have effectively spun out from Samsung.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251698" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Inside &#8212; the earliest of the three stages &#8212; includes an AI-powered smartphone app, called Piloto, designed to improve device habits; exam service PROBA; Innovision, which is designed to detect eye alignment in infants; and ZamStar, a guitar that features built-in LED guides for education. Outside, which was founded in 2018, is an accelerator that provides guidance to South Korean startups. That list includes nine companies. Per Samsung:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Petnow, an AI-based pet biometric recognition solution</li>
<li>Digisonic, a 3D immersive audio solution for mobile devices</li>
<li>Verses, an interactive metaverse music app</li>
<li>bitsensing, an array of imaging radar technology solutions for autonomous driving and smart cities</li>
<li>SELECTSTAR, an AI-based data collection and labelling platform</li>
<li>RGT Inc., a multifunctional modular serving robot</li>
<li>MoreDream Inc., an input system to improve accessibility and productivity for the visually impaired</li>
<li>Yellowknife, a vehicle display customization platform</li>
<li>MONIT, a smart diaper care solution for elderly patients</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Founded in 2012, C-Lab has worked with 406 companies thus far &#8212; a number Samsung expects to hit 500 by some point next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This year was a watershed for the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) industry, marked by billion-dollar exits, huge venture deals and more partnerships. But in many ways, the past year should be thought of as the setting of a chess board before a match: the pieces are in place. Now it is time to play.</p>
<p>That means that 2022 will be a make it or break it year, at least for those developers who have publicly stated ambitions of hitting commercial operations by 2024. What will next year hold in store, not just for them, but for the sector more broadly? Below are some top predictions and trends to look out for in the coming year.</p>
<h2>“It’s the year of put up or shut up.”</h2>
<p>Overall, the sentiment from experts, analysts and VCs we spoke to seemed to be that 2022 will be critical for separating the wheat from the chaff &#8212; specifically when it comes to certification of the aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration, a prerequisite for any company that hopes to get their aircraft off the ground.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The main story of 2022, it&#8217;s definitely going to be certification,” Sergio Cecutta, founder and partner at SMG Consulting, said. “It’s the year of put up or shut up.”</p>
<p>Due to certification timelines, Cecutta said that companies that want to enter service in 2024 need to start flying with the FAA for certification credit by the end of next year in order to hit that target.</p>
<p>David Wyatt, a technology analyst at IDTechEx, agreed. “What I want to see in 2022 is more aircraft in the air,” he said. “To have something that&#8217;s certifiable by [2024], they have to start getting substantial aircraft in the air and really demonstrating the capabilities of those aircraft.”</p>
<p>“They&#8217;re not going to be complete, finished products, but at least a real ramp up in prototyping is what you&#8217;d be wanting to see from these companies who have raised the money,” he added. “They need to start demonstrating to investors that they&#8217;re capable of building these aircraft and getting them through flight certification.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Automakers get serious</h2>
<p>While many of the biggest players in eVTOL are startups (or startups-turned-public companies, thanks to SPAC deals), they aren’t the only ones looking to take advantage of the potentially huge market for air taxis, drone deliveries or other applications of electric aviation.</p>
<p>Hyundai and Honda have not been shy about their eVTOL ambitions, with Hyundai unveiling a concept eVTOL at CES in 2020. At the end of 2021, it announced it had spun out its urban air mobility division into a separate business arm, dubbed Supernal, with the aim of bringing an aircraft to market in 2028.</p>
<p>Other automakers, principally Toyota and Stellantis, have already started joining in &#8212; in the form of major investments in Joby and a manufacturing deal with Archer, respectively. But we could see other automakers announcing their own eVTOL projects next year, Cyrus Sigari, co-founder and managing partner of UP Partners, said.</p>
<p>“I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we saw a meaningful move from Ford or GM in 2022,” he said.</p>
<h2>More SPACS</h2>
<p>As we detailed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/top-evtol-trends-2021/">part one</a> of our eVTOL retrospective, 2021 was undoubtedly the year of the SPACs. There was a notable uptake of this financial vehicle, not just in eVTOL but across the electric mobility space. It’s unclear whether this trend will continue into 2022, but the high capital demands of aviation could mean more startups are still looking for a huge injection of cash via the public markets.</p>
<p>Amy Burr, president of airline JetBlue’s venture capital arm, said that SPACs may be the best way to raise capital and access public markets for pre-revenue companies like electric aviation developers.</p>
<p>“I believe that that&#8217;s their only path forward, unless they could just continue to do venture rounds and raise more capital that way, which is always a possibility,” she said.</p>
<p>Sigari suggested there’s room for “two more” SPACs next year. “I&#8217;d be very surprised if the number is greater than five and I’m pretty sure it&#8217;s not going to be zero. This is assuming we don&#8217;t have a global financial crisis.”</p>
<p>There could be a slight tempering of the public market’s appetite for aviation technology. At the end of November, air taxi developer Volocopter cancelled its SPAC plans due to an “extremely unfavorable” environment for SPACs, <a href="https://financefwd.com/de/volocopter-ende-spac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a German publication reported</a>.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s always potential out there for more SPAC deals, but whether the Volocopter [deal] falling through is a sign of a general cooling of interest towards those kinds of deals, I guess we&#8217;ll have to see,” Wyatt said.</p>
<p>One thing that most experts we spoke to didn&#8217;t mention (or didn&#8217;t seem overly concerned with) is consolidation, which has hit other hot tech industries like autonomous vehicles. &#8220;With time it&#8217;s just inevitable that there will be consolidation and there will be companies that might not make it,&#8221; Cecutta said.</p>
<p>That omission suggests, at least to us, that perhaps the industry has not yet reached the apex of the hype cycle for emerging technologies &#8212; which suggests that despite the crazy cash flow and growing fanfare, there may still be a rocky road ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a remote island nation in the middle of the South Pacific, New Zealand is experiencing the stirrings of a burgeoning startup scene. The country has historically been capital-starved, but recent investments from the government and foreign investors have significantly increased access to early-stage venture capital funding. Now, certain industries are emerging as potential areas where New Zealand can win in the tech space.</p>
<p>Deep tech, medtech/biotech, climate tech, and crypto and blockchain are all areas that investors say they&#8217;re either actively investing in or watching for signs of scale.</p>
<p><em>Note: All monetary amounts are listed in New Zealand dollars unless otherwise stipulated. </em></p>
<h2>Deep tech</h2>
<p>New Zealand has the right mix of deep tech-focused capital and resources, strong engineering schools and major success stories that are helping create technologically sophisticated, globally scalable startups.</p>
<p>During the first half of this year, total investment in New Zealand&#8217;s early-stage sector increased 78% from the first half of 2020, 42% of which went directly to deep tech startups, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.nz/insights-and-publications/2021-publications/startup-investment-october-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to PwC</a>. Much of that funding came from New Zealand Growth Capital Partners (NZGCP), a government entity established to create a vibrant early-stage environment in New Zealand, via its Elevate fund of funds program that provides capital to New Zealand VCs investing in Series A and B rounds.</p>
<p>Last October, <a href="https://www.nzgcp.co.nz/funding/elevate-venture-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate allocated $20 million</a> to a fund managed by deep tech VC firm Pacific Channel. More recently, <a href="https://www.nzgcp.co.nz/news-and-media/new-blog/nuance-fund-receives-17m-nzgcp-committment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate committed $17 million to Nuance Connected Capital’s</a> fund focused on deep tech innovations, as well as $45 million to GD1’s Fund 3, which focuses on deep tech as well as connected hardware, enterprise software and health tech.</p>

			New Zealanders make really good founders. &#8230; There&#8217;s something about just growing up on a farm or, you know, playing beer float out in the lakes and rivers; New Zealand is just really resourceful. 							<cite>Blockchain NZ Chair Bryan Ventura</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Then there are groups, like Outset Ventures, formerly LevelTwo, that are geared toward helping seed and pre-seed deep tech startups get going. Outset is home to New Zealand’s only two deep tech unicorns, Rocket Lab and LanzaTech, both of which have spun out numerous other deep tech companies. Outset continues to be a resource for seed-stage startups that need not only money, but also connections to larger companies and access to workshops and labs. Just last year, Outset and Icehouse Ventures, a VC firm, partnered to raise a $12 million fund, which launched this April, for early-stage science and engineering startups. Imche Fourie, CEO of Outset, said the company has already made 40 investments from that fund.</p>
<p>Notable deep tech companies out of New Zealand include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/foundry-lab-raises-8m-to-quickly-cheaply-create-metal-castings-using-a-microwave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundry Lab</a>, a startup that creates metal castings quickly and cheaply with a microwave; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/soulmachines/empathetic-customer-experiences-the-next-big-step-for-marketing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soul Machines</a>, a platform that creates lifelike digital avatars that animate autonomously, responding to interactions and interpreting facial expressions, with personalities that evolve over time; and Dennisson Technologies, a wearables company that’s developing soft exosuits that incorporate 4D material technology to actively assist people with limited mobility due to physical or neurological disability.</p>
<p>The most Kiwi of deep tech startups, however, is Halter — a company that spun out of Rocket Lab and produces solar-powered smart cow collars that allow farmers to remotely shift and virtually fence and monitor cows in order to optimize pasture time. Founder Craig Piggott grew up on a dairy farm watching his parents struggle with the relentless work. After studying engineering at Auckland University of Technology and working at Rocket Lab, Piggott combined his experience to come up with a somewhat wacky and ambitious hardware and software play. Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck, who backed Halter, told TechCrunch he thinks it will be a globally scalable billion-dollar company.</p>
<p>The epitome of New Zealand’s deep tech scene is its over <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2019-11/Deloitte%20NZ%20Space%20Economy%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.75 billion space industry</a>. Rocket Lab, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is now a U.S.-owned company after a SPAC merger</a>, put New Zealand on the map as a place with minimal air traffic, clear skies and favorable aerospace regulations. As a result, companies are forming that can either send payloads into space or provide services to existing space companies.</p>
<p>Outset-backed Zenno Astronautics, for example, is developing a fuel-free satellite propulsion system that uses magnets powered by solar panels. Dawn Aerospace is working toward a remotely piloted aircraft that could take off like a normal airplane, drop a satellite payload and be back home in 15 minutes. And Astrix Autonautics, a startup founded by three Auckland University students, is being trialed by Rocket Lab to see if they can more than double the power-to-weight ratios of solar arrays used today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve visited a crypto company’s website recently, you’ve probably visited a URL ending in “.xyz&#8221; instead of its cheugier counterpart, .com. From fintech Block, formerly known as Square, to venture firm Paradigm, to blockchain startups like Mirror, .xyz has become the go-to URL ending for many web3 companies. But what does it mean, and why has it caught on in the web3 space?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.xyz, released to the public in 2014, first surged in popularity one year later when Google parent Alphabet decided to use it for their rebranded website. The internet behemoth had run into an increasingly widespread problem &#8212; the .com URLs for their brand were already taken, with BMW’s fleet management division using </span><a href="http://www.alphabet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alphabet.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and American Broadcasting Corporation at </span><a href="http://www.abc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abc.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Alphabet decided to open up shop at abc.xyz, which presented an “unlimited branding opportunity” for its “futuristic company,” Daniel Negari, </span><a href="https://ceo.xyz/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.xyz’s 36-year-old founder and CEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, told TechCrunch in an email. Now, .xyz may be one of the top five top-level domains (TLDs) in the world by traffic, according to the company’s own DNS data.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.xyz was created to “provide users around the world competition and choice when it comes to their domain name,” and is “the first truly generic domain extension with no inherent meaning,” according to Negari. While .com was meant for commercial use, .net for networks and .org for organizations, Negari envisioned .xyz as the TLD choice for users who felt they did not fit neatly into one of these categories or wanted to stand out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I firmly believe the market has adopted our mantra of “for every website everywhere,” Negari said. “Our mantra of openness and inclusion for everyone and everything has bled through into a community of creative thinkers that has embraced .xyz as their domain.”</span></p>
<h2>How .xyz met web3</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negari is an active crypto investor with “numerous” investments in the space, including Gemini, MoonPay and BlockFi, he said. Because of his interest in crypto, he reached out to Ethereum Name Service (ENS) creator Nick Johnson to pitch him a collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That historic collaboration allowed early adopters to use a .xyz domain as their wallet address,” Negari said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2250498" style="width: 461px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250498" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2250498" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/daniel_negari_about.jpeg?w=300" alt=".xyz founder and CEO Daniel Negari" width="451" height="293" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/daniel_negari_about.jpeg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/daniel_negari_about.jpeg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/daniel_negari_about.jpeg?resize=680,444 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/daniel_negari_about.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250498" class="wp-caption-text"><em>.xyz founder and CEO Daniel Negari <strong>Image Credits:</strong> XYZ</em></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ENS </span><a href="https://forkast.news/what-is-ens-ethereum-name-service-how-does-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows users to create a universal nickname</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all their crypto addresses, providing a searchable database to make crypto wallets and transactions, which otherwise reside on a variety of different platforms, more easily accessible. Users can now create profiles to share their social media handles or other personal information in ENS using its native .eth domain or on a .xyz domain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.xyz has continued to find ways to collaborate with ENS and work with the crypto community. It </span><a href="https://gen.xyz/blog/ethxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it launched its “eth.xyz” service, allowing users to search individual ENS profiles simply by adding “.xyz” to the end of their .eth name rather than having to go to the ENS database to look them up, Negari said. </span></p>
<p>By allowing cryptocurrency holders to buy domains in their preferred names using Ethereum, ENS has creatively monetized users&#8217; desire to leverage the internet as an identity-building tool. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke, for example, bought the ENS domain name tobi.eth earlier this month for 30 ether, equivalent to more than $120,000 at the time of the transaction.</p>
<p>Although .xyz domains currently fall under the purview of the DNS system, managed by internet regulatory authority <a href="https://www.icann.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICANN</a>, several parties are now working to develop a decentralized alternative to this system to underpin web3, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/yat-thinks-emoji-identities-can-be-a-thing-and-it-has-20m-in-sales-to-back-it-up/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Amanda Silberling reported</a>. .xyz&#8217;s strategy to align itself proactively with web3 companies could present a host of new monetization opportunities based on identity and ownership in a decentralized web as this generation of internet users stakes new claims on domains.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">.xyz runs a blog where it highlights companies, many of them web3 native, that have chosen to use its domain name ending, and cites reasons why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them opted to use it for simple logistical reasons. Defi platform Matcha </span><a href="https://gen.xyz/blog/matchaxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using the .xyz web extension gave it many more naming options, and Ethereum data tool Dune </span><a href="https://gen.xyz/blog/dunexyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chose .xyz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it allowed for a more concise web address. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its domains, available to anyone who wants to purchase them, also </span><a href="https://www.hostinger.com/blog/why-we-believe-xyz-is-the-new-com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tend to be more affordable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to their alternatives. To that end, .xyz launched a class of domains known as 1.111B, which are 6- to 9-digit numerical domains available for 99 cents each year, Negari said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond its convenience and accessibility, some web3 builders see .xyz as a symbolic representation of their ambitions to build a new internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We chose .xyz because it symbolizes decentralization and the new wave of Web3 applications,” Réka, the founder of decentralized autonomous organization Agora DAO, </span><a href="https://gen.xyz/blog/agoraxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negari agrees that .xyz’s cultural significance may be one of its most important attributes, as it </span><a href="https://ceo.xyz/page/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">represents the next generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of online innovation after the .com era. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The community is made up of hundreds of thousands to millions of individuals and small businesses who are actively breaking away from the status quo to take a stand for the future,” Negari said. “You do not have to be a non-profit organization or a commercial registrant &#8211; you can be whatever and whoever you want.”</span></p>

<p>Europe has a well-earned reputation for regulating Big Tech, taking the lead on privacy, data protection and especially competition. Now, new antitrust legislation that introduces criteria to identify large online “gatekeepers” is winding its way through the European Parliament. But while the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Markets Act</a> is expected to target a number of U.S. tech companies, if used strategically the DMA — and European antitrust and competition policy writ large — can also be a tool to compete with China.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Europe has slowly awakened to China’s challenge to transatlantic technology leadership. Although many Europeans are slowly converging on Washington’s threat perceptions, Europe still lacks the tools and political will to address challenges emanating from Beijing’s juggernauts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251286" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While transatlantic policy responses to China should be aligned, they need not be the same. The United States and Europe should leverage their respective strengths and toolboxes to combat China’s market distorting practices in the technology sphere. And Europe should bring its comparative advantage — developing and enforcing competition policy — to bear to compete with China, beginning with the DMA.<br />

<p>Beijing’s tech giants are competing for size and control of the global technology ecosystem — a dynamic the transatlantic partners cannot afford to ignore. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has set the goal of market domination for their largest technology companies. To achieve this goal, the CCP is engaged in anti-competitive behavior to improve their companies’ market positions. In addition to state subsidies, the CCP often provides sweetheart deals to companies to improve their market standing.</p>
<p>The 5G case study illustrates this dynamic. The Chinese government <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-support-helped-fuel-huaweis-global-rise-11577280736" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> 5G champion Huawei with $75 billion of state support through tax breaks, discounted resources and financing assistance. Meanwhile, China’s domestic market enables state-backed champions — including Huawei — to leverage very little competition and high market share within China to offer services for a fraction of the price in third countries. When faced with this reality, Europe’s leading producers of 5G technology, Nokia and Ericsson, previously struggled to compete with Huawei in their home market. Beijing’s domestic economic policy thus has global consequences.</p>
<p>In the past year, European countries have formed investment screening mechanisms to combat Beijing’s growing footprint in Europe. Yet, they still have work to do. Of the 27 member states, only 18 have <a href="https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2019/june/tradoc_157946.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established</a> investment screening mechanisms, though an additional six are in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-23/chinese-deals-in-europe-fall-as-eu-slowly-ramps-up-screening" target="_blank" rel="noopener">development</a>. There are also reasons to question the mechanism’s efficacy. The European Commission only <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/40171032-f4e0-419e-addd-b1d3dc6bc606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked</a> eight of the 265 projects they examined. Only 8% of the examined projects <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/40171032-f4e0-419e-addd-b1d3dc6bc606" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were</a> Chinese projects. And they don’t explicitly tackle anti-competitive behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s beginning to change. In May 2021, the European Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> a regulation on foreign subsidies distorting the internal market, which introduces tools to investigate and potentially halt financial contributions by a non-EU government involving foreign subsidies. But while Europe’s nascent efforts are encouraging, they are not enough to address Chinese companies’ market positions and the Chinese government’s distortive policies.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Europe is well positioned to leverage its regulatory momentum. Given China’s multifaceted playbook, Europe should think beyond subsidies. To effectively compete with China’s tech giants and address the unfair market position of Chinese companies, Europe must use antitrust regulations to target Chinese companies engaging in anti-competitive behavior, including by calibrating the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Pairing investment screenings with antitrust policy would give Brussels ample tools to address Beijing’s anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>Combating China’s anti-competitive behavior through antitrust policy is a logical extension of Europe’s toolkit. While the United States traditionally views antitrust policy through the lens of consumer welfare, Europe often views antitrust policy through the lens of market competition. Furthermore, Europe is often loath to view Chinese companies through a national security or anti-China frame. While investment screenings mechanisms focus on national security, antitrust and competition policy is pursued to ensure market competition in Europe. This framing makes addressing Beijing’s anti-competitive practices through antitrust policy a natural fit for Europe. In fact, last week, members of the European Parliament <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/eu-parliament-backs-tough-new-rules-rein-us-tech-giants-2021-12-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argued</a> that the DMA should be extended to China’s Alibaba.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Such a move would also correct for <a href="https://twitter.com/ProgressChamber/status/1468647693182550024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived</a> anti-American bias when it comes to antitrust enforcement. Commission officials maintain that Chinese companies do not do enough business in Europe to be subject to DMA. But that approach means that American firms are targeted by European regulators almost exclusively. Yet when viewed through a geopolitical lens, China’s technology national champions pose a greater threat than U.S. technology companies to Europe’s innovation ecosystem. This continues to be a point of contention in Washington and threatens to weaken the transatlantic relationship.</p>
<p>While Europe often bristles at the United States’ anti-China framing of technology issues, moving forward with a pro-democracy affirmative agenda — Europe’s preferred framing of the challenge — requires the United States and Europe to bolster their respective innovation ecosystems. Exclusively targeting U.S. companies in the Digital Markets Act threatens to hobble potential transatlantic cooperation and hinder an affirmative transatlantic agenda.</p>
<p>While the Digital Markets Act is not wrong to keep U.S. tech companies accountable, it is an opportunity for Europe to use antitrust and competition policy to recalibrate an approach to the China challenge that fits European perceptions and strengths. Europe shouldn’t miss this opportunity to address China’s market distorting behavior and to add another tool to its toolbox to push back on China’s anti-competitive behavior.<br />

There are the &#8220;haves&#8221; (public companies with revenue growth of over 30%) and the &#8220;have nots&#8221; (everyone else) of B2B software.</p>
<p>The chart below demonstrates just how drastically the &#8220;haves&#8221; separated themselves from the rest. With average EV/revenue multiple up +28.5x for companies that grew over 50% and +9.9x for companies that grew 30%-50% since 2019, compared to just +2.9x for those that grew by 10%-30%.</p>
<p>The real trick is identifying why certain companies are “haves” and how they remain that way. Put differently, what is it about companies like Zoom, Datadog, Monday.com and Asana that drive their outsized valuations? More importantly, are there strategies or tactics that management teams can employ to optimize for this type of outcome?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hi again friends, and welcome to Daily Crunch for Monday, December 27.</p>
<p>I continue to captain the USS Cruncherprise while <a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> is out on vacation. If you&#8217;re missing his wit and wisdoms, fear not: He&#8217;ll be back next week.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251606" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As I mentioned last week, the news cycle tends to get a bit quieter in these last weeks of December — so expect these daily recaps to be a bit more compact accordingly. We should be back in the full swing of things next week, if only because that&#8217;s when CES is happening. (And, yes, it&#8217;s apparently still happening, despite a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces/">number of the biggest companies</a> pulling out.)</p>
<p>—<a href="http://twitter.com/Grg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/remembering-the-startups-we-lost-in-2021/">Remembering the startups we lost in 2021:</a></strong> Houseparty! Dark Sky! Loon! A few members of the TC team put together a list of the products, projects and tech companies that shut down (or announced plans to shutdown) this year. Fry&#8217;s Electronics gets an honorable mention because, though it was hardly a startup, its shutdown leaves a massive &#8220;pyramid-shaped hole in the hearts of many who grew up wandering its aisles.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/24/gift-guide-techcrunchs-favorite-things-of-2021/">TC&#8217;s fav things:</a></strong> Team TC also put together its annual list of its &#8220;favorite things&#8221; of the year, with &#8220;things&#8221; defined … as, well, anything. We love doing this one; it ends up being a big mish-mashed list of stuff worth knowing about (I really can&#8217;t stop listening to Kirsten&#8217;s air traffic controller music recommendation), and doubles as a little glimpse into the in-the-moment headspaces of the folks who keep this place going.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/26/accessibility-awareness-is-on-the-rise-but-is-it-turning-into-action/"><strong>Is accessibility awareness resulting in better accessibility?</strong></a> Companies are doing a better job of <em>talking</em> about accessibility, but are their words leading to actual results? Joe Devon, co-founder of the Global Accessibility Awareness Day, takes us on a deep dive into the data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/26/naren-gupta-nexus-venture-partners/">Naren Gupta passes away:</a></strong> The co-founder of Nexus Venture Partners died on Saturday at the age of 73. Manish Singh shares details of Gupta&#8217;s life, his many successes and how the venture capitalist helped &#8220;plant Indian SaaS startups on the world map.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/24/nigerian-edtech-startup-teesas-secures-1-6-million-in-pre-seed-round-to-launch-tutor-marketplace-expand-in-east-southern-francophone-africa-in-2022/">Teesas raises $1.6M:</a></strong> Less than two months after launch, Nigerian edtech startup Teesas has raised a $1.6 million pre-seed round. The company offers a subscription program for students that delivers live/recorded content designed to pair right up with what they&#8217;re learning in school.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/indian-neobank-jupiter-raises-86-million-to-launch-lending-and-wealth-management-services/">Jupiter raises $86 million:</a></strong> The Indian neobank startup, not the gas planet. Just a few months after launching publicly, the company&#8217;s founder says the service has &#8220;just short of half a million users.&#8221; This round values the company at $711 million, more than doubling its valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/nubank-co-leads-45-million-investment-in-indian-neobank-jupiter/">from August</a>.</li>

<h2>Foreign investors, mature startups redraw New Zealand’s VC funding landscape</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2251411" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/26/new-zealands-maturing-vc-funding-landscape-piques-interest-of-foreign-investors/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251411" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2251411 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-1159746919.jpg" alt="Abstract of New Zealand map network, internet and global connection concept, Wire Frame 3D mesh polygonal network line, design sphere, dot and structure.

<p>For a country with just over five million people, New Zealand&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/26/new-zealands-maturing-vc-funding-landscape-piques-interest-of-foreign-investors/">startup ecosystem is punching well above its weight.</a></p>
<p>In 2020, investors bet $158 million on 108 deals, the third consecutive year of growth. After a series of exits like RocketLab, Pushpay and Seequent, foreign investors like Sequoia and Founders Fund have taken notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m hopeful over the next five years we’re going to start seeing more unicorns and real successes coming out of the market, which I think will create a positive halo effect and that’ll create the next generation of founders,&#8221; said James Pinner, acting CEO of New Zealand venture fund Elevate.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/gm-is-also-dropping-its-in-person-ces-plans/">More big companies back out of CES:</a></strong> While the Consumer Electronics Show is still set to go on as planned, a number of huge companies won&#8217;t be there this time — at least, not in person. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/as-exhibitors-mull-attendance-amid-omicron-ces-organizers-stand-firm/">T-Mobile</a> was the first huge name to drop its in-person presence at the show due to the ongoing COVID spike; a number of companies have since followed their lead, including Google, Lenovo, Intel, GM, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/24/tiktok-moderator-sues-over-mental-trauma-caused-by-graphic-videos/">TikTok moderator sues:</a></strong> Content moderation is a massive challenge that, arguably, no major social network has gotten right. Machines aren&#8217;t really up to the job yet, and hiring people to do it is like saying &#8220;You know all the vile, horrifying, absolute-worst bits of the internet? Here&#8217;s a firehose of it!&#8221; A TikTok moderator sued parent company ByteDance this week over trauma they experienced on the job; according to the complaint, tackling the &#8220;sheer volume of content&#8221; required moderators to &#8220;simultaneously view three to 10 videos at the same time.&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the morning of December 21st, <a href="https://twitter.com/6Gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kimberly Bryant</a>, CEO and co-founder of nonprofit organization <a href="https://www.blackgirlscode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Girls Code</a>, learned that she could no longer access her work e-mail. The board of directors at the nonprofit organization, which she founded a decade ago, sent a note to her personal email notifying her that she had been &#8220;suspended indefinitely.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Press release: So it’s 3 days before Christmas and you wake up to discover the organization YOU created and built from the ground up has been taken away by a rogue board with no notification,” Bryant <a href="https://twitter.com/6Gems/status/1473386563904196613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a tweet.</a> Two days later, Bryant responded to her temporary removal in a formal statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“First and foremost, I know that I have not personally done anything unethical, immoral, or illegal as the Founder and CEO of Black Girls Code,” read the statement. “As a founder who has built something from her own blood, sweat, and tears from the ground up, this fight for me is about justice and giving rights to founders, especially women in leadership. We must be treated fairly and just.&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Bryant’s statement continued: “None of the so-called allegations have been substantiated, no investigation has even started, and this entire process has been dishonest and unlawful.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251585" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="c-message_actions__container c-message__actions" role="group">
<div class="c-message_actions__group" role="group" aria-label="Message shortcuts" data-qa="message-actions"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In a later statement to TechCrunch, the Black Girls Code board of directors said that they formed a special committee to review and evaluate complaints made by current and former employees about Bryant’s conduct. The board formed a special committee to review the complaints, and placed Bryant on paid administrative leave last week “to ensure a full and fair review process.”</span></div>
</div>
<p>In her statement, Bryant identified interim board chair<a href="https://twitter.com/HeatherHiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Heather Hiles</a>, founder of edtech company Pathbrite, as the person who ultimately decided to suspend her “without fair investigation or substantiated allegations.” When asked for more specifics by TechCrunch, Hiles responded in a text message that “the board has a fiduciary responsibility to protect the organization and the well-being of its staff. I can confirm that the recent activities are a result of following through in that responsibility.”</p>
<p>Through a spokesperson, the board declined to comment on if there is an impending investigation, the process of Bryant’s suspension and if the founder was given any notice before being put on leave. The board also declined to comment on the timeline for the ongoing review.</p>
<p>The founder claims there has been no active investigation, even after she approved a payment in October 2021 requested by an ad hoc committee of the board of directors to hire an attorney to conduct one. The board said in a statement it has formed a special committee “to review and evaluate the complaints and determine what, if any, action should be taken with respect to these concerns.” The committee is fully made up of BCG board members.</p>
<p>Bryant founded Black Girls Code in February 2011 to close the opportunity gap in tech for Black women and girls. Since then, the nonprofit has <a href="https://blackgirlscode.com/faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">established 15 chapter cities</a> in the U.S. and abroad, hosting technology workshops, hackathons and other enrichment opportunities for over 30,000 Black girls, it says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Senior sources currently employed at the company say that Sofia Mohammed, Black Girl Code’s vice president of programming, is serving as interim CEO. TechCrunch reached out to Mohammed, who has not yet responded to a request for comment.</p>
<h2>&#8220;A mix of emotions&#8221;</h2>
<p>Five former employees of Black Girls Code spoke to TechCrunch anonymously out of fear of retaliation about the state of affairs at BGC. They confirmed the board&#8217;s decision to look into the company culture after a summer of rapid turnover, with many individuals citing Bryant as a key reason for parting ways.</p>
<p>Bryant attributed the turnover to distributed work. “Now, like many orgs navigating the pandemic, we had a lot of turnover in the last year mostly from folks we hired while virtual in 2020. We were not spared the ‘great resignation’,” she said in a text message in response to allegations.</p>
<p>Two former employees, both who spent months at the organization in leadership capacities, say employee churn was largely attributed to Bryant’s leadership style, which they describe was “rooted in fear.” When Bryant was there, they say she would publicly berate managers within meetings, repeatedly calling folks incompetent and urging a manager to “go back to school” when they were unable to deliver on a certain task.</p>
<p>Bryant denied that she said this, pointing to her choice to hire consultants to build a compensation policy to weigh employees&#8217; years of experience over number of degrees. “As a techie in an industry where not everyone needs a degree, it’s not something I place a high value on.”</p>
<p>One employee said that a recurring phrase Bryant used was, “you’re not living up to my expectations of what you should be,” even though, the employee notes, she declined to give them independent access to widely used productivity tools. No new employees were given access to Salesforce, which they said prevented them from accessing key information about the community they were tasked with serving, including names, ages and history in the program. One employee detailed the lack of onboarding process, as well as Bryant’s absence in the daily operations in pursuit of media appearances.</p>
<p>“People stayed because they figured out the workarounds,” said one of the former employees. “Someone said that it was to your benefit to stay off her radar, and if you could figure out how to execute your work even without access to specific systems, you’d be fine.” Bryant said that BGC just completed a five-year strategy plan with the Bridgespan Group &#8220;that addresses operational concerns,&#8221; which would include strategies around what databases employees have access to. The founder denies having any control over who can access what.</p>
<p>A recently resigned employee conveyed a mix of emotions.</p>
<p>“We know how it is perceived to take down a Black person,” they said. “And that’s not even what we want to accomplish. We want the organization to be under leadership that could continue the growth of our work.”</p>
<p>Despite belief in the mission, they said they finally left the company, partially thanks to consulting their therapist. “To work for an organization that is trying to change how you are treated, valued and appreciated — and when that doesn’t happen again — it&#8217;s really a particular kind of betrayal,” they added.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted tweet, Bryant said that “I am driven, [have] high expectations, and [am] a bit of a perfectionist. But I have never in my life misappropriated, misused, or abused anything or anybody for the org I built out of love. So don’t ever ever believe that. It’s not true.”</p>
<h2>Checks and balances</h2>
<p>Despite Bryant’s denial of former employees&#8217; allegations, currently employed sources close to the matter say that resignations, along with <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Black-Girls-CODE-Reviews-E1375937.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a slew of negative Glassdoor reviews</a>, caused the founder to hire <a href="https://edgilityconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edgility Consulting</a>, an external firm, to do a salary study and address staff concerns. According to a document obtained by TechCrunch, the consultation was launched in June and completed in December. The findings were not made available.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlamonterroso/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karla Monterroso</a>, an executive coach, told TechCrunch in an interview that Bryant hired her in September 2021 after complaints against Bryant and the nonprofit’s culture surfaced.</p>
<p>While Monterroso declined to offer specifics of her conversations with Bryant, she said they met for 90 minutes every other week about culture at the company and the operational complexities ahead. Monterroso was not contacted before the leadership change. The board, which is conducting an ongoing review, has yet to confirm if it has hired an external firm, reviewed salary structures or brought in a board consultant.</p>
<p>“I think there are a lot of imperfect leaders trying to do their very best, and I believe that the story is about systemic complexity that is popping up for leaders of color,” Monterroso said. “And not about any one organization or individual, it’s about the poor conditions that exist for our leaders and our teams to succeed with their dignity intact.”</p>
<p>At the time of publication, Bryant is still employed at the nonprofit but continues to not have access to her company e-mail and internal platforms. Current employees and contractors were told that if they communicated with Bryant, they would immediately be fired, Bryant says.</p>
<p>“Checks and balances of power and support have been put in place at BGC, and I absolutely believe in proper board/corporate governance,” Bryant said in the written statement. There is nothing about how this matter was handled that is appropriate, and I have not been treated fairly or justly.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. App Annie says global spending across iOS and Google Play is up to $135 billion in 2021, and that figure will likely be higher when its annual report, including third-party app stores in China, is released next year. Consumers also downloaded 10 billion more apps this year than in 2020, reaching nearly 140 billion in new installs, it found.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that was up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249990" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3><strong>900+ app publishers will see their first $1 million in 2021</strong></h3>

<p>Sensor Tower is <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/million-dollar-publishers-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forecasting</a> that the number of publishers set to see their first $1 million (or more) in annual net income in 2021 has nearly doubled since 2016. This year, more than 900 publishers will reach this milestone, up nearly 91% from the 475 who hit the milestone in 2016. This 900+ breaks down to 581 on iOS and 325 on Google Play, it notes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250008" style="width: 1562px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250008" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2250008 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/category-breakdown-app-store-million-dollar-publishers-2021.png" alt="" width="1552" height="1140" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/category-breakdown-app-store-million-dollar-publishers-2021.png 1552w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/category-breakdown-app-store-million-dollar-publishers-2021.png?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/category-breakdown-app-store-million-dollar-publishers-2021.png?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/category-breakdown-app-store-million-dollar-publishers-2021.png?resize=768,564 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/category-breakdown-app-store-million-dollar-publishers-2021.png?resize=680,499 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/category-breakdown-app-store-million-dollar-publishers-2021.png?resize=1536,1128 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/category-breakdown-app-store-million-dollar-publishers-2021.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1552px) 100vw, 1552px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250008" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor TowerBroken down by category, mobile game publishers continued to account for the largest percentage of iOS apps that hit the $1 million milestone in 2021, with a 32% share of the overall total. Social networking apps followed with an 11% share, then Entertainment, Health &amp; Fitness and Productivity apps, at 7%, 7% and 6%, respectively. On Google Play, games also led but accounted for even more of the milestone-achieving apps, with a 43% share.</p></div></p>
<p>However, the figure represents a decline from last year, when 1,003 publishers hit their first net $1 million in global revenue &#8212; a change that Sensor Tower chalks up to a normalization of consumer behavior after the pandemic drove installs up during 2020 to outsized levels. Consumers in 2021 experimented with fewer new apps than during the height of the pandemic, the report noted.</p>

<h3>China&#8217;s laws impact the number of available apps</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3160457/chinas-big-tech-crackdown-number-apps-falls-40-cent-over-three" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South China Morning Post</a> this week reported on how China&#8217;s big tech crackdown is playing out across the Chinese app stores. According to its findings, the number of available mobile apps has fallen 40% over the past three years as new data laws and other clean-up campaigns went into effect. By the numbers, Chinese app stores had 4.52 million apps in December 2018, but as of October 2021, that had dropped to just 2.78 million. It also noted the biggest declines took place over the course of this year, as Beijing further cracked down on big tech with its new data privacy laws.</p>
<h3><strong>The Netherlands orders Apple to allow dating apps to offer alternative payments</strong></h3>
<p>The Netherlands is the latest country looking to regulate the app stores with a new ruling, as reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apples-app-store-broke-competition-laws-dutch-watchdog-says-2021-12-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a>, that says Apple has violated the country&#8217;s competition laws via its in-app purchase policies. However, the case in this market is unique because it&#8217;s only applying to a segment of the app store &#8212; specifically, dating apps. (Match, of course, has been a significant Apple critic and has been pushing for new payment policies both in the U.S. and abroad.) The Netherlands&#8217; Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) says that Apple has until January 15 to implement App Store changes. If the company fails to comply, it could be fined up to €50 million ($56.6 million), the report notes. Apple has appealed the ruling.</p>

<p>Known for an AI-powered lip-syncing app, Wombo&#8217;s latest app, <a href="https://www.wombo.art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dream</a>, is tapping into AI to create art. (Read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/wombo-dream-app/">TechCrunch&#8217;s review by Natasha Lomas here</a>). To use the app, you type in what you want to create a picture of, then choose a style &#8212; like vibrant, pastel, dark fantasy, steampunk, etc. Dream will then spend a few seconds making the finished composition &#8212; some of which look better than others. You can repeat the process until it delivers a result you like. The app has already seen over 10 million images created by users and has been downloaded over 1 million times across <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/wombo-dream/id1586366816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.womboai.wombodream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The late Harvard Business School professor <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Clayton_Christensen_World_Economic_Forum_2013.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clayton Christensen</a> found that in many sectors, low-end disruptors typically take hold at the bottom of the market and then work up to satisfy more demanding market segments. That very phenomenon is happening in the investment management industry. The industry is now showing the traditional earmarks of a sector ripe for disruption — most obviously, unhappy customers and very profitable incumbents.</p>
<p>In order to understand the next wave of disrupters, we use professor Christensen’s formal Disruptive Innovation framework. He popularized the idea of analyzing a company by looking at the &#8220;<a href="http://www.christenseninstitute.org/key-concepts/jobs-to-be-done/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jobs to be done</a>&#8221; its clients needed. Most money managers think their main job is generating alpha, but they are wrong. According to Amanda Tepper, CEO of <a href="http://www.chestnutadvisory.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chestnut Advisory Group</a>, investment performance alone does not drive asset flows.</p>
<p>We summarize below all of the jobs to be done by an investment manager in each category, across technical, functional, and emotional benefits. For example, Vanguard Group delivers not only the technical and functional benefits of low-cost investing, but ladders that into the emotional benefit of trust, of putting clients first and not making an excessive profit.</p>
<h2>The hierarchy of jobs to be done by investment managers</h2>
<h3>Technical: What the product/experience does/is — &#8220;the offer&#8221;</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investment strategy:</strong> Generate alpha; don’t lose (too much) money; match liabilities and obligations; minimize expenses, and taxes; exposure to targeted sectors; legacy/achieve political or social goals; and protection from tail risks.</li>
<li><strong>Execute investments:</strong> Source/generate investment ideas; research/due diligence; make investment decisions; manage portfolio and exit.</li>
<li><strong>Administer investments:</strong> Administration; build optionality; compliance with the law and religion; and transfer wealth to heirs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Functional: What the product/experience provides to the client — &#8220;the execution&#8221;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy and convenient user interface; customer service; access to networks; education; self-discipline.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Emotional: How the product/experience makes the client feel — &#8220;the tone&#8221;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Peace of mind; social validation; exclusivity; control; excitement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical jobs to be done</h2>
<p>A money manager must do all of the technical jobs at an acceptable level just to get in the game. We’ve listed below the major technical jobs, in roughly descending level of importance. We break these into three subcategories: (a) investment strategy; (b) execute investments; (c) administer investments.</p>
<h2>Investment strategy</h2>
<p><strong>Generate alpha</strong></p>
<p>Some investors look to optimize for the highest returns above all other goals. They can typically tolerate extended volatility.</p>
<p>Investors focused on returns may want to invest in the most nascent of asset classes, which historically have generated astronomical returns for early investors. Historical examples include art, <a href="http://ctxglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon credits</a>, collectibles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrencies</a>, <a href="http://points.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frequent flyer miles</a>, internet domain names, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_Share_Agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifetime individual income</a>, <a href="http://www.longfordcapital.com/litigation-finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">litigation finance</a>, mineral rights, <a href="http://icapip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patents</a>, receivables, SaaS company <a href="https://medium.com/John_Street_Capital/recurring-revenue-the-rise-of-an-asset-class-eff0c4be9fa0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recurring revenue</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>, <a href="https://www.wave.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media accounts</a>, <a href="https://www.acqu.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBA third-party sellers on Amazon</a> and other virtual currencies such as video game currencies.</p>
<p>These asset classes usually lack liquidity, legal protection, credibility among professional investors and indices, and they’re extremely high risk. However, as they develop, these asset classes accrete more of the infrastructure of the larger, established asset classes.</p>

<p>Similarly, angel investing is the highest-returning asset class we’re aware of, with median returns of 18% to 54% across 12 academic studies. However, angel investing has a long duration, extreme dispersion, high time requirements and poor visibility.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t lose (too much) money</strong></p>
<p>People <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hate</a> to lose money more than they care about making money. The clearest example of serving this need are specialists in structured products, e.g., <a href="https://axiofinancial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axio Financial</a>. <a href="https://haloinvesting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halo</a> is a two-sided marketplace connecting investors to structured products offered by leading global financial institutions, easing access to these instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Match liabilities and obligations</strong></p>
<p>Pension funds are the best example of investors who do not prioritize getting the highest return possible but want assurance that they can meet their financial obligations on time. Even a family office that may not have a legal obligation to pay pensions does need to plan ahead for when they’ll get cash from the other side of their illiquid investments.</p>
<p>The universal liability is inflation. Inflation-linked bonds are an innovative tool to address this liability, alongside traditional inflation hedges such as real estate and commodities. In some markets used to high inflation, such as <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/business/india-pips-china-worlds-biggest-gold-consumer-2014-2096495.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China and India</a>, money molders choose to invest a significant portion of their wealth into gold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">2021 was the year micromobility as a concept, a solution and a way of life really started to settle in.</p>
<p>Increased shared micromobility and COVID-ridden public transit helped make small electric vehicles mainstream enough for people to wrap their heads around purchasing their own. Consequently, 2021 was the year of the e-bike, with a <a href="https://www.npd.com/news/blog/2021/the-cycling-market-pedals-ahead-in-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growth rate in sales of 240%</a> over the 12 months leading up to July. This new normal resulted in cities adopting infrastructure plans that would have truly been unbelievable a decade ago <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=paris+cycling+city&amp;oq=paris+cycling+city&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3123j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(looking at you Paris!</a>).</p>
<p>2021 was also the year that people, particularly people in cities, began talking openly about the impact of micromobility on emissions reduction, which is undoubtedly greater than the advent of the electric car.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247779" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This year, we saw shared micromobility companies really take advantage of this shift in mindset toward the humble e-scooter and e-bike, using their dominant market positions to become more operationally efficient and get their hardware on point.</p>
<p>So with all of this behind us setting the groundwork for the future, let&#8217;s take a look at the top predictions for the micromobility space in 2022.</p>
<h2>E-bikes for everyone</h2>
<p>The e-bike trend is expected to continue into 2022, especially as countries like the U.S. are now <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/bidens-build-back-better-bill-may-provide-up-to-a-900-e-bike-tax-credit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offering subsidies worth up to $900</a> off a new e-bike&#8217;s purchase price. But the craze won&#8217;t stop with private consumers. Tony Ho, vice president of Segway&#8217;s global business development, says the company is seeing a big jump in demand for e-bikes from micromobility companies, as well. Segway has been known to supply e-scooters and e-bikes to most of the giants of shared micromobility, such as Lime and Bird.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the beginning Lime was a bike-sharing company, but it didn&#8217;t go anywhere until they started to do scooters, partly because the scooter is cheaper and also it&#8217;s easier to deploy,&#8221; Ho told TechCrunch. &#8220;Now it seems like the e-bike is getting a lot more traction and we&#8217;re seeing the mix start to even out and seeing a lot more orders on the e-bike side for sharing. And for the cities, it&#8217;s a no-brainer because they have bicycle sharing programs to begin with.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Fresh VC money is drying up</h2>
<p>Some of the big players, like Bird and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/micro-mobility-startup-helbiz-to-go-public-via-a-spac-and-will-expand-into-ghost-kitchens/">Helbiz</a>, have gone public, something <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/lime-raises-523-million-as-it-prepares-to-go-public/">Lime has promised to do next year</a>, and the industry has generally consolidated under a few big names. So instead of more VC money and new entrants pouring in, we&#8217;re likely to see the current market mature.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EdvgVkPwaO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/birds-first-public-earnings-show-missed-q3-revenue-but-potential-for-full-year-growth/">Bird&#8217;s first public earnings show slight miss in Q3 revenue, full-year guidance improved</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bird&#8217;s first public earnings show slight miss in Q3 revenue, full-year guidance improved&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/birds-first-public-earnings-show-missed-q3-revenue-but-potential-for-full-year-growth/embed/#?secret=EdvgVkPwaO" data-secret="EdvgVkPwaO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;After the whole Bird and Lime craze, I think investors have moved onto something different, like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/segway-makes-its-first-foray-into-sidewalk-robot-delivery-with-coco-partnership/">Coco sidewalk robot delivery guys</a>,&#8221; said Ho. &#8220;It still takes quite a bit of capital to get into this business, and the smaller guys, I personally think it&#8217;s gonna be tougher for them especially because cities require you to pay for the license, buy insurance. It&#8217;s not actually a game for the small startup anymore. Whoever survived the last wave will probably be here to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>And those who are staying are doing everything they can to drive down costs, become more efficient and sustainable and be more compliant with city regulations.</p>
<h2>But … the ride-share companies might be coming back to play</h2>
<p>&#8220;The orders and interest we got show a lot of companies are coming back to play, so that next year, as people come out of the pandemic, micromobility is becoming a priority on their agenda,&#8221; said Ho. &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing some companies coming back, including the big names like the ride-share guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the summer of 2020, micromobility was in bad shape due to pandemic lockdowns. Uber, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">sold off its micromobility company Jump to Lime</a>, and more integration between the two companies followed. In May last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/lyft-ends-electric-scooter-operations-in-oakland-austin-and-san-jose/">Lyft also ended many of its fledgling e-scooter programs</a>, but if Ho is to be believed, these two companies might try to get back in the game before they lose all market share.</p>
<h2>Expect to see more AI, smarter vehicles</h2>
<p>Cities really hate it when scooterists ride and park their vehicles on the sidewalk. They hate it so much, their hate has caused many companies to innovate and create some seriously smart scooters. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/">Spin</a>, Helbiz and Voi are already testing out camera-based systems that can detect when a rider is riding on a sidewalk or about to hit a pedestrian and even have the capability to stop the ride in real time. Others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/superpedestrian-acquires-navmatic-to-detect-and-control-unsafe-e-scooter-rider-behavior/">Superpedestrian</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/bird-vehicles-can-now-accurately-detect-sidewalk-riding-and-slow-riders-to-a-stop/">Bird</a> are using a highly accurate location-based approach to implement similar advanced rider-assistance systems. Once companies figure out how to keep costs down and cities around the globe get a whiff of this fun-killing tech, the trend will only become more commonplace.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Advanced rider assistance systems: Tech spawned by the politics of micromobility&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/embed/#?secret=ntipW2WxFl" data-secret="ntipW2WxFl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mircromobility ADAS systems will extend beyond the shared market. Already companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/streetlogic-launches-computer-vision-based-e-bike-collision-warning-system-raises-2-1m/">Streetlogic</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/the-station-intel-eyes-an-ipo-for-mobileye-and-how-elon-influenced-autopilot/">Terranet</a> are working to produce computer vision-based systems that can help e-bike riders in the consumer market ride more safely by detecting potential danger and providing collision warnings. These types of systems provide peace of mind and added safety for the average person looking to replace car trips with e-bike rides.</p>
<p>Having additional sensors on micromobility vehicles also opens up the door to monetization of data for companies, says Horace Dediu, an industry analyst who coined the term &#8220;micromobility.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see more sensing happening and that basically means dash cams, so a lot of imaging happening,&#8221; Dediu told TechCrunch. &#8220;I know this is coming into cars, but everything that happens in cars happens on micro and often happens faster because you can roll out 100 million vehicles without that much investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>By placing cameras in the front and rear of micromobility vehicles, companies can image entire cities the way dash cams do today, said Dediu. If those systems can already detect sidewalks and pedestrian lanes, they&#8217;ll surely be able to detect road surface conditions that could inform cities through a shared database on road maintenance issues. Or micromobility companies could sell that information to mapping companies like Google and allow them to image the world a little better.</p>
<p>If you think about what else micromobility vehicles can do today, like torque sensors that measure the user&#8217;s input, Dediu predicts companies might come out with all kinds of &#8220;Peloton-like services&#8221; that attach to wearables, as well.</p>
<h2>Micromobility and the metaverse</h2>
<p>&#8220;There has been billions invested by Meta or Facebook, by Microsoft and Apple, trying to figure out how to interact with someone who&#8217;s wearing something on their head,&#8221; said Dediu &#8220;At the same time, when you look at micromobility, people are just saying we need to find a way to get people to wear helmets. So I simply put those two ideas together and said, well if you&#8217;re going to wear a helmet, why not make it a smart helmet? And if you&#8217;re gonna wear a smart helmet, why not make it so exciting and interesting that you will want to do so?&#8221;</p>
<p>A helmet with a smart visor that augments reality as you sail around a city could not only make riders more aware of their surroundings and potentially safer, but it can also unlock experiences and get people outside and moving, says Dediu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Micromobility and the metaverse are made for each other,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about looking up. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/audi-spinoff-holoride-collects-e10m-in-series-a-led-by-terranet-ab/">Augmentation of a car experience</a> is nothing more than becoming more isolated looking down. So would you rather look up or look down?&#8221; <b></b></p>
<p>Caveat: This union may not happen in 2022, but Dediu is pretty sure it will happen in some way, shape or form over the next few years.</p>
<h2>New — heavier — form factors</h2>
<p>The only problem with riding a scooter or e-bike or moped to work everyday is, what happens if it rains? To solve this problem and cater to different use cases, we might start to see some new, heavier-duty, closed-roof form factors emerge in both the consumer and shared markets, according to Oliver Bruce, a strategic adviser, angel investor and co-host of the <a href="https://micromobility.io/podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Micromobility Podcast</a> with Horace Dediu.</p>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/30/arcimoto-and-lightning-motorcycles-partner-to-build-fastest-tilting-3-wheeled-electric-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arcimoto, which recently acquired Tilting Motor Works</a>, and <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/491442/nimbus-halo-best-three-worlds-electric-trike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nimbus</a> are working on some tilting three-wheeled electric vehicles that should be ready or close to going to market in 2022, says Bruce.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re serious about hitting our climate goals that we talked about at COP26, new electric vehicles are going to need to come out and scale quickly,&#8221; Bruce told TechCrunch. &#8220;If we try to ramp up electric vehicles as they currently stand, we&#8217;re just really struggling to do it. We don&#8217;t have the capacity to do it.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Micromobility integrated into the transit mix</h2>
<p>&#8220;I think 2022 will start to see the application of rides into public transport credit,&#8221; said Bruce. &#8220;So for example, you&#8217;ll hop off the subway and you&#8217;ll be able to hop onto an e-bike and it will be a cross-subsidized trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bruce says this will be in part a side effect of all the infrastructure plays we&#8217;re seeing with cities around the world, but mainly in Europe, of building in more bike lanes. But it will also be a function of micromobility companies getting the per mile cost of servicing vehicles down substantially.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economics of it start stacking up for operators to be able to sell in bulk kilometers to transport agencies, and then those transport agencies will say, cool you can do an unlock on the scooter on your metro card or via your app. Certain cities around the world will start to include this with their public transport.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Better integrations with Maps</h2>
<p>&#8220;2022, maybe the year after, is going to be the year of software,&#8221; said Dediu.</p>
<p>Today, transit planning and mapping apps like Google Maps and Moovit have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/spins-electric-scooters-and-bikes-are-now-on-google-maps/">started to integrate micromobility options</a>, offering users multiple ways to reach a destination. That type of integration should beef up to the point where Maps acts as a search engine, letting you see the top transport hits within seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we&#8217;re saying, I want to go from A to B, and you get three or four options, and no one&#8217;s bidding on my ride,&#8221; said Dediu. &#8220;I want to see 15 bidders. I want to see an auction happening every time I request a ride, the way Google search does. This is so obvious that I&#8217;m shocked that it&#8217;s almost 2022 and it doesn&#8217;t exist yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a lot of that is because the glue isn&#8217;t there. The interaction of the APIs aren&#8217;t there, so once that happens on the shared side, then we should have a nice explosion of opportunities for shared operators to bid on Google Maps, which should be making tons of money from micromobility. So the monetization of micromobility will be through discovery.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Industry veteran <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/jiten-gupta-jupiter-launch/">Jitendra Gupta’s consumer-focused neobank</a> Jupiter has raised about $86 million in a new financing round as the Bangalore-based startup gears up to offer its customers lending and wealth management services.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, QED and Sequoia Capital India co-led the two-year-old startup’s Series C round, Gupta told TechCrunch in an interview. The new round values the startup at $711 million, up from about<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/nubank-co-leads-45-million-investment-in-indian-neobank-jupiter/"> $300 million in its August Series B funding</a>.</p>
<p>MUFG Bank, Japan’s largest bank, also invested in the new round, making its debut fintech backing in the South Asian market. Existing investors 3one4 Capital and Mirae Asset also participated in the round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251573" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Launched in beta in June this year, <a href="https://jupiter.money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jupiter</a> has established itself as a market-leading “100% digital bank” in India. The startup has amassed “just short of half a million users,” said Gupta. More than 65% of this user base actively transacts on the platform each month, he said.</p>
<p>“We are more than doubling transaction volume each month. We should end this month at over $60 million worth of transactions,” said Gupta, who previously co-founded CitrusPay, a fintech startup that was acquired by PayU.</p>
<p>Scores of startups in India are attempting to improve the banking experience in India today. Whether you are a teenager, or just out of college, or a working professional, or don’t have a credit score, there are firms that can get you a credit card and loan. But most of these services have a ceiling limit of some sort.</p>
<p>The fintech veteran is taking a broader approach to win customers by adding what he says is &#8220;delight&#8221; to the banking experience. And that bet appears to be working. Jupiter, which offers its customers a banking account as well as a debit card, is adding about 5,000 users each day and its burn is less than $1 million a month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reducing the friction customers face while engaging with their banks and an additional layer of offerings have helped neobanks make inroads in several markets in recent years. The top 20 neobanks globally have about 180 million customers, analysts at Jefferies wrote in a note earlier this month. This figure &#8220;may appear small overall, but the number is growing fast,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>Gupta said the startup now has more than $145 million in its bank. It has yet to deploy any capital it raised from its previous round &#8212; which eventually ballooned to $50 million. Moreover, it has yet to tap nearly half of the $25 million fund it raised in its Series A round two years ago.</p>
<p>He said Jupiter, which employs about 300 people, is focusing on developing new services for its customers. By April, the startup plans to offer its customers a lending feature. Next year, it will also launch investment products.</p>
<p>“We have sufficient capital to use. We are confident to reach at least 2 million users by the end of next year,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to PitchBook data, faith-based, mostly Christian, apps attracted $175.3 million in venture funding this year through mid-December, more than tripling the $48.5 million they attracted from VCs last year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a far cry from the meager $6.1 million they attracted in 2016.</p>
<p>As readers might recall, we talked with one of the startups that raised a big round  &#8212; <a href="https://glorify-app.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glorify</a> &#8212; earlier this month when it landed $40 million in Series A funding led by Andreessen Horowitz. The subscription-based “well-being” app currently offers users guided meditation, along with audio bible passages and Christian music, and its co-founder and co-CEO, Ed Beccle, has big ambitions to create a broader platform that includes dating and other features.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251522" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>More recently, we talked with Alex Jones, the founder of another of the year&#8217;s buzziest faith-based apps. Called <a href="https://hallow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hallow</a>, the three-year-old, 40-person outfit raised <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/catholic-app-hallow-passes-1-123000046.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$40 million</a> in Series B funding back in November from Peter Thiel, Drive Capital and others and has raised $50 million altogether this year to &#8220;help folks to build a routine of prayer and to journey together through the content,&#8221; says Jones.</p>
<p>Beyond the fact that Hallow is exclusively focused on Catholics, while Glorify focuses on all Christians, we wondered how the two outfits &#8212; which are clearly racing to capture many of the same users &#8212; differ in their offerings and in their outlook. What we observed is that Hallow&#8217;s CEO, Alex Jones, <em>sounds</em> more &#8220;religious&#8221; than Beccle, a young serial entrepreneur who describes himself as a philosophical person who is largely focused on how tech impacts how people think and feel.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ll let you hear directly from Jones regarding how he thinks Hallow&#8217;s app differs from its rivals. Our chat, below, has been edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you see as Hallow&#8217;s place in this increasingly crowded competitive landscape?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AJ: First off, we&#8217;re big fans of anybody helping folks deepen their relationship with God and find peace, so we&#8217;re excited to see a lot of folks &#8212; Glorify, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pray-com-prayer-sleep-bible/id1161035371" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pray</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/abide-christian-meditation/id726031617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abide</a> &#8212; all these folks continue to try to help folks to grow deeper in their spirituality. As for Hallow, we are focused on the Catholic world, so all the content is 100% authentically Catholic and in line with the Catholic Church&#8217;s teaching, which is a specific theology.</p>
<p>Then on the content side, we have a ton of really phenomenal exclusive content, [including] Jonathan Roumi, the guy who plays Jesus from &#8220;The Chosen,&#8221; [who] does a lot of the meditations for us. [YouTube priest and personality] Father Mike Schmitz, [author and speaker] Bishop Robert Barron, [author] Dr. Scott Hahn, Sister Miriam and Sister Josephine create content for the app. We also have Mass readings that align with the Catholic Church&#8217;s daily Mass; we have daily rosary stuff; and we have a massive music library with a lot of really beautiful Gregorian chants and old-school traditional stuff, along with new contemporary music and peaceful Andean music and all that jazz.</p>
<p><strong>Like other apps, this is a subscription product?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think everybody has the same model, but there&#8217;s a free version of the app that has 1,000-plus meditations, and then with Hallow Plus you can unlock up to 3,500 custom meditations.</p>
<p><strong>How many daily average users do you have and what percentage of them are paying customers?</strong></p>
<p>We don&#8217;t disclose the daily active user stuff, but we just crossed 1.5 million downloads or so, around 50,000 five-star reviews and 25 million prayers completed.</p>

<p><strong>Why start this company?</strong></p>
<p>It was largely a personal journey. I was raised Catholic but fell away from my faith in high school and college. I would consider myself atheist or agnostic most of the time. Then I got pretty into secular meditation. I was fascinated by it, and Headspace had just launched [as well as] Calm and I loved the products and thought they were an awesome way to learn the technique of meditation from the comfort of your own home. But every time I would meditate, my mind would feel pulled toward something spiritual, something Christian. So I started talking to priests, brothers, sisters, pastors, anybody I could talk to, asking the question, &#8220;Hey, is there any intersection here between this meditation thing and this faith thing?&#8221; And they all laughed at me and said, &#8220;Yeah, we&#8217;ve been doing it for 2,000 years. It&#8217;s called prayer.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Are you a first-time founder?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I was an engineer in undergrad, so I&#8217;d known a little bit of how to code. Then I went to McKinsey [and worked in] strategy consulting for a couple years, then I went to [the Stanford Graduate School of Business], so I had some exposure to entrepreneurship. When we started talking about this idea, I learned how to code in Swift for iOS in a couple weeks [with the help of] a free Stanford course, so I was able to pick that up quickly enough, but I am a terrible engineer [and we&#8217;ve thrown away] the code that I&#8217;ve written [since]. I&#8217;m by no means a legit developer.</p>
<p><strong>Glorify plans to add a lot of features that turn it more into a social network centered around micro interactions. Is that also on Hallow&#8217;s road map?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of opportunity to help folks bring God into as many aspects of their life as possible. I know folks have thrown out the dating stuff or [generating revenue through] tithing stuff. For us, we&#8217;re just really maniacally focused on trying to help folks grow deeper in their spiritual lives and to find peace with God, so the categories we&#8217;re focused on right now are really the categories [we already feature], including music, sleep, Bible, prayer and meditation. We think we&#8217;ve really just scratched the surface with all of these. Just 5% to 10% of the Catholics in the world are in the U.S.; the vast majority are international; we&#8217;re just now launching our Spanish content. We&#8217;re also very focused on school and parish partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Has anyone from Facebook reached out you? The company is reportedly also very focused on trying to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/us/facebook-church.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keep Christians on its platform</a>, including by forming partnerships with faith-based groups.</strong></p>
<p>Facebook has been really helpful for us in terms of reaching out to folks and spreading the word about Hallow, especially during the pandemic. Facebook has also been incredibly helpful in helping us figure out how to advertise to folks and what messaging works. They have a core partner program thing that we&#8217;ve been able to be a part of.</p>
<p>Still, the majority of our growth is from just folks talking about the app and sharing it with folks. Also, our big pitch is that your phone is usually a place of stress and anxiety, where you have to figure out how many likes you got or who commented on your thing or what your aunt said about whatever political hot button issue. Our goal is to try to build a place of peace away from that.</p>
<p><strong>Who do you consider your biggest competition? The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bible/id282935706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bible app</a> is the giant in the space, I know.</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a tough one because, in all honesty, if folks are ending up in heaven, we don&#8217;t really care how they get there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new &#8220;Matrix&#8221; film released this holiday season is a bit of a disaster, but while it falls down on action, characters, pacing, visuals and most other measures, it succeeds on a surprising one: having something cogent to say about our relationship with technology.</p>
<p>(&#8220;The Matrix: Resurrection&#8221; spoilers ahead, but really … it kind of came out spoiled.)</p>
<p>The original &#8220;Matrix&#8221;<em>&#8216;s</em> premise that the world we live in is not real was not quite original, but its deep sci-fi spin on it — a &#8220;Terminator&#8221;-esque robocalypse using a simulation to pacify the masses — was compelling and well executed. At the time, people had not yet developed the healthy fear of tech we now see daily: smartphones didn&#8217;t exist (and therefore neither could our unhealthy reliance on them), robots were rudimentary, AI was still sci-fi, and social media meant ICQ and chat rooms. Oh, blessed ignorance!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251511" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This meant that the fears and threats were only superficially technological: It happened to be machines that had yoked the human race into being living batteries, but ultimately the paranoia concerned an illuminati hiding the truth of the world from you, an idea that goes back centuries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Resurrections&#8221; is different. In the two decades since &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; came out, smartphones, AI and social media (among other things) have emerged not merely as influential technologies but the defining characteristics of this era, both in terms of what they enable and new terrors they inflict.</p>
<p>The fundamental threat described by &#8220;Resurrections&#8221; is not one of total deception but of targeted disinformation — perhaps the clearest and most present danger of our time. The solution proposed is not to simply pierce the veil, which as shown by the previous movies is only a partial one, but to live genuinely and humanely, in harmony and dialogue with others.</p>
<p>The situations we find the main characters — such as they are — in at the beginning of the movie represent different traps that we can fall into. The initially compelling and meta recasting of the original trilogy as a series of games is the half-truth more convincing than a lie; Neo, acclaimed but stalled professionally and creatively, is in therapy to treat his unhealthy perception of the games as reality. Trinity has had a comfortable routine as the path of least resistance. And (new) Morpheus lives in an inescapable echo chamber.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251572" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/neo-bath.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251572" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2251572" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/neo-bath.jpg" alt="A still from The Matrix Resurrections, Neo sitting in the bath thinking." width="1024" height="463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/neo-bath.jpg 1806w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/neo-bath.jpg?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/neo-bath.jpg?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/neo-bath.jpg?resize=768,347 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/neo-bath.jpg?resize=680,307 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/neo-bath.jpg?resize=1536,694 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/neo-bath.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2251572" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Warner Bros Pictures</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard at all to connect these ideas with the direst threats inherent to social media: self-delusion, doomscrolling and radicalization. The machines are machines of influence, making their ideas seem like one&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not so much any more that &#8220;this is not the real world,&#8221; though it isn&#8217;t, but rather that &#8220;my thoughts are not my real thoughts.&#8221; Well, if not yours, then whose? Answer <em>that</em> question, and you find your oppressor.</p>
<p>Elsewhere we find failed approaches to thinking for oneself. Outside in the real world humanity has stalled. The revolutionary original Morpheus is gone and the new leadership hobbled by risk aversion in the face of apocalyptic threat. Here one sees echoes of ineffectual government, unable to take the bold action required to move forward.</p>
<p>In the warehouse we have — however clumsily rendered — a sort of neophobic (pun intended, and purposeful) Boomer mentality of total rejection in the wild man Merv: &#8220;We had grace, we had style, we had conversation, not this … beep-beep-beep-beep! Art, films, books were all better! Originality mattered!&#8221; He wants to return to a bygone era of perceived greatness: a whiny, befouled barbarian blaming tech for his own inability to adapt.</p>
<p>And last there is the presence of a civil war among the machines: shades of tech, unsustainable but unable to stop, beginning to eat itself.</p>
<p>What &#8220;Resurrections&#8221; puts forth as a way forward is in some ways a hackneyed &#8220;let&#8217;s all work together!&#8221; But the subtext enriches it with a purposeful message: The common enemy is technological in nature, but not technology itself. And escape is an illusion if you are trapped in the prison of your own mind.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s important in the film is the rejection of the programming we&#8217;ve adopted as our own, whether it has been maliciously and deliberately engineered by a high-tech adversary or arrived at more naturally through a lack of self-reflection.</p>
<p>Coexistence is the path we should take, and to accomplish that we must question our own preconceptions about the other. That humans and the hated machines even can work together is shocking to Neo. Let us not read too far into this on the politics side — I don&#8217;t think this is an allegory for bipartisanship — but rather consider the new terminology introduced. They&#8217;re not robots but &#8220;synthients&#8221; — a pleasing portmanteau, offered in a gentle correction that mirrors the issue of pronouns and labels. Gender is a spectrum — why not consciousness?</p>
<p>In &#8220;Resurrections,&#8221; it is coexistence with the other that is the only realistic path, both in the &#8220;real world&#8221; where robots and humans must share the planet, and in the Matrix, where even AIs chafe under the overbearing management of their roles and agency.</p>
<p>Ultimately, after the requisite <em>amor vincit omnia</em> moment and subsequent overblown action scenes, the final showdown is one of perspectives. The &#8220;Analyst,&#8221; who has given humanity the rope with which it has bound itself, says that people are happier that way. Neo and Trinity propose that the technological treadmill on which people purportedly choose to walk only works because the system has been designed to prevent real connections and real joy.</p>
<p>Far from the solipsistic barbarians or the comfortably passive leadership, &#8220;Resurrections&#8221; endorses an inclusive and collaborative world where people are free to learn and grow — because the tools and entities that kept them ignorant and divided are the same that provide illumination and connection.</p>
<p>As an action flick, Lana Wachowski&#8217;s film barely holds together — it&#8217;s a mess (I watched &#8220;Commando&#8221; as a palette cleanser). But beyond its dubious execution, the mess it depicts is the message. We can see ourselves and our modern dilemma painted with unsettling accuracy in the movie, and the director&#8217;s belief that we are capable of more if we question not the world but our own self-imposed limitations is the &#8220;red pill&#8221; she suggests we take.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigmcluckie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Craig McLuckie</a>, the co-founder of the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes</a> project during his time at Google and now the VP of R&amp;D at VMware (after selling his startup Heptio to the company), was named the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Cloud Foundry Foundation.</p>
<p>He succeeds VMware&#8217;s Paul Fazzone, who was named chairman in April 2020. Since 2020, though, the Cloud Foundry Foundation went through an additional leadership change, with executive director Chip Childers leaving his post in August and not backfilling the executive director position. Instead, the foundation decided to put more emphasis on its newly formed technical oversight committee and board of directors, which means McLuckie is the closest to the earlier executive director role the foundation currently has.</p>
<p>Now, even though he was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/21/as-kubernetes-hits-1-0-google-donates-technology-to-newly-formed-cloud-native-computing-foundation-with-ibm-intel-twitter-and-others/">instrumental</a> in launching the CNCF and donating Kubernetes to it, McLuckie hadn&#8217;t been all that active in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem. Both foundations fall under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, though, so there&#8217;s some immediate overlap there. In addition, since Cloud Foundry&#8217;s story in recent years was quite closely linked with its move to Kubernetes as part of its core infrastructure &#8212; and the idea of <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buildpacks</a> that originated from the Cloud Foundry ecosystem started to <a href="https://buildpacks.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">influence the Kubernetes ecosystem</a> &#8212; there was always a lot of interplay between the different communities. Add to that VMware&#8217;s acquisition of Pivotal and you have a lot of links between the different groups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250914" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As McLuckie told me, about six months ago, he started thinking more about the role he could play in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem and the gears were set in motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;As VMware acquired Pivotal, I saw an opportunity to really look at what had been built in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem, which in some ways was really an anchor technology for the ideation of a lot of cloud-native patterns,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was a technology that predated Kubernetes, it had a very specific opinion about how to deal with application construction, orchestration and delivery. And it&#8217;s been a fascinating opportunity through the acquisition of Pivotal to get closer to a community, which in many ways started a lot of the cloud-native patents, which really, really embraced the idea of sort of container-packaged delivery, which created an abstraction that enabled developers to go from their IDE to a production environment in a very controlled way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The journey now, he said, is about bringing these two technologies together: To look at what made Cloud Foundry&#8217;s developer experience successful and to look at what Kubernetes can offer as an abstraction on infrastructure. It&#8217;s maybe no surprise, then, that one of the first new projects to come out of the foundation now will be a beta of a new Cloud Foundry experience on Kubernetes in the first quarter of 2022. Some vendors previously had their own take on this, but with this new project, a number of organizations like VMware, SAP and IBM came together to converge on a path forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, not all developers are invested in spending their evenings on Hacker News and playing with all sort of technologies,&#8221; McLuckie said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of folks that just want to go home, and drink a beer and watch YouTube. Cloud Foundry creates a lot of very simple, accessible experiences and offloads a lot of the operating headaches associated with running applications in production. Now we&#8217;re offering up an opportunity to really enable them to preserve that experience but deliver an abstraction which is emerging as that standard for multi-cloud destinations.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s maybe even more important than these individual projects is that the organization is going through a more radical transformation, one that started about a year ago, from a more vendor-driven group to one that makes it easier for individual developers to contribute to the ecosystem without having to go through all of the ritual and ceremony that was previously necessary before becoming an open source committer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen Cloud Foundry go from a foundation which was really primarily driving the commercial interests of organizations that were building sort of specific products around the Cloud Foundry technology base. And as with any foundation, there&#8217;s always going to be a sort of tensions between vendors,&#8221; he explained. But going forward, the Foundation is looking to focus on three things: support the contributor community, whether they work for a vendor or not; provide better support for end-users who consume the open source version of Cloud Foundry; and work with the ecosystem to help vendors work together and collaborate on the ideation and evolution of many of the cloud-native technologies (like buildpacks) that came out of the Cloud Foundry ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really does represent a new kind of epoch of looking at the evolution of this technology and just authentically looking to take care of both the organizations that are consuming it and the committers that are contributing to it in an open and fair way,&#8221; said McLuckie.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When we penned the intro for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/remember-the-startups-we-lost-in-2020/">this piece last year</a>, little did we know that &#8212; in many ways &#8212; we’d still be deep in it by the time 2021’s feature rolled around. Amid another holiday season marred by a new variant, seemingly the more things change &#8212; well, you get the picture.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, however, in spite of the fact that we’re still very much in the throes of a global pandemic, 2021 hasn’t been punctuated by as many high-profile losses in the startup world as the year prior.</p>
<p>Perhaps the first year of the pandemic was simply the final straw for so many companies that were already treading water &#8212; or maybe an influx of capital sources has kept heads above water. Some companies successfully pivoted and others were born as a direct result of a world forever changed because of COVID-19.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2249902" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>2021 also largely lacked the kind of blockbuster crashes we saw last year, courtesy of names like Quibi and Essential. But even in a non-pandemic year, keeping a startup afloat is still an enormously difficult task, and not everyone managed to make it to the New Year unscathed.</p>
<h3><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/actuator-7/"><strong>Abundant Robotics (2016-2021)</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>Total raised:</strong> $12 million</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1802082" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1802082" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1802082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Abundant-Robotics-at-TG-Global-03-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1802082" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abundant</p></div></p>
<p>This is a major sputtering in what has been an otherwise remarkable year for robotic startups. In a certain sense, Abundant was ahead of the curve on agtech robotics, which can often be more curse than blessing. Barely two years after rolling out its first commercial deployments, the apple-picking robotics firm quietly closed up shop. Over the years, the company managed to raise $12 million, including a $10 million Series A led by GV (Google Ventures) back in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Farmers are taking a long, hard look at robotics and automation to help ease the strain of continued labor shortages. Companies like John Deere are investing a lot in homegrown solutions and acquisitions. It seems very much within the realm of possibility that we’ll see more widescale picking robots deployed sooner than later, but the main question at the moment is from whom?</p>
<p>In October, it was reported that Waverly Labs had acquired Abundant’s IP, meaning that its technology may still live on in some form.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2018, TechCrunch reported that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FedEx was working with a relatively new and unknown startup called Chanje Energy as it ramped up its efforts to electrify its fleet of delivery vans. The company announced plans to add 1,000 electric delivery vehicles from Chanje, a California-based and China-backed startup founded in 2015. In subsequent years, Chanje came to be known for its practice of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importing electric delivery vans from China and selling them to companies like FedEx, Ryder and even Amazon. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FedEx and other customers were left in the lurch when the electric vehicle company reportedly “quietly folded” sometime this year, </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822775/chanje-fdg-electric-delivery-vans-investigation-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Verge reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on December 15. CEO Bryan Hansel (described by some employees as both “charismatic” and “narcissistic) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had partnered with a Chinese company that went bankrupt. Hansel reportedly worked hard to convince investors to buy pieces of that company so that Chanje could keep operating, but to no avail. According to The Verge, he fired the last of Chanje’s employees the Friday before Memorial Day weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chanje reportedly still owes “many” of its former employees months of back pay and promised bonuses, with at least four having filed suit against the startup. Ryder also </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22337230/ryder-chanje-lawsuit-fedex-electric-vans-startup-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued the company for more than $3 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Chanje did not deliver most of the vans it promised to the fleet company. Meanwhile, FedEx never got the 1,000 electric vans it expected from Chanje from that 2018 deal. This led to the delivery giant being forced to abandon a project to build out charging infrastructure at FedEx depots across California. While FedEx is also suing the company in an effort to get back some of the millions of dollars it had spent on that charging infrastructure, its prospects are bleak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2020, Apple acquired the Dark Sky weather app, which was popular for its hyperlocal focus. Clearly the tech giant was interested in its features, many of which it incorporated into the iPhone weather app. From the get go, Apple had made clear that the Android app would shutter that July. The fate of the iOS app and API service, however, remained fuzzy. (The API service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowed other developers to tap Dark Sky’s database of “weather forecasts and historical weather data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By June of 2021, the iOS app and API service </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/dark-sky-ios-app-and-website-are-likely-shutting-down-at-the-end-of-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially had expiration dates</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> with co-founder Adam Grossman writing: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support for the Dark Sky API service for existing customers will continue until the end of 2022. The iOS app and Dark Sky website will also be available until the end of 2022.” While this was not an explicit shutdown announcement, it was certainly implied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a time that Katerra was considered the darling of the construction tech world. Some argued it made prefab construction more mainstream &#8212; and cool. As it grew, Katerra ambitiously wanted to own the tech stack around a construction project, whether it be office buildings or apartments. But by the end of 2020, signs of serious problems emerged. The startup was said to be on the verge of filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy when Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank swooped in with a $200 million bailout. But it was too little, too late. Katerra’s vertically integrated approach couldn’t keep up with rising labor and construction costs and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company was struggling with delays and cost overruns on some projects, while the COVID-19 pandemic delayed others. Irregularities that the company discovered in accounting practices also added to headaches, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-agrees-to-200-million-bailout-of-katerra-11609366612?mod=hp_lista_pos3">The Wall Street Journal</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it was not a huge shock when on June 1, 2021, Kattera was reported to be </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/softbank-backed-construction-giant-katerra-said-to-be-shutting-down-after-raising-billions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially shutting down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (The Information broke the news) after burning through more than $2 billion in funding. Founded in 2015, Katerra had at one point been valued at $4 billion and employed more than 8,000 people. When it shuttered, it was believed to have had around 2,400 employees. The failure marked the second high-profile SoftBank-backed proptech with very public struggles in recent years (WeWork was the first). While there were concerns that Katerra’s implosion might affect faith in the construction tech industry as a whole, the year still saw a number of large fundings in the space.</span></p>

<p>Alphabet’s Loon flew high over the course of its nine-year run, only to come crashing back down to earth earlier this year. Two-plus years after spinning off the X graduate, the company grounded the project aimed at bringing internet connectivity to underserved areas via balloon. Loon CEO Alastair Westgarth noted in a blog post that the project simply wasn’t able to achieve profitability.</p>
<p>“While we’ve found a number of willing partners along the way, we haven’t found a way to get the costs low enough to build a long-term, sustainable business,” he wrote. “Developing radical new technology is inherently risky, but that doesn’t make breaking this news any easier.”</p>
<p>Loon said its technologies would continue to live on, having already been adopted by outfits like Project Taara, another Alphabet X moonshot aimed at delivering high-speed internet through light transmission. In September, Alphabet<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/alphabet-gives-some-loon-patents-to-softbank-open-sources-flight-data-and-makes-patent-non-assertion-pledge/"> passed an additional 200 patents along to SoftBank</a>, which plans to execute on them as part of its High Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) business. Fellow high-flying moonshot Wing, on the other hand, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/walgreens-will-deploy-wing-drone-deliveries-in-the-dallas-fort-worth-area/">continues to gain steam</a>.</p>

In the early innings of the pandemic, the social video chat app claimed that it was landing 50 million new signups a month, as humans sought virtual connection amid quarantine. Fast-forward to today, and it seems that Houseparty’s pandemic bump didn’t help the company stay relevant. In September, Epic Games announced that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/epic-games-to-shut-down-houseparty-in-october-including-the-video-chat-fortnite-mode-feature/"> it was shutting down Houseparty</a> in October, a little over two years since it first acquired the company<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/epic-games-paid-35-million-for-houseparty-in-2019-2020-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> for a reported $35 million.</a></p>
<p>There are a variety of potential reasons as to why the once-booming app was shut down, from the rise of Clubhouse to the inevitable fatigue from Zoom. In a thread announcing the shutdown, Houseparty CEO and co-founder Sima Sistani hinted it was simply a strategy shift.</p>
<p>&#8220;The metaverse vision and products we’re working on at [EpicGames] are also about shared experiences, but in a more rich form than 2D video &#8212; one that&#8217;s better positioned to shape the next generation of the internet,&#8221; Sistani wrote.</p>

<p>Pearl Automation, an automotive accessory startup, shuttered just a year after launching out of stealth mode. Founded by former Apple engineers, Pearl debuted with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/27/pearls-rearvision-is-a-backup-camera-for-those-who-want-the-best-rear-view/">wireless rear-view camera</a> and already began shipping out its products, which cost $499.99.</p>
<p>“Once connected, the RearVision app in landscape will show you a full-screen view of what the cameras in the license plate holder is seeing, with a 175-degree viewing angle,” reporter Darrell Etherington wrote in a 2016 review of the product. “You can toggle between the full fish-eye experience, or a warp-corrected view that fills the display corner-to-corner with the space behind your car. You can also pivot the view up or down to get a better look at more of the sky, or more of the ground as needed.”</p>
<p>While Etherington liked the industrial design and minimal software of the product, he noted that it is a premium device which needed upgrades: “It’s still for a specific subset of users &#8212; those who value quality and craftsmanship and are willing to pay for it, but who also don’t have a modern vehicle with its own backup camera, and don’t plan on getting one anytime soon.” This year, it seems like that subset wasn’t enough to keep the company going.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.axios.com/exclusive-auto-startup-pearl-shuts-down-1513303229-afdd0410-4602-4326-8e25-70db89962651.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a>, the shutdown was a result of disappointing product sales and a high burn rate, despite the fact that Pearl Automation had raised $50 million in venture capital funding. Investors included Accel, Venrock, Shasta Ventures and Wellcome Trust, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pearl-7/company_financials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase.</a></p>

U.S. electronics store chain Fry&#8217;s Electronics is permanently closing all of its stores, the company announced Wednesday. The company said in a statement on its website that it &#8220;made the difficult decision to shut down its operations and close its business permanently&#8221; because of changing consumer shopping habits and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

<p>Mea culpa. This one’s not a startup, but it would still feel weird to do a list without it. The Februrary closure of the Bay Area-based electronics chain left a massive Egyptian (or, perhaps, Mayan) pyramid-shaped hole in the hearts of many who grew up wandering its aisles. For me, it was the Fremont store, whose 1893 World’s Fair theme didn’t make for a particularly exciting exterior, but the indoor Tesla coil did the trick.</p>
<p>In an Amazon-ruled world devoid of Circuit Cities, where RadioShack is a shadow of its former self, it’s frankly amazing that this strange, beautiful beast held on for as long as it could. At its peak, Fry’s boasted 34 giant stores across nine states. But ultimately, COVID-19 was the final nail in the already troubling environment of brick and mortars. It&#8217;s a testament to just how big these big box stores were that their former homes are dealing with zoning headaches in their wake.</p>

<p>Unlike other pandemic-fueled losses over these past two years, the death of LG’s mobile division was a long time coming. The South Korean electronics giant simply couldn’t keep up in a market dominated by Samsung, Apple and, increasingly, manufacturers in China. In April, LG announced its exit from phones in order to spend more time with TVs and other smart home products.</p>
<h3><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/fantasy-startup-investing-nft-platform-visionrare-shuts-down-paid-marketplace-after-a-day-in-open-beta/">Visionrare (2021-2021?)</a></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2124290" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124290" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2124290" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nft-flaming-car1.jpg" alt="NFT car on fire" width="1024" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124290" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>And so rare its vision truly was. When founders Jacob Claerhout and Boris Gordts launched Visionrare, they combined two trends: the gamification of investing and the surging interest around NFTs. The end result was a platform in which users could bid for NFT shares of different startups, stacking up a fake portfolio that they could then compete against others with. It even got some Y Combinator startups on board.</p>
<p>Crypto angle aside, Visionrare’s pitch was interesting. The fake stock market could get non-accredited investors a track record in betting on startups, and one day<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/fantasy-equity-nft-game-wants-you-to-spend-real-money-buying-fake-shares-of-real-startups/"> “serve as a signal for VCs looking for their next hires.”</a></p>
<p>If you think it sounds buzzy, some entrepreneurs and investors had a different word: illegal. Some questioned whether the platform was legal or if it was an investment security, pushback that ended up causing the co-founders to shut down the paid marketplace due to underestimating “the legal complexities” with selling novelty NFT shares in real startups.</p>
<p>Crypto marketplaces aren’t controversial, but Visionrare’s approach to the burgeoning sector rang alarm bells. And that doesn’t happen as often as you’d think. Nonetheless, the founders promised to relaunch the company soon. Their LinkedIn’s show that they<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bgordts?originalSubdomain=be" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> are continuing to work together,</a> and are “building<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-claerhout/?originalSubdomain=fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> something new.”</a></p>
<h3><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">Nuzzel (2012-2021)</a></h3>
<p>Nearly a decade ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/13/jonathan-abrams-nuzzel-launch/">Friendster’s Jonathan Abrams launched Nuzzel</a>, a social news reading service that highlights headlines that are being read and shared by friends in your network. The simple yet savvy startup soon attracted a loyal user base, especially for Twitter users who wanted a more personalized timeline. According to Crunchbase, Nuzzel had raised $5.1 million from investors, including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.</p>
<p>In 2019,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/scroll-acquires-nuzzel/"> Nuzzel was acquired by Scroll</a>, which wanted to bring aggregation and curation to its subscription service. While no one from Nuzzel’s original team joined Scroll in a full-time capacity, the app continued to function as is &#8212; until this year, of course.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/"> Twitter scooped up Scroll in May</a> and simultaneously shut down Nuzzel. In a blog post that has since been removed, Nuzzel’s team explained that the product needed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">be rebuilt in order to scale with Twitter.</a></p>
<p>“To those of you who love Nuzzel and are disappointed that we can’t maintain Nuzzel as-is in the interim, I’m as disappointed as you,” Scroll CEO Tony Haile <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/05/eyeing-a-future-subscription-service-twitter-acquires-the-ad-free-news-startup-scroll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in the now-deleted post.</a> “We explored any number of Hail Marys to make that happen and just couldn’t get there. Looking to the future, Nuzzel’s functionality has always felt like it should be a part of Twitter and I’m excited to help make it so.”</p>
<p>Months later, some good news: While Nuzzel as we know it has ceased to exist, Twitter brought back one of the app&#8217;s most-loved features, Top Stories, in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">debut of its premium subscription service Twitter Blue. </a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[There was a lot of action in 2021 in enterprise M&#038;A — once totaled, my top 10 deals came in at just under $121 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There was a lot of action in 2021 in enterprise M&amp;A — once totaled, my top 10 deals came in at just under $121 billion. And the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/">biggest enterprise deal</a> of the year by far — Oracle&#8217;s bid to buy Cerner — happened as I was writing this post.</p>
<p>The final tally doesn&#8217;t include what would have been the third largest deal when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/18/zoom-buys-cloud-call-center-firm-five9-for-14-7-billion/">Zoom agreed to buy Five9</a> last summer for $14.7 billion. That deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/and-thats-that-as-the-zoom-deal-to-buy-five9-is-called-off/">eventually broke down</a>, as Zoom&#8217;s pandemic stock price bubble burst, and the companies ultimately decided to go their separate ways.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the second-biggest deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">Microsoft&#8217;s bid to buy Nuance Communications</a> is stuck <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/cma-microsoft-nuance/">in regulatory limbo</a> in the U.K., as regulators worry that it could give Microsoft too much power in the healthcare market. The U.K. decision bears watching, given that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">Visa&#8217;s $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid</a> was scuttled last year when U.S. authorities sued to block the deal and the parties eventually decided to walk away.</p>
<p>You may recall that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/the-top-10-enterprise-ma-deals-in-2020-totaled-a-staggering-165b/">last year&#8217;s total</a> was an incredible $165 billion, but that was fueled by four large-chip consolidation deals totaling over $100 billion. This year&#8217;s deals are far more diverse, with more than 20 deals over $1 billion, and many that didn&#8217;t make this list. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/these-ten-enterprise-ma-deals-totaled-over-40b-in-2019/">In 2019</a>, the bottom three were under $2 billion — this year, the smallest deal was $5.4 billion.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that four or the 10 deals involved private equity firms, who continue to be highly active in the M&amp;A market. There was a big focus on legacy security companies this year.</p>
<p>As in previous years, I needed to decide which deals belonged on my list and which didn&#8217;t, and that&#8217;s never easy to do. I didn&#8217;t include a number of large deals, including the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">$29 billion Square-Afterpay merger</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/investor-consortium-to-acquire-mcafee-for-14-billion/">the $14 billion McAfee deal</a>, as they both involved consumer-focused businesses.</p>
<p>I also excluded a couple of other big companies that fall outside my coverage area. These included the <a href="https://www.globallogic.com/about/news/hitachi-to-acquire-globallogic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hitachi-Global Logic</a> deal for $9.6 billion, and the <a href="https://media.blueyonder.com/panasonic-accelerates-the-autonomous-supply-chain-with-acquisition-of-blue-yonder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panasonic-Blue Yonder deal</a> for $7.1 billion. Two other big deals just missed making the list: the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cloudera-to-go-private-as-kkr-cdr-grab-it-for-5-3b/">$5.3 billion KKR-Cloudera acquisition</a> and the <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3603432/cisco-coughs-up-another-19b-to-buy-acacia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cisco-Acacia $4.5 billion deal.</a></p>
<p>So here are my top 10 deals in ascending order:</p>
<h2>10. Clearlake-Quest Software $5.4B</h2>
<p>In the first of a string of private equity companies buying older security companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/francisco-partners-flips-quest-software-to-clearlake-capital-in-deal-reportedly-worth-5-4b/">Clearlake bought Quest Software</a> for a reported $5.4 billion from another private equity firm, Francisco Partners. Quest, whose products include One Identity and OneLogin, has been shuffled around over the years, but it still has a decent business, and Francisco was able to turn a tidy profit on its 2016 $2 billion investment.</p>
<h2>9. Permira-Mimecast $5.8B</h2>
<p>Speaking of private equity, Permira took a plunge into email security with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/permira-plans-to-take-e-mail-security-firm-mimecast-private-in-a-5-8b-all-cash-deal/">acquisition of London-based Mimecast</a> earlier this month for $5.8 billion. Permira liked that Mimecast had a large existing market with almost 40,000 customers, half of who use Microsoft Office 365 products.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">My first in-person experience with a fitness ring was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/03/motiv-ring/">back at CES 2017</a>. Four years later, one wonders if they might be having a moment at next week’s show &#8212; in-person or no. The Motiv ring demonstrated the potential for moving fitness band functionality onto a ring, but ultimately fell short. More recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/oura-ring-3-review/">, Oura has found more success</a> demonstrating what these products can actually do.</p>
<p>I anticipate seeing more startups explore the burgeoning form factor in 2022, and CES is positioned to be the tip of that spear. <a href="https://movano.com/">Movano</a>, an East Bay-based medical device company, announced the upcoming arrival of its own Ring device. Aimed at women, the product is designed to monitor heart rate, sleep, steps, calories, blood oxygen and breathing &#8212; standard fitness tracking stuff.</p>
<p>The product looks to differentiate itself as a more serious healthcare product, offering up actionable insights to wearers &#8212; also something that’s increasingly becoming a target as wearable makers look beyond simple step counts. Oura, for instance, has participated in various studies in an effort to get to something deeper with all of the data it tracks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251493" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Also, like, Oura, the company has made its app the centerpiece of that information &#8212; understandable, for a device that returns to the days of screenless fitness trackers. Says John Mastrototaro, the company’s CEO, in a release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Movano was founded on the core belief that good health is a fundamental human right, but good health requires more than a few static metrics from an annual physical. We’ve set out on a mission to put your health in your hands with affordable and non-intimidating devices. Our app notes your body’s signals and transforms them into insight.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the release notes, Movano is still in that rough fitness device limbo of seeking FDA clearance, specifically for things like blood oxygen and heart rate. It’s a tough hurdle for relatively young companies, but an important one in the quest toward being taken more seriously as a healthcare product.</p>
<p>Such things can ultimately have an impact on release dates &#8212; or, depending on how the company plays it, the launch feature set. At present, the product is set to arrive at some point in the second half of next year, as a beta release. It&#8217;s the first &#8212; but almost certainly not the last &#8212; fitness ring you can expect to see getting some play next week at CES.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Quantum computers, sensors and communications networks have the potential to bring about enormous societal and market opportunities — along with an equal amount of disruption. Unfortunately for most of us it takes a Ph.D. in physics to truly understand how quantum technologies work, and luminaries in the field of physics will be the first to admit that even their understanding of quantum mechanics remains incomplete.</p>
<p>Fortunately you don&#8217;t need an advanced degree in physics to grasp the magnitude of potential change: computers that can help us design new materials that fight the climate crisis, more accurate sensors without a reliance on GPS that enable truly autonomous vehicles and more secure communications networks are just a few of the many technologies that may emerge from quantum technology.<br />

<p>The challenge of the quantum industry isn’t ambition; it’s scale. Physicists know how to design useful quantum devices. The challenge is building larger devices that scale along with innovative business models. The confluence of talented physicists, engineers and business leaders tackling the problem is reason for much confidence. More private investors are placing bets on the technology. They can’t afford not to — we may look back on the commercialization of quantum and compare it to the steam engine, electricity, and the internet — all of which represented fundamental platform shifts in how society tackled problems and created value.</p>
<p>More difficult than quantum physics, however, is getting the U.S. government’s regulatory and funding strategy right toward the technology. Aligning various government entities to push forward an industry while navigating landmines of regulation, Byzantine government contracting processes and the geopolitical realities of both the threats and disruptions that quantum technology portends will be a challenge much greater than building a million-qubit quantum computer.</p>
<p>While this claim may be slight hyperbole, I’ve now worked in both worlds and seen it up close and personal. As a former CIA case officer, even at the “tip of the spear,” I’ve seen how slowly the government moves if left to its own devices. However, I’ve also seen the value it can bring if the right influencers in the right positions decide to make hard decisions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The government can help pave the pathway for commercialization or cut the industry off at its knees before it has a chance to run. The U.S. government needs a quantum commercialization strategy in addition to its quantum R&amp;D strategy. We need to get out of the lab and into the world. To push the industry forward, the government should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Push more funding to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). We can thank DARPA for the internet and GPS. I imagine we will one day thank DARPA, and some parts of the Department of Energy, for quantum. With increased funding, DARPA should consider allocating larger amounts per company focused on longer-term research in quantum error correction and quantum navigation.</li>
<li>Ask the National Science Foundation (NSF) to buy 20 different universities different types of quantum computers for use by researchers and students. The NSF should provide grants to physics departments at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and at economically disadvantaged schools in the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program to increase diversity in the quantum technology industry.</li>
<li>Create a large, well-funded program within the Department of Defense for quantum sensors that goes beyond small-scale research. For example, the Pentagon could fund a $200 million dollar program to field a quantum positioning system (QPS) that is rugged, compact, more accurate and more secure than current GPS systems.<br />
Like ambitious defense programs for new fighter jets and nuclear modernization, deep tech companies cannot cross the “valley of death” on one $800,000 contract at a time. They need significant long-term commitments, especially in such a hardware-intensive field like quantum technology. Otherwise, we’ll condemn physicists and engineers to spending their time writing proposals to compete for future projects in order to keep the lights on.<br />
The government should also provide exponentially more funding to the Pentagon’s National Security Innovation Capital (NSIC) program. NSIC’s role is to help hardware-focused companies cross the valley of death with non-dilutive investments. If the government is really serious about this, then these investments need to be at the level of at least $5 million and above.<br />
The money going into this hardware commercialization will inevitably lead to devices used by the average person and other discoveries. The same quantum positioning systems that power submarine navigation can also power commercial autonomous vehicles and sensors for smart and more environmentally-friendly cities. Smartphones, the internet and MRI machines are examples of unintended discoveries. The U.S. taxpayer will recoup their money in long-term value creation even when some companies inevitably fail or miss their intended targets.</li>
<li>Despite the government’s important role, it needs to know where to stay out of the way. The government shouldn’t create additional regulation through export controls until U.S. companies have built a globally dominant quantum capability. I understand the national security threats we face in emerging technologies and the U.S. government’s desire to stop rampant IP theft, anti-competitive practices and the use of these technologies for authoritarian ends and power projection purposes. But a key element to our national and economic security has been our openness. Regulation at this early stage will only stymie our ability to build global quantum companies and be a greater threat.</li>
</ol>
<p>The U.S. government must inject more money more quickly into the commercial sector for these emerging technologies. This new technological era demands that we compete at a pace and scale that the government budgeting process currently is not built to handle. Smaller companies can move fast and we are in an era where speed, not efficiency, matters most in the beginning because we have to scale up before our geopolitical competition, which is directly pouring tens of billions of dollars into the sector.</p>
<p>When I was at the CIA, I often heard the words “Acta non verba” or “deeds not words.” In this case, the deeds are putting money on the table in the right ways, as well as not regulating the industry too early. Not everyone in senior U.S. government positions has to believe in quantum’s potential. I wouldn’t blame them if they have some doubts — this is truly beyond rocket science. But the smart move is to hedge. The U.S. government should make such a bet by pushing a commercialization strategy now. At the least it shouldn’t stand in the way of it.</p>
