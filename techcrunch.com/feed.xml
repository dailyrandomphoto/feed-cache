										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies continue to delay their returns to the office and find temporary remote work policies becoming permanent, the startups building tooling for remote work-first cultures are finding a seemingly endless supply of customers.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Companies are finding the shift to remote work is not a one-time aberration due to Covid,&#8221; <a href="https://almanac.io/">Almanac</a> CEO Adam Nathan tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Over the past several months we’ve seen pretty explosive revenue growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almanac, which builds a doc editor that takes feature cues like version control from developer platforms like Github, has been seizing on the shift to remote work, onboarding new customers through its open source office document library Core while pushing features that allow for easier onboarding like an online company handbook builder.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LW8jEH4gHw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/almanac-is-building-a-faster-doc-editor-for-the-remote-work-era/">Almanac is building a faster doc editor for the remote work era</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Almanac is building a faster doc editor for the remote work era&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/almanac-is-building-a-faster-doc-editor-for-the-remote-work-era/embed/#?secret=LW8jEH4gHw" data-secret="LW8jEH4gHw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the past couple years, timelines between funding rounds have been shrinking for fast-growing startups. Almanac announced its $9 million seed round earlier this year led by Floodgate, now they&#8217;re taking the wraps off of a $34 million Series A led by the pandemic&#8217;s most prolific startup investment powerhouse &#8212; Tiger Global. Floodgate again participated in the raise, alongside General Catalyst and a host of angels.</p>
<p>The company wants its collaborative doc editor to be the way more companies fully embrace online productivity software, leaving local-first document editors in the dust. While Alphabet&#8217;s G Suite is a rising presence in the office productivity suite world, Microsoft Office is still the market&#8217;s dominant force.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see ourselves as a generational challenger to Microsoft Office,&#8221; Nathan says. &#8220;It’s not only an old product, but it’s totally outmoded for what we do to today.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While investors have backed plenty of startups based on pandemic era trends that have already seemed to fizzle out, the growing shift away from office culture or even hybrid culture towards full remote work has only grown more apparent as employees place a premium on jobs with flexible remote policies.</p>
<p>Major tech companies like Facebook have found themselves gradually adjusting policies towards full-remote work for staff that can do their jobs remotely. Meanwhile, Apple&#8217;s more aggressive return-to-office plan has prompted a rare outpouring of public and private criticism from employees at the company. Nathan only expects this divide to accelerate as more companies come tor grips with the shifting reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally don’t believe that hybrid is a thing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You have to pick a side, you’re either office culture or ‘cloud culture.’”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">General Motors has spent a lot of time recently talking up the capabilities of its upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">Ultium battery technology</a> but has said significantly less so about the motors those cells will power. That changed on Tuesday when the company detailed its new <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/sep/0916-ultium-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">Ultium Drive motors</a>. With today’s announcement, the series consists of three different models: a 180 kW front-drive model, a 255 kW rear- and front-drive variant and a 62 kW all-wheel drive assist motor. The first two models are permanent magnet motors GM designed in such a way so as to try and reduce its dependence on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-rare-earth-metal-recycling-process-181124555.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">heavy rare metals</a>.</p>
<p>The company didn’t speak to the specific torque and power density characters of each motor but claimed they should deliver “excellent” performance on those fronts. It also revealed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmc-hummer-ev-reveal-001354369.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">2022 Hummer EV</a> will feature three of the 255 kW models. GM claims they will enable the vehicle to produce a combined 11,500 ft/lb of torque and accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in approximately three seconds.</p>
<p>GM says its engineers designed the motors with scalability in mind. Each one can be made using similar tools and manufacturing techniques. It also found a way to integrate components like the power inverter directly into the motors, a feat the company said should reduce costs and simplify manufacturing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I was annoying Seth Rogen. We had just started the interview, and while he politely answered my questions, he was growing tired of talking about his celebrity status. He was more interested in discussing how the company he co-founded is succeeding by overcoming countless regulatory hurdles. To him, that success has little to do with the Seth Rogen brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m a real celebrity. It&#8217;s not like Chris Evans is behind this,&#8221; Rogen said, laughing. &#8220;On the grand scale, celebrities are very low on the pecking order. I don&#8217;t even know if I am a celebrity since I haven&#8217;t been in a Marvel movie.&#8221;</p>
<p>I spoke with Rogen, CEO Mike Mohr, and Chief Commerce Officer Haneen Davies at TechCrunch Disrupt. Houseplant launched in March with two product categories: &#8216;House,&#8217; as in, home goods, and &#8216;Plant,&#8217; as in weed. One is highly regulated by the federal government and social media companies, and the other is not.</p>
<p>&#8220;We approached [building the brand] in a way that nobody else has,&#8221; Davies said. &#8220;I think the merger of house and plant is what&#8217;s going to help us establish a brand name that goes beyond the limiting restrictions you have to abide by to communicate cannabis.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Portal line has always been a kind of odd duck in the world of smart screens. Facebook’s most significant contribution to the category is almost certainly Smart Camera, which uses AI to track a subject and pan and zoom accordingly to keep them in frame. It was the first big line to bring the clever feature to market, though Google, Amazon and even Apple have since offered their own takes on the category.</p>
<p>Portal’s other primary appeal (versus a Nest or Echo) is its integration with Facebook’s own software like Messenger and WhatsApp. Beyond that, the line has struggled to differentiate itself from Amazon and Google’s head start in the world of connected home hardware and smart assistants.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205404" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205404" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205404 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png 8192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205404" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Today’s news brings an interesting new layer to the conversation, with the arrival of the Portal Go, a battery-powered portal smart screen. The 10-inch device sports a handle on the back for quick gripping and a battery that promises five hours of standard usage and up to 14 hours of music playback with the screen off (there’s currently no specific battery-saving mode).</p>
<p>It’s a clever addition to the line. We are, no doubt, pushing further into tablet territory here, but I’ve felt the impulse to pick up and bring my Nest Home into the other room more than once. Your mileage will vary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205412" style="width: 8202px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205412" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205412 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Office-Desk-e1632175444636.png" alt="" width="8192" height="4608" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205412" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>I haven’t seen the thing in person yet, but I do dig the design. It’s got rounded edges around some big black bezels and a fabric-covered backing that’s been all the rage in the smart home category for several years now. The Go is propped up in a wedged design, with two front-facing speakers and a rear-facing woofer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s got an ultrawide front-facing 12-megapixel camera that does the aforementioned smart panning, along a with a physical lens cover for privacy. The screen can also be titled up and down for an optimized viewing angle. The system doesn’t currently support far-field technology for a multiple speaker setup, which could complicate things as you move it around the house.</p>
<p>There’s also a new version of the Portal+, which features the same camera setup, coupled with a thin 14-inch tiltable display that can view up to 25 people at a time on a Zoom call. The Portal Go runs $199, while the new Portal+ is $349. Both devices are available for preorder today and start shipping October 19.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205424" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205424" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205424 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png 8192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205424" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Today’s news also finds Faceboook launching Portal for Business, aimed at positioning the smart screens as teleconferencing products. Per a release:</p>
<blockquote><p>With Portal for Business, SMBs will be able to create and manage Facebook Work Accounts for their teams. This is a new account type that allows businesses to use their own company email addresses to set up Portal. These Work Accounts will also provide access to other popular Facebook work products in the coming year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using Portal Device Manger, IT departments can set up and remotely wipe employee machines. The system is available now as a closed beta.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox is introducing an optional age verification for its users that will combine an ID check with a selfie scan. While the system will not be needed to play most Roblox games, it will be required for those who want to gain early access to Roblox&#8217;s upcoming voice chat features when they roll out later this fall. Additionally, the company says developers will be able to create new experiences that will rely on identity verification in the future.</p>
<p>The verification system is an acknowledgment that many of Roblox&#8217;s core users are aging up. The company said earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/roblox-voice-chat-spatial-audio/">when introducing</a> its new &#8220;Spatial Voice&#8221; feature, that 50% of its users are now over the age of 13. It&#8217;s also seeing the most explosive growth among the 17 to 24-year old demographic.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/09/future-communication-metaverse/">Spatial Voice</a>, which will allow Roblox gamers to have real voice conversations while in games, will initially be made available to a group of 5,000 developers, all 13 and older, who will be able to test voice chat in a custom-built Roblox community space. The rollout to Roblox&#8217;s wider user base will proceed slowly, as it will require new moderation tools and safety features to be built in parallel, the company had said. Age verification is now one of those tools.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205714" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205714" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2205714" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png 1298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205714" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roblox</p></div></p>
<p>Age Verification will come in two stages.</p>
<p>First, using the app, Roblox users will scan an ID card, driver&#8217;s license, passport or other government ID. The company says it won&#8217;t store the raw ID document data. Instead, an anonymized value is generated, which allows Roblox to verify the identity without risking exposure of the user&#8217;s real identity. Roblox matches the data on the document to a library of thousands of global document types to determine it&#8217;s legitimate. After scanning, the user will take a selfie to verify they are a living individual as opposed to uploaded a selfie image &#8212; something that could be automated to trick the system. The selfie is then matched to the person on the document. The process takes a few seconds after the image is snapped, Roblox says.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fairly common for identity verification to be offered on social platforms, as an optional tool. Facebook, for example, may ask users to verify their identity <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1555715811351399/?helpref=search&amp;query=identity%20verification&amp;search_session_id=39050418d137b21988c9af677693ded8&amp;sr=1">to use its payments or donations services</a> or to have their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/295038365360854">profile or Page verified</a>. Twitter <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">may also ask for an ID to verify accounts</a>. Tinder recently <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">made its own ID verification available</a> to members, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, in Roblox&#8217;s case, verification will become more common as it&#8217;s tied to access to newer voice-enabled games and experiences down the road. Roblox hasn&#8217;t yet said what, if any, alternatvie methods of verifying age for voice chat it may later employ.</p>
<p>The company notes that developers and creators will be able to use verification as a signal of trust when looking for collaborators, too &#8212; the verified status, in this case, may hold the same sort of clout that it does elsewhere in social media. On this front, Roblox this summer launched a <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/introducing-talent-hub-open-beta-new-platform-to-find-post-work/1396502">Talent Hub</a>, where users can look for jobs within the Roblox developer community.</p>
<p>Age verification is rolling out gradually, starting today, and will reach all users over the next few weeks. The opt-in feature will be globally available to everyone 13 years old or older in over 180 countries on both desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Age Verification marks a big milestone in our long-term vision of building a trusted, fun, and civil platform for everyone,&#8221; noted Roblox Senior Product Manager, Chris Aston Chen, in an announcement. &#8220;As part of that vision, we will continue to work on seamless ways to verify a user’s age, always respecting a user&#8217;s privacy. Over time, we’ll continue to introduce new and innovative ways for users to easily and securely maintain and protect their identity on the Roblox platform, unlock new and immersive social capabilities, and build and enjoy amazing experiences together,&#8221; Chen added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.mirakl.com">Mirakl</a> has closed a new Series E funding round of $555 million. Following this round, the company is now valued at $3.5 billion. Mirakl helps you launch a marketplace on your online store for your end customers or for your B2B clients. It’s a software-as-a-service marketplace, meaning that Mirakl manages the marketplace for you.</p>
<p>Silver Lake is leading the investment with existing investors 83North, Elaia Partners, Felix Capital and Permira also participating. With today’s funding round, Mirakl is experiencing a sharp valuation bump as the company closed a $300 million funding round at a $1.5 billion valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/mirakl-raises-300-million-for-its-marketplace-platform/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Some of Mirakl’s clients include ABB, Accor, Airbus Helicopters, Carrefour, Express, Leroy Merlin, The Kroger Co and Toyota Material Handling.</p>
<p>Chances are you’re already familiar with marketplaces on online stores. If the e-commerce brand doesn’t have the item you’re looking for, they might be recommending some third-party sellers. You can buy the item from this third-party seller directly on the store you’re using. Mirakl helps you add a marketplace to your site.</p>
<p>On some online stores, marketplace transactions have overtaken in-house transactions. It’s a lucrative shift as e-commerce companies don’t own the inventory of third-party sellers. It frees up some capital to increase reach and online sales.</p>
<p>And that trend isn’t limited to consumer-facing online stores. B2B marketplaces are emerging. For instance, car manufacturers rely on many different suppliers. They could all list parts directly on a marketplace so that repair shops can easily find the right part to fix a car.</p>
<p>When you add a marketplace component, you switch from a one-to-many model to a many-to-many model. It means that you have to make sure that you’re taking advantage of your marketplace by partnering with the right third-party sellers. As a third-party seller, it also means that you need to list your products on as many marketplaces as possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why the company has also built something called <a href="https://www.mirakl.com/mirakl-connect/">Mirakl Connect</a>. The startup positions itself as a center piece of the marketplace ecosystem by connecting online stores with sellers. Mirakl customers can use Mirakl Connect to find third-party sellers. And third-party sellers can more easily list their products on Mirakl-compatible marketplaces.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Mirakl plans to increase the size of its engineering team. It’ll add 350 engineers on top of its team of 500. Similarly, the customer success team will double in size. In other words, things are going well for Mirakl, so let’s invest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Mercedes-Benz has priced the flagship EQS electric vehicle more than $8,700 below its gas-powered S-Class counterpart, a strategic move by the German automaker aiming to ensure a successful rollout of the luxury EV in North America.</p>
<p>The EQS, which will arrive in U.S. dealerships in fall 2021, will start at $103,360, including the $1,050 destination charge. The federal tax credit will provide another $7,500 off of the sticker price.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz will start with two models: the EQS 450+ and the EQS 580 4MATIC, which has a higher base price of $120,160. These two variants will be offered in three trims — the top is appropriately called Pinnacle — pushing that price point as high as 126,360, including the $1,050 destination charge.</p>
<p>Mercedes&#8217;s decision to price the EQS below the S Class, which <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-7122b266eca9fbce132ea26634041549-2022-mercedes-benz-s-class-sedan-quick-reference-guide">starts at $$112,150</a> (including destination charge), illustrates the stakes at play here. The S-Class has long been the company&#8217;s storied and luxurious flagship sedan. Mercedes, which earlier this year outlined a €40 billion ($47 billion) plan to become an electric-only automaker by the end of the decade, needs to either convert old S Class owners to the EQS or bring in a new slate of buyers.</p>
<p>The 2022 Mercedes-Benz exudes ultra-luxury, as expected. But it&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/all-the-tech-crammed-into-the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs/">loaded with tech</a>, including a 56-inch hyperscreen, monster HEPA air filter and the software that intuitively learns the driver&#8217;s wants and needs. There is even a new fragrance called No.6 MOOD Linen and is described as &#8220;carried by the green note of a fig and linen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercedes is betting that the tech, coupled with performance, design and the price will attract buyers. As TechCrunch has noted before, this is a high-stakes game for Mercedes. The German automaker is banking on a successful rollout of the EQS in North America that will erase any memory of its troubled &#8212; and now nixed &#8212; launch of the EQC crossover in the United States.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ultimately, BioNTech's mission is to make treatments that are optimized not only to specific patient needs, but also to time and place.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BioNTech&#8217;s founding story dates back to the late 1990s, when CEO and co-founder Uğur Şahin, his wife and co-founder Özlem Türeci, and the rest of the seven-person founding team began their research.</p>
<p>Focused specifically on an area dubbed &#8220;New Technologies,&#8221; mRNA stood out as one area with tremendous potential to deliver the team&#8217;s ultimate goal: Developing treatments personalized to an individual and their specific ailments, rather than the traditional approach of finding a solution that happens to work generally at the population level.</p>
<p>Şahin, along with Mayfield venture partner Ursheet Parikh, joined us at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine, his long journey as a founder, what it takes to build a biotech platform company, and what&#8217;s coming next from BioNTech and the technologies it&#8217;s developing to help prevent other outbreaks and treat today&#8217;s deadliest diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;At that time, mRNA was not potent enough,&#8221; Şahin recalled. &#8220;It was just a weak molecule. But the idea was great, so we invested many years in an academic setting to improve that. And in 2006, we realized &#8216;Wow, this is now working. Okay, it&#8217;s time to initiate a company.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audi has launched the Q4 e-tron, the fifth electric vehicle in its growing portfolio, as<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> part of the German automaker’s plan to bring more than 30 EVs and plug-in hybrids to market by 2025. </span></p>
<p>T<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he Q4 e-tron is <a href="https://media.audiusa.com/en-us/releases/491">Audi&#8217;s entry electric SUV model</a> and the price reflects that. The vehicle, which was </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">first revealed as a concept at the 2019 Geneva International Motor Show, has a starting price of $44,995, including the $1,095 destination charge. It&#8217;s worth noting that the Q4 electric vehicle is about $1,000 cheaper than the gas-powered 2022 Q5 SUV.</span></p>
<p>The Q4 e-tron is more like a family of vehicles with three members. There is the Q4 50 e-tron and a Q4 Sportback 50 quattro, a variation that is all-wheel drive and powered by dual asynchronous motors. Both of these vehicles have an estimated EPA range of 241 miles.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the Q4 40 e-tron, which is rear-wheel drive and powered by a single asynchronous electric motor. The EPA estimates for the Q4 40 e-tron has not been released.  Here&#8217;s a breakdown of some of the basic specs below.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205843" style="width: 1514px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-7.53.56-AM.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205843" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205843 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-7.53.56-AM.png" alt="Audi Q4 e-tron" width="1504" height="818" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-7.53.56-AM.png 1504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-7.53.56-AM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-7.53.56-AM.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-7.53.56-AM.png?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-7.53.56-AM.png?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-7.53.56-AM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1504px) 100vw, 1504px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205843" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Audi</p></div></p>
<p>The new Q4, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/audis-all-electric-q4-e-tron-crossover-will-have-a-dynamic-ar-windshield-display/">TechCrunch noted earlier this year</a>, is packed with tech in its stout-looking package, notably the option to add an AR-enabled windshield.</p>
<p>The Q4 is a larger compact SUV with a short overhang and wheelbase of 9.1 feet. This makes the Q4 look compact from the outside. Inside though, there is combination there&#8217;s an interior of 6 feet in length, the kind of space found in a large full-size class SUV. The Q4 40 e-tron and Q4 50 e-tron models come standard with 19&#8242;-inch wheels equipped with all-season tires. The Sportback variant of the Q4 50 e-tron quattro receives larger standard 20-inch wheels with all-season tires, according to Audi.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Importantly, the Q4 also shares the same architecture with parent company VW’s modular electric drive toolkit chassis, or MEB platform. This flexible modular system, which was first introduced by VW in 2016, was developed to make it more efficient and cost-effective to produce a variety of EVs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The dashboard enables businesses to automatically store, ship and retrieve employee computers in a way that is remote and hands-free.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rippling.com/hardware">Rippling</a>, a startup building a platform to manage all aspects of employee data, from payroll and benefits through to device management, launched Rippling Inventory Management, what founder and CEO Parker Conrad is touting as the “world’s first cloud IT closet.”</p>
<p>The dashboard enables businesses to automatically store, ship and retrieve employee computers in a way that is remote and hands-free. Rippling stores and monitors company devices so they no longer need an “IT closet” on-site or utilize an employee’s home. Rippling also manages the logistics related to the devices, including wiping and assigning devices and issuing prepaid mailers for machines that need to be returned.</p>
<p>Customers pay a per employee, per month fee to use the dashboard to hire, or fire employees, and set up all of the apps (and access) that the employee will need on their computer. In addition, the user can see all of the outstanding shipments and where they are in the process of being delivered or returned.</p>
<p>The product launch is buoyed by a massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/rippling-nabs-145m-at-a-1-35b-valuation-to-build-out-its-all-in-one-platform-for-employee-data/">$145 million Series B round in 2020 </a>that gave the company a valuation of $1.35 billion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205113" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205113" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2205113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rippling-invmgmt-shippedbox.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="364" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205113" class="wp-caption-text">Rippling inventory management gif. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rippling</p></div></p>
<p>The inventory management platform stems from a problem Rippling saw as remote work became more prevalent over the past 18 months, Conrad told TechCrunch. The company itself used to have an IT closet, which he considers “the last physical part about managing employees.”</p>
<p>“What this does is kill the IT closet,” he added. “If you don’t work in an office and decide to leave, some companies don’t have a process on how to get the former employee’s device back. We had a situation ourselves where employees would ship computers back to one person, and she had them stacked up in her apartment.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The leadership team spent a long time looking for an inventory management service, and also saw customers posting about it on social media. However, Conrad considers this a problem that didn’t really exist until March 2020.</p>
<p>He explained that with the exception of a few outlier companies, most were not remote and physically handed a computer to new employees or gathered them from the desk of someone who left. Once they were remote, it was difficult to keep track of who had which device and how to get them back if needed.</p>
<p>“Everyone can be done online now, and you don’t have to come into the office to sign paperwork,” Conrad said. “This is the last piece that companies need and works to solve the last-mile problem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s iPhone review goes back to Disneyland for the first time in a couple of years for, uh, obvious reasons. I’m happy to report that the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 performed extremely well and the limited testing I was able to do on the iPhone mini and iPhone 13 Pro Max showed that for the first time you’re able to make a pretty easy choice based on size once you’ve decided you’re ok without telephoto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major reasons I keep bringing these iPhones back to Disneyland is that it’s pretty much the perfect place to test the improvements Apple claims it is making in an intense real-world setting. It’s typically hot, the network environment is atrocious, you have to use your phone for almost everything these days from pictures to ticket scanning to food ordering and you’re usually there as long as you can to get the most out of your buck. It’s the ideal stress test that doesn’t involve artificial battery rundowns or controlled photo environments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my testing, most of Apple’s improvements actually had a visible impact on the quality of life of my trip, though in some cases not massive. Screen brightness, the longer telephoto and battery life were all bright spots.</span></p>
<p><b>Performance and battery</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery of the iPhone 13 Pro hit just over the 13 hour mark in the parks for me running it right to the dregs. Since there was so much video testing this year, the camera app did stay on screen longer than usual at just over 1hr of active ‘on screen’ usage which does put a bit of a strain on the system. I’d say that in real-world standard use you’ll probably get a bit more than that out of it so I’m comfortable saying that Apple’s estimate of an hour or more longer video playback time from the iPhone 12 Pro is probably pretty accurate. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205847" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205847" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2205847 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2463.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205847" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it was hard to get the same level of stress on the iPhone 13 Pro Max during my tests, I’d say you can expect even more battery life out of it, given the surplus it still had when my iPhone 13 Pro needed charging. Bigger battery, more battery life, not a big shock.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re using it in the parks and doing the rope drop I’d say I would plan on taking it off the charger at 6am or so and plan to have a charger handy by about 4pm so you don’t go dead. That’s not a bad run overall for an iPhone in challenging conditions and with heavy camera use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s new ProMotion display was a nice upgrade as well, and I did notice the increased screen brightness. Typically the bump in brightness was only truly noticeable side-by-side with an iPhone 12 Pro with high-key content displayed on the screen. Popping open the Disneyland app for the barcode meant a bit better consistency in scanning (though that’s pretty hard to say for sure) and a visual increase in overall brightness in direct sun. Out of the Sun I’d say you’d be hard pressed to tell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variable refresh rate of the ProMotion screen cranking all the way up to 120hz while scrolling Safari is a really nice quality of life improvement. I’m unfortunately a bit jaded in this department because I’ve done a ton of my computing on the iPad Pro for the past couple of years, but it’s going to be an amazing bump for iPhone users that haven’t experienced it. Because Apple’s system is not locked at 120hz, it allows them to conserve battery life by slowing down the screen’s refresh rate when viewing static content like photos or text when not scrolling. I’m happy to say that I did not see any significant ramping while scrolling, so it’s really responsive and seamless in its handling of this variability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new A15 chip is, yes, more powerful than last year. Here’s some numbers if that’s your sort of thing:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2205784" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png 1488w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-21-at-6.10.16-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impressive as hell, especially for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more battery life</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">less</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The power-per-watt performance of Apple’s devices continues to be the (relatively) un-sung victory of its chips department. It’s not just that this year’s iPhones or the M1 laptops are crazy fast, it’s that they’re also actually usable for enormous amounts of time not connected to a charger. For those curious, the iPhone 13 Pro appears to have 6GB of RAM. </span></p>
<p><b>Design</b></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205845" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205845" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2205845 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_2460.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205845" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The design of the iPhone continues to be driven by the camera and radio. Whatever is necessary to support the sensors and lenses of the camera package and whatever is necessary to ensure that the antennas can accommodate 5G are in control of the wheel at this point in the iPhone’s life, and that’s pretty natural. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The camera array on the back of the iPhone 13 Pro is bigger and taller in order to accommodate the three new cameras Apple has installed here. And I do mean bigger, like 40% bigger overall with taller arrays. Apple’s new cases now have a very noticeable raised ridge that exists to protect the lenses when you’re setting the case down on a surface. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything else is sort of built around the camera and the need for wireless charging and radio performance. But Apple’s frosted glass and steel rim look retains its jewel-like quality this year and they’re still really good looking phones. I doubt the vast majority of people will see them long without a case but while you do they’re nice looking phones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The front notch has been pared down slightly due to improvements in camera packaging, which leaves a tiny bit more screen real-estate for things like videos, but we’ll have to wait to see if developers find clever ways to use the extra pixels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, on to the cameras.</span></p>
<p><b>Cameras</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems impossible that Apple continues to make year-over-year improvements that genuinely improve your optionality and quality of images that are enough to matter. And yet. The camera quality and features are a very real jump from the iPhone 11 Pro across the board and still a noticeable improvement from the iPhone 12 Pro for you early adopters. Anything older and you’re going to get a blast of quality right to the face that you’re going to love. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The camera packaging and feature set is also more uniform across the lineup than ever before with Apple’s IBIS in camera sensor shift stabilization system appearing in every model &#8212; even the iPhone 13 mini which is a crazy achievement given the overall package size of this sensor array.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my experience in the parks this year, Apple’s improvements to cameras made for a material difference no matter which lens I chose. From low light to long zoom, there’s something to love here for every avid photographer. Oh, and that Cinematic Mode, we’ll talk about that too. </span></p>
<p><b>Telephoto</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all of the lenses I expected improvement from, the telephoto was actually not that high on my list. But I was pleasantly surprised by the increased range and utility of this lens. I am an admitted telephoto addict, with some 60% of my photos on iPhone 12 Pro taken with the tele lens over the wide. I just prefer the ability to pick and choose my framing more closely without having to crop after the fact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having Night Mode on the telephoto now means that it doesn’t fall back to the wide lens with crop in dark conditions as it used to. Now you get that native telephoto optics plus the Night Mode magic. This means much better black points and great overall exposure even hand held at zoom &#8212; something that felt just completely out of reach a couple of years ago.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205804" style="width: 1546px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205804" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2205804 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205804" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the higher zoom level, portraits are cropped tighter, with better organic non-portrait-mode bokeh which is lovely. With this new lens you’re going to be able to shoot better looking images of people, period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a camera person, the 3x reminds me a lot of my favorite 105mm fixed portrait lens. It’s got the crop, it’s got the nice background separation and the optical quality is very, very good on this lens package. Apple knocked it out of the park on the tele this time around. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205813" style="width: 1546px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205813" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2205813 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tele2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205813" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longer optical range was also very handy in a Disneyland world where performers are often kept separate from guests &#8212; sometimes for effect but mostly because of pandemic precautions. Being able to reach out and get that shot of Kylo Ren hyping up the crowd was a fun thing to be enabled to do.</span></p>
<p><b>Wide</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s wide lens gets the biggest overall jump in sensor technology. A larger ƒ/1.5 aperture and new 1.9µm pixels roughly doubles the light gathering &#8212; and it shows. Images at night and inside ride buildings had a marked improvement in overall quality due to deeper blacks and better dynamic range. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Night Mode enabled, the deeper light gathering range and improved Smart HDR 4 makes for deeper blacks and a less washed out appearance. If I had to characterize it, it would be ‘more natural’ overall &#8212; a theme I’ve seen play out across the iPhone cameras this time around. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205830" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205830" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2205830 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=300,113 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=1536,576 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/widenight.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205830" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without Night Mode enabled, the raw improvement in image quality due to more light being captured is immediately evident. Though I think there are few situations where you need to turn off Night Mode any more, subjects in motion in low light are one of those and you’ll get a few inches extra of wiggle room with this new sensor and lens combo in those instances. </span></p>
<p>Having sensor shift OIS come to the wide on the iPhone 13 across the range is a huge godsend to both still shots and video. Though I&#8217;m spoiled having been able to play with the iPhone 12 Pro Max&#8217;s stabilization, if you haven&#8217;t shot with it before you&#8217;re going to be incredibly happy with the additional levels of sharpness it brings.</p>
<p><b>Ultra Wide</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple’s ultra wide camera has been in need of some love for a while. Though it offered a nice additional perspective, it has suffered from a lack of auto-focus and sub-par light gathering ability since its release. This time around it gets both a larger ƒ/1.8 aperture and autofocus. Apple claims 92% more light gathering and my testing in pretty rough lighting conditions shows a massive improvement across the board. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205803" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205803" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2205803 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=300,113 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=1536,576 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ultrawide.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205803" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically at Disneyland I like to shoot the wide in one of two ways: up close to create a fisheye-type perspective for portraits or to snag a vista when the lighting or scene setting is especially good. Having auto focus available improves the first a ton and the wider aperture gives the second a big boost too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check out these shots of a moonlit Trader Sam’s, a snap that you might grab because the lighting and scenery are just right. The iPhone 12 Pro isn’t bad at all here but there is an actually quite clear difference between the two in exposure. Both of these were taken with Night Mode disabled in order to compare the raw improvement in aperture.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205857" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205857" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2205857 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=300,113 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=1536,576 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nonight.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205857" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The delta is clear, and I’m pretty impressed in general with how much Apple keeps improving this ultra wide camera, though it seems clear at this point that we’re hitting the upper limits of what a 12MP sensor at this size can bring to a lens with such a wide POV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new ISP also improves Night Mode shooting here too &#8212; and with a bit more raw range to work with given the wider aperture, your night mode shots lose even more of that bright candy-like look and get a deeper and more organic feeling. </span></p>
<p><b>Macro photos and video</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another new shooting possibility presented by the iPhone 13 Pro is a pretty impressive macro mode that can shoot as close as 2cm. It’s really, really well done given that it’s being implemented in a super wide lens on a smartphone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was able to shoot incredibly detailed snaps very, very close-up. We’re talking ‘the surface texture of objects’ close; ‘pollen hanging off a bee’s thorax’ close; dew&#8230;well you get the idea. It’s close, and it’s a nice tool to have without having to carry a macro attachment with you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found the sharpness and clarity of the macro images I captured to be excellent within the rough 40% area that comprised the center of the capture area. Due to the fact that the macro mode is on the ultra wide, there is a significant amount of comatic aberration around the edges of the image. Basically, the lens is so curved you get excess blurring at the edges of a hyper-spherical element. This is only truly visible at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">very</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> close distances at the minimum of the focal range. If you’re a few cm away you’ll notice and you’ll probably crop it out or live with it. If you’re further away getting a ‘medium macro’ at 10cm or whatever you’ll likely not notice it much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a separate factor from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slim field-of-focus that is absolutely standard with all macro lenses. You’re going to have to be precise at maximum macro, basically, but that’s nothing new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given how large scale Disneyland is I actually had to actively seek out ways to use the macro, though I’d imagine it would be useful in more ways in other venues. But I still got cool shots of textures in the bottles in Radiator Springs and some faux fungi at Galaxy’s Edge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macro video is similarly fun but requires extremely stable hands or a tripod to really take advantage of given that the slightest movement of your hands is going to move the camera a massive amount of distance proportional to the focal area. Basically, tiny hand moves, big camera moves in this mode. But it’s a super fun tool to add to your arsenal and I had fun chasing bugs around some flower petals in the garden of the Grand Californian hotel with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a way to go from world scale down to fine detail it’s a great way to mix up your shots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One interesting quirk of the ultra wide camera being the home of macro on iPhone 13 Pro is that there is a noticeable transition between the wide and ultra-wide cameras as you move into macro range. This presents as a quick-shift image transition where you can see one camera clicking off and the other one turning on &#8212; something that was pretty much never obvious in other scenarios even though the cameras switch all the time depending on lighting conditions and imaging judgement calls made by the iPhone’s camera stack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users typically never notice this at all, but given that there is now an official macro camera available when you swoop in close to an object while you’re on 1x then it’s going to flip over to the .5x mode in order to let you shoot super close. This is all totally fine, by the way, but can result in a bit of flutter if you’re moving in and out of range with the cameras continuously switching as you enter and exit ‘macro distance’ (around 10-15cm). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I queried about this camera switching behavior, Apple said that “a new setting will be added in a software update this fall to turn off automatic camera switching when shooting at close distances for macro photography and video.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This should solve this relatively small quirk for people who want to work specifically at the macro range. </span></p>
<p><b>Photographic Styles and Smart HDR 4</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the constant tensions with Apple’s approach to computational photography has been its general leaning towards the conservative when it comes to highly processed images. Simply put, Apple likes its images to look ‘natural’, where other similar systems from competitors like Google or Samsung have made different choices in order to differentiate and create ‘punchier’ and sometimes just generally brighter images. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did some </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/iphone-11-pro-disney-after-dark/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comparisons of these approaches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back when Apple introduced Night Mode two years ago.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The general idea hasn’t changed much even with Apple’s new launches this year, they’re still hewing to nature as a guiding principle. But now they’ve introduced Photographic Styles in order to give you the option of cranking two controls they’re calling Tone and Warmth. These are basically vibrance and color temperature (but only generally). You can choose from 5 presets including no adjustments or you can adjust the two settings on any of the presets on a scale of -100 to +100. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would assume that long term people will play with these and recommendations will get passed around on how to get a certain look. My general favorite of these is vibrant because I like the open shadows and mid-tone pop. Though I would assume a lot of folks will gravitate towards Rich Contrast because more contrast is generally more pleasing to the human eye. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205953" style="width: 2242px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205953" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2205953 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles-1.jpg" alt="" width="2232" height="2048" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles-1.jpg 2232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles-1.jpg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles-1.jpg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles-1.jpg?resize=768,705 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles-1.jpg?resize=680,624 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles-1.jpg?resize=1536,1409 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles-1.jpg?resize=2048,1879 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/styles-1.jpg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2232px) 100vw, 2232px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205953" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this shot of some kid-sized speeders, you can see the effects on the shadows and midtones as well as the overall color temperature. Rather than being a situational filter, I view this as a deep ‘camera setting’ feature, much like choosing the type of film that you wanted to roll with in a film camera. For more contrast you might choose a Kodak Ektachrome, for cooler-to-neutral colors perhaps a Fuji, for warm skin tones perhaps a Kodak Portra and for boosted color maybe an Ultramax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This setting gives you the option to set up your camera the way you want the color to sit in a similar way. The setting is then retained when you close camera.app. This way when you open it, it’s set to shoot the way you want it to. This goes for the vast majority of camera settings now under iOS 15, which is a nice quality of life improvement over the old days when the iPhone camera reset itself every time you opened it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that these color settings are ‘imbedded’ in the image, which means they are not adjustable afterwards like Portrait Mode’s lighting scenarios. They are also not enabled during RAW &#8212; which makes sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart HDR4 also deserves a mention here because it’s now doing an additional bit of smart segmentation based on subjects in the frame. In a situation with a backlit group of people, for instance, the new ISP is going to segment out each of those subjects individually and apply color profiles, exposure, white balance and other adjustments to them &#8212; all in real time. This makes for a marked improvement in dark-to-light scenarios like shooting out of windows and shooting into the sun. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would not expect much improvement out of the selfie camera this year, it’s just much the same as normal. Though you can use Cinematic Mode on it which is fun if not that useful in selfie modes.</span></p>
<p><b>Cinematic Mode</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an experimental mode that has been shipped live to the public. That’s the best way to set the scene for those folks looking to dive into it. Contrary to Apple’s general marketing, this won’t yet replace any real camera rack focus setup on a film set, but it does open up a huge toolset for budding filmmakers and casual users that was previously locked behind a lot of doors made up of cameras, lenses and equipment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cinematic Mode uses the camera’s depth information, the accelerometer and other signals to craft a video that injects synthetic bokeh (blur) and tracks subjects in the frame to intelligently ‘rack’ focus between them depending on what it thinks you want. There is also some impressive focus tracking features built in that allow you to lock onto a subject and follow them in a ‘tracking shot’ which can keep them in focus through obstacles like crowds, railings and water. I found all of these depth-leveraging features that did tracking to be incredibly impressive in my early testing, but they were often let down a bit by the segmentation masking that struggled to define crisp, clear borders around subjects to separate them from the background. It turns out that doing what portrait mode does with a still image is just insanely hard to do 30 times a second with complex, confusing backgrounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature is locked to 1080p/30fps which says a lot about its intended use. This is for family shots presented on the device, AirPlayed to your TV or posted on the web. I’d imagine that this will actually get huge uptake with the TikTok filmmaker crowd who will do cool stuff with the new storytelling tools of selective focus.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205890" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cinematic.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205890" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2205890 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cinematic.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205890" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Matthew Panzarino</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did some test shooting with my kids walking through crowds and riding on carousels that was genuinely, shockingly good. It really does provide a filmic, dreamy quality to the video that I was previously only able to get with quick and continuous focus adjustments on an SLR shooting video with a manually focused lens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That, I think, is the major key to understanding Cinematic Mode. Despite the marketing, this mode is intended to unlock new creative possibilities for the vast majority of iPhone users who have no idea how to set focal distances, bend their knees to stabilize and crouch-walk-rack-focus their way to these kinds of tracking shots. It really does open up a big bucket that was just inaccessible before. And in many cases I think that those willing to experiment and deal with its near-term foibles will be rewarded with some great looking shots to add to their iPhone memories widget.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll be writing more about this feature later this week so stay tuned. For now, what you need to know is that an average person can whip this out in bright light and get some pretty fun and impressive results, but it is not a serious professional tool, yet. And even if you miss focus on a particular subject you are able to adjust that in post with a quick tap of the edit button and a tap on a subject &#8212; as long as it&#8217;s within the focal range of the lens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a filmmaking tool for the run and gun generation it’s a pretty compelling concept. The fact is that it allows people to spend less time and less technical energy on the mechanics of filmmaking and more time on the storytelling part. Moviemaking has always been an art that is intertwined with technology — and one of the true exemplars of the ideal that artists are always the first to adopt new technology and push it to its early limits.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of hard to explain because I think most of us are so used to the language of film these days but having these tools in your arsenal is a huge step forward in how everyone&#8217;s home videos will look and feel over the next few years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Apple’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/hands-on-with-the-iphone-7-plus-crazy-new-portrait-mode/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">portrait mode</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has improved massively over the past 6 years, I expect Cinematic Mode to keep growing and improving. The relatively sketchy performance in low light and the locked zoom are high on my list to see bumps next year, as is improved segmentation. It’s an impressive technical feat that Apple is able to deliver this kind of slicing and adjustment not only in real-time preview but also in post-shooting editing modes, and I’m looking forward to seeing it evolve. </span></p>
<p><b>Assessment</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a great update that improves user experience in every way, even during an intense day-long Disneyland outing. The improved brightness and screen refresh means easier navigation of park systems and better visibility in daylight for directions and wait times and more. The better cameras mean you’re getting improved shots in dark-to-light situations like waiting in lines or shooting from under overhangs. The nice new telephoto lets you shoot close-up shots of cast members who are now often separated from the crowds by large distances, which is cool &#8212; and as a bonus acts as a really lovely portrait lens even while not in Portrait mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall this was one of the best experiences I’ve had testing a phone at the parks, with a continuous series of ‘wow’ moments with the cameras that sort of made me question my confirmation bias. I ended up with a lot of shots like the night mode wide angle and telephoto ones I shared above that impressed me so much I ended up doing a lot of gut checking asking other people in blind tests what they thought of the two images. Each time I did so the clear winner was the iPhone 13 &#8212; it really is just a clear cut improvement in image making across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the package is pretty well turned out here too, with massive performance gains in the A15 Bionic with not only no discernable impact on battery life but a good extra hour to boot. The performance chart above may give the wow factor but that performance charted on the power usage of the chip across a day is what continues to be the most impressive feat of Apple’s chip teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The iPhones 13 are an impressive field this year, providing a solid moat of image quality, battery life and now, thankfully, screen improvements that should serve Apple well over the next 12 months.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Turns out COVID-19 lockdowns have been good for the indoor hobby of hardware hacking: The U.K.-based foundation behind the low-price microprocessor Raspberry Pi announced close of a $45 million funding round yesterday.</p>
<p>The cash injection into the trading arm of the (nonprofit) Raspberry Pi Foundation values it at $500 million (pre-money), founder Eben Upton confirmed.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by London-based Lansdowne Partners and The Ezrah Charitable Trust, a private charitable foundation based in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pleased to welcome Lansdowne Partners and The Ezrah Charitable Trust as our first outside shareholders to help us achieve the next steps in our growth,&#8221; said Upton in a statement. &#8220;We are seeing strong demand from consumers as they use our PCs to access the internet for work and entertainment, and even faster growth from industrial companies globally as they design Raspberry Pi into their innovative IoT applications. This funding will enable us to scale to meet future demand.</p>
<p>“Our new investors will not only add value to our strategy and help support our growth but they also understand the rationale and ethos of our business model, aimed at enabling access to hardware and software tools for everyone and delivering a consumer PC experience from only $35 as well as building partnerships with a growing range of OEMs across the world.”</p>
<p>The Pi Foundation said the financing will be used to expand what is already an ample product line of Pi microprocessors.</p>

<p>Spending on marketing is also planned, across both the consumer (&#8220;build it yourself&#8221; PC) and industrial (IoT) sectors.</p>
<p>Its trading arm ships 7 million+ devices a year at this point.</p>
<p>While, in total, the Pi Foundation also said it&#8217;s shipping over 42 million (Pi-powered) PCs to more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly saw increased interest in Raspberry Pi during lockdown,&#8221; Upton told TechCrunch. &#8220;It was satisfying to be able to supply units to young people who needed machines to study from home on, and we had some great philanthropic support (notably from the Bloomfield Trust) to roll kits out to disadvantaged young people in the U.K.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our current sustained increase in demand is driven primarily by industrial customers as the economy rebounds from COVID-19,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the short term the focus is on investing in manufacturing and supply chain to meet demand,&#8221; he also said, expanding on the plan for the funding. &#8220;In the longer term, this funding is going to allow us to invest more in product development: As our products become more sophisticated, they become much more expensive and time-consuming to develop, so being able to hire more engineers is a key driver of future growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting in a supporting statement, Peter Davies of Lansdowne Partners, added: “We are very excited to be investing with Raspberry Pi, an organisation we have followed and admired for many years. The commercial and human impact it has achieved in its first decade has been extraordinary and we look forward to assisting the company to expand this even further in coming years as new capital is deployed.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.just.insure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just Insure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a pay-per-mile insurance technology company, has raised $8 million in a funding round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CrossCut Ventures, ManchesterStory and Western Technology Investments co-led the investment, which brings its total raised to $15.3 million since its January 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles-based Just says it uses telematics “to reward safe drivers and reduce insurer bias” by looking at factors such as how, when and where customers drive, rather than factors such as ZIP code or marital status as most traditional insurers do. Or put more simply, it charges customers only for miles driven and its rates vary based on driving behavior. This way, Just says it’s able to offer lower rates for “safer drivers,” and it claims to save its customers around 40% from their “previous auto insurance company.” For now, it’s only available in Arizona, although the company plans to expand to other markets such as Texas, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Georgia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Just is not the first company to offer personalized auto insurance. There’s Metromile, which launched its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personalized pay-per-mile auto insurance in 2012. And there’s also </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/10/public-investors-stay-in-love-with-tech-as-root-and-affirm-file-to-ipo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Root Insurance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Ohio-based car insurance startup that uses smartpho</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ne technology to understand individual driver behavior. Although there are similarities between Root and Just, there are also distinct differences, according to founder and CEO Robert Smithson.</span></p>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">
<p>Root charges customers a monthly fee, and when policies are renewed, the rate is subject to change based on driving behavior. Just has a similar model. If its drivers exhibits safe driving behavior, their rates can fall. On the other hand, if they exhibit dangerous behavior, their rates can rise. But unlike Root, Smithson said, Just only charges its &#8220;liability only&#8221; customers for miles driven. There is no monthly fee. For &#8220;full cover&#8221; customers, Just also includes a &#8220;small daily charge&#8221; to reflect the risk that someone could steal their car. For its part, MetroMile charges customers a base rate <em>plus</em> a per mile rate. Neither rate are affected by how a person drives, notes Smithson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The [Just] per mile price that a customer gets can change every month. This means we&#8217;re able to rapidly reward safe drivers with lower rates, and to increase them for those who drive less well,&#8221; Smithson said. &#8220;This rapid feedback loop encourages people to make smarter driving decisions. And it means that our customers have fewer accidents, and we do better. &#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>In 2020, Root had a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://ir.joinroot.com/static-files/d768cb47-df9e-4d14-8711-ea814a2de5e0)%7C">direct loss ratio of 82%</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. Just&#8217;s direct loss ratio is 65.8% year to date so far. But of course, it has far fewer customers and is only serving one market. Still, the <span style="font-weight: 400;">company says that it has already achieved underwriting profitability in terms of what portion of premium to it pays out in claims.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div dir="auto">
<p>Also, with so many people shifting to working from home over the last year, Just says it has seen increased demand this year. It issued over 1,000 new policies in the second quarter, up “tenfold” compared<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the same period in 2020. The startup said during that same time, its revenue climbed 1,400% compared to the second quarter of 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“People are simply driving less as a result of increased work-from-home rates, and this isn’t changing anytime soon,&#8221; Smithson said. &#8220;Our approach enables us to offer customers rates that are truly reflective of their driving.”</p>
<p>The company likens its user experience to that of a prepaid phone card. Just customers can “load up” their account for $30 for minimum liability-only coverage and <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$75 for full coverage to start driving.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> The company&#8217;s</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> insurance policy is for 30 days.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So as customers drive, their balance declines. Every 30 days, the company changes each customer’s price as it gathers more data about their driving habits.</span></p>

<p>It’s an approach that Matt Kinley, co-founder and managing partner at ManchesterStory, had never before seen.</p>
<p>“It is more fair, affordable and customized across the board, and unique because the company offers customers rates that are actually reflective of their driving, which rewards safe drivers with lower insurance premiums,” he said.</p>
<p>The company plans to use its new capital in part to do some hiring &#8212; it currently has a staff of 35 &#8212; and scale its product offering. It is also planning to launch beyond Arizona into neighboring states. In particular, Smithson said the startup is “keen” to launch in Texas.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden has pledged to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. He intends to meet this ambitious target through a wave of new federal spending and government programs.</p>
<p>But our best hope for reducing carbon emissions isn&#8217;t new government spending. It&#8217;s a technological sea change &#8212; one that can only come from the private sector.</p>
<p>In fact, the government is slowing progress against climate change by imposing regulations that prevent emissions-lowering technologies from reaching the market. If our leaders really want to save the planet, they need to get out of the way of entrepreneurs who can actually do so.</p>
<p>One would expect the government to embrace technology with the potential to cut carbon pollution. After all, Biden himself has promised to &#8220;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-sets-2030-greenhouse-gas-pollution-reduction-target-aimed-at-creating-good-paying-union-jobs-and-securing-u-s-leadership-on-clean-energy-technologies/">spur American technological innovations</a>&#8221; as part of his climate agenda.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of the most promising green tech breakthroughs face severe headwinds as a result of misguided or antiquated federal policies.</p>
<p>One such technology &#8212; profiled in &#8220;<a href="https://www.theysayitcantbedone.com/">They Say It Can&#8217;t Be Done</a>,&#8221; a new documentary on the relationship between innovators and regulations &#8212; is <a href="https://climatechange.medill.northwestern.edu/2016/11/29/artificial-trees-might-be-needed-to-offset-carbon-dioxide-emissions/">an artificial tree</a> developed by Arizona State University physicist and engineer Klaus Lackner. These man-made trees contain a special plastic resin that can absorb carbon dioxide and release it when submerged in water. They&#8217;re 1,000 times more effective at taking in carbon dioxide from the air than natural trees. Once captured, this carbon dioxide can then be reclaimed and converted into fuel.</p>
<p>Lackner&#8217;s design could be scaled to produce units that each remove a metric ton of carbon dioxide daily. The main stumbling block is <a href="https://www.onlocationinc.com/blog/regulatory-hurdles-of-a-revolutionary-technology-to-fight-climate-change">the lack of clear regulations</a> surrounding carbon capture technologies &#8212; specifically the transport and storage of captured carbon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Until a uniform federal framework exists, the process of bringing this technology to market will remain impossibly complicated and <a href="https://lawliberty.org/innovation-in-a-regulatory-labyrinth/">fraught with risk</a>.</p>
<p>Or consider technologies that could reduce the need for large-scale livestock farming. Raising billions of chickens, pigs and cattle requires vast amounts of water, feed and land. The resulting carbon footprint is massive &#8212; about <a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/">7.1 gigatons of greenhouse gases a year</a>.</p>
<p>Here too, new technologies could help reduce emissions. Researchers are designing cell-cultured meat &#8212; chicken, pork and beef produced in the lab rather than the feedlot. This <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sustainability_cultivated_meat.pdf">lab-grown protein</a> is safe, healthy and far less carbon-intensive than traditionally farmed meat.</p>
<p>One startup that makes lab-grown meat, Eat Just, recently obtained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/eat-just-to-sell-lab-grown-meat-in-singapore-after-gaining-world-first-regulatory-approval/">approval</a> to sell its cell-cultured chicken in Singapore. But it&#8217;s still waiting on the green light from U.S. regulators. <a href="https://thespoon.tech/eat-justs-josh-tetrick-on-what-it-will-take-to-normalize-the-concept-of-cultured-meat/">According to the firm&#8217;s founder</a>, it could be another year &#8212; or more &#8212; before U.S. approval comes through.</p>
<p>For an industry as capital-intensive as cultured meat production, this sluggish approval process can make it impossible for a startup to launch and get its products to market.</p>
<p>High-tech solutions like these are precisely what&#8217;s required to protect our planet from the threat of climate change. While it is impossible to say whether lab-grown meat is the future of sustainable food or if artificial trees are the best solution for sequestering atmospheric carbon, an accessible and level regulatory playing field allows the best innovations to thrive.</p>
<p>Too many Americans believe that when it comes to climate change, only the government is up to the task. The fact is, the main barrier to large-scale adoption of sustainable technologies isn&#8217;t a lack of government involvement, but too much &#8212; or at least the wrong kind.</p>
<p>In order to make good on his promise to reduce the nation&#8217;s carbon footprint, the president and his team will need to recognize how government obstructs the development and deployment of technology that can fulfill that promise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber said Tuesday that it could hit one measure of profitability in the third quarter, earlier than expected, as the ride-hailing company saw gains in its delivery and mobility businesses. The ride-hailing service <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/d6f5405e-e252-4c03-bdc4-d8899e94d535.pdf">told regulators in a filing this morning</a> that it anticipated an increase in gross bookings and stronger adjusted EBITDA in the quarter than it had forecasted for shareholders in its last investor presentation.</p>
<p>The company now anticipates gross bookings for the current quarter to land between $22.8 billion and $23.2 billion, up from an initially promised $22 billion to $24 billion range. The company&#8217;s forecasted adjusted EBITDA, an accommodating method of calculating profit, was also raised to between -$25 million and $25 million in the quarter ending September 30, and improvement from the company&#8217;s previous anticipation of a result merely “better than a loss of $100 million.”</p>
<p>“They say that crisis breeds opportunity and that’s certainly been true of Uber during the last 18 months,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement.</p>
<p>Uber is now on track to adjusted EBITDA breakeven in quarter three, CFO Nelson Chai said &#8212; an achievement that may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the economics of ride-hailing, which is characterized by perilous unprofitability.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch’s Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/">explains</a> for Extra Crunch, “adjusted EBITDA” is a way of calculating profit before interest, taxes, depreciation and other costs. Consider, for example, that Uber lost $6.77 billion in 2020 (admittedly an improvement from its previous yearly loss of $8.51 billion). But under adjusted EBIDTA accounting, those numbers dropped to losses of $2.73 billion and $2.53 billion, respectively.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rlDVaX48i2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/">Will ride-hailing profits ever come?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will ride-hailing profits ever come?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/will-ride-hailing-profits-ever-come/embed/#?secret=rlDVaX48i2" data-secret="rlDVaX48i2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Uber did not provide a full picture of its financials for the third quarter in its recent 8-K filing &#8212; that will come when the company reports its performance after the conclusion of Q3. However, it looks like the company may reach positive adjusted EBITDA by the fourth quarter, meeting a long-held promise to investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ride-hailing giant further noted that its fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is projected to land between $0 and $100 million, compared to the previously anticipated, and more generic, expectation of merely “adjusted EBITDA profitability.” Uber cautioned that &#8220;significant forecasting uncertainty&#8221; may cause it to provide an updated forecast.</p>
<p>Still, for Uber the long march to adjusted profitability appears to finally be in sight. All it took was a global pandemic, layoffs and far-higher prices for the achievement to be managed.</p>

In honor of that fact, entries from The Exchange concerning NFT volume viz recent marketplace valuations and how an accelerating pace of change helps startups by exposing more market voids will have to wait.</p>
<p>But we do have time this morning for a little incredulity, so let&#8217;s indulge.</p>

<p>CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/klarna-ceo-market-volatility-has-me-nervous-about-an-ipo.html">reported</a> today that <a href="https://twitter.com/klarnaseb">Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski</a> is not enthused about present-day market conditions, and thus isn&#8217;t in a hurry to take his company public.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some merit to the idea; after all, Klarna has shown a strong ability to raise huge sums of capital while private.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Why not just keep at it? In short, because the company has to either go public or sell itself to a larger company at some point. Given that we&#8217;ve already seen PayPal and Square cut checks to buy BNPL volume, the list of potential acquirers for Klarna is not as long as you might think. The company, flush with billions in private-market funding, will need to go public. It&#8217;s a simple question of <em>when. </em></p>
<p>Which makes the following all the more surprising. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/klarna-ceo-market-volatility-has-me-nervous-about-an-ipo.html">Via CNBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The volatility in the market right now makes me nervous to IPO to be honest,” Siemiatkowski told CNBC’s Karen Tso at the London Tech Week conference on Monday. “I think it would be nice to IPO when it’s a little bit more sound. And right now it doesn’t feel really sound out there.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh. Color us confused.</p>
<p>The public market for BNPL companies actually feels pretty damn strong at the moment.</p>
<p>Affirm, for example, is a BNPL company publicly listed in the United States. In Q2 2021 (Q4 fiscal 2021 for the company), <a href="https://investors.affirm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/affirm-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2021-results">Affirm reported</a> gross merchandise volume of $2.5 billion and revenues of $261.8 million. Those figures were up 106% and 71%, respectively. Affirm also posted a net loss of $128.2 million in the quarter and $430.9 million in red ink during its most recent fiscal year (the 12 months ending June 30, 2021).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tumblr is entering <a href="https://postplus.tumblr.com/post/662944143853715456/its-for-tumblr-you-its-from-tumblr-us-its">open beta</a> for its subscription product Post+, meaning that all U.S. users can now try out the monetization feature. The product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">launched in closed beta</a> in July, allowing users hand-picked by Tumblr to place some of their content behind a monthly paywall. This marked the first time that Tumblr allowed bloggers to monetize their content directly on the platform, but the feature was met with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/">backlash from users</a> who worried about how the feature would change the site&#8217;s culture.</p>
<p>Now, Tumblr has responded to user feedback by removing the blue Post+ badge that appeared next to the names of users who enabled the feature. Tumblr differentiates itself from other sites by not revealing users&#8217; follower and following counts, so users were concerned that this distinction, which looked like a Twitter verification badge, contradicted that key aspect of Tumblr culture. Tumblr is also adding a $1.99/month price point in open beta &#8212; before, subscriber-only content could be priced at $3.99, $5.99 and $9.99. Tumblr will only take 5% of creator profits &#8212; comparatively, Patreon takes <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing">between 5% and 12%</a> depending on the tier. Payments will be processed through Stripe.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trouble in fandom paradise: Tumblr users lash out against its beta subscription feature&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/embed/#?secret=Wbg5LHr1xy" data-secret="Wbg5LHr1xy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, Tumblr users were dismayed by the way Post+ was rolled out. Many bloggers were concerned that in the closed beta, Post+ users didn&#8217;t have the ability to block paying subscribers without first contacting support &#8212; this could potentially expose users to harassment without the tools to manage it. Tumblr corrected that mistake in the open beta, so now, users can block subscribers themselves. Creators can also put existing content behind the Post+ paywall.</p>
<p>Some users upset with the Post+ rollout <a href="https://postplus-protest.tumblr.com/post/657433316725833728/post-plus-is-coming-whether-you-want-it-or-not">staged a protest</a>, which &#8212; with over 98,000 notes &#8212; is the first thing that shows up when you <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/post+plus?sort=top">search</a> &#8220;post plus&#8221; on Tumblr. Many people on Tumblr have amassed followings by posting iterative fan content, like fanfiction. Tumblr cited fanfiction as an example of the kind of content that creators can put behind a paywall, but users remain concerned that they will be subject to legal action if they were to do so. Archive of Our Own, a major fanfiction site, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18072622/fanfic-ao3-free-speech-censorship-fandom">prohibits its users</a> from linking to sites like Patreon or Ko-Fi, since some intellectual property rights holders can be litigious about the monetization of fanfiction. While it&#8217;s considered fair use to make fan content, profiting from it can be considered a violation of copyright.</p>
<p>When Tumblr<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/tumblrs-back-in-the-app-store-following-porn-ban-announcement/"> banned pornographic content</a> in 2018, monthly page views <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/">decreased by 29%</a> &#8212; to date, the blogging platform hasn&#8217;t regained that traffic. After being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/verizon-is-selling-tumblr-to-wordpress-parent-automattic/">sold to Automattic</a> in 2019, Tumblr has committed to capturing the attention of Gen Z audiences, who the platform says make up about 48% of its users. Tumblr says it&#8217;s catering Post+ to serve Gen Z audiences, but the results of the open beta will begin to reveal whether or not this is what users on the platform want.</p>

<p>The round was co-led by L Catterton, a joint venture between LVMH and Catterton, Entrée Capital and Pico Venture Partners. Additional investors also joined, including Saga VC, as well as leading artists, art collectors, museums, gallerists and trustees at institutions such as MOMA and Guggenheim as well as Shalom McKenzie, an online gambling entrepreneur and investor who also invests in NFTs. Prior to the Series A round, Niio had raised $8 million, initially from strategic angels, followed by a seed round from institutions in 2017.</p>
<p>Niio will use its capital to grow its artist community and scale its app-enabled subscription and purchase platform, which is blockchain<span lang="EN-US">&#8211;</span>based and will include a trading-enabled marketplace for NFTs and other digital art assets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Digital art has become an accepted, mainstream medium with the market accelerating largely due to the explosive growth of NFTs,&#8221; <span lang="EN-US">said </span>Niio CEO and co-founder Rob Anders. &#8220;The transformation <span lang="EN-US">people</span> are experiencing is the most significant and consequential moment for culture in decades, making new kinds of art accessible and experienced on screens in ways like never before.&#8221;</p>

<p>By providing Niio’s tools to a global community of 6,000 galleries, institutions and artists, Niio’s platform and blockchain enables artists to distribute, manage, monetize and preserve their work.</p>

<p>Niio claims it will be free for all artists, forever, to respect and support the creative community and artists’ ability for publishing, managing and protecting their life’s work.</p>
<p>“We have realized our vision for a platform that first and foremost empowers artists and enables their work to be experienced digitally and available globally. We are gratified by the trust that more than 6,000 artists have placed in us &#8212; as we enable them to publish, manage protect and monetize their life’s work,” Niio<span lang="EN-US"> co-founder</span> Oren Moshe said.</p>
<p>Approximately 10,000 global business customers have been using the Niio platform for the past two to three years<span lang="EN-US">, Anders said</span>. Clients range from art professionals, including galleries, museums, studios and art schools, to luxury brands, hotel chains and real estate developers, who subscribe and display curated art streams from the 15,000 premium works available on the platform, to millions of people across public spaces and places in over 30 countries, Anders<span lang="EN-US"> said</span>.</p>
<p>“There are over 1 billion smart TVs in the market and our partner Samsung has 30-40% of the market contributing to our ability to offer a ‘last mile’ proposition,” Anders said.</p>
<p>The digital art market <span lang="EN-US">is projected to be approximately</span> $50 – $100 billion by 2025, according to Anders.</p>
<p>“Digital art has long been on our radar at L Catterton. We are very bullish on its future, and our ongoing evaluation of the sector brought us to Niio,” said Michael Farello, managing partner at L Catterton’s Growth Fund. “We are convinced that their platform approach including both subscription and an NFT offering combined with the reputation they have built in the critical artist community and the validation from their partnership with Samsung – will make them a market leader.”</p>
