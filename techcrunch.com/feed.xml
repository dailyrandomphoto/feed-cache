										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s not discuss the Mustang Mach-E&#8217;s name. Not the Mach-E portion, the other part. The lineage of the pony car slapped onto an electric SUV. Those arguments are over. People have picked sides. The question of whether or not the Mach-E is a Mustang is irrelevant. A far more pressing query is upon us: Is the Mach-E GT worthy of the GT badge?</p>
<p>Without reservation, both the Mach-E GT (Starting at $59,900) and Mach-E GT Performance Edition (starting at $64,900) are worthy of Ford&#8217;s Grand Touring badging. This is accomplished thanks to significant power boosts on both trim levels versus the regular Mach-E, a new track mode, and in the case of the Performance Edition, an upgraded suspension system.</p>
<h2>Unbridled</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2215872" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215872" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2215872 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg" alt="Ford Mustang Mach E GT back end" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/101021_macheGT-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2215872" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roberto Baldwin</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215864" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The base-level Mach-E is already quick thanks to its EV powertrain. For the GT and GT Performance Edition, the acceleration and throttle response have been increased to deliver impressive bursts of speed. The GT ships with 480 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque and hits 60 miles-per-hour from a dead stop in 3.8 seconds. To increase speed, Ford upgraded the front motor and while the battery pack is the same at 88-kWh, the wiring and tuning of the pack has been enhanced.</p>
<p>For those with larger budgets and a desire to hit 60 even quicker, the GT Performance Edition sports 480 horsepower and 634 pound-feet of torque for a zero to 60 run of 3.5 seconds. Like the GT it&#8217;s also received a battery wiring and tuning upgrade and an enhanced front motor.</p>
<p>Both vehicles ship with all-wheel-drive (AWD) standard which helps deliver all the EV torque to the road but that power isn&#8217;t as well maintained as it should be. During multiple launches, the front wheels of both vehicles slipped either right at launch or before hitting 30 miles per hour. I also experienced momentary torque steer on the GT Performance Edition when I stomped on the accelerator from a dead stop.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Those tiny peel-outs are expected on the GT. It&#8217;s rolling with the same multi-link suspension found in the regular Mach-E. The GT Performance Edition though is the first Ford EV to be outfitted with a MagneRide suspension system. While it&#8217;s great at reducing body roll in the corners, it seems to need a bit more tweaking to keep the back end from diving during take-offs to reduce wheel slippage in the front.</span>Driving both vehicles on the same day, I was able to see the benefits of MagneRide both on the freeway and during spirited backroad driving. While the GT offered up suitable handling around corners, it displayed far more body roll than the more expensive GT Performance Edition. This was especially noticeable in hairpin turns where the Performance Edition held its own while I found the GT diving to the outside.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking of cornering, while both vehicles are AWD, they both displayed slight understeer which isn&#8217;t much of a surprise. On the second day of driving though, Ford placed me on an autocross track with the GT Performance Edition, and with traction control turned off, the vehicle felt more neutral around corners and did lend itself to some slight oversteer when pushed.</p>
<h2>BlueCruise</h2>
<p>While driving the GT, I had my first encounter with Ford&#8217;s hands-free driver assistance system, BlueCruise. Like Super Cruise from GM, the Level 2 system allows the driver to remove their hands from the wheel under certain circumstances. Like Super CCruise, the system is geofenced to pre-mapped divided highways and uses a driver monitoring system to make sure the person behind the wheel is paying attention to the road. Ford says that BlueCruise is available on both vehicles as part of the optional $1,900 Ford Co-Pilot360 Active 2.0 Package.</p>
<p>During my tests, I found the system to be slightly less robust than GM&#8217;s offering with a bit more ping-ponging of the vehicle in the lane after tight corners. In one instance, I took over the steering duties when I felt the vehicle hadn&#8217;t turned sharp enough and felt that it would glide into the next lane. On a majority of corners and when traveling in a straight line, it handled changing traffic conditions and cut-ins proficiently. If I spent too much time looking at the infotainment screen rather than the road ahead I was appropriately scolded by the system.</p>
<p>I do wish the audible warnings were a bit louder and that Ford added a light bar or warning lights to the vehicle&#8217;s steering wheel in addition to the dash cluster to warn when I need to pay attention or when BlueCruise&#8217;s hands-free feature was about to disengage. BMW, GM and Mercedes use on-wheel indicators; it&#8217;s a shame that Ford has decided not to follow their leads.</p>
<h2>Interior: same, yet different</h2>
<p>While the interior is the same at the regular Mach-E, the materials have received an upgrade with new seats. In the GT, sport-style seats add a bit more side bolstering to keep drivers in their seats while cornering. The new seats are comfortable without being overbearingly sporting.</p>
<p>The seats in the GT Performance Edition are another issue. The Performance seats have an additional element at the shoulder line that was uncomfortable no matter how I situated my six-foot three-inch frame. Shorter drivers might be fine with it, but I couldn&#8217;t get comfortable and was happy when I switched over the GT.</p>
<p>Like the regular Mach-E, the two GTs are home to Ford&#8217;s 15.5-inch portrait display with Sync 4A. The infotainment system displayed only a slight bit of latency and its large surface area reminds you that this is the future of vehicles. Most features were only a few taps away and the large volume knob near the bottom of the display is still one of my favorite features on the vehicle.</p>
<p>Climate controls are handled by the infotainment system, which I&#8217;m not a fan of, but adjusting the temperature was relatively painless since the controls are always available at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>The rear seats in both vehicles are still comfortable even for taller adults and along with a cavernous frunk, the Mach-E&#8217;s 29.7 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats is enough to haul four to five pieces of medium-sized luggage.</p>
<h2>Battery and range</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2215871" style="width: 1956px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215871" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2215871 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg" alt="ford mustang mach e gt-baldwin" width="1946" height="928" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg 1946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=300,143 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=768,366 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=680,324 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=1536,732 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ford-mustange-mach-e-gt-baldwin.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1946px) 100vw, 1946px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2215871" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roberto Baldwin</p></div></p>
<p>All that fun GT does come at a price beyond the rather steep cost differential over the $42,895 base model Mach-E.</p>
<p>For all the extra power, you lose range. The extended range Mach-E (starting at $50,775) has 306 miles of range. The Mach-E GT tops out at 270 miles, while the GT Performance Edition needs to be hooked up to the power grid after 260 miles.</p>
<p>Fortunately, both support charging at up to 150-kW at DC fast-charging stations, better yet, they feature plug and charge which means if you have an account set up with a charging station like electrify America, you just plug in the vehicle and it starts transferring that sweet electricity to the vehicle&#8217;s battery without using an app or credit card. It just recognizes the vehicle.</p>
<h2>Which to get</h2>
<p>The Mach-E GT Performace Edition makes a compelling case for dropping an extra $5,000 for slightly more power but better suspension. The reality is, most of these will never see a track or use Ford&#8217;s Mach-E track mode Unbrilded Extend feature. It&#8217;s more likely that these will be daily drivers that see more traffic than track time. If that&#8217;s the case, the $1,900 driver assistance package with hands-free BlueCruise is likely money better spent.</p>
<p>Either choice someone makes, they&#8217;ll get a driving experience from an EV that we might not agree is a Mustang, but we can definitely concede that it&#8217;s deserving of the GT badge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the latest sign that that the tech industry is pivoting towards climate and sustainability, Atlantic Food Labs &#8211; an offshoot of the <a href="https://atlanticlabs.de/">Berlin fund Atlantic Labs</a> headed by long-time tech investor Christophe F. Maire &#8211; is relaunching as <a href="https://www.foodlabs.com/">FoodLabs</a>, with a dedicated €100m FoodTech fund to invest in food, health, and sustainability startups.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Atlantic Food Labs has been an investor in startups such as Infarm.com, SanityGroup.com, Formo.bio, Mushlabs.com, Mitte.co, Choco.com, Stenon.io and Gorillas.io. With the new fund, FoodLabs is doubling down on the sector.</p>
<p>Focusing on Intellectual Property and “scalable digital business models toward a more efficient and sustainable food industry from earth to earth, from agriculture, production, distribution, human health to zero waste.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Maire said: “The food industry is the largest industry in the world, and it accounts for more than a quarter of greenhouse emissions globally. Transforming how we produce and consume food toward more efficiency and sustainability, has a major impact on the planet and people. We strongly believe that technology and entrepreneurship hold the key to tackling the key challenges of our time. With the Food Fund we will back the most ambitious founders building outlier companies that pave the way for healthier nutrition, sustainable agriculture, better access to food.”<br />
 <br />
In a call with me, he said: “I started the food labs five years ago because simply I felt the food industry is one of the most relevant industries for human health but one of the most irrelevant industries to the climate. I believe that entrepreneurs can help us solve some of the key issues of our time. We started, relatively small, so we invested around $15 million, but along the way, I discovered that the potential is much bigger than I ever imagined. So now we setting up this 100 million. Euro fund. I have a great team and all the people who are really into the mission. And I think this is the best thing I&#8217;ve ever done in my career. It&#8217;s a fantastic space and it&#8217;s very fascinating.”</p>
<p>The first companies across of the new fund include:</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.foodji.com/">Foodji</a> (D), a digital solution for fresh and healthy food to go</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.tryhabitual.com/">Habitual</a> (UK), a digital health startup providing digital diabetes reversal direct to consumers</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.kitch.io/">Kitch</a> (P) offering a Software for delivery services</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.klim.eco/">Klim</a> (D) with the mission to make agriculture more sustainable through carbon farming</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://getvoila.com/">getVoila</a> (D), bringing fine dining from Europe’s best restaurants to everyone’s living room.</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://microharvest.com/">Microharvest</a> (D)  Providing access to sustainably produced nutrients and proteins.</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.hellomyota.com/">Myota</a> (CH)</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://de.yababa.com/">Yababa</a> (D) a fast-delivery company for oriental food</p>
<p>●      <a href="https://www.theplate.org/">The Plate</a>, a culinary creator platform</p>
<p>●       <a href="https://airfarm.io/en">Airfarm</a> (D) an AgriTech company providing a digital platform for farmers.</p>
<p>It’s also announcing the launch of its Entrepreneur in Residence program for scientists.</p>
<p>Maire added: “We strongly believe that Europe will become the epicenter of FoodTech &amp; AgTech innovation. Europe has always been strong with scientific research and engineering expertise, but lagging behind with a support system for entrepreneurship. Our mission is to build an international platform for innovation and sustainability in the food industry, bringing together entrepreneurship, scientific know-how from universities and research institutions, as well as major industry players.” <br />
 <br />
Patrick Huber, General Partner at FoodLabs said: “Over the last years we have been impressed by the scientists who joined us to build exceptional companies. We strongly believe that the collaboration of scientists and entrepreneurs will be key to bring radical innovation to the food value chain.”</p>
<p>Maire told me: “We start with agriculture and agriculture methods that will capture more carbon. So we have, for instance, a company that&#8217;s focusing on permaculture, which I think is much bigger than people imagine. We also look at aquaculture, new proteins, new methods of production, new methods of distribution. Quick commerce, local sourcing, new consumer behavior. So, food and health, because what&#8217;s fascinating about this space is that it&#8217;s not just a push on the side of the entrepreneur, it&#8217;s very much a pull up from the consumer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The former UK minster of state for what is now the digital and culture department, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport">DCMS</a>, has warned of the looming battle in parliament over the exact shape of incoming online safety legislation.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Ed Vaizey &#8212; a former Conservative Party MP, now Lord Vaizey of Didcot, who was head of the culture, comms and creative industries department, as it was then, between 2010 and 2016 &#8212; predicted a huge tug-of-war to influence the scope of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">Online Safety Bill</a>, warning that parliamentarians everywhere will try to hang their own &#8220;hobby horse&#8221; on it.</p>
<p>The risk of over regulation or creating a disproportionate burden for startups vs tech giants is also real, Vaizey suggested, setting out several areas that he said would require a cautious approach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215309" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wTf9uvXCxe"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">UK publishes draft Online Safety Bill</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK publishes draft Online Safety Bill&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/embed/#?secret=wTf9uvXCxe" data-secret="wTf9uvXCxe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In theory it&#8217;s just going to be the big platforms that will be regulated,&#8221; he said of the scope of the Internet Safety Bill, which was published in draft form <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">back in May</a> &#8212; and which critics are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57569336">warning will be catastrophic for free speech</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some platforms that should be regulated could potentially not be be regulated. But you&#8217;re right that people are concerned that, in effect, there&#8217;s a paradox &#8212; that it could help the Facebooks of this world because the regulatory hurdles that get going might be too big. And if anyone is capable of being regulated it&#8217;s Facebook, as opposed to a startup. So I think that&#8217;s something we have to be very careful of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, although I support the principle of legal but harmful content being regulated I have no doubt at all that that is going to be the big battle in parliament. The balance between legal but harmful free speech is going to be a huge battleground. And it will be interesting to see in what form it survives.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;And thirdly &#8212; I think, paradoxically &#8212; everyone is going to try and hang their own particular hobby horse on this piece of legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p>With sweeping goals for the Online Safety (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">neé Harms</a>) Bill from the get-go &#8212; the government is proposing to make online platforms tackle not just illegal but harmful content, which could mean everything from terrorist propaganda and child sexual abuse material to racism, bullying, pro-suicide and pro-eating disorder content to anti-vaxxer views &#8212; the draft legislation has attracted plenty of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">concern</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/uk-quietly-ditches-porn-age-checks-in-favor-of-wider-online-harms-rules/">controversy</a> already, and the formal parliamentary debate hasn&#8217;t even started yet.</p>
<p>The &#8216;hobby horse&#8217; risk could mean a vast encrusting of an already wide-ranging proposal for Internet regulation, with MPs trying to barnacle on all sorts of issues and grievances that can be loosely attached to the digital sphere. But it will be UK tech businesses saddled with risk and regulatory red tape at the end of the process, while fundamental British values like freedom of expression could be caught and crushed in the middle.</p>
<p>Signs of MPs&#8217; appetite to shoehorn random pet peeves into what some have dubbed a &#8220;<a href="https://alecmuffett.com/article/14984">kitchen sink bill</a>&#8221; are plain to see.</p>
<p>Just last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/labour4decrim/status/1446514017917444113/photo/1">concerns</a> were raised that anti-sex work campaigners intend to target the bill to include clauses against &#8220;online pimping&#8221;, for example. So a &#8220;battleground&#8221; sounds like a polite way to characterize the looming cacophony of arguments in parliament over what does and doesn&#8217;t get stuffed into this Great British Internet rulebook&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; Neil Brown (@neil_neilzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/neil_neilzone/status/1446346680257990658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Vaizey gave the example of online scams as one likely target for amendments to further extend the scope of the Online Safety Bill. Although provisions to target ad scams are probably one of the less controversial additions that could come.</p>
<p>&#8220;I obviously do not support online scams but it&#8217;s pretty obvious that people will try to put amendments down to make sure that certain things are caught which are not currently in the scope of the bill. And one has to be careful it doesn&#8217;t get weighed down with too many, too much regulation &#8212; so there are all sorts of weird contradictions,&#8221; he warned. &#8220;It could be gutted, it could be fattened up, depending on who prevails in parliament.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he also generally welcomed the plan &#8212; saying the government deserves praise for drafting what he described as a &#8220;pioneering&#8221; bill and arguing that Internet regulation is &#8220;long overdue&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is a pioneering piece of legislation. People will criticize this legislation, of course. My view is you can&#8217;t let the best be the enemy of the good. It is not &#8212; by no means &#8212; going to be perfect when it arrives in parliament. And it will probably not be perfect when it emerges out of parliament. And as it&#8217;s implemented by Ofcom in the next few years there will be areas of mistakes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I think that tech regulation of this kind is long overdue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very important countries like Canada and Australia, and indeed the European Union and the US are looking at this and they will look to the UK example and take lessons from it.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Ofcom chair role</h2>
<p>The former minister of state has recently been in the running for a key vacancy atop Ofcom, the UK telecoms and media regulator which is itself in the process of being fattened up for an expanded role overseeing Internet content and social media giants.</p>
<p>The government has said it wants to give Ofcom <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">powers to levy fines of up to 10%</a> of a company’s annual global turnover (or £18M, whichever is higher) if they fail to live up to the bill&#8217;s requirements to protect users from illegal or harmful content.</p>
<p>So the regulator is set to have major powers to influence tech giants&#8217; approach to content moderation and online freedom of expression in the coming years.</p>
<p>Vaizey was interviewed for the role of chair of Ofcom and shortlisted by an independent panel. However, earlier this year, the then secretary of state for digital, Olivier Dowden, chose to rerun the competition &#8212; rather than pick a candidate from the whittled down shortlist.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-57265431">Reports </a>have suggested the government was unhappy that the independent panel rejected its preferred candidate, ex-<em>Daily Mail</em> editor Paul Dacre &#8212; and that it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/aug/31/ministers-struggle-to-find-people-to-interview-paul-dacre-for-ofcom-job">still trying to find a way to parachute</a> the divisive former newspaper editor into the top job overseeing social media platforms&#8217; compliance with legally binding content rules.</p>
<p>Vaizey sidestepped these rumors when asked if he&#8217;s still in the running for the Ofcom job &#8212; suggesting the government decided to rerun the competition because of a lack of applicants in the first round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly the government felt it needed a more competitive field. So it may be that I only got an interview because so few people applied,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;But I really enjoyed the interview and I would love to chairman of Ofcom so I&#8217;ll see when they reopen the process whether there&#8217;s an opportunity for me to apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ofcom is at a point where it&#8217;s proven itself as a telecoms regulator, and I think to a certain extent as a media regulator. But it is entering uncharted and very exciting territory in terms of Internet regulation,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Asked what his priorities would be, were he to get the dream job chairing Ofcom, Vaizey said Internet safety would top his list &#8212; on account of how challenging overseeing the digital realm will be.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is going to be the biggest challenge for Ofcom; how do you absorb such an enormous role? And also how you communicate to the public or the stakeholders that this will be a work in progress?,&#8221; he said, predicting: &#8220;It will not emerge fully formed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Were he to give a &#8220;light critique&#8221; of Ofcom, Vaizey said it would be that the regulator needs to dial up its &#8216;pro-business&#8217; flank.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can also be pro-consumer by being pro-business,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;And I think in a highly competitive area&#8230; the job of the regulator is not only to regulate but also to know when not to regulate and to step back and let businesses navigate a very complex and competitive environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;So if I was to bring any kind of &#8216;Vaizey-esque&#8217; approach to Ofcom it would be to make sure that businesses felt they had a regulator that wasn&#8217;t too much on their case, and was as much a partner as much as a regulator.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Data adequacy</h2>
<p>TechCrunch also asked the former minister of state for his views on the government&#8217;s appetite to &#8216;reform&#8217; data protection rules.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">Last month</a> the government announced a consultation on a data reform, suggesting that &#8216;simplified&#8217; rules in this area would be better for business.</p>
<p>Currently, UK privacy rules are based on the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) &#8212; which is considered the &#8216;gold standard&#8217; for protecting people&#8217;s digital information globally. But the UK government&#8217;s policy push appears to favor reducing this current high level of protection for UK citizens&#8217; information &#8212; without presenting a coherent economic case for why lower domestic privacy standards will be an advantage for digital businesses.</p>
<p>The government has made the simplistic claim that easier access to data will somehow stoke &#8216;innovation&#8217;. However UK startups wanting to access the European market &#8212; or indeed US companies subject to rules like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-officially-takes-effect-today/">California&#8217;s CCPA</a> &#8212; will continue to need to comply with robust privacy regulations elsewhere.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK dials up the spin on data reform, claiming &#8216;simplified&#8217; rules will drive &#8216;responsible&#8217; data sharing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/embed/#?secret=dYCdoTe2Wo" data-secret="dYCdoTe2Wo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On data reform, Vaziey suggested there could be room to make the practical implementation of UK data protection rules less &#8220;onerous&#8221; for UK businesses and organizations without undermining key principles of privacy and protection for personal data.</p>
<p>But on those principles he warned that the UK staying aligned with European Union standards will be vital for the digital economy &#8212; saying it would be &#8220;disastrous&#8221; were the UK to lose the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/uk-gets-data-flows-deal-from-eu-for-now/">data adequacy agreement with the EU</a> that allows for continued free flows of data from Europe to the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UK was very influential in how data protection legislation was drawn up when we were members of the EU so I think it&#8217;s slightly odd that we should shy away from that legislation,&#8221; Vaizey also told us.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very EU defining thing &#8212; and so I think the biggest watchword for the government when they look at reforming data protection legislation is obviously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">what&#8217;s gone on with the US</a> [which has had two data transfer agreements with the European Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">struck down</a> by Europe&#8217;s top court].</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not want a position where you make yourself vulnerable to attacks by the EU to say that your data protection regime is not adequate and we can&#8217;t therefore have cross-border exchanges of data &#8212; that would be disastrous. So whether we like it or not we will have to keep to a certain extent in lock-step with the European Union.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oTH2qrGf6Y"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/embed/#?secret=oTH2qrGf6Y" data-secret="oTH2qrGf6Y" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I also think it&#8217;s the case that the European Union legislation&#8230; has become the gold standard of data protection,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If you look at California adopting data privacy legislation it is based on European legislation and most tech companies will comply with that as their default standard because it just makes their life a hell of a lot easier when they&#8217;re trading globally.&#8221;</p>
<h2>UK must stay open to tech skills</h2>
<p>Vaizey has just taken up a new appointment as patron of the digital skills-focused UK industry association <a href="https://www.theitp.org">ITP</a>, aka the Institute of Telecommunications Professionals.</p>
<p>Discussing the skills challenges facing the country he said there is no room for complacency &#8212; given rising global demand and increasingly fierce competition for tech talent around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are doing really well and we continue to do very well but as with any area you cannot afford complacency and all the tools are there with the right resources to really push forward,&#8221; he said, discussing the government&#8217;s approach to skills &#8212; which now includes a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/uk-announces-a-national-strategy-to-level-up-ai/">ten-year strategy to boost domestic AI capability</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;One looks at what [president] <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">Macron has done in France</a> and I think it&#8217;s fair to say that he took France from a standing start&#8230; He&#8217;s done a tremendous job of raising the profile of France as a tech-friendly nation. So I think we can&#8217;t afford to be complacent. We&#8217;ve got a lot going for us but we can move up another gear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vaizey also queried whether the government will take what he said must be a necessarily &#8220;open&#8221; approach to immigration to ensure UK startups are able to thrive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only does every country in the world have this problem but every startup in any European country is competing for talent, and any startup in the US is competing for talent,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to see that with <a href="https://technation.io/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI74_l3PbB8wIVRvhRCh0tUATWEAAYASAAEgJaLPD_BwE">Tech Nation</a> and so on there are more entrepreneur visas available but I think the government has to be very open to the fact that to get people over with the right tech skills to support startups has to be an absolute priority. And they have to be flexible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because when we had free movement [as part of the EU] one of the great advantages of free movement is that you could take a job and you knew that your partner would also be able to get a job in the UK as well. So that&#8217;s something that they really need to lean into.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://mono.co/">Mono</a>, an African startup that helps connect consumers’ bank accounts to financial applications, has raised a $15 million Series A round, the company confirmed to TechCrunch today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round, led by Tiger Global &#8212; the VC firm’s third major investment in Africa this year after <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/amp/">Flutterwave</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/amp/">FairMoney</a> &#8212; also had participation from new investors Target Global (an investor in neobank Kuda), General Catalyst, and SBI Investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors were joined by existing ones including Entree Capital, Lateral Capital, GPIC, Acuity VC, and Ingressive Capital, bringing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono’s total raise to a little over $17 million since launching last year.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215852" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half of the population is</span><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=ZG"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> either unbanked or underbanked.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Open finance players in Africa like Mono &#8212; mirroring Plaid’s success in the U.S. market to theirs &#8212; thrives on the notion that access to a financial ecosystem via open APIs will improve access to financial information and lower entry costs for the underbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the likes of Okra, Plaid, Stitch and OnePipe also streamlining various financial data in single APIs, the battle to provide customers’ financial information to companies and third-party developers is heating up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nicely, hence the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> need to ship more innovative products down the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Mono’s case, two products give it an edge, according to CEO Abdulhamid Hassan. First, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DirectPay, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">product that helps Nigerian businesses to collect bank transfer payments from customers within their web or mobile app without using their debit cards. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hink of what Flutterwave and Paystack have done with cards; Mono wants to do with bank accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statement Pages allows businesses to access customers’ financial accounts without needing a developer; Hassan calls it the first of its kind in Africa.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even with these </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> features tailored to a Nigerian audience, Mono is going after other markets like Ghana and Kenya, first mentioned by the CEO in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono has delivered on only Ghana, for now, piloting with a few banks and fintechs such as Oze and Tranzo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya, on the other hand, is still within its radar as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one out of three countries (including Egypt and South Africa) Mono plans to expand into next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hassan adds that Mono might complete the move to South Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">via a partnership with Absa bank this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When open finance startups in Africa began to gain some attention last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the consensus was that each company could do significant business in the big individual markets they had first launched with. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it doesn’t seem that way anymore </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">as Mono, Stitch, Pngme and Okra now operate in other African markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is capped</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how many businesses we can target,” said Hassan, who co-founded Mono with Prakhar Singh, over a call.</span></p>
<p>By the end of next year, Mono will be present in five African countries, a move that slightly suggests that the company might be spreading itself too thin.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questioned whether investor pressure or competition was fuelling the need for Mono to expand quickly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hassan reckoned that the company made such decisions solely because of its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything that we do at Mono is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> customer-driven. Customers who want to launch lending or fintech apps in these countries say they can’t do so unless Mono is there,” he said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on how we’ve built our relationship and the kind of products we’ve built in Nigeria, people rely on us and say when we go to a country, they would also want to launch there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also a vertical expansion play for the company as it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">looks to offer enterprise solutions to FMCGs, law firms — non-tech and traditional industries with the capability to command more transaction volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking of numbers, Mono claims to have processed over 200 million financial data transactions from over 270 businesses, developers, and fintechs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also said it has connected over 150,000 bank accounts in the last two months and is growing 45x year-on-year in that regard. With around 30 staffers today, Mono doubled its headcount from the previous year, according to its CEO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activity in the global open finance market has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ironically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> buoyed by Visa’s failed takeover target of Plaid. And investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have not slowed down in backing startups in other regions which they feel could be major acquisition targets for the U.S. company if it decides to expand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono is one such candidate in Africa and lead investor Tiger Global knows that. According to Hassan, the VC firm reached out to lead a new round and though Mono didn’t plan to raise any additional capital this year, the capital from Tiger Global would help it grow faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We feel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the team at Tiger felt we were doing something amazing but thought what we had raised wouldn’t help us build a big company. And they were like, ‘we want to help you build a big company,” said Hassan.</span></p>
<p>Tiger Global confirmed it led the investment in an email to TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of Africa’s fastest-growing startups, Mono has closed early-stage rounds in a manner rarely seen on the continent. Last</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> September, the company had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/21/mono-raises-500k/"> completed a $500,000 pre-seed</a> investment with a handful of local investors. Then it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">took part</a> in Y Combinator’s most recent winter batch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/nigerias-mono-raises-millions-to-power-the-internet-economy-in-africa/">raising $2 million in seed funding</a> upon graduation before raising this Series A round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, not everyone measures growth this way. These days, startups burn a lot of money to scale fast but have little or no revenue to show</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And in Africa, side remarks </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are often thrown about on how </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">such models might lead to long-term unprofitability for high-flying startups such as Mono.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked if that was a concern to the company, which has a valuation north of $100 million, Hassan said, “the first thing you look for when you’re building a startup is not profitability but I will say that our revenue has grown ten times since our last raise in May</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mono’s present revenue is equivalent to what it did in the last three months combined, continued the CEO before referencing how the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is pursuing growth, scale and profitability with a lean team to “build the best open banking platform in Africa.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/mobile-gaming-company-voodoo-acquires-beach-bum/">Voodoo acquired Beach Bum</a>, another French mobile gaming company has news to share. <a href="https://www.homagames.com">Homa Games</a> is raising a $50 million Series A round led by Northzone. The company partners with indie game studios and acts as a publisher.</p>
<p>Other investors in today’s funding round include Singular, King, the founders of FuboTV and Daniel Ek’s family office. The company is raising this Series A round just seven months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/hyper-casual-game-publisher-homa-games-raises-15-million/">raising its seed round</a> (led by Headline and Eurazeo).</p>
<p>In particular, back in February 2021, the company said it managed to generate 250 million downloads. That number has now doubled as the startup has now delivered 500 million installs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215601" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Homa Games specializes in hypercasual, casual and board games, a segment of the mobile gaming industry that requires a methodical, technology-driven approach. It has developed its own tech stack that optimizes the performance of each game.</p>
<p>Game developers can build a prototype with Unity and submit it to Homa Games. After that, Homa Games can test the potential of each prototype to find out if it’s worth exploring further.</p>
<p>The startup has developed an all-in-one SDK that helps developers optimize their mobile game through analytics and A/B testing to turn it into a profitable venture. It lets them track and improve the most important metrics of the industry — cost of acquisition, retention and session times. Of couse, this will lead to a better average revenue per user.</p>
<p>Homa Games then takes care of publishing the game on the App Store and Play Store. It relies heavily on advertising to generate revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What’s interesting is that you don’t have to spend months or years to craft the perfect mobile game. With the current state of hypercasual mobile games, game developers focus on one key concept that is going to make you compulsively launch the game again and again. All of Homa Games’ success that ended up in the top 20 of most downloaded games in the App Store and Play Store have been developed in eight days or less.</p>
<p>“Their platform gives any game entrepreneur or independent studio super powers by allowing them to tap into publishing, analytics and marketing tools to compete on an even footing with the giant game studios across the world. Daniel and Oliver don’t just bring a vision but more importantly, a killer execution that is helping them define and build an entirely new category within gaming,” Northzone’s Pär-Jörgen Pärson said in a statement.</p>
<p>So far, the company has released 40 games. But Homa Games is increasing its release pace as 20 games will be released by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>And now, the company is working on a sub-genre of hypercasual games. Homa Games call this the ‘arcade idle’ category. Like in many hypercasual games, it features a texture-less stickman character that you move around the digital world. Like in idle games, players have to gather resources to increase wealth and unlock new levels.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like in Craft Island, Farm Land, and Harvest It:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2215602" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215602" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/60c16e652b27de106efd101d_arcade-idle.gif" alt="" width="600" height="302" class="size-full wp-image-2215602" /><p id="caption-attachment-2215602" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Homa Games</p></div></p>
<p>According to the company’s <a href="https://www.homagames.com/post/arcade-idle">blog post</a>, the company plans to monetize these games through interstitial ads, in-app purchases and subscriptions. Players can also choose to watch an ad to go faster.</p>
<p>I don’t know if we should celebrate this kind of innovation or not, but it’s clear that there’s still a lot of business potential in mobile gaming. And Homa Games seems well-positioned to become an important publisher.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/gogoros-electric-vehicle-technology-will-make-its-china-debut-through-a-deal-with-yadea-and-dcj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing a deal</a> with two of China’s biggest two-wheel vehicle makers, Gogoro officially launched there today, opening 45 battery swapping stations in Hangzhou. The company’s co-founder and chief executive officer Horace Luke told TechCrunch that it targets 80 stations by the end of the year, before expanding into other major cities with its partners, Yadea and Dachangjiang Group (DCJ).</p>
<p>In China, Gogoro’s battery swapping technology will operate under the Huan Huan brand, a partnership between Gogoro, Yadea and DCJ.</p>

<p>Yadea and DCJ are both developing vehicles that run on Gogoro’s battery swapping technology, with Yadea launching two models for sale today, starting in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The companies expect consumer demand to be <a href="https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1903231745/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driven by government regulations</a> for electric two-wheel vehicles that (among other things) require the use of lithium batteries instead of lead-acid. An estimated 270 million vehicles that don’t meet the new regulations will need to be retired by 2025.</p>
<p>Gogoro <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gogoro-will-go-public-on-nasdaq-after-2-35b-spac-deal/">announced last month</a> that it will go public on Nasdaq after a $2.35 billion SPAC deal with Poema Global that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. In addition to its battery swapping network, Gogoro is also known for its own range of high-end two-wheel scooters, but has made deals with other manufacturers to produce vehicles that use its batteries and charging stations, including Yamaha, Suzuki and AeonMotor.</p>
<p>Its partnerships have been an important factor in increasing the accessibility of Gogoro’s technology, and the company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/gogoro-partners-with-indias-hero-motocorp-one-of-the-worlds-largest-two-wheel-vehicle-makers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a deal this year</a> with Hero MotoCorp, the market leader for two-wheeled vehicles in India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’ve always been looked at as ‘Gogoro is too premium, we are out of reach to the people that really matter in major cities,’ and with Yadea and DCJ, everyone is going to be able to ride and buy the vehicles, which won’t be any more expensive than previously-sold mass vehicles,” said Luke.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-testid="paragraph-0">Tesla CEO Elon Musk threw a rager at the new Berlin gigafactory on Saturday – complete with bright lights, techno music, a Ferris wheel, carousel, arcade and vegetarian food trucks – to announce the start of production at the disputed site that&#8217;s faced lawsuits by environmental groups.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">&#8220;We&#8217;re aiming to start production in a few months, basically, November or December, and hopefully deliver our first cars in December,&#8221; said Musk at the event to the applause of thousands of fans. &#8220;But starting production is kind of the easy part. The hard part is reaching volume production.&#8221;</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">Volume production amounts to 5,000 or &#8220;hopefully 10,000&#8221; vehicles per week, said Musk. The factory is expected to manufacture Model Y vehicles, in addition to millions of battery cells. Tesla submitted plans to invest around $5.8 billion in a battery plant with 50 GWh capacity next to the 300-hectare site, and Musk promised volume production of battery cells by the end of the year. <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37594789/vw-battery-tech-new-laboratory/">Volkswagen&#8217;s planned factory in Salzgitter</a> is expected to produce 40 GWh capacity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215839" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="AdSlot__slot___1GI9_W">
<p data-testid="paragraph-0">Construction on the Tesla gigafactory in Berlin-Brandenburg, which was granted two years ago by authorities under an exceptional procedure, is nearly complete, despite opposition from locals who are holding up final approval for the plant due to environmental concerns. Musk&#8217;s over-the-top event looks to be an attempt to win over the natives, an almost cartoonish move reminiscent of<em> Stranger Things</em>&#8216; <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Larry_Kline">Mayor Kline</a> throwing an Independence Day festival to win votes and distract from the Russians he had leased land to in order to open yet another otherworldly portal.</p>

<p data-testid="paragraph-7">Locals filed more than 800 complaints that are being discussed via an online residents&#8217; consultation process, which is due to close on October 14, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/musk-s-plane-takes-off-to-berlin-ahead-of-tesla-plant-party">according to Bloomberg</a>. Only then will environmental authorities make a final decision on approval.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-7">Despite pushback, Tesla has a 95% chance at gaining factory approval, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-brandenburg-factory-becomes-festival-site-giga-fest-2021-10-09/">according to Brandenburg&#8217;s economy minister</a>. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Tesla factory, which is currently hiring widely throughout Europe, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/whats-happening-with-teslas-7-billion-german-gigafactory-2021-06-22/">is in favor</a> with many political parties in the country who see it as a major economic boost for eastern Germany. </span></p>
</div>
<p data-testid="paragraph-4">Musk defended the factory against critics saying it used &#8220;relatively little&#8221; water and that battery production would be &#8220;sustainable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last week, we talked about how YouTube has managed to skate along while Facebook has gotten pummeled over platform responsibility concerns. This week, we&#8217;re looking at another slippery slope Apple is dancing on the edge of.</p>

<h2>the big thing</h2>
<p>After first hitting that sweet trillion dollar valuation, then surpassing two trillion, Apple is likely well aware that it&#8217;s a long road ahead to becoming the first quadrillion dollar company and they&#8217;re going to have to make some controversial choices to get there. Jokes aside, Apple&#8217;s business is actually changing quite a bit as it reaches mega-scale and the company is flirting with growth tactics that could either be seen as bold and aggressive or as a little over the line.</p>
<p>As Apple&#8217;s diversifying business shifts from simply getting consumers to buy new iPhones towards getting them to buy Apple devices while locking them in to subscription software services on said devices, they&#8217;re starting to get a little pushier than they used to be.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-calls-out-apple-for-promoting-its-services-in-the-iphone-settings-screen/">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney called out Apple for putting advertisements in its Settings app for its own services</a>, launching a critique that Apple wasn&#8217;t playing by its own rules. His complaint was probably intended to be more focused on alleging Apple&#8217;s anti-competitiveness but my first takeaway after seeing an advertisement for an Apple Music free trial inside the Settings app, was &#8220;Damn, Apple isn&#8217;t that a little gauche?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For a $2 trillion company, pushing consumers to buy something inside the section of the app they usually go to when they&#8217;re trying to fix something seems like a pretty embarrassing growth hack. Sure, it&#8217;s just one ad slot, one slip up, but the lack of spam and crapware has long been a hallmark of the Apple device ecosystem. Sure, over the years maybe you didn&#8217;t like having their standard calculator or stocks app pre-installed but it wasn&#8217;t anything too troubling, but as Apple starts pushing paid subscription after paid subscription with a varying array of services including Music, News+ tv+, Fitness+, Arcade, iCloud+ and others, one begins to wonder where this all leads.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not new — mine rotates between Arcade and Music daily — triggered by new device purchase that comes with the services <a href="https://t.co/37nS7sarKk">pic.twitter.com/37nS7sarKk</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Rich Greenfield, LightShed (@RichLightShed) <a href="https://twitter.com/RichLightShed/status/1445898886816669700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple is starting to build more complex subscriber products as well that live outside of a single app; its iCloud+ service now blends backups with more sophisticated privacy features in Safari only available to paying customers. Varying levels of Apple One memberships bundle these services together at discounts that can be shared with family members. And sure, to Sweeney&#8217;s point, this is all going to be very frustrating for developers that are trying to compete with a product that has home court advantage in perpetuity, but it also leads to a less welcoming platform for consumers who simply want devices that bring them objectively to the broader web and all its stakeholders and services.</p>
<p>For a blanket disclaimer, I will say that Apple gets criticized so much over seemingly petty things because they generally have done a pretty solid job streamlining positive consumer experiences with their devices, and consumers have also grown accustomed to seeing other companies let these little things snowball into misplaced incentives that slowly erode a product. That&#8217;s why seeing a couple more promotional push notifications than normal or a seemingly misplaced ad or a few too many introductory offers when sparking up a new devices raises some red flags.</p>
<p>Apple turning into a services business is certainly no crime, but it&#8217;s important to realize that doing so likely requires a shift in what their relationship with consumers fundamentally looks like. We&#8217;re only starting to taste some of those changes today, but they may become much more visible down the road.</p>

<h2>other things</h2>
<p><em>I&#8217;m going to play around with this section a bit over the next few weeks, so it&#8217;s fewer cold summaries and more context&#8230; let me know on Twitter if this is your jam or if you prefer more headlines and less bloviating :)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/hacker-leaks-twitch-source-code-and-creator-payout-data/"><strong>Twitch hack spells future trouble for game streaming kingpin</strong></a><br />
Amazon&#8217;s gaming-centric streaming service had a pretty bad week as hackers released a trove of source code and creator payout data. It&#8217;s a pretty huge competitive loss for Twitch and leaves Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming with a spreadsheet of data to poach exclusive streamers to their platform. It&#8217;s also probably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/hacker-leaks-twitch-source-code-and-creator-payout-data/">demoralizing</a> for the streamer base, with streamers now able to clock just how much more some of their competitors are hauling in from paid by the streaming giant.</p>
<p>Twitch&#8217;s outsized lead in the game streamer wars has been slowly shrinking largely as a result of efforts from YouTube and Facebook to attract viewers. Twitch is still the default many early career streamers choose though and YouTube and Facebook are miles behind in this department, their success has largely come from dumping money into paid partner programs to bring popular content creators on board, meaning that the data that just leaked is pretty priceless to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/"><b>Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp&#8217;s god-awful week</b></a><br />
Facebook is having a pretty rough few weeks but this past one was just plain brutal. While the company was waging a PR war on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">whistleblower</a>, the service suffered its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/"> most brutal outage of likely the past decade</a>, taking all of the company&#8217;s global services down and breaking its internal tools in the meantime. Everything was down for several hours, meaning plenty of confusion and frustration, particularly for user that rely on WhatsApp so heavily for their business or social life.</p>
<p>As I wrote last week, Facebook probably doesn&#8217;t deserve to be the only internet media platform getting universally dumped on, but even with so much public anger, I get the feeling that executives at the company can&#8217;t see past the fact that they feel they&#8217;re being treated unfairly and that they aren&#8217;t even trying to self-reflect. Facebook&#8217;s brand is in a pretty sustained state of decay at this point, but the idea that it might be spreading to its subsidiaries like Instagram should be a cause that leadership and shareholders realize is too critical to meaningfully ignore.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/fantasy-equity-nft-game-wants-you-to-spend-real-money-buying-fake-shares-of-real-startups/">Paying real money for fake shares of real startups</a><br />
</b>I can&#8217;t say this is as impactful as the two bits above, but I&#8217;d be remiss not to rehash a saga I covered this week that really feels like it showcases where we&#8217;re at in this bull market. Visionrare, an NFT platform for &#8220;fantasy startup investing&#8221; was born earlier this week and I covered its launch with a good amount of skepticism. It essentially was a pitch to treat venture capital investing like fantasy sports and get people competing to build their own portfolio full of synthetic NFT shares of startups.</p>
<p>Plenty of investors and entrepreneurs chimed in after my launch post and detailed all of the ways it was likely going to get sued, and it seems the founders listened. Less than a day after going into public beta,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/fantasy-startup-investing-nft-platform-visionrare-shuts-down-paid-marketplace-after-a-day-in-open-beta/"> they shut down the marketplace</a>, promising an eventual return return with a free-to-play version. As full of funny money as the NFT market seems (and often is), plenty of top NFT project founders spend an awful long time hashing out mechanics with lawyers ahead of time so that they don&#8217;t get saddled with these hard choices after launch. Speaking of funny money, this <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/art-blocks/mint/13000109/">piece of generative art</a> sold for $6.9 million this week and this <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/cryptoadz/mint/1519/">toad</a> went for 420 ETH ($1.5 million), enjoy your weekend!</p>

<h2>added things</h2>
<p><em>Some of my favorite reads from our newly-renamed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">TechCrunch+</a> subscription service this week:</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/"><b>Global startups raised $158 billion in Q3</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;Since the back half of 2020 kicked off and the venture capital and startup worlds discovered that COVID and its related economic impacts were largely set to miss the upstart technology market, investors have been busy stuffing ever-larger amounts of cash into new companies around the world. The acceleration of capital deployment has generated more unicorns, more mega-rounds and simply more available dollars than ever before in the history of startups&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/getting-the-details-right-in-your-pitch-deck/"><b>Getting the details right in your pitch deck</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;every Disrupt, we host a session we call Pitch Deck Teardown. It’s a convivial workshop where founders in the audience send me their decks, and I walk through a curated set of them live in front of an exceptional VC panel, who critique the deck slide by slide. This year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>, we were joined by Maren Bannon, co-founder and managing partner at <a href="https://www.january.ventures/">January Ventures</a>; Vanessa Larco, partner at <a href="https://www.nea.com/">NEA</a>; and Ben Ling, founder and general partner of <a href="https://www.blingcap.com/">Bling Capital</a>&#8230;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/index-sequoia-and-canvas-investors-weigh-in-on-how-to-raise-your-first-dollars/"><b>Top VCs weigh in on how to raise your first dollars</b></a><br />
&#8220;&#8230;Index Ventures partner Nina Achadijan started out by urging founders to first consider whether they actually really need to raise venture capital. &#8216;It’s a phenomenal time to be an early-stage entrepreneur. There’s more capital than ever before and there’s a willingness to accept technology from consumers and businesses,&#8217; she said. &#8216;And quite frankly, there’s a lot of platform shifts that are very exciting for early-stage entrepreneurs. But the first thing you need to do is ask yourself: Do you really need to raise venture capital? There are so many incredible businesses that can be built that actually don’t need VC funding.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re just weeks away from COP26, the big environmental policy confab where scores of world leaders will descend on Scotland and determine the future of the planet, answering the question, “Should we all die or live?”</p>
<p>That’s meant a whole truckload of new books on the subject, as well as renewed attention to older works that are suddenly back in the limelight again. So following up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/climate-change-summer-2021-book-reviews/">our summer round-up of books broadly on the thesis of climate change</a>, we have a new set of reviews of four more books to explore this intricately fascinating subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I look at Kim Stanley Robinson’s <i>Ministry for the Future</i> with a piece entitled “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/the-dark-side-of-environmentalism/">The dark side of environmentalism</a>.” Robinson offers us a hopeful vision of the future where humans come together to solve the world’s problems, but only after an ecoterrorist group makes the alternatives and status quo less palatable. How do we unpack those values, and what do they portend for our world going forward?</li>
<li>Second, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/on-ten-years-of-the-vertical-farm/">my colleague Brian Heater looks</a> at <i>The Vertical Farm</i> written by Dickson Despommier, which was recently republished as a tenth anniversary edition. Vertical farms are among the more utopian movements emanating out of climate tech — a way to bring agriculture closer to the billions of people living in urban agglomerations. How feasible are they, and will they really work?</li>
<li>Third, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/everything-is-accelerating-in-the-exponential-age/">I interview Azeem Azhar on his new book</a> <i>The Exponential Age</i>, exploring why technologies like semiconductors, gene editing, 3D printing, and more are suddenly coming together to completely reshape our world. The change is only going to accelerate.</li>
<li>Finally, I analyze Amitav Ghosh’s <i>The Great Derangement</i>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/how-culturally-deranged-is-our-climate-today/">a heady and intensely thought-provoking series of lectures</a> bound up in a slim volume that is just exploding with insight. Ghosh sees our culture as completely divergent from the needs of the climate today, and wonders why authors and other creatives seem completely unwilling to address the crisis that is befalling the planet.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buckle up, it’s going to be a wild ride.</p>
<p>The pace of change over the last few decades is only set to accelerate in the coming years, as improvements in biology, medicine, spacecraft, manufacturing, software and more continue to transform the very foundations of society, economics and politics. We cover these innovations pretty much daily at TechCrunch, but we rarely get a chance to step back from the frenetic pace of funding announcements and startup product launches to take a look at what all these changes ultimately add up to.</p>
<p>Thankfully, London-based writer and entrepreneur Azeem Azhar is here to add some direction. He just published <a href="https://diversionbooks.com/books/the-exponential-age/">The Exponential Age: How Accelerating Technology is Transforming Business, Politics and Society</a>, and has been the long-time writer of the <a href="https://www.exponentialview.co">Exponential View</a> newsletter and podcast. I recently hosted Azhar for a live discussion about his book and the meaning of the world on a Twitter Space, discussing everything from genetic engineering to data privacy laws and the relocalization of global economies. Highlights from our hour-long conversation are compiled below.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><i>This interview has been edited and condensed.</i></p>
<p><b>Danny Crichton</b>: How did you get started writing your newsletter, <i>The Exponential View</i>?</p>
<p><b>Azeem Azhar</b>: I started this newsletter six years ago when my company had been acquired. I&#8217;m sure there are many founders on this Twitter Space, and some may have been through the process of being acquired, but it&#8217;s kind of a strange thing, because you find yourself wearing someone else&#8217;s clothes. It&#8217;s familiar, but it&#8217;s not familiar and it&#8217;s not you. So I just started to write a newsletter for a few friends of mine. I&#8217;ve been writing newsletters on the internet since 1996, and so it&#8217;s always my kind of go-to comfort blanket.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2215778" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Expoential-Age.jpg?w=454" alt="" width="454" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Expoential-Age.jpg 1709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Expoential-Age.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Expoential-Age.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Expoential-Age.jpg?resize=768,1150 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Expoential-Age.jpg?resize=454,680 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Expoential-Age.jpg?resize=1025,1536 1025w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Expoential-Age.jpg?resize=1367,2048 1367w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Expoential-Age.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time, there was this strange situation, these kind of magical technologies on one side, and the sense that maybe stuff wasn&#8217;t playing out the way we expected on the other. I think that the newsletter, as many founders I think discover, just got product-market fit for that reason. It took off, and it sort of took over my life. I spent a lot of time reading about technologies and reading about the political and economic theories that kind of surrounded them and surrounded our societies. Eventually, that started to coalesce into a thesis that actually we are in a really special time in history, with a lot of opportunity but also a lot of peril, and that turns into the book, <i>The Exponential Age</i>.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: You talk about the rise of silicon, genomics, batteries, and custom manufacturing, but these are all relatively new technologies in the context of human history. Why is this “exponential age” just starting right now?</p>
<p><b>Azhar</b>: When these technologies start, they&#8217;re expensive, and although they&#8217;re improving at these double-digit rates, they&#8217;re still expensive, and it takes time for them to become cheap enough to become more ubiquitous. Once they start to become ubiquitous for all of the complementary businesses, then you need to make them real for the rest of us living in the economy and in society more broadly.</p>
<p>So while we&#8217;ve had chips since the late 1960s, that moment where billions of us had access to computing really happens only after the the iPhone shipped and smartphones start to take off. This was roughly the same period at which renewable power started to compete with traditional fossil fuels.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s just a phenomenon of compound interest. With exponential technology improvement, things start off quite boring, and you have to build up a few years, sometimes a few decades worth of gains, until that next year&#8217;s increment is really, really meaningful.</p>
<p>The point where I think we can say we&#8217;re entering into the exponential age is somewhere between 2013 and 2016. In 2012, many of the world&#8217;s largest companies were still companies of the previous era, the car companies, the oil companies, the electricity companies, but by 2016, all of the world&#8217;s largest companies were the Tencents and the Apples of this world. In 2012, less than half of humanity had real-time access to supercomputers, in the sense of how many people were carrying smartphones. By 2016, that had reversed.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: We have all these new technologies, but we also have something you dub “the exponential gap” between what technology allows us to do and what society is prepared to handle. Could you talk about that?</p>
<p><b>Azhar</b>: The challenge here of course is that the technology provides all these incredible potentials, and we would really not be anywhere without it. But technology and social norms are closely interconnected to each other.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fine when the rate of change of technology adaptation is sort of within the remit of the rate of change of the adaptation of social institutions like laws or regulatory bodies or just habits around the dinner table. But when the technology has reached this tipping point, which I think it has done in the last few years, and it changes so rapidly, then it&#8217;s a little bit like one of those three-legged races you might have done when you were at kindergarten or junior school and your buddy runs much faster than you and you&#8217;re kind of left behind.</p>
<p>Technologies are adapting and developing incredibly fast, but our institutions — by their design — are meant to change very, very slowly. I mean, if they changed very quickly, they wouldn&#8217;t be institutions, they would be fads, or crazes. And the problem is that, for most of us, our everyday lives are actually governed, whether we like it or not, by those informal customs and habits, and those really formal regulations, institutional rules, and laws.</p>
<p>The challenge here is not so much about the technology, it&#8217;s the exponential gap, which if left unaddressed will start to really erode a sort of pleasant functioning of society.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: You make reference in the book to the French historian Fernand Braudel, who wrote about many things, but showed in some of his work the extraordinary regularity of medieval life. You could live 60-70 years, and pretty much nothing changes socially, culturally, politically, or economically. You were born, you worked on the farm, you continued working on the farm, you sort of retired from the farm, but there&#8217;s absolutely nothing that changes.</p>
<p>In the exponential age, everything changes all the time, and I’m curious how we are supposed to handle the cognitive load of all that?</p>
<p><b>Azhar</b>: The load is is huge.</p>
<p>You know, TechCrunch was partly my clock for what was going on here. Let me give you an example. While writing the book, I mention a Romanian company called UiPath, which does automation software. When I wrote the first draft, UiPath had a valuation of a billion dollars, and it had gotten there really, really quickly. By the time I got the comments on the first draft, which was a few weeks later, UiPath’s valuation had reached $7 billion. By the time I got the final draft into my editor, the valuation was $10 billion, and I&#8217;m having to change this in the text. Then just before the draft went to press, I called the editor and I said, “listen, they&#8217;ve just gone public on the NASDAQ at a $35 billion valuation. And we have to go in and change that number right now.” That really encapsulates the kind of cognitive load that I&#8217;m writing about.</p>

<p>I have to take that burden on myself, but that level of cognitive load is being borne broadly by people because we don&#8217;t have the psychology or the brain geography frankly to deal with these exponential changes. We never had to come across, UiPaths, or Ubers, or DoorDashes that grow incredibly fast. Like Braudel points out, we saw things change very linearly and quite often cyclically and in understandable ways. So we&#8217;re not well adapted to this sort of techno sphere that we&#8217;ve created over the past 30 or 40 years.</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: You’re talking about a lot of exponentially improving technologies, but on the flip side, there are many technologies that one might have thought would improve exponentially and haven’t. I am curious what you think about some of the limits on technology growth and what that means for your thesis?</p>
<p><b>Azhar</b>: I think the question is really about where are there core technologies that lend themselves to this kind of fundamental learning rate and to a kind of composability. That is, they can be combined and integrated with other technologies, which tends to make them much more powerful. The technologies that can become modular and decentralized tend to be ones where learning effects become much more pronounced.</p>
<p>So we wouldn&#8217;t expect hydroelectric dams, for example, to demonstrate that kind of effect, we wouldn&#8217;t expect large-scale aircraft to demonstrate that kind of effect, because of the sort of complexities that get involved there.</p>
<p>I think one question I&#8217;m interested in is what happens when the prices of these fundamental technologies start to drop effectively to zero. I know this is weird for any of us who spent $2,000 on a new MacBook Pro recently, but effectively, compared to where we were when we were born, the price of computing is essentially zero right now. And you can see that it creates all kinds of opportunities around it. Our ability to create energy from renewables, our ability to manipulate the biosphere, whether it&#8217;s through protein engineering, or through gene engineering, and our ability to make stuff through these these technologies of 3D printing. What happens when those costs go to zero?</p>
<p><b>Crichton</b>: One argument that you make in the book is how in the industrial era, there was this sort of globalization, but with the exponential age, we are seeing a sort of “relocalization,” which happens to have been intensified with COVID-19. I’m curious why we’re seeing that movement of productive forces?</p>
<p><b>Azhar</b>: Many of the technologies that we talk about are ones that don&#8217;t rely on enormous supply chains. Wind power and decentralized rooftop solar and virtual, grid-scale batteries made by networking the batteries within electric vehicles, all of those things can be done without shipping hundreds of millions of barrels of oil halfway across the globe.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re starting to see this in places like South Australia, where decentralized solar energy is weaning that state off coal. But you could also look at technologies like high intensity, vertical urban farms such as Bowery Farming, who will essentially chop a field up into a sort of a mini skyscraper that can be put right in the middle of a city or a town and provide food locally, so that you&#8217;re not optimizing your food for supply chain, you&#8217;re just growing it locally and powered by renewable power (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/on-ten-years-of-the-vertical-farm/">see also our review today on <i>The Vertical Farm</i></a>)</p>
<p>Then there’s cellular agriculture, which will deliver artificial meats and also doesn&#8217;t require fields of cows and can become highly localized. 3D printing gives us the same thing — we don&#8217;t need a factory miles away, you could just start to build things. All of that creates this potential for doing things more locally and relying less on on global supply chains.</p>
<p>That is one of the impetuses towards the local, but the second impetus is that there is recognition of a competition in the digital space between nations. Since I&#8217;ve written the book, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), has taken strong steps to control that country&#8217;s internet industry, and I think also, interestingly, introduced new data privacy laws that are much more stringent than even the GDPR in Europe. One of the key lenses behind China&#8217;s data privacy laws is one about technological sovereignty.</p>
<p>So I think there are twin forces of technologies that enable production and consumption in the local that don&#8217;t rely so much on global supply chains, together with this move towards technological sovereignty. Together, they start to unwind some of the logic that policymakers have felt towards globalization and start to create a logic to do things more locally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><i>The Ministry for the Future</i> by Kim Stanley Robinson isn’t a book that lauds ecoterrorists. In fact, it mostly manages to avoid the subject across its many pages. Yet, at the center of its speculative account about the eponymous ministry and its leadership over the next few decades, the dark side is the linchpin for transitioning Earth to its peaceful, sustainable future.</p>
<p>It’s a strange setup for a plot-driven novel, in which the actual plot — the sabotage to airplanes, the sinking of cargo ships — is mentioned casually as news commentary, sometimes in conversations between characters. The so-called Children of Kali group, seen in a handful of quick asides and vicariously through rumors, uses the darker methods of violence to force the plutocratic capitalist class to finally capitulate toward a net-zero carbon world.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2214100" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ministry-for-the-Future.jpg?w=323" alt="" width="323" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ministry-for-the-Future.jpg 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ministry-for-the-Future.jpg?resize=97,150 97w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ministry-for-the-Future.jpg?resize=194,300 194w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Ministry-for-the-Future.jpg?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px" /></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214086" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ecoterrorism has gotten more sympathetic purchase from authors in recent years as the climate crisis has crescendoed. Richard Powers, the author of <i>The Overstory</i>, which won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, depicted how five divergent characters eventually come together to commit a violent act to save the planet, and then process the repercussions.</p>
<p>It’s a grisly subject, and one that had been all but off limits in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It’s not particularly novel, though. Square’s Final Fantasy VII, which was released in 1997 and remains a lodestar in that franchise’s long history, follows a cell of ecoterrorists trying to save the planet from the machinations of the evil mako-extraction corporate empire Shinra.</p>
<p>Yet Robinson has avoided the challenging ethical quandaries of violent revolution, or the deeply-wrought emotions that come from people who theoretically love the planet and people, and believe somehow that killing those very beings is a form of salvation. Instead, he writes a sprawling, heady work that explores the challenges of getting to a carbon-free future, ultimately finding that humanity can get there, albeit with an off-page violent nudge here and there.</p>
<p>As a work of speculative fiction, <i>The Ministry for the Future</i> is heavily ladened with speculation, with an almost encyclopedic remit. It’s got discursive discussions on everything from the discount rate used in economics to blockchains, glacier movements, central bank politics, scientific bureaucracy, Swiss governance, Earth’s albedo, and more. It’s a very comprehensive policy memo wrapped up into a windy plot that extends over decades — and let’s be clear, a much better narrative than any policy memo could ever hope to attain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yet, the novel reminds me of an old adage about diplomacy and many other professions: that the job is one that is mostly boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror. At its best, <i>The Ministry for the Future</i> is able to capture indelible scenes of the future with deep empathy and verve. The opening scenes of a heat wave that strikes India are harrowing, stinging and unforgettable. Robinson is at his finest when crafting scenes of nature, with discussions of Antarctica, the Swiss Alps, and views from airships having particular resonance.</p>
<p>That’s only maybe a quarter of the book though. Robinson has taken on a quixotic challenge, to write a propulsive narrative that can transform the activities of an agency tasked with enforcing the Paris climate agreement into something enticing for a general readership. It’s uneven, and there are glimpses of scenes that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/20/state-tectonics-review/">remind me of Malka Older’s Centenal Cycle</a>, which similarly had a lens on a future supra-national government body and its bureaucratic goings-on.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qGthmUpR8p"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/20/state-tectonics-review/">In State Tectonics, an explosive ending for the future of democracy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In State Tectonics, an explosive ending for the future of democracy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/20/state-tectonics-review/embed/#?secret=qGthmUpR8p" data-secret="qGthmUpR8p" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Older had a direct villain in her series though, while Robinson has taken on the damn hard challenge of doing without. The villain is all of us, it’s capitalism and the system, it’s inertia and lethargy. A reader’s interest in a political bureaucrat’s fight against inertia is heavily dependent on whether their personal biography includes a stint at a public policy graduate school. That’s me, but even I couldn’t quite get there.</p>
<p>But even with nearly 600 pages of discourse on climate change mechanics and economics, what’s missing is still the most interesting part of Robinson’s work. Whole countries change their politics, sometimes in as short as a page. Capitalists, sitting in Davos and forcibly locked down by presumably the Children of Kali to watch videos of the death of the planet and a positive path forward, suddenly have a change of heart. It’s speculative fiction of course, but with a heavy dose of “what if this just happened.” What if China suddenly became an open, democratized, and equitable place? What if India just rejected its modern Hindutva and returned to an organic, agrarian society of regenerative farming? What if the capitalists just gave up?</p>
<p>What’s missing repeatedly in the book is any form of narration on human behavior, and particularly, the penchant for revenge for those forced to go without. Sure, an ecoterrorist group is successful in using drones to sink the cargo ships littering the high seas and knocking out carbon-emitting planes from the sky, and also hacking all banks around the world and destroying petrodollars. Do any of the people affected ever respond? Ironically, the Children of Kali were formed in the aftermath of that India heat wave, so revenge is certainly on the author’s mind.</p>
<p>Robinson wants to unveil what’s possible, to show us a different path. But of course, what’s possible is quite literally <i>always</i> possible. The challenge is how to actually strike down that path, given the human forces that are often insurmountable along the journey. In this way, the novel is less speculative fiction and more just fantasy, a form of escapism for a particularly politically-attuned observer of world affairs, who just wishes that people in Geneva can make things happen.</p>
<p>That lack of human behavioral insight can lead the book astray quite quickly. <i>The Ministry for the Future</i> was published in 2020 centering on the coming decades, and one of its plot points is how China becomes the vessel for changing the climate debate in the years ahead. In the process, Hong Kong becomes something of a bastion of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>In the novel’s final pages, we get the analysis of how it won its freedom. “So we in Hong Kong fought for it, we fought for the rule of law. All through the years between 1997 and 2047 we fought.” How did they fight? “Over the years we saw what worked and refined our methods. Violence didn’t work. Numbers did. That’s the secret, in case you are looking for the secret to resisting an imperial power, which was what we were doing through those years. Non-violent resistance of the total population, or as much of it as you can get. That’s what works.”</p>
<p>Contemporaneously with the book’s publication (editing and publishing always takes a long time of course), Hong Kong’s resistance movement completely collapsed. Hundreds of thousands joined the various movement protests over the past few years, only to be completely subsumed by the mainland government in incredibly short order. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/23/1009582208/hong-kongs-apple-daily-shut-down-leadership-arrested">Newspapers have been shut</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-access-online-museum-about-tiananmen-square-appears-blocked-n1280411">websites blocked</a>, <a href="https://hongkongfp.com/2021/06/02/in-pictures-hong-kongs-tiananmen-massacre-museum-shuts-down-after-govt-says-it-has-no-license/">museums</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/06/china-hong-kong-freedom/619088/">universities</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kongs-government-broadcaster-ordered-support-national-security-mission-2021-09-29/">cultural institutions</a> curtailed. Numbers just didn’t pan out. Non-violent resistance was executed par excellence by organizers in Hong Kong. They failed completely.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the uncanny nature of the book’s central premise. For all the positive changes we should look forward to, this future history depends on a radical group willing to commit violence to usher in this world. Robinson wants utopia, and feels that a natural utopia is within our grasp, but can’t seem to find a way there with what’s on the page. “Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,” someone once said. It’s a notion that Hong Kong recently relearned, and one that is increasingly normalized in the environmental discourse. The Ministry for the Future is just reusing the same tactics which past ministries of the world have used, and that’s a devastation that none of us should want.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roughly two hours pass between my initial email and our first Zoom chat — on a Sunday, no less. I skip the post-gym shower and pop on a baseball cap, because I’m not sure when the opportunity will present itself again.</p>
<p>After more than two decades of espousing the benefits of vertical farming around the world, it seems Dickson Despommier is still every bit as eager to talk about the subject as I am. This is likely due, in no small part, to the tenth anniversary edition of <em>The Vertical Farm</em>, which arrived late last year. In a culture that seems almost irrevocably hung up on anniversaries, this occasion feels earned, largely due to everything that transpired in that intervening decade.</p>
<p>“Although there are at present no examples of vertical farms,” Despommier writes in the original edition, “we know how to proceed—we can apply hydroponic and aeroponic farming methodologies in a multistory building and create the world’s first vertical farms.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215514" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The latest edition of the book offers a coda in the form of a tenth chapter titled, “And Then What Happened?” The answer, as I’ve discovered in my own dealings with the world of vertical faming, is a lot longer than can one can hope to address in a single chapter — or, for that matter, a brief book review on a technology website.</p>
<p>“In 2010, when this book was first published, there were no vertical farms,” Despommier opens the new chapter, describing what began as a slow trickle in the U.S. and Asia. “As of this writing, there are so many vertical farms, I don’t know exactly how many exist.”</p>
<p>The list of vertical farms that follow is hardly exhaustive, amounting to four and a half pages and offering some concessions for space such as only listing Japan’s largest vertical farming company Spread, and noting the country is home to at least 200 such farms. The U.S. list, meanwhile, begins with AeroFarms and Bowery Farming, familiar names to TechCrunch readers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Even devoid of an exhaustive list, the sheer number of countries and companies that have embraced the concept of vertical farming as a potential method to address the looming specter of climate catastrophe is an astonishing testament to what, for many, is the right idea at the right time. While few (if any) view the concept of tightly-packed, vertically stacked crops grown in an urban setting as a catchall solution, there’s been plenty of momentum around the notion that it could be an important piece of that puzzle.</p>
<p>I doubt that, in the year 2021, many who pick up a book called <em>The Vertical Farm</em> need much in the way of convincing when it comes to man-made climate change. But Despommier still does a fine job spelling out many of the concerns in his introduction, especially as they pertain to apprehensions about population growth and over-farming. Beyond the clear (and I believe well deserved) targeting of meat production, there’s probably still education to be done around the impact of food production in general.</p>
<p>These big issues were the catalyst for the development of the vertical farming concept. The modern definition of the idea was born as a thought experiment in a 1999 Columbia University class led by Despommier. A similarly titled <em>Vertical Farming</em> was published in 1915, but ultimately shares very little with what we understand the term to mean. (The book, written by American geologist Gilbert Ellis Bailey, is <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL1559636W/Vertical_farming">available for free online</a> and includes some fun ideas about farming with explosives. It’s an entertaining way to kill an hour.)</p>
<p>In spite of Despommier’s status as an Ivy League professor (now emeritus at 81), <em>The Vertical Farm</em> is written in extremely digestible language. The book is less a blueprint or how-to guide than a continuation of his class’s early thought experiments – understandable again given the fact that there were no major vertical farms at the time of its initial publication. The nature of the book plays into its author’s notions of utopian idealism.</p>
<p>Bowery Farming CEO Irving Fain, who met with Despommier ahead of his company’s 2014 launch, summed up some of the sentiment well in a recent conversation we had, noting,</p>
<blockquote><p>I think every industry needs a north star at some point. I think Dickson has been a phenomenal north star of the industry, in some ways long before everybody was sort of onboard and believing in indoor farming. Do I think everything he imagines will come to pass? Not necessarily, but that&#8217;s not actually the goal of a north star anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>This, I think, is the right way to approach a book like <em>The Vertical Farm</em>. Despommier is certainly a pragmatist when it comes to the threats of climate change, overpopulation and over-farming, but he’s an idealist when discussing the solutions. In a sense, it’s a breath of fresh air in an age when so many of us are (I think understandably) inclined to something far darker when faced with such existential challenges.</p>
<p>The strongest example of this dynamic at play are important questions around the energy use and costs of growing plants indoors, instead of directly harnessing the power of the sun. The book&#8217;s new chapter points to green solutions like clear photovoltaic windows, rainwater harvesting and carbon sequestration as answers. As more farms come online, there will be more opportunities to determine the complex math around whether such solutions are net positive. Hopefully more scale and better technologies will get us closer to where we need to be.</p>
<p>My time writing about startups, meanwhile, has made me — if not more cynical, than at least more skeptical about altruistic motivators in green technology. The pragmatist in me firmly believes that the bar of capitalistic drivers is the first one that needs clearing here — at least in the United States. Companies need to prove out that vertical farms can aggressively generate revenue and then, hopefully, we can see true advances on the sustainability side of the equation.</p>
<p>As a north star, to again quote Bowery’s CEO, the work is a supremely effective one. One need look no further than the agricultural revolution Despommier and <em>The Vertical Farm</em> helped catalyze a decade ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Climate change has been the deepest, most challenging cognitive puzzle for humans to untangle these past years. It’s systems on top of systems, with emergent properties that can easily turn intuitive notions into catastrophic dead ends. Every action has a reaction or ten, and improving one part of the system almost invariably leads to weaknesses elsewhere.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly given the scope of the challenge, complexity theory and “systems thinking” have become critical to comprehending Earth. It also happens to be a popular framework for technologists, fitting well with software engineering and technology products generally as well as society at large. Rather than see every little feature or change in the world atomistically, systems thinking builds relationships between all of them, finding connections where others only see disparate phenomenon.</p>
<p>In his profound and engrossing book <i>The Great Derangement</i>, celebrated Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh trains his sharply analytical and observant mind on the interconnections between humans and the planet, discovering counter-intuitive relationships wherever he roams. An edited collection of a series of lectures he delivered at the University of Chicago in 2015, it’s a taut and provocative meditation, and one of the best I have read in recent years.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215133" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2215137" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Great-Derangement.jpg?w=453" alt="" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Great-Derangement.jpg 853w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Great-Derangement.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Great-Derangement.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Great-Derangement.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Great-Derangement.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Great-Derangement.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></p>
<p>Ghosh’s main argument centers on the role of culture, and particularly literary culture, in contextualizing the climate crisis. He’s all but astonished to find it completely absent, which leads to the book’s title of the great derangement: that climate change is all but incidental to culture, a fact that’s insane in a world increasingly trembling from the daily crises of a planet under stress. In fact, “it could even be said that fiction that deals with climate change is almost by definition not of the kind that is taken seriously by serious literary journals: the mere mention of the subject is often enough to relegate a novel or a short story to the genre of science fiction.”</p>
<p>He narrates his own brush with climate change: a freak urban cyclone that nearly killed him when he was younger. Yet, as he reminisces on this incident, he realizes that his random brush with death would be impossible in the context of a plot. Too arbitrary, a narrative device that would seem hackneyed to even the most open-minded reader. His own lived experience — an authentic, real experience — impossible to write down since it seems almost impossible to have happened.</p>
<p>The likelihood of any individual catastrophe emanating from climate change is unlikely, but the totality of each of those many rolls of the dice all but guarantees frequent disasters. That leads Ghosh into a meditation on the history of probability. “Probability and the modern novel are in fact twins, born at about the same time, among the same people, under a shared star that destined them to work as vessels for the containment of the same kind of experience,” he writes. The randomness of life that was a feature of humanity for millennia became regularized with the rise of the industrial era — we took control of our environments, our destinies after struggling to hold back the chaos of our world. Probability thus became less relevant in the modern age.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, it was precisely that penchant for control that has led to our current climate rupture. Our upgraded standard of living simultaneously cost us the very quality of regularity that we demand. The idyllic nature of the San Francisco Bay Area is now punctuated by successive climate crises, from droughts to wildfires. Our interwoven global community now stutters with supply-chain disruptions, travel cancelations, border closures and policy changes. Our system of regularity has become a system at war with itself.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Air conditioning is one of the greatest inventions of the 20th Century. It’s also killing the 21st&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/28/eric-dean-wilson-interview/embed/#?secret=cqNqU9L0Vu" data-secret="cqNqU9L0Vu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Part of the challenge in Ghosh’s mind is that culture has become centered on narrations of individuals, who are hopelessly outmatched today by Earth’s forces. He borrows from John Updike the phrase “individual moral adventure” to describe much of modern literature, particularly that produced in the West. We want a hero, a protagonist, someone we can viscerally connect with and understand their tribulations as they embark on a quest against challenges they eventually overcome.</p>
<p>The climate is a system though, and thus, practically impervious to individual action. As I pointed out in my review of Kim Stanley Robinson’s <i>The Ministry for the Future</i> today, it’s nearly impossible to engage a reader on the bureaucratic struggles that form the basis for any change around climate. There is no villain but all of us, and that just doesn’t match the kind of narrative readers and viewers expect.</p>
<p>Worse, the narrative needs of “individual moral adventure” leads us to a world in which the substance of the matter isn’t even the heart of the story. Ghosh decries where this leads, writing that “Fiction, for one, comes to be reimagined in such a way that it becomes a form of bearing witness, of testifying, and of charting the career of the conscience. Thus do sincerity and authenticity become, in politics as in literature, the greatest of virtues.” That leads to a declining level of agency for individuals and also for groups. “As the public sphere grows ever more performative, at every level from presidential campaigns to online petitions, its ability to influence the actual exercise of power becomes increasingly attenuated,” he writes.</p>
<p>While systems thinking can easily get truncated to just technical and scientific relationships, Ghosh has successfully expanded the bounds to include culture in the equations as well (his three parts in this volume are entitled “Stories,” “History” and “Politics,” which gives some idea of his intended contributions). It’s not enough to just peer into our natural ecosystems and see what’s going on, but we also have to understand how humans conceive and connect with these systems in the first place. His analysis offers another critical stratum on an already deeply-layered problem.</p>
<p>So where does this foray into culture, power and politics lead us? Ultimately, Ghosh sees an important place for traditional religious authorities to take charge on climate. As he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Religious worldviews are not subject to the limitations that have made climate change such a challenge for our existing institutions of governance: they transcend nation-states, and they all acknowledge intergenerational, long-term responsibilities; they do not partake of economistic ways of thinking and are therefore capable of imagining nonlinear change — catastrophe, in other words — in ways that are perhaps closed to the forms of reason deployed by contemporary nation-states.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ghosh touches on a myriad of other subjects across this slim book, but his erudite and at times contrarian thinking successfully reframes many of the debates and points of reference around climate and future governance. As with all good systems thinking, his analysis ultimately others something synthetic: different lenses by which to understand a wicked problem. We should be fortunate that there is perhaps a path out of the morass.</p>
<p>Or not. For it’s clear that while debates around the climate have gone on for decades, we’re still doing little to actually solve the fundamentals. Ghosh quotes U Thant, the third secretary-general of the United States and the first from Asia, back in 1971:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we watch the sun go down, evening after evening, through the smog across the poisoned waters of our native earth, we must ask ourselves seriously whether we really wish some future universal historian on another planet to say about us: &#8220;With all their genius and with all their skill, they ran out of foresight and air and food and water and ideas,&#8221; or, “They went on playing politics until their world collapsed around them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That history is being written now, and while the puzzle in front of us is indeed vexing, it’s neither impossible to comprehend not impossible to solve.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There's no one-size-fits-all solution, but having a better understanding of how BaaS providers position themselves between banks and fintechs can help potential customers determine which model is best for them.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The BaaS market is evolving rapidly and so are the options for companies who wish to quickly spin up new financial services by leveraging these bank-in-a-box APIs.</p>
<p>We recently took a look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/who-needs-a-baas-partner-anyway/">who the ideal customers and partners</a> are for banking-as-a-service startups … And today we’re going to dig deeper into the different flavors of BaaS offerings and how they stack up.</p>
<p>Some of the BaaS players in the market have partnered with bank partners to offer API access to their services, others offer software and are running a marketplace model to match up community banks and fintechs, and at least one startup has bought a bank to build its own banking API customers can access.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to spin up a new fintech app or want to add banking, debit cards or other financial services to your existing business, knowing how each of these competitors is positioned to work with customers and bank partners is key.</p>
<h2>Turnkey banking as a service</h2>
<p>The simplest &#8212; and most common &#8212; BaaS offering is one that brings together everything a company might need to roll out financial services and made it available via API. Companies providing these types of services include <a href="https://synapsefi.com/">Synapse</a>, <a href="https://www.unit.co/">Unit</a> and <a href="https://www.bond.tech/">Bond</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Typically, these BaaS providers make their money by charging a platform fee to customers and/or share in revenues from interchange or other fees generated by the customer’s end product or service.</p>
<p>For fintech companies just getting started or vertical SaaS players looking to launch financial services without building out a whole new fintech team, hooking into their API or set of APIs can be a low-cost way to build, test and deploy with little hassle.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The epic fall from grace of Elizabeth Holmes holds lessons for everybody from CEOs to investors, commercial partners, the media &#8212; social or otherwise &#8212; and the Silicon Valley hype machine that is always hungry for a new breakout star and unicorn company.</p>
<p>For pharmaceutical companies, especially medical affairs, the important lesson from this sad and sordid affair is as simple as it is powerful: Your advisory board matters — a lot.</p>
<h2>Big names, little relevant expertise</h2>
<p>Those five words characterize Theranos’ board. A quick look shows (former) politicians (George Shultz, William Perry, Sam Nunn, Henry Kissinger, Bill Frist), high-ranking members of the military (Gary Roughead, James Mattis) and corporate leaders without healthcare experience (Richard Kovacevich/banking and Riley Bechtel/engineering and construction).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215537" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Then there was the lone medical professional, the former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, William Foege &#8212; unless you want to count Bill Frist, an M.D. focused on cardiac transplants who switched to politics long before he joined Theranos’ board. Holmes herself was a college dropout at 19, and Theranos COO Sunny Balwani was an IT professional by training and experience.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			While big names attract attention and lend credibility, you need domain expertise on your advisory boards from the start. Real boots-on-the-ground expertise from advisers who know what they&#8217;re talking about because they&#8217;ve lived it every day.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Except for Foege, nobody knew the first thing about diagnostic testing, the technologies behind it, the challenges, the logistics, economics or even the biology. Mattis’ testimony in the Holmes trial makes this point clear.</p>
<p>“I thought all along that we were doing it on Theranos gear,” he told prosecutors, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/22/jim-mattis-elizabeth-holmes-trial/">The Washington Post</a>. He took the word of Holmes and the senior leadership team that the technology worked. Without any experience in the field, that’s probably pretty much all he could do.</p>
<p>What the board needed &#8212; and members should have insisted much earlier that this expertise needed to be added &#8212; was people capable of looking under the hood and scrutinizing every aspect of a system, that, if real, would make every other diagnostic testing system out there look like child’s play.</p>
<p>It was only in 2016 that Theranos added what <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/04/07/theranos-adds-startlingly-well-qualified-medical-board/">Fortune</a> magazine called a “startlingly well-qualified medical board.” Which it was. But by then, apparently, it was too late.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Lessons learned for advisory boards</h2>
<p>The first lesson learned from this debacle is intuitive: While big names attract attention and lend credibility, you need domain expertise on your advisory boards from the start. Real boots-on-the-ground expertise from advisers who know what they&#8217;re talking about because they&#8217;ve lived it every day.</p>
<p>Advisory boards in (bio)pharmaceutical companies don’t normally feature secretaries of state or defense, but the risk associated with a board consisting only of high-level, international key opinion leaders can be similar: They are highly sought after, incredibly busy and might not be in a good position to dig into the data and details. They might keynote panels at the most prestigious conferences, know everybody who is anybody in the therapeutic area and publish in high <a href="https://armacad.info/blog/highest-impact-factor-journals">Journal Impact Factor</a> magazines, but do not see patients.</p>
<p>While advisory boards absolutely need these big names to inform strategic decisions, they also need members who can get into the weeds, help answer relevant, detailed medical questions and identify unmet medical needs of different patient populations. A highly functioning, diverse board needs to be in place to advise companies early on.</p>
<p>Once things have gone awry, even a “startlingly well-qualified” board might not be able to turn things around.</p>
<h2>Job description: Rebel with a cause</h2>
<p>Lesson No. 2 relates to the interesting case of the lone expert on the board: Foege was one of the most loyal Theranos supporters and the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-last-days-of-theranos-the-financials-were-as-overhyped-as-the-blood-tests-2018-10-16">longest-tenured Theranos official</a> (except Holmes) when the Theranos house of cards came tumbling down.</p>
<p>As this example shows, people, even experts, get sucked into the hype. That’s why it is good to have a “rebel” or two on your board, i.e., experts, often rising stars, who question convention, challenge the status quo, deeply vet the data and are not afraid to argue with the luminaries.</p>
<p>While it is easy to say, “Find yourself a couple of rebels driven by the cause of improving patient outcomes,” this is one of the more difficult advisory board positions to fill. Those who question established approaches might not be recommended by the experts they challenge. Therefore, the popular ways of building boards by asking established members for recommendations might prove ineffective or even counterproductive when it comes to these critical members.</p>
<p>This leaves medical affairs or commercial teams in life science companies with the tough job of finding these emerging experts with an independent streak using different approaches.</p>
<p>Scientific publications can be used as an early indicator of emerging experts. The number of publications, the impact factor of the journal and, importantly, the actual work they publish can help identify exceptional talent.</p>
<p>Social media is an emerging but increasingly important source of information. What healthcare providers communicate and whom they target, e.g., patients or colleagues, can help paint a more complete picture, especially of early-career professionals. Awards, active membership in medical societies, especially participation in guideline development committees and international collaborations are other factors companies consider.</p>
<p>Once found and onboarded, these emerging experts may turn out to be a pain in the neck, but if that means not going down the wrong path, that pain is well worth it.</p>
<h2>The good, the bad, the ugly</h2>
<p>The third lesson is an indirect one: A lot of time, energy, money and sleepless nights go into assembling an advisory board. Now use it for all that it’s worth.</p>
<p>Theranos never did this; they couldn’t, because their board was not meant to provide real oversight or ask hard questions. It was designed to help raise funds, inspire awe, squelch doubts and shut down criticism by the power of its members&#8217; reputation. It did this very successfully &#8212; until it didn’t.</p>
<p>Criticism, while not pleasant, is vital, and therefore the goal must be to foster a culture of openness that encourages hard questions, deep vetting of data, fact-checking and constructive criticism.</p>
<p>The advisory board is just the place to have those open discussions among experts. As the Theranos example shows: If you fail to address challenges in the circle of trusted advisers, you might end up having to discuss them in public or — in this case — a court of law.</p>
<h2>Your advisory board matters — a lot</h2>
<p>Boards are critical to success, whether it is the success of an entire company or a specific drug development program. To live up to that expectation, boards of any description need diverse members who are highly qualified, engaged, collaborative and not afraid to ask uncomfortable questions and keep asking them.</p>
<p>The burden on boards in the life science industry is especially great because people’s health and lives are at stake. We might never know whether patients died as a direct result of Theranos’ misdiagnoses, but an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05149-2">“untold number of people were harmed by the erroneous results: Some underwent unnecessary procedures, received misdiagnoses of serious conditions and experienced emotional turmoil.”</a></p>
<p>The burden of vetting, questioning and fact-checking is on the board. The burden of building a board that is able to do so and takes that responsibility seriously &#8212; and enabling it by creating an environment of openness and trust and really listening to its input and feedback &#8212; is on the company.</p>
<p>Theranos starkly shows the possible consequences of failing to do so.</p>

<p>This week on Equity, we chatted about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/the-metaverse-is-coming-for-squid-game/">why the metaverse is inevitably coming for &#8220;Squid Game.&#8221;</a> More specifically, we explored how the world of gaming is changing through the lens of startups and Big Tech.</p>
<p>For example, Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/netflix-acquires-its-first-games-studio-oxenfree-developer-night-school/">recently scooped up its first gaming studio</a>. While I had some questions about streaming quality, I became convinced of the synergies after realizing Netflix could turn its original content — ahem, Squid Game — into highly produced video games. We also addressed how<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-doesnt-make-videogames-but-its-the-hottest-player-in-gaming-11633147211"> Apple is the biggest gaming giant among them all</a> and a 30% app store cut may have something to do with that. Finally, in the world of startups, we riffed on the rise of the metaverse and how Andressen Horowitz <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andreessen-horowitz-raising-vc-fund-for-investing-in-gaming-startups-2021-9">has a new gaming-focused fund</a>, sans a partner to lead it but plus a lot of fascinating early investments.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215632" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I’m not a gamer. And that’s partially why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/the-metaverse-is-coming-for-squid-game/">this episode was fun to record.</a> I learned how an industry has evolved from scrappy, indie games with momentary popularity to full-on productions that sneak in recurring ways to stay fresh (and make money).</p>
<p>The sector is de-risking itself for creators and venture capitalists, which means more funding will kick-start a wave of new studios and services. Expect to see the industry collaborate with other trends in tech right now, from NFTs to edtech to cloud infrastructure plays.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, I’ll tell you about my startup of the week, S-1s and community as a buzzword.</p>
<h2>And the startup of the week is …</h2>

<p>Chalo! Other than having an adorable name that means &#8220;let’s go&#8221; in Hindi, Chalo is a startup that wants to tackle bus inefficiencies in India. The startup, which deploys GPS machines on buses and offers a nifty app, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/chalo-raises-40-million-to-digitize-bus-commutes-in-india/">$40 million Series C this week.</a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Sometimes actions matter more than numbers. As part of the new financing round, the startup said it will use $10 million of the proceeds to buy back stock options to reward its current and former employees as well as some early angel investors. This founder move is a flex and is proof that India is maturing as a startup ecosystem.</p>

<p>We love a late Friday regulatory filing, and that’s exactly what Rivian did last week when it filed its S-1. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/7-takeaways-from-rivians-ipo-filing/">Through numbers and strategy</a>, the EV company helped us understand just how expensive it is to build its business, why market size estimates are BS and if Tesla and Amazon are main characters or side baes.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/7-takeaways-from-rivians-ipo-filing/">Here’s what to know</a>, via Transportation Editor<a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Kirsten Korosec</a> and Senior Editor <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are 81 mentions of Amazon in the Rivian S-1 filing. The number is high as Amazon is both an investor in the company and a customer. Per the filing, Amazon owns at least 5% of Rivian, though the final number is not yet available. Ford also has a stake greater than 5%, along with a number of investors.</p>
<p>A bet on Rivian’s IPO, then, is in great part a wager that Amazon does in fact buy the 100,000 vehicles that it is expected to, and we’d add on a timeline and price point that work for Rivian. There’s a lot of room for things to go pear-shaped between 10 vehicles in December of 2021 and the delivery of the remaining 99,990 vehicles that Rivian expects to deliver to one of its key shareholders.</p></blockquote>

<p>There’s a fine line between cultivating a nuanced and diverse community and creating a fancy term to describe your most loyal customers. We spoke about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/community-is-the-new-ai/">the watering down of the term &#8220;community&#8221; on Equity this week.</a> The whole conversation was triggered because Contrary Capital, which funds student entrepreneurs and star employees within companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/contrary-capitals-20m-fund-ii-is-all-about-community-first-investments/">closed its second fund.</a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Contrary brought together a 350-person community of students, aka investment partners, that it wants to help advise (and eventually invest in). About 45% of the cohort identifies as female and 65% identifies as non-white. But, as Contrary founder Eric Tarczynski said, he’s not bummed if none of those students found the next Stripe. He wants the community to be full of talented individuals; and even if they don’t start their own projects, he’s bringing together a database of some useful potential hires for his own portfolio to poach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2211776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h1>Top Stories</h1>
<h3>Winners from the Facebook outage</h3>
<p>When Facebook went down for nearly six hours on Monday, other apps saw an immediate benefit. Telegram, for example, <a href="https://t.me/durov/170">gained</a> a massive influx of 70 million more users, it said. Other firms did a fuller analysis of how the outage played out in the world of mobile apps.</p>
<p><a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/facebook-outage-impact">According to Sensor Tower,</a> Snapchat saw the biggest increase on the social media front, with average time spent by existing users climbing by 23% week-over-week. Twitter, which had jokingly <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter/status/1445078208190291973">tweeted</a> &#8220;hello literally everyone,&#8221; grew that figure by 11% and TikTok saw a 2% jump. When comparing October 4 to the week-ago day, Snapchat saw a 14% increase in sessions, the report said. Twitter saw 5% session growth week-over-week, but TikTok saw a 1% dip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But as the outage impacted more than just social networking &#8212; Facebook&#8217;s communication services, including Messenger and WhatsApp went down, too &#8212; rival chat apps also saw some gains. This included a 15% time-spent bump in Signal and an 18% increase in Telegram. In terms of sessions, Signal and Telegram grew by 13% and 9%, respectively, when compared with September 27. In addition, both saw an increase in installs, with Signal seeing nearly 12x the installs from the day before, reaching 881,000 downloads on the day of the outage. Telegram saw 6.3 million installs and Viber gained 137,000.</p>

<p>At Facebook, the declines in time spent were significant. Instagram&#8217;s average time spent on Android dropped by 28% week-over-week. Facebook on Android was down 24%; WhatsApp was down 25%; and Messenger was down 20%.</p>
<h3>Apple brings back the App Store&#8217;s &#8220;Report a Problem&#8221; feature</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">Apple made a change to its App Store <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j5uyprul">by returning the “Report a Problem” link</a> to App Store product pages across iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey devices. The link offers an easy way for users to report issues they’re having with an app, including whether it contains offensive or illegal content, or whether it was attempting to scam consumers out of their money. Apple had removed the consumer-friendly “Report a Problem” button from the App Store years ago, possibly to its detriment. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/06/apple-app-store-scams-fraud/">New reports have suggested</a> that many of the top apps are scams costing consumers millions and Apple has even been questioned by Congress over the situation.</p>
<p>The &#8220;new&#8221; feature is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and will make its way to other markets over time. However, the feature isn&#8217;t technically &#8220;new&#8221; in the sense that it had never before existed on the App Store &#8212; a button like this used to have a prominent position in the App Store&#8217;s early days.</p>
<p>When clicked, consumers will be able to select from options like &#8220;Report a scam or fraud” and “Report offensive, abusive, or illegal content&#8221; at <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>. They will also be able to report issues with free apps that don&#8217;t include in-app purchases.</p>
<p>The addition arrives after a number of reports about high-profile App Store scams have made headlines. Scams were even brought up in an antitrust hearing Apple attended earlier this year, when senators questioned why it wasn&#8217;t doing enough to protect consumers. The return of the button seems to be the closest to an acknowledgment we will get from Apple that fighting fraud effectively may require public input.</p>
<h3>Apple&#8217;s apps get rated and reviewed</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2215615" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2215615" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2215615" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-average-rating-summary-1005-2.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-average-rating-summary-1005-2.jpeg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-average-rating-summary-1005-2.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-average-rating-summary-1005-2.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-average-rating-summary-1005-2.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-average-rating-summary-1005-2.jpeg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/apple-average-rating-summary-1005-2.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2215615" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Appfigures</p></div></p>
<p>With iOS 15, Apple began to allow consumers to rate and review its own first-party apps on the App Store for the first time. That meant users could now leave reviews for built-in apps like Mail, Music, Stocks, Calculator and others that typically ship with the iPhone. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/02/this-week-in-apps-tiktok-shops-for-advertisers-microsoft-makes-app-store-changes-apples-apps-get-reviews/">Initially</a>, some of the apps were not faring well as users finally had a chance to offer their feedback. For example, News started off with 2.5 stars as users complained about nags to upgrade to News+, advertising and other elements.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://appfigures.com/resources/insights/apple-pre-installed-app-ratings">Appfigures analyzed how the apps were doing</a> as of October 5, 2021, to reflect the nearly 33,000 ratings they received over the first couple of weeks. It found that the most disliked apps included Mail, Podcasts, News and Translate. The latter, a newer app in the Apple lineup, fared the worst. Translate was the lowest-rated app, with a 2.42 average star rating globally off of 1,629 total ratings, Appfigures found. News, Mail and Podcasts were rated 2.55 stars, 2.98 stars and 2.44 stars, respectively.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, apps with ratings over 4 stars included Find My, Voice Memos, Compass, Measure, FaceTime, Notes, Fitness and Apple Wallet. A majority of Apple&#8217;s apps, however, were in the 3-star range. None received 5 stars or less than 2.42.</p>
<p>In terms of the number of ratings, Music and Maps led with 23% of the 32,953 ratings that came in over the past couple of weeks. Worldwide, music had 4,431 ratings, and Maps had 3,207 ratings. They were also the only apps with 3,000+ total ratings as of the time of publication.</p>

<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>iOS Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS 15 users noticed they have started to see promotions for Apple&#8217;s services in the Settings screen.</strong> While Apple has used this spot in the past, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/epic-games-ceo-tim-sweeney-calls-out-apple-for-promoting-its-services-in-the-iphone-settings-screen/">this week called out Apple</a> for the practice, saying Apple is using the Settings screen as an ad unit its competitors don&#8217;t have access to. Apple was seen marketing Apple Music here, for example &#8212; but a rival like Spotify would not be able to use this same prime real estate in the same way.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mlbmt3m7">launched</a> new metrics in App Analytics.</strong> The new analytics include redownloads, total downloads, proceeds, preorders and updates. Each metric can be displayed by territory, source type, device and more.</li>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mdkbobfo">reminded developers</a> that its updated App Store Guidelines said that all app submissions starting January 31, 2022 will need to offer an account deletion feature</strong> if they also offer account creation. The changes were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams/">previously announced</a> alongside other, larger updates focused on cutting down on fraud and scams.</li>
<li><strong>Apple launched iOS 15.1 beta 3, which <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/06/iphone-13-auto-macro-ios-15-toggle-camera/">added a new &#8220;Auto Macro&#8221; toggle</a> </strong>that will allow you to disable the automatic camera switching. It also added ProRes support and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/06/ios-15-1-beta-3-fixes-apple-maps-look-around-image-quality-issue/">fixed some of the issues</a> with Apple Maps&#8217; &#8220;Look Around&#8221; mode&#8217;s image quality. Meanwhile, Apple <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/04/apple-stops-signing-ios-148-code-for-certain-devices?utm_medium=rss">stopped</a> code signing iOS 14.8 for some older iPhones.</li>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/apple-launches-new-coding-guide-for-elementary-school-students/">launched</a> new coding guides for elementary school students.</strong> The guides include a new one-hour App Design session and other core coding concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Android updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google announced its <a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/">next Pixel event</a> would take place on October 19.</strong> The company said it will officially introduce the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, powered by its first custom mobile chip, Tensor.</li>
<li><strong>Google <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/android-12-is-live-in-aosp.html">released</a> the Android 12 source code on Android Open Source Project (AOSP).</strong> But unlike in years past, it didn&#8217;t also immediately release the new OS to Android devices. Instead, it said that Pixel device owners will still need to wait a few more weeks for some Pixel-first exclusives and features. (Perhaps to be announced at the new event?) Android 12 will also reach other phones later this year, including Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo and Xiaomi devices.</li>

<h3>E-commerce</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pinterest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/pinterest-rolls-out-new-shopping-features-for-advertisers/">rolled out new features for advertisers</a> and brands to promote their products to users on its platform.</strong> A new &#8220;slideshow for collections&#8221; feature pulls products from brands’ catalogs and automatically turns them into a &#8220;collections ad,&#8221; which helps advertisers produce video-like content. It&#8217;s also adding support for &#8220;merchant details,&#8221; which will allow brands to showcase their values &#8212; like “responsibly sourced” and &#8220;inclusive&#8221; &#8212; on their profile. And companies can highlight communities they&#8217;re a part of, like &#8220;women-owned&#8221; or &#8220;Black-owned,&#8221; for example. The company is also expanding its Verified Merchant Program and is testing a new “Idea Ads with paid partnership” feature that is a joint partnership between creators and advertisers.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. consumers are <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/mobile-minute/mobile-shopping-predictions-q4-2021/">expected</a> to spend over 900 million hours on mobile shopping apps during the holiday season,</strong> reports App Annie. This figure is up 20% year-over-year in the U.S. but other markets are on track for increases as well. In the U.K., consumers are on track for over 145 million hours in shopping apps, up from 138 million last year.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/amazon-will-allow-u-s-prime-members-to-send-gifts-using-only-an-email-or-phone-number/">added</a> a new feature to its U.S. shopping app that will allow Prime members to send gifts to anyone using just an email address or phone number.</strong> When checkout is complete, the gift recipient will then receive either an email or text that lets them accept the gift by providing Amazon with their preferred delivery address from their own Amazon account.</li>
</ul>

It also worked to improve its in-app reporting tools, and is adding a new educational portal when drug-related terms are searched for in the app.</li>

It will also allow developers to manage their own refunds. Plus, its fees would be 10% on transactions under $10 and 5% on transactions over $10 &#8212; less than Apple. But Paddle&#8217;s entire product hinges on its belief that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">court&#8217;s ruling</a> in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit will be held up upon appeal, and that the way Apple will interpret the ruling will allow payment system alternatives such as Paddle&#8217;s to operate.

<li><strong>Firefox Focus, the privacy-centric browser, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/firefox-focus-gets-new-logo-shortcuts-dark-theme-and-more/">updated</a> this week with a brand-new look, shortcuts and more privacy controls.</strong> The browser now has new colors, a new logo and a dark theme, as well.

<li><strong>Universe, a mobile website builder app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/no-code-mobile-website-builder-universe-launches-new-themes-block-features-and-more/">added</a> advanced creative controls, enhanced themes, block features</strong> and more to its grid-based web builder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Government &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dutch antitrust authority found that Apple&#8217;s rule requiring developers to use its in-app payments system is anticompetitive,</strong> Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-dutch-watchdog-finds-apple-app-store-payment-rules-anti-competitive-2021-10-07/">reported</a>. The investigation began in 2019, following complaints from Match, which said Apple hindered it from direct communications with developers.</li>
<li><strong>The U.K.&#8217;s comms, broadcast and, now, internet regulator, Ofcom, said video-sharing platforms in the U.K. will have to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/uk-publishes-safety-focused-rules-for-video-sharing-platforms/">comply with new regulations</a> designed to protect those under the age of 18 from harmful content. </strong>This includes hate speech, videos or ads likely to incite violence in protected groups, terrorist content, child sex abuse material, racism and xenophobia. In addition to larger video platforms like TikTok, Vimeo, Twitch, Snap, Triller and more, the regulations <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/information-for-industry/vsp-regulation/notified-video-sharing-platforms">also apply</a> to services like OnlyFans, Recast, BitChute and others.</li>

Instead of just marking articles to save later, only to never get read, Matter spruces up the reading list experience by offering other features to keep users more engaged with what they&#8217;re reading &#8212; like private and public highlighting, support for commenting, a curated public feed and editors picks, support for importing newsletters, audio playback of articles in a less-robotic sounding voice than rivals, and more.

<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called Fireside <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/mark-cuban-backed-live-entertainment-app-fireside-launches-to-creators/">launched this week</a> with what it hopes will be a more compelling set of tools for content creation, distribution, measurement and monetization. The service offers a platform for live and interactive shows, which had earlier drawn Clubhouse comparisons. But Fireside offers live and on-demand programming as well as the ability to export and simulcast to other platforms. The app had been making waves during its beta period thanks to financial backing by Mark Cuban, who has also taken the rare step of naming himself as co-founder. He’s joined by former Googler, YouTuber and Node co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/falon/">Falon Fatemi</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/sugarcrm-acquires-node-to-gain-predictive-customer-intelligence/">who sold her last company to SugarCRM</a>, and early Yammer employee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-ihbe/">Mike Ihbe.</a> The platform is now exiting its beta period, where it was tested with more than 500 creators whose collective audience reach has topped 100 million, the company says. Fireside is available on the web <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fireside/id1526340798">and iOS</a> to start.

<p id="speakable-summary">When you’re exploring a city — whether one you’re visiting on your travels or your own — there are a number of tools that can help you find out where to go, what to see and what to do, like Google Maps, Yelp, TripAdvisor and others. But a startup called <a href="https://welco.me/">Welcome</a> thinks that today’s set of tools could be smarter and more personalized to the individuals who use them. Its new app instead uses “real-time” technologies to make recommendations that take into account a user’s preferences as well as other details about their current context — like the weather, season, traffic and the popularity of the place at the current time of day — in order to provide a better-curated set of recommendations. The end result is a city guide that functions more like a personal concierge.

<p>With the iPhone 13 Pro, users can now take photos close up &#8212; less than an inch away from their subject &#8212; thanks to its support for macro photography. But now, there&#8217;s an option for everyone else, too. <a href="https://lux.camera/iphone-macro-camera-a-big-day-for-small-things/">Halide&#8217;s popular camera app updated this week</a> with a new feature that brings support for macro photography to all iPhone models from the iPhone 8 and up. While the ultra-wide camera will still automatically focus on very-close subjects, the company says, a separate mode unlocks powerful tools and processing specific to macro. To get started, you&#8217;ll tap the “AF” button to switch from auto focus to manual focus. To then enter Macro Mode, you&#8217;ll tap the flower icon — the universal symbol for macro. Halide will examine your available cameras and switch to whichever one has the shortest minimum focus distance. It then locks focus at that nearest point. You can tap anywhere on-screen to adjust focus or adjust it manually. To make the feature work, it trained a neural network to upscale images in a way that produces &#8220;much sharper, smoother results&#8221; than what you typically get in an editor, the company said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Happy Saturday, everyone. I hope that you are well, resting and relaxed.</p>
<p>Today we’re going to have some fun. Sure, down below we have our usual mix of venture capital rounds and notes and the like. But first, let’s talk about AI.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215623" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This week I got to chat to two different companies working on making machine intelligence a bit more concrete. One dealt with hardware, the other software.</p>
<p>On the hardware side of things, I chatted with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhchapman/">IonQ’s Peter Chapman</a>. IonQ is a quantum computing company that recently <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/828571518/files/doc_presentation/2021/09/IonQ_Investor_Presentation_-_Sept_2021_Updates_v092121.pdf">went public via a SPAC</a>. However, instead of digging into redemptions and other blank-check minutiae, Chapman and I mostly discussed science fiction and what strong AI really means.</p>
<p>In simple terms, strong AI is not how Alexa works today. Alexa, per Chapman, works by having engineers code up lots of possible responses to queries. That scales for a while. But <em>strong</em> AI has to be able to write its own code, Chapman explained, which makes it fundamentally different than human-generated question-and-answer setups.</p>
<p>This fits into the quantum topic because quantum computing, Chapman said, is very good at the sort of code generation that strong AI will require. And, critically, it’s also pretty alright at parsing myriad probabilities at the same time and selecting between them.</p>
<p>All this is to say that quantum computing is reaching its early commercial stages, and companies like IonQ — named for its use of trapped ions in its technology — are helping usher in this new computer era. As quantum computing becomes more mainstream we should be able to get closer to the sort of AI that isn’t just ML models on a macro scale.</p>
<p>From the software side of things, I got on the phone with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelacarpenter/">Intrinio CEO Rachel Carpenter</a>. Her <a href="https://intrinio.com/">company</a> has built a huge financial dataset that it makes available via an API. As a financial nerd, that’s cool. How much time you have spent reading SEC filings will determine if you care about that part of Intrinio or not.</p>
<p>But the startup is also building something <a href="https://intrinio.com/thea">called Thea</a>, an AI service that works by weaving together neural networks into a custom natural language processing machine that can understand text. For folks looking to parse huge amounts of financial reporting, it’s a great product idea.</p>
<p>What struck me when talking to Carpenter was that Thea was initially trained on the larger internet. It’s not just a financial language parsing tool. It can do more.</p>
<p>Today the company is keeping Thea’s focus on its financial niche, per the CEO. But if Intrinio can spin up something that complex using partially open source services, we could see many more intelligent systems like Thea come to market in the coming years. Fuse that to increasingly commercial quantum computing tech and it seems, just maybe, that we’re possibly on the road to eventually, one day, maybe getting closer to actual artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Yes, we were both born 50 years too early.</p>
<h2>Venture capital this, venture capital that</h2>
<p>As expected, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">the Q3 venture capital landscape was utterly bonkers</a>. Flat crazy. Historically rich. Pick your phrasing.</p>
<p>So far Q4 is looking precisely and exactly the same. A sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notion</strong> has raised a $275 million round at a valuation of $10 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/10/08/notion-raises-at-10-billion-valuation-boosted-by-remote-work-tiktok/?sh=47cdc3416490">according to Alex Konrad over at Forbes</a>. (<a href="https://twitter.com/alexrkonrad">Alex</a> has been doing great work lately, I should note.) That’s effectively free capital. How so? Notion just sold 2.75% of itself for north of a quarter billion dollars. In terms of capital efficiency in dilution terms, that’s … cheap. Especially for a startup still too worried about its revenue scale to actually share the numbers. Notion still had a bunch of its last round in the bank before this round. So, it raised a quarter billy on spec, from investors who had that much capital lying around to place a  bet on the company managing an exit of at least $30 billion in time. Let’s see.</li>
<li>And this week <strong>Modern Treasury</strong> raised <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211006005329/en/Modern-Treasury-Raises-85-Million-Passes-2-Billion-Valuation">an $85 million Series C</a> that values the “payments operations” fintech company at more than $2 billion. The company raised its Series B earlier this year when it was valued at roughly $300 million <a href="http://pitchbook.com">per PitchBook data</a>. That’s a lot of value creation in a very, <em>very</em> short period of time! But it feels pretty fitting for what we’ve seen in recent months.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this is to say that it doesn’t appear that Q4 is slowing compared to quarters two and three of this year. If 2022 doesn’t best 2021’s venture capital totals, I wonder how long it will be until we see this sort of investment again.</p>
<p>What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>In other news I wrote some more take-y stuff this week — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-might-not-be-having-fun-at-work-you-guys/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/rich-and-worried-about-the-world-put-your-money-where-your-concern-is/">here</a> — if you want something with more bite.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In a late-August ruling, China’s supreme court declared one of the country’s most infamous work practices illegal.</p>
<p>Known as “996,” the term is shorthand for a work schedule spanning from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days per week. Though popularized by the country’s soaring tech firms, often evoking images of hip urban startup employees with stock option plans hustling before being made millionaires by an IPO or funding round, “996” has evolved in how it is understood and applied by employers and employees, as well as how it is viewed by regulators.</p>
<p>Indeed, while the August 26 Supreme Court decision and issuance of guidelines from the Ministry of Human Resources will impact tech firms and their well-educated, well-compensated employees, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-authorities-say-overtime-996-policy-is-illegal-2021-08-27/">case itself</a> dealt with a worker much farther down the digital economy hierarchy: a logistics worker making a salary of 8,000RMB (roughly $1,240) per month, which is just slightly <a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2019/0705/c90000-9594926.html">below the average</a> of the country’s 37 largest cities.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215722" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>China’s regulators appear to be sending a message to employers and employees alike that the rules that define their relationship must change. As is the case with many things in China these days, what the country’s leaders are asking for will require a change not just in action, but also in the philosophies, psychologies and incentive structures at the core of Chinese society. What this change will look like is only starting to come into form.</p>
<h2>Hungry like the wolf (culture)</h2>

<p>Whether as a result of the intense work culture that has defined many Chinese companies or as the pacesetting example that many have emulated, there is perhaps no better case study of the spirit, the benefits and the potential toxicity of a 996 work culture than that of Huawei.</p>
<p>Known for its “wolf culture,” the Shenzhen-based telecoms behemoth became defined by its intensity. Depending on who you ask, the description can be interpreted in multiple ways. In a more generous interpretation, it is seen as a sort of kinship, of team members moving in coordinated packs in pursuit of a shared goal. For others, it can mean something far more brutal. “In Huawei, ‘wolf culture’ means you kill or be killed,” explained a former Huawei employee who I interviewed for <a href="https://supchina.com/2017/10/09/thinking-working-chinese-company-first-find-lenovo-huawei/">an article</a> on the company in 2017. “I think the idea is that if you have everyone in the company competing fiercely with one another, the company will be better at fighting and competing with external threats.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless of how its employees came to characterize it, the intensity central to Huawei’s culture also helped shape its success. In contrast to its European competitors Ericsson and Nokia who have been criticized for their cumbersome bureaucracy and perceived complacency, Huawei’s willingness to win and deliver projects regardless of seemingly any obstacle made them favorites of telecommunications network providers across the world.</p>
<p>Though juiced by cheap financing from the Chinese state and lucrative contracts in its domestic market that allowed it to subsidize its overseas business, there is also a competitive logic to the extreme zeal that has characterized the firm’s culture, and which also helps to explain why other Chinese firms adopted such spirit in the form of “996.”</p>
<p>While now considered cutting-edge innovators in some areas, Huawei and other Chinese firms experienced a constant struggle to overcome deficits in technological sophistication in comparison to their foreign peers in their early days. Without holding an advantage through unique or advanced tech, they achieved an edge through cost, speed and a flexibility in circumventing the obstacles to doing business that can be particularly tricky in the developing world.</p>
<p>“What Chinese tech companies seem to really understand is the value that execution can have over product,” explains Skander Garroum, a German entrepreneur who has founded startups both in China and Silicon Valley. “The U.S.-centric tech narrative is so often one of a genius who creates a great product, and due to an open internet and open economy, it scales simply due to its obvious superiority. But in China and other developing markets, [there] are more obstacles, less openness, and scaling is a question not simply of how good a product is, but how well a team executes, and how hard they work.”</p>
<p>While such narratives are often hyperbolic renditions of the truth, the willingness to outwork rivals is a badge of honor many Chinese companies carry. For ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing, its famed victory over Uber in their mid-2010s battle for the Chinese market was a result of a myriad factors. Yet to ask many who were involved, the answer is often that they simply executed better on a local level and were willing to fight harder until Uber deemed it to be simply not worth continuing the fight.</p>
<p>Self-defined by their work ethic and hunger, many firms have actively sought out individuals without a privileged background but who aspire to move above their station in life. Huawei, for example, is known to target its recruiting efforts on young, skilled people from fourth- or fifth-tier cities looking for their &#8220;first pot of gold&#8221; (<span class="s2">第一桶金 dìyī tǒng jīn), using a phrase meaning the first opportunity that a person receives to make a lot of money or to move into the middle class.</span></p>
<p>As China grew and its firms rose to global prominence, the dream of the first pot of gold was indeed achievable for many and generous compensation often accompanied the demanding work hours. For longtime Huawei employees enrolled in the company’s <a href="https://jefftowson.com/2019/10/huaweis-employee-stock-ownership-plan-esop-is-a-great-example-of-meritocracy-plus-partnership-in-china-tech-at-scale-pt-2-of-3/">share scheme</a>, annual dividends have been known to surpass hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars for individual employees, in many cases eclipsing employees’ salaries. It was hard work, but hard work that paid off.</p>
<h2>A system set up for employer exploitation</h2>
<p>Known for its infamously hard-driving work culture, it can be counterintuitive to learn that the laws on the books in China are quite protective of the rights of workers. In practice, however, these rules have rarely been enforced.</p>
<p>Though <a href="https://www.hrone.com/overtime-payments-regulations-china/">technically</a> mandating overtime pay for anything surpassing a standard five-day/40-hour work week, employers are known to avail themselves of a plethora of formal and informal methods for evading their legal obligations.</p>
<p>In the case of Huawei, this is known to come in the form of a “<a href="https://www.thenanjinger.com/news/national-news/china-work-life-imbalance-married-to-the-job/">striver pledge</a>,” a supposedly “voluntary” agreement signed by new employees in which they forego their rights to overtime pay and paid time off. Though Huawei has gained attention for such an approach, similar methods seem to be commonplace and often for companies who do not offer Huawei’s perks and paths for advancement.</p>
<p>“For our [blue-collar staff], our contracts stipulate that all overtime pay is already included in their monthly salaries,” explained one career-long HR manager who has worked for both domestic and foreign firms in China. “It’s not a good thing, but it is pretty standard throughout China as far as I know.”</p>
<div>Another method for circumventing labor law is through crafting performance metrics that give overwhelming power to management. “It is common for companies in China to take the Western performance-management concept of ‘deliverables,’ but to extend it to extremes,” said a female executive who formerly headed human resources for two large Sino-European joint ventures and who like many interviewees for this piece, requested anonymity to speak freely about a sensitive policy issue. “The ‘deliverables,’ however, will often be impossible to reach. This puts more power in the hands of the manager to determine if they deem the ‘effort’ of the employee to be satisfactory.” The executive added that she has discouraged such practices throughout her career and that they were more common with local Chinese firms than with multinationals. With such a dynamic in place, it is not difficult to imagine the myriad forms of exploitation that could potentially occur.</div>
<p>For those who have chosen to take on the system, they have often found themselves not only to be at odds with their employer, but with the state as well. Independent labor unions are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-labour/two-chinese-trade-union-officials-arrested-after-helping-workers-source-idUSKCN1NZ0SP">functionally illegal</a> in China, and the state-run All-China Federation of Trade Unions has historically been inconsistent in aiding workers in labor disputes.</p>
<p>In 2019, former 13-year Huawei employee <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50658787">Li Hongyuan</a> was jailed for 241 days over charges that he had blackmailed the company while negotiating an exit package. Though eventually freed, as prosecutors failed to find sufficient evidence of wrongdoing on his part, news of his lengthy detention was a source of considerable online outrage.</p>
<p>Popular frustration over labor issues in nominally socialist China seems to have been on the rise in recent years. In 2018, security at the elite Peking University <a href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2018/12/students-clash-with-security-over-control-of-pku-marxist-society/">cracked down</a> on protests by the school’s Marxist Society, which itself had been protesting the crackdown on labor activists in southern China. The GitHub repository “<a href="https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU">996.ICU</a>” became a popular online forum for tech workers frustrated with their companies’ brutal workplace practices to vent and bring attention to the worst-behaving companies. For burnt-out young people across China, the trend of &#8220;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/techstream/the-lying-flat-movement-standing-in-the-way-of-chinas-innovation-drive/">lying flat</a>&#8221; (tǎngpíng 躺平), which rejects the pressure and ambition that so defined earlier generations, has gained sufficient popularity that <a href="https://qz.com/2019322/why-lying-flat-a-niche-chinese-millennial-meme-alarms-beijing/">the government has lambasted the movement</a> in major newspapers.</p>

<h2>Schrödinger’s working hours: Written laws and unwritten norms</h2>
<p>Compounded by a need to reduce pressure on families and boost a dwindling birth rate, authorities are now looking to change the unwritten rules of the game that have long dictated labor relations in China.</p>
<p>In response to the August 26 ruling, many companies acted quickly to change official policies. Yet for many firms and industries, the question that looms larger is one of culture and expectations.</p>
<p>TikTok parent company ByteDance, which previously was known to officially conduct a six-day work week, brought an <a href="https://technode.com/2021/07/09/bytedance-to-end-weekend-work-in-blow-to-996-culture/">end</a> to the policy. However, this was not entirely welcomed by employees, who in exchange for reduced work days saw commensurate reductions in their pay.</p>
<p>“For many of us, we know what we’re agreeing to when we work for internet companies,” explained a woman surnamed Zhou who has worked for several such firms in China. “We know we might have to work hard, but we also get a chance to make more money,” she said. “If we wanted something different, we would have decided to work for other companies,” adding that she can understand why some ByteDance employees would be upset at the reduced hours and pay.</p>
<p>In the eyes of some China tech workers, increased pressure on companies to comply with government’s stricter expectations around working hours may just mean more informal working hours, for which they are not directly compensated. “Nothing has changed for me or my team as far as I know,” shared one employee of a popular U.S.-listed Chinese internet company. “I work on the weekends and will work over my holiday [the National Day holiday of October 1]. Just because it’s officially a day off doesn’t mean that business stops,” adding that they “of course” do not receive overtime pay for their extra working hours.</p>
<p>The idea that “business doesn’t stop” is what leaves some in doubt about whether any government regulation will have any positive impact on the condition of tech workers. “ByteDance is cutting back official hours and pay, but if nothing else changes, it doesn’t really matter,” shared Zhou bluntly. “People still want to keep their jobs and get promoted, so of course they will work as much as they can … or move to a company that will pay them more to do it.”</p>
<p>Yet for those who are higher up the management ladder, there is a much stronger inclination to take recent government mandates seriously, both in the letter and spirit of the law. “Companies have to show that they are taking action on this, and if they don’t, they risk being made an example of by authorities,” said the Sino-European corporate HR executive. “HR departments should be conducting companywide audits and getting a clear picture of what kind of hours people are working,” adding that, “the most likely outcome will probably be to hire more people, who will each work shorter hours, at least in the short term.”</p>
<p>What most do seem to agree on is the broader trend: As Xi Jinping speaks of “common prosperity” and puts the country’s corporate titans on notice, it appears as though the go-go years of China’s gilded age are coming to a close. How far the government will go in enforcing its desired changes is yet to be determined, however. For the first time in a long time, Beijing is signaling to the country’s corporate community that it will no longer tip the scales overwhelmingly in favor of business over labor. The question now is to what degree the balance of those scales will be adjusted.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency remittances are a lifeline for Afghans after the abrupt U.S. withdrawal led to Western Union temporarily ceasing operations and banks in the country severely limiting withdrawals.</p>
<p>As regulators in remittance source countries like the U.S. and U.K. turn their sights on crypto, they should remember how indispensable those currencies are to some of the world’s most vulnerable people.</p>
<p>Crypto will become increasingly indispensable as the local currency &#8212; in Afghanistan and elsewhere &#8212; becomes not only difficult to access but unreliable as a store of value. Conflict fuels inflation, which makes currencies less valuable &#8212; sometimes worthless.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215146" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If we regulate cryptocurrency transfers to appease the crypto hawks at home, we risk turning our backs (again) on those who need this asset class the most: the Afghan people and many others like them.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			For remittances to continue to be a lifeline, they need to be fast. When money is needed, it is often needed instantly.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>With the Taliban takeover comes the freezing of Afghanistan’s financial system, too. Foreign aid has halted, which makes up approximately <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-58328246">40% of Afghanistan’s GDP</a>, according to the World Bank. Similarly, foreign reserves of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-58328246">Afghanistan central bank have been frozen, which is approximately $9 billion.</a></p>
<p>What’s more, in response to the Taliban’s takeover and Western countries halting foreign aid, international money transfer companies like Western Union and MoneyGram shut off their services (in some cases, they have resumed activity, for now), leaving the average Afghan with no way to engage with the global financial system and, crucially, no way to receive remittances from relatives abroad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Remittances, the practice of sending money “back home” from rich countries,<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-help-people-in-afghanistan-as-western-union-suspends-money-transfers-into-the-country-11629225525#:~:text=Remittances%20%E2%80%94%20money%20beamed%20from%20abroad,billion%2C%20the%20World%20Bank%20said."> makes up approximately 4% of the country’s GDP</a>. In an economy that is so heavily cash dependent, the sudden crumbling of the local financial infrastructure may well mean the difference between life and death for many Afghans.</p>
<p>For remittances to continue to be a lifeline, they need to be fast. When money is needed, it is often needed instantly. An internally displaced person, for example, cannot wait three to five days for funds to clear; they need food, fuel and medical supplies today.</p>
<p>Bitcoin “maximalists” make wide-eyed claims about how crypto will change the global economic system. Whether you believe them or not, we can see that crypto has already revolutionized remittances in unstable, conflict-ridden places. Afghanistan presents a textbook use case for cryptocurrencies in failed states.</p>
<p>Sometimes, sheer necessity creates the strongest argument for new tech. Afghanistan is <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-global-crypto-adoption-index">20th on the list of 154 countries in the Global Crypto Adoption Index formulated by Chainalysis</a>, a blockchain data platform. When adjusted for peer-to-peer transactions (including remittances), it ranks seventh. In 2020, Afghanistan didn’t even make the list.</p>
<p>Afghanistan is not alone. Crypto usage has spiked recently in Lebanon, Turkey and Venezuela. Those people are not trying to get rich &#8212; they are simply trying to receive funds from relatives abroad and stop their wealth from disappearing at a time of high inflation.</p>
<p>“Many people are mining and trading [cryptocurrencies] not to acquire products, but to protect themselves from hyperinflation,” Venezuela-based crypto consultant Jhonnatan Morales <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-can-alleviate-the-financial-fallout-for-people-in-afghanistan">observed</a>.</p>
<p>Venezuela, which has one of the highest rates of inflation in the world (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-inflation/venezuela-monthly-inflation-hits-28-5-in-may-central-bank-says-idUSL2N2NY2I5">moving toward 3,000%</a>), has increasingly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/venezuelas-economy-regresses-crypto-fills-gaps-2021-06-22/">adopted cryptocurrencies</a> as its economy teeters.</p>
<p>Lebanon is another example: As the lira lost 80% of its value, Lebanese downloads of bitcoin wallet <a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/alternative-assets/463079-cryptocurrencies-offer-lebanese-place-to-put-their-cash-amid-hyperinflation">BlueWallet, for example, grew by 1,781% year on year in 2020.</a></p>
<p>But Afghanistan may be the most urgent and tragic case of why the Global South needs crypto. As cash becomes scarce, prices soar and as the Taliban loses the foreign aid the country was previously dependent upon, the already crumbling afghani currency will get even weaker. By allowing the Afghan people to receive, store and spend their wealth in bitcoin, they may be able to protect themselves against the worst effects of a failed state.</p>
<p>And this is what we must remember when we regulate cryptocurrencies in the West. That regulation will not just affect speculators; it will hit those who want to send remittances “back home.” Those who receive remittances have the most to lose.</p>
<p>When Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell publishes his report on the next stage of cryptocurrency regulations, I hope that he doesn’t forget those who need cryptocurrency the most: the Afghan people &#8212; and millions across the world like them.</p>
<p>While the West may have turned its back on the people of Afghanistan, we need to make sure that our laws don’t continue to leave them in the dark. We need cryptocurrency regulation that ensures those vital financial lifelines are not lost. If we do, we are closing another door of hope for the people who need it the most.</p>
