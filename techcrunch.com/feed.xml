This launch will carry 60 of the company&#8217;s broadband internet satellites to low-Earth orbit, where they&#8217;ll join the existing constellation and contribute to its growing network of eventually global coverage. The launch is also significant because it will potentially set a new record for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/falcon-19ff" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="falcon-19ff">Falcon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 9 rocket reusability – this marks the seventh flight for the first stage booster flying tonight.</p>

And that&#8217;s no the only way that this is SpaceX&#8217;s most reusable flights ever – the fairing covering the payload of satellites on top of the rocket includes one half that flew on one mission previously, and another half that supported not one, but two prior missions before being recovered and refurbished.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;ll also be furthering SpaceX&#8217;s mission with Starlink, which is ultimately to provide fast, low-latency and relatively low-cost broadband internet access to hard-to-reach areas around the world. SpaceX has launched nearly 900 satellites for Starlink to date, and began operating its &#8216;Better Than Nothing&#8217; early beta in parts of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/canada-c0c7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="canada-c0c7">Canada <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> last week, in addition to the areas in the U.S. where it&#8217;s offering this early access service.</p>
<p>The launch livestream will begin above at around 15 minutes prior to liftoff, or at around 9:19 PM EST (6:19 PM PST).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The space industry, once dominated by government-funded programs and a small handful of corporations, has seen a surge in startups in recent years. And with startups aplenty, the venture firms can never be far behind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been refused permission to dismiss 11 people at its EMEA headquarters in Amsterdam by the Dutch Employee Insurance Agency (UWV), the ride hailing company has confirmed.</p>
<p>The affected individuals did not take up an earlier severance offer as part of wider Uber layoffs earlier this year.</p>
<p>Uber announced major global layoffs of around 15% of its workforce in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/uber-is-laying-off-3700-as-rides-plummet-due-to-covid-19/">May</a> &#8212; which included around 200 staff based in Amsterdam &#8212; blaming the cuts on changes to demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Late last week, Dutch newspaper <a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/11/20/uwv-uber-mag-werknemers-niet-ontslaan-a4020835">NRC</a> reported that Uber had been refused permission to fire the staff as the UWV had found there were no grounds for dismissal.</p>
<p>Per its report, affected Uber employees had faced pressure to accept Uber&#8217;s severance offer &#8212; saying they were disconnected from its internal systems the day after being informed of termination via Zoom video call and were then sent daily reminders to accept dismissal with Uber telling them &#8216;their position was ceasing to exist&#8217;.</p>
<p>Dutch law requires employers to obtain approval from the UWV for planned redundancies. But the majority of the affected staff in this instance accepted its severance offer before the agency had made a decision. <a href="https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/11/20/uwv-uber-mag-werknemers-niet-ontslaan-a4020835">Local press reports</a> suggest many of those affected were expats &#8212; who may have been unaware of their labor rights under Dutch law.</p>
<p>We reached out to Uber with questions &#8212; and a company spokesperson sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier this year we made the difficult decision to reduce our global headcount due to the dramatic impact of the pandemic, and the unpredictable nature of any eventual recovery. The headcount reductions in our EMEA Headquarters in Amsterdam are part of those efforts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uber also told us it does not agree with the UWV&#8217;s decision to refuse permission for it to dismiss the 11 employees who had not accepted severance, adding that it will review the decision before determining how to proceed.</p>
<p>It said the severance packages offered to the ~200 affected employees included at least 2.5 months of salary, health benefits to the end of the year, outplacement/recruitment support and additional support for Uber-sponsored visa holders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">3D-printed rocket startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/relativity-space" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="relativity-space">Relativity Space <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005996/en">closed $500 million</a> in Series D funding (making <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/relativity-space-is-raising-a-massive-500m-round-at-2-3b-valuation/">official the earlier reported raise</a>), the company announced today. This funding was led by Tiger Global Management, and included participation by a host of new investors including Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Iconiq Capital, General Catalist and more. This brings the company&#8217;s total raised so far to nearly $700 million, as the startup is poised to launch its first ever fully 3D-printed orbital rocket next year.</p>
<p>LA-based Relativity had a big 2020, completing work on a new 120,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Long Beach. Its rocket construction technology, which is grounded in its development and use of the largest metal 3D printers in existence, suffered relatively few setbacks due to COVID-19-related shutdowns and work stoppages since it involves relatively few actual people on the factory floor managing the 3D printing process, which is handled in large part by autonomous robotic systems and software developed by the company.</p>
<p>Relativity also locked in a first official contract from the U.S. government this year, to launch a new experimental cryogenic fluid management system on behalf of client <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lockheed-martin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lockheed-martin">Lockheed Martin, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as part of NASA&#8217;s suite of Tipping Point contracts to fund the development of new technologies for space exploration. It also put into service its third-generation Stargate 3D metal printers – the largest on Earth, as mentioned.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Relativity Space is raising a massive $500M round at $2.3B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/relativity-space-is-raising-a-massive-500m-round-at-2-3b-valuation/embed/#?secret=NzK4vHQSpU" data-secret="NzK4vHQSpU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s ambitions are big, so this new large funding round should provide it with fuel to grow even more aggressively in 2021. It&#8217;s got new planned initiatives underway, both terrestrial and space-related, but CEO and founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/tim-ellis-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="tim-ellis-3">Tim Ellis <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> specifically referred to Mars and sustainable operations on the red planet as one possible application of Relativity&#8217;s tech down the road.</p>
<p>In prior conversations, Ellis has alluded to the potential for Relativity&#8217;s printers when applied to other large-scale metal manufacturing – noting that the cost curve as it stands makes most sense for rocketry, but could apply to other industries easily as the technology matures. Whether on Mars or on Earth, large-scale 3D printing definitely has a promising future, and it looks like Relativity is well-positioned to take advantage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The EPA just released its findings on the Mustang Mach-E, and it&#8217;s a mixture of good news and bad news. Depending on the model, the EPA says the Mach-E is good for just 211 miles to 300 miles on a charge. On the one hand, the Mach-E matched Ford&#8217;s range target, with the EPA agreeing with Ford&#8217;s range. On the other hand, the range is well under that found in competing vehicles, which puts the Mach-E on its backfoot as it enters the competitive electric vehicle market. Ford <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/ford-drops-the-price-of-its-all-electric-mustang-mach-e-to-stay-fully-competitive-2/">dropped the price of the Mach-E</a> in September.</p>
<p>The Mach-E will come in two powertrain variants: standard-range and extended-range, with both options available in a dual-motor, AWD setup. The extended-range option nets buyers an additional 60-70 miles of range, with this option delivering 270 miles for the AWD version and 300 for the RWD version. The standard range Mach-E comes in at 211 miles for AWD and 230 miles for RWD.</p>
<p>Those figures are nearly identical to what Ford targeted with the Mach-E, signaling the automaker&#8217;s improving engineering quality.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With a max range of 400 miles on a two-wheel-drive model, the Mach-E range falls well short of the Tesla Model 3, available in 400 mile-range variants for similar prices as the Mustang Mach-E. Tesla&#8217;s more comparable Model Y also has a superior range to the Mustang Mach-E. Tesla&#8217;s crossover has a max range of 326 miles with the dual-motor AWD version compared to Mach-E&#8217;s 270 miles for a similar configuration.</p>
<p>The Mustang Mach-E is Ford&#8217;s first major electric vehicle. Customers will start taking delivery of pre-orders this December. The vehicle is launching in a space that&#8217;s increasingly becoming more competitive. Along with Tesla, the Mustang Mach-E must sell against the fantastic Polestar 2, Audi&#8217;s growing line of electric vehicles, and Kia/Hyundai&#8217;s affordable electric crossovers. Some have longer range, and others are less expensive than Ford&#8217;s first EV.</p>
<p>The Mustang Mach-E is just the start of Ford&#8217;s electric offering, and the automaker likely understood the range would fall short of the market leaders. The goal is seemingly to kick off Ford&#8217;s EV stable with an exciting, affordable vehicle, and the Mach-E seems to fit that role despite the short range.</p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s note: This article previously listed the Polestar 2 as having a ranging similar to the Model 3. That&#8217;s incorrect and has been fixed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A spate of startups focused on mental health recently made enough noise as a group that they caught the eye of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a> podcast crew. Sadly, the segment we&#8217;d planned to discuss this topic was swept away by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/21/how-the-pandemic-drove-the-ipo-wave-we-see-today/">blizzard of IPO filings</a> that piled up like fresh snow.</p>
<p>But in preparation, I reached out to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/">CB Insights</a> for new data on the mental health startup space that they were kind enough to supply. So this morning we&#8217;re going to dig into it.</p>
<p>Regular readers of The Exchange will recall that we last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/funding-for-mental-health-focused-startups-rises-in-2020/">dug into overall wellness venture capital investment in August</a>, noting that it was mental health startups inside the vertical that were seeing the most impressive results.</p>

<hr />
<p>I wanted to know what had happened even more recently.</p>
<p>After all, Spring Health recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spring-health-raises-76-million-in-series-b-financing-301176026.html">raised $76 million</a> for its service that helps companies offer their workers mental health benefits, <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/mantra-health-tackles-college-mental-healthcare-closed-loop-virtual-care">Mantra Health disclosed</a> that it has raised $3.2 million to help with college-age mental health issues and Joon Care announced $3.5 million in new capital to &#8220;grow its remote therapy service for teens and young adults,&#8221; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/joon-raises-3-5m/">per GeekWire</a>.</p>
<p>Sticking to theme, Headway just raised $32 million to build a platform that &#8220;helps people search for and engage therapists who accept insurance for payments,&#8221; according <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/headway-raises-26m-to-help-people-find-therapists-and-therapists-to-accept-insurance/">to our own reporting</a>, and online therapy provider <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/talkspace-said-to-work-with-advisers-on-possible-sale?sref=gni836kR">Talkspace is pursuing a sale</a> &#8212; it looks like an active time in the mental health startup realm.</p>

<h2>The state of mental health venture investing</h2>
<p>To prepare the ground, let&#8217;s talk about the general state of healthcare investing in the venture capital world. Per <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cb-insights" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cb-insights">CB Insights&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/healthcare-trends-q3-2020/">Q3 healthcare VC report</a>, venture capital deal volume and venture capital dollar volume reached new record highs in the sector during Q3 2020.</p>
<p>The quarter&#8217;s 1,539 rounds and $21.8 billion in invested capital were each comfortably ahead of prior records set in Q2 2018 for round volume (1,431) and Q2 2020 for dollar volume ($18.4 billion) for healthcare startups.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://superpeer.com">Superpeer</a>, a startup that helps experts share and monetize their knowledge online, is announcing that it has raised $8 million in additional funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/superpeer/">As I wrote in March</a>, the Superpeer platform allows experts to promote, schedule and charge for one-on-one video calls with anyone who might want to ask for their advice.</p>
<p>In addition to announcing funding, the startup is also moving beyond one-on-one sessions by launching paid channels, where experts can charge a subscription fee for access to larger group sessions with video and chat. Co-founder and CEO Devrim Yasar suggested that channels allow <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/superpeer" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="superpeer">Superpeer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> experts to be more accessible, hosting sessions that cost less money to watch and reach a larger audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It can be hard to say, &#8216;Hi I&#8217;m Anthony Ha, if you want to talk to me,<br />
my hourly rate is $500,'&#8221; Yasar said. (To be clear: I would never say that.) &#8220;But if you have a channel where anyone can subscribe for $1 or $5, that makes you feel better that you are accessible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plus, you can still offer (and charge more for) one-on-one meetings, say for subscribers who still have &#8220;burning questions&#8221; after a channel session.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the midst of the pandemic, we&#8217;re seeing a widespread embrace of online mentoring and content as new source of source. Last week, for example, Squarespace </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/squarespace-member-areas/">launched a new paywall feature called Member Areas</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, and I&#8217;ve also written about </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/prox/">another video mentoring platform called Prox</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>Yasar acknowledged that things are getting pretty competitive, but he said that Superpeer is trying to build the most attractive brand for public intellectuals and thought leaders — he described the vision (half-jokingly, half-proudly) as &#8220;OnlyFans for brains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are an intellectual, if you have an audience, if you are a TED speaker with 30 million views on your video, you&#8217;ve never had a platform to really monetize that audience,&#8221; Yasar said. &#8220;All you could do is maybe write a book and sell that, you could be a guest at someone else&#8217;s event [but not much else]. Those people don&#8217;t want to go to YouTube or Instagram, that&#8217;s not the brand that they associate themselves with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond branding, Yasar said that Superpeer has also worked hard on the technology side to create a lightweight video experience in the browser.</p>
<p>The new round comes from Acrew Capital, Audacious Ventures, Homebrew, Moxxie Ventures, Brianne Kimmel, Scott Belsky and OnDeck, and it brings Superpeer&#8217;s total funding to $10 million.</p>
<p>Yasar said the startup will be expanding its growth, partnership and revenue teams. It will also be offering financial support for experts through a brand ambassador program, though the company is still working out the details.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;d like to see the platform in action, I&#8217;ll also be <a href="https://superpeer.com/nihal/event/eniac-extras-1">talking to Yasar and his investors</a> at Eniac Ventures tomorrow in a free session at noon Eastern.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gatik-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gatik-ai">Gatik, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the autonomous vehicle startup focused on the &#8220;middle mile,&#8221; is already using its self-driving box trucks to deliver customer online grocery orders for Walmart. Now, the company — freshly stocked with $25 million in Series A funding — is expanding up into Canada with a partnership with retail giant Loblaw.</p>
<p>Gatik said Monday that five autonomous box trucks in Toronto will be used to deliver goods for Loblaw starting in January 2021. The fleet will be used seven days a week on five routes along public roads. All vehicles will have a safety driver as a co-pilot. This deployment, which follows 10-month pilot in the Toronto area, marks the first autonomous delivery fleet in Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;As more Canadians turn to online grocery shopping, we&#8217;ve looked at ways to make our supply chain more efficient. Middle-mile autonomous delivery is a great example,&#8221;Loblaw Digital senior vice president Lauren Steinberg said in a statement. &#8220;With this initial rollout in Toronto, we are able to move goods from our automated picking facility multiple times a day to keep pace with PC Express online grocery orders in stores around the city.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike other autonomous delivery companies, Gatik isn&#8217;t targeting consumers. Instead, the startup is using its autonomous trucks to shuttle groceries and other goods from large distribution centers to retail locations. For Loblaw, the company will equip Ford Transit 350 box trucks with refrigeration units, lift gates and its autonomous self-driving software.</p>
<p>&#8220;Retailers know the biggest inefficiencies in their logistics operations often exist in the middle-mile, typically between automated picking facilities and retail locations,&#8221; Gatik CEO and co-founder Gautam Narang said in a statement. &#8220;This is where Gatik lives and succeeds, and is the reason we&#8217;re able to offer immediate value to our customers. We are delighted to partner with Loblaw in addressing this critical piece of their supply chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gatik&#8217;s &#8216;middle mile&#8217; B2B focus has attracted customers like Walmart as well as investors, including Wittington Ventures and Innovation Endeavors, which co-led the company&#8217;s Series A round. FM Capital and Intact Ventures along with existing investors lDynamo Ventures, Fontinalis Partners, AngelPad also participated in the round that was announced alongside the Loblaw partnership. Gatik has raised $29.5 million to date.</p>
<p>The company said it plans to use the funding to build out operations across North America and hire more employees at its Palo Alto, California and Toronto facilities. Narang said Gatik is also pushing to expand its retail partnerships and fleet deployments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout the year we saw an increase of 30% to 35% in orders from our customer base, and we expect this trend to continue,&#8221; Narang said. &#8220;We will continue to bring autonomous delivery into the mainstream, driving substantial efficiencies in supply chain logistics for retailers across North America and beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gatik said it has completed more than 30,000 revenue-generating autonomous orders for multiple customers across North America.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook today is introducing a new feature that will allow users in the U.S. to collect food, clothing, and other necessities for people in need. The feature, called &#8220;Drives,&#8221; is being made available through Facebook&#8217;s existing Community Help hub, which is the place where Facebook centralizes requests and offers for help within a local community. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today is introducing a new feature that will allow users in the U.S. to collect food, clothing, and other necessities for people in need. The feature, called &#8220;Drives,&#8221; is being made available through Facebook&#8217;s existing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/community_help/?page_source=fb_marketing_covid_mar_campaign">Community Help hub</a>, which is the place where Facebook centralizes requests and offers for help within a local community.</p>
<p>The Community Help hub was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/community-help/">launched</a><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2017/02/empowering-people-to-help-one-another-within-safety-check/"> in 2017</a> as a way for Facebook users to centralize their resources in the wake of a crisis, like a man-made, accidental or natural disaster, ranging from weather events to terrorist attacks, and more. In 2020, however, the feature has been put to broader use as a part of Facebook&#8217;s COVID-19 efforts, which even saw a version of Community Help feature scaled globally to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/facebook-launches-a-global-version-of-its-community-help-feature-in-response-to-the-covid-19-pandemic/">help those impacted</a> by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Now, with the economic crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., millions are out of work and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/12-million-americans-set-to-lose-unemployment-benefits-by-years-end.html">12 million may lose</a> their unemployment benefits in December when CARES Act provisions lapse. <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/reports-on-impact-of-the-pandemic-on-women-at-home-and-in-business/">Food insecurity</a> and an inability to pay bills, including rent and mortgage payments, as well as manage other household expenses, are <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/tracking-the-covid-19-recessions-effects-on-food-housing-and">impacting millions as well</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Drives, Facebook will allow users to create and share their own efforts in collecting items for those in need, like a Canned Food Drive that&#8217;s looking to gather items for local shelters, a Clothing Drive, or any other event where someone is working to collect items to help others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077481" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077481" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077481" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png 2516w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Drives-Screenshot-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077481" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>To create a Drive, type &#8220;Community Help&#8221; into Facebook Search to find the shortcut that takes you to the Community Help hub. From there, click the &#8220;Request or Offer Help&#8221; button, and on the bottom sheet that appears, click &#8220;Create Drive.&#8221; You can then fill out the form, setting a goal for the number of items you want to collect. When you post the Drive, others will be able to see what&#8217;s still needed with this goal tracker. Once created, the Drive will appear in your News Feed and Timeline like a regular post, in addition to appearing in Community Help.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out starting today, but Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/give-back-during-holidays-season-of-giving/">blog post originally said</a> the feature may not be widely available to all for &#8220;weeks.&#8221; That would be unfortunate, given that many people likely want to run holiday-related Drives within the hub to help get food for holiday meals or toys for families in need, for example. (After publication of our article, Facebook updated the blog post to say &#8220;coming days&#8221; and emailed TechCrunch to say it will expedite the feature to ensure it arrives in time for the holidays.)</p>
<p>Facebook notes that all posts in Community Help, including Drives, are reviewed to ensure they don&#8217;t violate Facebook’s Community Standards or its Community Help Product Policies. These policies prohibit insensitive and promotional content, spam, inauthentic posts, and posts from users under 18, among other things. If posts are found to be in violation, they&#8217;re taken down, the company says.</p>
<p>Drives is one of several efforts around holiday giving that Facebook announced today. The company also says it will match up to $7 million in eligible donations to U.S. nonprofits on GivingTuesday (Dec. 1), and is running its own fundraiser, &#8220;Peace Through Music: A Global Event For Social Justice&#8221; exclusively on Facebook Live. The event, on Dec. 1 at 12 PM ET, will feature Aloe Blacc, Billie Eilish, Becky G, Carlos Santana &amp; Cindy Blackman Santana, Killer Mike, Ringo Starr, Skip Markey, and others. The event will support the <a href="https://playingforchange.org/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://playingforchange.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606231545346000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wZvOQGoakivLWUlLtUhi6">Playing for Change Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UNFPA/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/UNFPA/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606231545346000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ea_TYppokXkdcQU92LCvF">United Nations Population Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sankofadotorg/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/sankofadotorg/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606231545347000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1VeD1g03_7Wi_xLMKZ0viq">Sankofa</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/silkroadproject/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/silkroadproject/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606231545347000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0x1T3zf1Lq8vURW5e1YapH">Silkroad</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rockandrollhalloffame" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/rockandrollhalloffame&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1606231545347000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ybrgwEVlyT0s1tFHHsH0E">The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will soon gain new fundraising tools. Today, Instagram users can fundraise with stickers on Stories and on Instagram Live. A new feature will allow Instagram users to post fundraisers to their Instagram Feed, too, but Facebook didn&#8217;t offer a timeframe as to when that feature would launch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[An analysis of the total cost to UK businesses if the country fails to gain an adequacy agreement from the European Commission once it leaves the bloc at the end of the year &#8212; creating barriers to inbound data flows from the EU &#8212; suggests the price in pure compliance terms could be between £1BN [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An <a href="https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/NEF_DATA-INADEQUACY.pdf">analysis</a> of the total cost to UK businesses if the country fails to gain an adequacy agreement from the European Commission once it leaves the bloc at the end of the year &#8212; creating barriers to inbound data flows from the EU &#8212; suggests the price in pure compliance terms could be between £1BN and £1.6BN.</p>
<p>The assessment of the economic impacts if the UK is deemed a third country under EU data rules has been carried out by the <a href="https://neweconomics.org">New Economics Foundation</a> (NEF) think tank and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/european-institute/">UCL&#8217;s European Institute</a> research hub &#8212; with the researchers  conducting interviews with over 60 legal professionals, data protection officers, business representatives, and academics, from the UK and EU.</p>
<p>They are estimating that the average compliance cost for an affected micro business will be £3,000; or £10,000 for a small business; £19,555 for a medium business; and £162,790 for a large business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This extra cost stems from the additional compliance obligations – such as setting up standard contractual clauses (SCCs) – on companies that want to continue transferring data from the EU to the UK,&#8221; they write in the report. &#8220;We believe our modelling is a relatively conservative estimate as it is underpinned by moderate assumptions about the firm-level cost and number of companies affected.&#8221;</p>
<p>An adequacy agreement refers to a status that can be conferred on a country outside the European Economic Area (as the UK will be once the Brexit transition is over) &#8212; if the EU&#8217;s executive deems the levels of data protection in the country are essentially equivalent to what&#8217;s provided by European law.</p>
<p>The UK has said it wants to gain an adequacy agreement with the EU as it works on implementing the 2016 referendum vote to leave the bloc. But there are doubts over its chances of obtaining the coveted status &#8212; not least because of surveillance powers enshrined in UK law since the 2013 Snowden disclosures (which revealed the extent of Western governments&#8217; snooping on digital data flows).</p>
<p>Broad powers that sanction UK state agencies&#8217; digital surveillance have faced a number of legal challenges under UK and EU law.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK surveillance regime dealt another blow in court&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/27/uk-mass-surveillance-regime-dealt-another-blow-in-court/embed/#?secret=xz4WADxKkt" data-secret="xz4WADxKkt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The government has also signalled an intention to &#8216;liberalize&#8217; domestic data laws as it leaves the EU &#8212; writing in a national data strategy published in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/uk-wants-pandemic-levels-of-data-sharing-to-be-the-new-normal/">September</a> that it wants to ensure data is not &#8220;inappropriately constrained&#8221; by regulations &#8220;so that it can be used to its full potential”.</p>
<p>But any moves to denude the UK&#8217;s data protection standards risk an &#8216;inadequate&#8217; finding by the Commission.</p>
<p>Europe&#8217;s top court, meanwhile, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">set a clear line</a> that governments cannot use national security to bypass general principles of EU law, such as proportionality and respect for privacy.</p>
<p>Another major &#8212; and highly pertinent &#8212; ruling by the CJEU this summer invalidated an adequacy status the Commission had previously conferred on the US, striking down the EU-US Privacy Shield transatlantic data transfer mechanism. It does not bode well for the UK&#8217;s chances of adequacy.</p>
<p>The court also made it clear that the most used alternative for international transfers (a legal tool called Standard Contractual Clauses, aka SCCs) must face proactive scrutiny from EU regulators when data is flowing to third countries where citizens&#8217; information could be at risk.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9m9Fv5VLqd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s top court strikes down flagship EU-US data transfer mechanism&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/embed/#?secret=9m9Fv5VLqd" data-secret="9m9Fv5VLqd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The thousands of companies that had been relying on Privacy Shield to rubberstamp their EU to US data flows are now scrambling for alternatives on a case by case basis &#8212; with vastly inflated legal risk, complexity and administration requirements.</p>
<p>The same may be true in very short order for scores of UK-based data controllers that want to continue being able to receive inbound data flows from users in the EU after the end of the Brexit transition.</p>
<p>Earlier this month the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) put out 38 pages of guidance for those trying to navigate new legal uncertainty around SCCs &#8212; in which it warned there may be situations where no supplementary measures will suffice to ensure adequate protection for a specific transfer.</p>
<p>The solution in such a case might require relocation of the data processing to a site within the EU, the EDPB said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&#8220;Although the UK has high standards of data protection via the Data Protection Act 2018, which enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gdpr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gdpr">GDPR) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in UK law, an EU adequacy decision is not guaranteed,&#8221; the NEF/UCL report warns. &#8220;Potential EU concerns with UK national security, surveillance and human rights frameworks, as well as a future trade deal with the US, render adequacy uncertain. Furthermore, EUUK data flows are at the whim of the wider Brexit process and negotiations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Per their analysis, if the UK does not get an adequacy decision it will face an increased risk of GDPR fines due to increased compliance requirements.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> sanctions financial penalties for violations of the framework that can scale up to 4% of an entity&#8217;s global annual turnover or €20M, whichever is greater.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The report also predicts a reduction in EU-UK trade, especially digital trade; reduced investment (both domestic and international); and the relocation of business functions, infrastructure, and personnel outside the UK.</span></p>
<p>The researchers argue that more research is needed to support a wider macroeconomic assessment of the value of data flows and adequacy decisions &#8212; saying there&#8217;s a paucity of research on &#8220;the value of data flows and adequacy decisions in general&#8221; &#8212; before adding: <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;EU-UK data flows are a crucial enabler for thousands of businesses. These flows underpin core business operations and activities which add significant value. This is not just a digital tech sector issue – the whole economy relies on data flows.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The report makes a number of recommendations &#8212; including urging the UK government to make &#8220;relevant data and modelling tools&#8221; available to support empirical research on the social and economic impacts of data protection, digital trade, and the value of data flows to help shape better public policy and debate.</p>
<p>It also calls for the government to set aside funds for struggling UK SMEs to help them with the costs of complying with Brexit&#8217;s legal data burden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our report concludes that no adequacy decision has the potential to be a contributing factor which undermines the competitiveness of key UK services and digital technology sectors, which have performed extremely strongly in recent years. Although we do not want to exaggerate the impacts &#8212; and no adequacy decision is far from economic armageddon &#8212; this outcome would not be ideal,&#8221; they add.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://avepoint.com/">AvePoint</a>, a company that gives enterprises using Microsoft Office 365, SharePoint and Teams a control layer on top of these tools, announced today that it would be going public via a SPAC merger with <a href="https://apexacquisitioncorp.com/">Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation</a> in a deal that values AvePoint at around $2 billion.</p>
<p>The acquisition brings together some powerful technology executives with Apex run by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs head of technology investment banking Brad Koenig, who will now be working closely with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/avepoint" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="avepoint">AvePoint&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Tianyi Jiang. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777921/000121390019018376/f424b4091719_apextech.htm">Apex filed for a $305 million SPAC</a> in September 2019.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the transaction, Apex’s balance of $352 million plus a $140 million additional private investment will be handed over to AvePoint. Once transaction fees and other considerations are paid for, AvePoint is expected to have $252 million on its balance sheet. Existing AvePoint shareholders will own approximately 72% of the combined entity, with the balance held by the Apex SPAC and the private investment owners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jiang sees this is a way to keep growing the company. &#8220;Going public now gives us the ability to meet this demand and scale up faster across product innovation, channel marketing, international markets and customer success initiatives,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way.</p>

<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/avepoint-grabs-200m-series-c-for-microsoft-cloud-governance-tools/">raised $200 million in January</a> this year led by Sixth Street Partners (formerly TPG Sixth Street Partners), with additional participation from prior investor Goldman Sachs, meaning that Koenig was probably familiar with the company based on his previous role.</p>
<p>The company has raised a total of $294 million in capital before today’s announcement. It expects to generate almost $150 million in revenue by the end of this year with ARR growing at over 30%. It&#8217;s worth noting that the company&#8217;s ARR and revenue has been growing steadily since Q12019. The company is projecting significant growth for the next two years with revenue estimates of $257 million and ARR of $220 million by the end of 2022.</p>

<p>The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. Upon close the company will continue to be known as AvePoint and be publicly traded on NASDAQ under the new ticker symbol AVPT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.curehydration.com/">Cure Hydration</a> is announcing that it has raised $2.6 million in seed funding as it brings a healthier approach to the sports beverage market.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Lauren Picasso, whose past roles include serving as director of marketing at Jet.com, told me that she became interested in the market after training for a triathlon; she&#8217;d often feel dehydrated even after drinking lots of water. (This is also something I struggled with while training for a marathon last year — and yes, I&#8217;m only mentioning this because I really want you to know that I ran a marathon.)</p>
<p>The obvious solution was to drink Gatorade or something similar to replenish her electrolytes, but Picasso said, &#8220;When I started looking for electrolyte products that were healthy and effective, I realized everything on the market still uses a base of sugar.&#8221; In fact the average sports drink contains <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/is-gatorade-bad-for-you#cons-of-gatorade">36 grams of sugar</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So Picasso and the Cure team developed a new beverage <a href="https://www.curehydration.com/pages/why-cure">based on the World Health Organization&#8217;s Oral Rehydration Solution</a>, which Picasso said is &#8220;primarily used to help people suffering from diseases like cholera,&#8221; and which has saved &#8220;millions of lives and is proven to hydrate as effectively as an IV drip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cure uses the ORS as a foundation to create a range of flavored beverages (it&#8217;s adding the new flavors Ruby Riot Grapefruit and Laser Focus Matcha). The core ingredients include coconut water and pink Himalayan salt, while everything is organic and vegan, with no added sugars.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077457" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077457" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2077457" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Cure Hydration" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cure-Hydration_Image-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077457" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cure-hydration" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cure-hydration">Cure Hydration</p></div></p> <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>
<p>The startup sells these drinks in the form of powders that you mix with water. On its website, they cost $20.99 for a pack of 14, or $16.79 of you subscribe. (The company donates 1% of proceeds to the women&#8217;s sports nonprofit <a href="https://www.sheissport.com">SheIS</a>.) Picasso said early customers have tended to be amateur athletes and people who need help staying hydrated due to chronic illnesses and other health conditions.</p>
<p>The product is also available in stores like CVS, Walmart and Whole Foods. Picasso said that one of her goals with the funding is to continue expanding Cure&#8217;s retail footprint beyond its current 4,200 locations across the United States.</p>
<p>She also plans to develop new products beyond hydration, though she said they will stay true to the company&#8217;s &#8220;guiding principles&#8221; that all its products are &#8220;backed by science&#8221; and &#8220;taste delicious.&#8221; The company has a medical advisory board that includes Dr. Roshini Rajapaksa, a gastroenterologist; Dr. Dana Cohen, the author of &#8220;Quench&#8221;; and nutritionist Brooke Alpert, author of &#8220;The Sugar Detox.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lerer-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lerer-ventures">Lerer Hippeau, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from M3 Ventures, Litani Ventures, Andy Roddick, Nas, Matthew Dellavedova, Casper CEO Philip Krim, mParticle CEO Michael Katz, Thrive Market CEO Nick Green and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, more than ever, consumers are prioritizing health in their daily lives and looking for products that are not only effective, but better-for-you,&#8221; said Lerer Hippeau Principal Caitlin Strandberg in a statement. &#8220;Lauren is an exceptional operator and we&#8217;ve been impressed with her ability to bring a WHO-approved formulation to market without compromising on product quality or efficacy. With this cash infusion and retail expansion, we&#8217;re excited to see Cure get into even more hands.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://joinblvd.com">Boulevard</a>, a spa management and payment platform, has raised $27 million in a new round of funding despite a business slowdown caused by the COVID0-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Founded four years ago by Matt Danna and Sean Stavropoulos, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boulevard-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boulevard-3">Boulevard <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was inspired by Stavropoulos&#8217; inability to book a haircut and Danna&#8217;s hunch that the inability of salons and spas to cater to customers like the busy programmer could be indicative of a bigger problem.</p>
<p>The two spent months pounding the pavement in Los Angeles pretending to be college students doing research on the industry. They spoke with salon owners in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and other trendy neighborhoods trying to get a sense of where software and services were falling short.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through those months of interviews the two developed the booking management and payment platform that would become Boulevard. The inspiration was one part Shopify and one part ServiceTitan, Danna said.</p>
<p>The idea was that the Boulevard could build a pretty large business catering to the needs of a niche industry that hadn&#8217;t traditionally been exposed to a purpose-built toolkit for its vertical.</p>
<p>Investors including Index Ventures, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/toba-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="toba-capital">Toba Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> VMG Partners, Bonfire Ventures, Ludlow Ventures and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boxgroup" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boxgroup">BoxGroup <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> agreed.</p>
<p>That could be because of the size of the industry. There&#8217;s over $250 billion spent per year across roughly 3 million businesses in the salon and spa category, according to data provided by the company. By comparison, fitness attracts roughly $34 billion in annual spending from 150,000 businesses.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With limited access to the professionals that help us look and feel our best, I think the world has realized something that our team has always recognized: salons and spas are more than a luxury, they are essential to our well-being,” said Danna, in a statement. “We are humbled that so many businesses are placing their trust in us during such a turbulent time. This new capital will help accelerate our mission and deliver value to salons and spas that they never imagined was possible from technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data provided by the company, Boulevard is definitely giving businesses a boost. On average, businesses increase bookings by 16%, retail revenue jumps by 18%, and gratuity paid out to stylists jumps by 24% for businesses that use Boulevard, the company said. It also reduces no-shows and cancellations, and halves time spent on the phone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Boulevard is revitalizing the salon and spa industry, as evidenced by the company’s sustained 300-400% revenue growth over the last three years,” said Damir Becirovic of Index Ventures, whose firm led the company&#8217;s Series A round and has doubled down with the new capital infusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers using the company&#8217;s software</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include: Chris McMillan the Salon, Heyday, MèCHE Salon, Paintbox, Sassoon Salon, SEV Laser, Spoke &amp; Weal, and TONI&amp;GUY.</span></p>
<p>Boulevard now has 90 employees and will look to increase that number as it continues to expand across the country.</p>
<p>Investors have taken a run at the spa market in the past, with company&#8217;s like MindBody valued at over $1 billion for its software services. Indeed, that company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mindbody-m-a-vista-equity-partners/vista-equity-partners-to-buy-mindbody-in-a-1-9-billion-deal-idUSKCN1ON0QG">was taken private two years ago</a> in a $1.9 billion transaction by Vista Equity Partners.</p>
<p>As Boulevard expands, the company may look to get deeper into financial services for the salons and spas that it&#8217;s already working with. Given the company&#8217;s window into these businesses&#8217; financing, it&#8217;s not impossible to image a new line of business providing small business loans to these companies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something that the founders would likely not rule out. And it&#8217;s a way to provide more tools to entrepreneurs that often fall outside of the traditional sweet spot for banks and other lenders, Danna said.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1894192 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png" alt="the station scooter1a" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-scooter1a.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>COVID-19 has obliterated entire business models, while boosting others. Micromobility startups were some that suffered in the early days of the pandemic. However, there appears to be a recovery. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/limebike" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="limebike">Lime <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the latest example.</p>
<p>Lime said this week it has moved beyond the financial hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, is now largely profitable. Alex Wilhelm and I raised our eyebrows at this and asked for more detail. As you might know, there are all kinds of tricks to be able to claim profitability. What we learned from the company — and yes, reader I know, it&#8217;s a private company and therefore no public filing — was rosier than we expected.</p>
<p>Lime said it was both operating cash flow positive and free cash flow positive in the third quarter &#8212; a first &#8212; and is on pace to be full-year profitable, excluding certain costs (EBIT), in 2021. In general, cash flow positivity is an important threshold for a startup to reach because it implies that the company can largely self-fund from that point forward, limiting its dependency on external cash for survival.</p>
<p>Lime also claimed that it &#8220;reached EBIT positive at the company level over the summer.&#8221; The specifics of the phrase &#8220;EBIT positive&#8221; are important. Was the company employing strict EBIT on its math and not discounting share-based compensation, or was it measuring using adjusted EBIT as many startups do, removing the cost of share-based compensation that shows up in GAAP results? According to the company the number did exclude share-based compensation, making the news slightly smaller.</p>
<p>And finally, the last most bullish data point. The company said it expects to be full-year profitable in 2021. TechCrunch asked for specifics because again how one measures profitability matters. It turns out, Lime is basing this projection on EBIT, as opposed to more traditional net income. For a startup this is not a surprising decision, but before we declare Lime fully &#8220;profitable,&#8221; we&#8217;ll want some more GAAP metrics.</p>
<p><strong>In other Lime news &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>The company launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/lime-plans-for-modes-beyond-bikes-and-scooters-in-2021/">fourth-generation scooter</a> in Paris, a device designed to last more than two years. The Gen4 will roll out across Europe in early 2021. Much of the Gen4 work was done by engineers at Uber’s Jump micromobility unit. Lime did some tweaking to the Jump team&#8217;s work, specifically improving the scooter&#8217;s durability and swapped out some parts that would allow the company to reuse parts from existing Lime vehicles.</p>
<p>Lime also teased that a &#8220;third mode,&#8221; beyond bikes and scooters, is also in the works for the first quarter of 2021, as well as the addition of third-party companies to its platform.</p>
<hr />
<p>I recommend that you take the time to read an article by two of TechCrunch&#8217;s European reporters Natasha Lomas and Romain Dillet. The pair examined the urban transformation that is underway in Paris, Barcelona, London and Milan, specifically policy decisions aimed reclaiming streets for feet and two wheels.</p>
<p>A few highlights include Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo&#8217;s efforts to create a &#8220;15-minute city&#8221; and Barcelona&#8217;s ambitious pedestrianization plan focused on creating ‘superilles’ or ‘superblocks.’</p>
<p>Grab a coffee and get comfortable for this detailed breakdown.</p>

<p><strong>Oh! wait &#8230; a couple of other micromobbin&#8217; items &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Voi</strong>, another European electric scooter startup, is equipping its devices with computer vision sensors to detect pedestrians and sidewalks. The aim, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/11/11/escooter-startup-voi-uses-ai-to-detect-pedestrians-and-sidewalks/">VentureBeat reports</a>, is to help users avoid collisions and comply with local legal requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Zipp Mobility</strong>, the Irish micromobility startup, is now operating in two Buckinghamshire towns under a year-long pilot program. The company will launch with 25 electric scooters in each area, with plans to increase the fleet size to 300 scooters over the next two months.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>The summer of the SPAC has spilled over into fall and is threatening to continue into 2021. Startups aiming to produce and sell electric vehicles seem to be particularly fond of this path to becoming a public company. We have Canoo, Fisker, Lordstown Motors, Hyliion, Nikola and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/arrival-becomes-latest-electric-vehicle-startup-to-test-the-public-markets-with-a-spac/">now Arrival</a>.</p>
<p>Arrival was an unknown UK startup that operated quietly for about five years until bursting on the public scene in January with a $110 million investment from Hyundai and Kia. It soon became one of the UK&#8217;s most valuable startups with a valuation of $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Arrival&#8217;s aim is to produce electric vehicles that are competitive in price with traditional fossil fuel-powered vehicles and lower than other EVs. Arrival&#8217;s pitch is that its modular electric &#8220;skateboard&#8221; platform, which can be used on a range of different vehicle types, along with its use of microfactories are the key ingredients to its price competitive sauce. So far, the company has two vehicles — an electric van and bus. Production of its buses are expected to start in the fourth quarter 2021 and its vans in 2022.</p>
<p>OK, so the gist of the deal is this: Arrival agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company CIIG Merger Corp. with a market valuation up to $5.4 billion. Arrival raised $400 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors that included Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Wellington Management, BNP Paribas Asset Management Energy Transition Fund and funds managed by BlackRock. Arrival will have about $660 million in cash proceeds.</p>
<p>On a side note, the company was founded by Denis Sverdlov, who also created Roborace.</p>

<h3><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Electric Last Mile Solutions</strong>, a Michigan-based electric vehicle startup founded by former Accuride and Ford executive Jason Luo, is in talks to go public through a merger with Forum Merger III Corp., <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-18/electric-last-mile-said-to-be-in-merger-talks-with-forum-spac?sref=AwwRcx4b">Bloomberg reported</a>. The startup aims to produce mre than 100,000 vehicles a year at a plant in Indiana. Caveat: the terms are not finalized.</p>
<p><strong>Fenix</strong>, a new Abu Dhabi micromobility startup, raised $3.8 million in a seed round investment led by Israel-based venture firm Maniv Mobility. The deal is notable for a few reasons. Remember Circ? It&#8217;s the Middle East scooter company that Bird acquired and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/bird-shuts-down-circ-operations-in-middle-east-scraps-as-many-as-10000-scooters/">then shuttered in several cities</a>. The founders of Circ, Jaideep Dhanoa and IQ Sayed (who were also colleagues at Careem), started Fenix. Maniv Mobility founder and managing partner Michael Granoff told me this is the first Israeli VC to invest in a UAE-based tech company. Granoff is joining the Fenix board. &#8220;Aside from more momentum toward clean and practical urban mobility, I think it heralds an amazing new age of cooperation in the Middle East,&#8221; Granoff wrote me in an email touting the deal.</p>
<p><strong>Forto</strong>, a digital freight forwarder, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/digital-freight-forwarder-forto-raises-another-50m-in-round-led-by-inven-capital/">raised $50 million</a> in a funding round led by Inven Capital, a growth fund out of the Czech Republic. Additional investment came from Iris Capital as well as existing investors Rider Global, Northzone, Cherry Ventures, Unbound (Shravin Mittal) and the Italian venture fund H14.</p>
<p><strong>Gojek</strong>, the ride-hailing firm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/indonesian-telecom-network-telkomsel-invests-150-million-in-gojek/">raised $150 million</a> from Indonesia&#8217;s biggest telecom network Telkomsel. This is being sold as a &#8220;strategic partnership,&#8221; and seems to expand upon the companies&#8217; existing relationship. Since 2018, Gojek and Telkomsel have maintained a deal to subsidize the cost of mobile data consumed by the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s driver partners.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning EMotors</strong>, a Colorado-based fleet electrification company, is in advanced talks to go public through a merger with blank-check firm GigCapital3 Inc., <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-19/lightning-emotors-said-in-talks-to-go-public-via-gigcapital3?sref=AwwRcx4b">Bloomberg reported</a>. There is still some ways to go on this deal, however. GigCapital3 is trying to raise about $100 million in new equity to support a transaction that would create a combined entity worth $700 million to $1 billion, including debt.</p>
<p><strong>Loadsmart</strong>, an on-demand digital freight platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/loadsmart-raises-90-million-to-further-consolidate-its-one-stop-freight-and-logistics-platform/">raised $90 million</a> in a Series C funding round co-led by funds under management by BlackRock and Chromo Invest. Strategic investor TFI International, a leader in the logistics space, also participated in this round. Maersk, a global oceanic shipping leader and one of Loadsmart&#8217;s strategic backers since its Series A round, also participated.</p>
<p><strong>Ride Vision</strong>, an Israeli startup building an AI-driven safety system to prevent motorcycle collisions,  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/ride-vision-raises-7m-for-its-ai-based-motorcycle-safety-system/">raised a $7 million</a> Series A round led by crowdsourcing platform OurCrowd. YL Ventures, Mobilion VC and motorcycle mirror manufacturer Metagal also participated in this round. The company has now raised a total of $10 million.</p>
<p><strong>Strava</strong>, the activity and fitness data-tracking platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/strava-raises-110-million-touts-growth-rate-of-2-million-new-users-per-month-in-2020/">raised $110 million</a> in new funding, in a Series F round led by TCV and Sequoia, and including participation by Dragoneer group, Madrone Capital Partners, Jackson Square Ventures and Go4it Capital.</p>
<h2>Election day mobility: scooters</h2>
<p>Spin, the micromobility subsidiary of Ford, sent me an interesting graphic and some data points about its ridership on Election Day.</p>
<p>Now, this is just one company&#8217;s data. We don&#8217;t want to get ahead of ourselves and make wild presumptions. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Think of this an interesting tidbit </span>on how <em>some </em>people were getting around November 3 and one company&#8217;s strategy to encourage ridership to the polls.</p>
<p>Spin recorded a 31.45% overall increase in ridership on Election Day from the previous Tuesday. The company offered a $10 discount for riders commuting to the polls November 3 under its SpinToVote campaign, which certainly helped push those ridership numbers higher. Spin said nearly 3,000 riders used the SpintoVote discount.</p>
<p>Cities with the highest increases in ridership on Election Day were Chicago with a whopping 243% rise, Cleveland with 193%, San Francisco with 25% and Atlanta with a10% increase. Spin also tracked use of its &#8220;Spin to Vote&#8221; campaign. Riders in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, San Diego and Washington D.C. had the highest opt in for that discounted ride campaign.</p>
<p>Update: Lime sent me some of their data, which they also <a href="https://www.li.me/second-street/lime-to-the-polls">posted in a blog</a>. The company said riders used the <em>Lime to the Polls</em> promotion code for 20% of all U.S. trips on Election Day. This is double the percentage of trips taken during the company&#8217;s first Lime to the Polls campaign for the 2018 midterm elections.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get to your polling location? (for those who didn&#8217;t mail in their ballot)</strong></p>

<h2>Notable reds and other tidbits</h2>
<p>Seriously, folks. So.much.news.</p>
<p><strong>California Public Utilities Commission</strong> approved Thursday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/robotaxi-companies-get-the-green-light-to-charge-for-rides-in-california/">two new programs</a> to allow permitted companies to provide and charge for shared rides in autonomous vehicles. While the industry mostly cheered the news, some have argued that the approval process to secure one of these permits adds unnecessary bureaucracy that could delay deployments by more than two years.</p>
<p><strong>General Motors</strong> had a bunch of announcements this week. First up, the company is getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/gm-to-leverage-driver-data-as-it-jumps-back-into-the-insurance-business/">back into the insurance biz</a>, but this time more in step with the connected-car era. The service, called OnStar Insurance, aims to leverage the vast amounts of data captured through its OnStar connected car service, which today has more than 16 million members in the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. automaker also upped its budget for electric vehicles and automated technology by 35%. GM said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/gm-ups-electric-and-autonomous-vehicle-spending-to-27-billion-through-2025/">spend $27 billion</a> over the next five years on EVs and AVs. GM is also accelerating its go-to-market timeline and adding more EVs to its portfolio plans. The new plan is to bring 30 new electric vehicles to a global market through 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> said it plans to establish an automotive R&amp;D center in Farmington Hills with support from the Michigan Strategic Fund, the Michigan Economic Development Corporation announced today. The project is expected to create 141 jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Luminar</strong> locked in a supplier deal to furnish Intel subsidiary Mobileye with lidar for its fleet of autonomous vehicles. The deal will see a rising star paired with a company that has long dominated the automotive industry. I breakdown why this is seemingly small deal is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/mobileye-taps-luminar-to-supply-lidar-for-its-robotaxi-fleet/">worth paying attention to</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Motional</strong>, the Aptiv-Hyundai $4 billion joint venture aimed at commercializing autonomous vehicles, received approval from the state of Nevada to test <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/motional-gets-approval-to-test-fully-driverless-vehicles-in-las-vegas/">fully driverless vehicles</a> on public roads. The company plans to begin driverless testing on public roads in Las Vegas sometime in early 2021.</p>
<p><strong>National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration</strong> officials released an advance notice of proposed rule-making for automated driving. Remember last week when I said rumor had it that U.S. regulators planned to make some moves that will affect the autonomous vehicle industry? Specifically, I noted that UL 4600, a standard created by Underwriters Laboratories that offers a guide for how to build the safety case for an AV design, is rumored to be the front runner.</p>
<p>Welp &#8230; the framework released this week includes a whole section for UL 4600. You can view the NHSTA Framework for Automated Driving <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ads_safety_principles_anprm_website_version.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NYT</strong> does a deep dive into the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/car-stereos.html"> arms race in car stereos</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Panasonic </strong>signed a preliminary agreement with the Nordic energy company Equinor and engineering and industrial company Norsk Hydro to collaborate on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/panasonic-explores-a-european-battery-deal-with-norways-largest-energy-and-industrial-companies/">building a battery business</a> in Northern Europe. Ok, I know, it&#8217;s a &#8220;preliminary agreement.&#8221; This got my attention because of the battery supplier battle that between LG Chem and Panasonic. And as TechCrunch&#8217;s Jonathan Shieber notes: Panasonic&#8217;s push into Northern Europe alongside two big regional players in hydrocarbons and renewable energy is a sign of the potential that exists in the European market beyond automotive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former Sequoia partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunamy/">Amy Sun</a>, who left the famed venture capital firm just months ago, has already raised $3.8 million for her new startup, Daylight Labs, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1832111/000183211120000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filings show</a>.</p>
<p>Daylight Labs will be creating a solution to help gig economy workers make more money, Sun hints to TechCrunch. Still in the early product development stages, the startup began during the pandemic when Sun noticed how many industries were “completely decimated” by the crisis.</p>
<p>“How can you leverage technology to create new ways for people to earn to make a living,” she said. “We’re innovating on the actual format and product.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There is no site or information available online about Daylight Labs, and Sun declined to comment on more specifics of the business, saying that the company is still iterating on its final product. What we do know, however, is that the company is a combination of all of Sun’s experiences in her career so far, from product management at Uber, to working on the Stories team at Facebook, to, most recently, investing in consumer companies on behalf of Sequoia Capital, which she joined in 2018.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077446" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077446" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2077446" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Headshot-2.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="294" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Headshot-2.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Headshot-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Headshot-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Headshot-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077446" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amy Sun</p></div></p>
<p>The Harvard grad started her career in product marketing at Microsoft, where she helped launch the Surface tablet. Sun then spent more than three years at Uber as a founding member of the ridesharing company&#8217;s growth marketing team, which included getting drivers to join the platform.</p>
<p>“Through that experience I got to build really strong relationships with drivers,” she said. “Seeing that you’re able to come into a city with a technology and people can start earning money, instantly &#8212; that’s really eye-opening for me.” Notably, in California, the Uber and Lyft-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">Prop 22 bill passed,</a> which allows gig workers to remain classified as independent contractors instead of full-time workers.</p>
<p>At Facebook, Sun worked on the company’s Stories product as a product manager. It&#8217;s unclear how her experience with consumer cameras and AR will be used within Daylight Labs, but that will definitely be interesting to track. During her tenure, users of Facebook Stories swelled from 2 million to 100 million.</p>

<p>Most recently, Sun worked at Sequoia Capital as the first woman on the firm’s growth-stage team. Her portfolio included Noom, Aurora, Glossier and The Wing, although she says she has transitioned “most responsibilities” from her tenure, including board seats, to the rest of the Sequoia team.</p>
<p>As for why leave the firm so soon after joining, Sun simply said that starting a company has “always been a dream” since the beginning of her career.</p>
<p>Since leaving Sequoia, Sun has lived a “nomadic lifestyle,” with time in San Francisco, Boston, North Carolina and, more recently, Austin, Texas. Daylight Labs is based out of Austin, and Sun joins troves of entrepreneurs who have been moving to the area <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/techs-great-migration-to-austin-tx/">for years. </a></p>
<p>More to come on Daylight Labs when Sun is ready to share.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Digital PR is an excellent strategy to pair with content marketing, especially if your goals include increasing your brand awareness and improving your backlink portfolio.</p>
<p>When you create excellent content and pitch it to writers, you not only get great media coverage, but you get the link back to your project and the authority that comes with being mentioned in a trusted publication.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://blog.frac.tl/earned-media">earned media</a> tactic is very effective — but it isn’t easy.</p>
<p>If you get any part of it wrong, your chances of success decrease dramatically. If you’ve run into roadblocks, make sure you’re not making any of these mistakes with your content or your pitching.</p>
<h2>1. It’s not newsworthy</h2>
<p>Sure, it’s easy to say the news only wants to cover material that is, well, news <em>worthy</em>.</p>
<p>But what does that actually mean?</p>
<p>For content marketers, it usually refers to three criteria: timeliness, relevance and significance.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch: Most content marketing programs don’t have journalists devoted to breaking news like actual media outlets do. So how can you create content that is truly newsworthy without the resources of a newsroom?</p>
<p><strong>By creating and analyzing your own data. </strong></p>
<p>If your brand provides a fresh data set or a new analysis of existing data, then you’re the sole owner of information, and you can offer it exclusively to publications. This makes your pitch much more interesting.</p>
<p>This tactic is a combination of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/earn-the-best-backlinks-with-high-quality-content-and-digital-pr/">original content marketing and digital PR</a>.</p>
<p>But the content can’t just be timely. It also has to be relevant to the writer you’re pitching and that writer’s audience. I’ll explain more on that in #4.</p>
<p>Finally, significance, which refers to the impact it has on the audience. When you think of local news, this is why they report on things like traffic jams and school closures: It directly affects the daily lives of the people watching and listening.</p>
<p>Alternatively, your data can be significant to writers covering specific beats. For example, for our client ZenBusiness, we surveyed Americans and asked what they thought about the government’s relief packages for COVID-19.</p>
<p>While ZenBusiness operates in the office/work niches, this new insight into American perspective was appealing to the political publication <a href="https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/longevity/496509-americans-believe-paid-sick-leave-is-most-effective-in">The Hill</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2076370" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076370" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2076370" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg" alt="zen business poll on sick leave" width="1024" height="412" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg?resize=150,60 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg?resize=300,121 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg?resize=768,309 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg?resize=680,274 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/newpollsfind.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2076370" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.frac.tl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fractl <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Significance is tough criteria from a brand perspective, but if you’re able to offer brand-new insights, it’s certainly not impossible.</p>
<h2>2. The significance isn’t clear</h2>
<p>Imagine a stranger handing you a book with a blank cover and saying, “Here, you’ll find this interesting.” Would you read the whole book?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has teamed up with Disney and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lucasfilm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lucasfilm">Lucasfilm <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to bring the Star Wars streaming series &#8220;The Mandalorian&#8221; to augmented reality. The company <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/mandalorian-in-ar">announced</a> this morning the launch of a new Android AR app, &#8220;<a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.mandalorian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.mandalorian&quot;}">The Mandalorian&#8221; AR Experience</a>, which will display iconic moments from the first season of the show in AR, allowing fans to retrace the Mandalorian&#8217;s steps, find the Child, harness the Force and more, according to the app&#8217;s Play Store description.</p>
<p>In the app, users will be able to follow the trail of Mando, Din Djarin and the Child, interact with the characters and create scenes that can be shared with friends.</p>
<p>New AR content will be released for the app on Mondays, starting today, November 23, and continuing for nearly a year to wrap on October 31, 2021. That makes this a longer-term promotion than some of the other Star Wars experiences Google has offered in the past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2077410" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077410" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2077410" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The_Mandalorian_AR_Experience.gif" alt="" width="800" height="448" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077410" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google/Lucasfilm</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the app itself takes advantage of Google&#8217;s developer platform for building augmented reality experiences, ARCore, in order to create scenes that interact with the user&#8217;s surroundings. This more immersive design means fans will be able to unlock additional effects based on their actions. The app also leverages Google&#8217;s new ARCore Depth API, which allows the app to enable occlusion. This makes the AR scenes blend more naturally with the environment that&#8217;s seen through the smartphone&#8217;s camera.</p>
<p>However, because the app is a showcase for Google&#8217;s latest AR technologies, it won&#8217;t work with all <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> devices.</p>
<p>Google says the app will only support &#8220;compatible 5G Android devices,&#8221; which includes its 5G Google Pixel smartphones and other select 5G Android phones that have the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/9462168">Google Play Services for AR</a> updated. You can check to see if your Android phone is supported on <a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/mandalorian">a list provided on the Google Developers website</a>. Other phones may be supported in the future, the company also notes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2077411" style="width: 465px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2077411" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2077411" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The_Mandalorian_AR_Experience_BTS.gif" alt="" width="455" height="800" /><p id="caption-attachment-2077411" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Google/Lucasfilm</p></div></p>
<p>While the experience requires a 5G-capable Android device, Google says that you don&#8217;t have to be on an active 5G connection to use the app. Instead, the requirement is more about the technologies these devices include and not the signal itself.</p>
<p>Google has teamed up with Lucasfilm many times over the past several years for promotional marketing campaigns. These are not typically considered ads, because they give both companies the opportunity to showcase their services or technologies. For example, Google allowed users to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/23/google-lets-you-give-its-apps-a-star-wars-makeover/">give its apps a Star Wars-themed makeover</a> back in 2015, which benefited its own services like Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Chrome and others. It has also introduced both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/11/googles-new-star-wars-ar-stickers-put-porgs-everywhere/">AR</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/googles-seurat-for-mobile-vr-means-you-can-finally-truly-step-into-star-wars/">VR</a> experiences featuring Star Wars content over the past several years.</p>
<p><a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.mandalorian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.mandalorian&quot;}">The Mandalorian AR Experience</a> is a free download on the Play Store.</p>

<p>If you like Equity, your cup runneth over.</p>
<p>So, what did we get into this morning? A grip of things, which I&#8217;ve listed below in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Thanksgiving is this week, so news may slow as we move toward Thursday.</li>
<li>New, good vaccine news is boosting stocks and hopes that the pandemic could be brought under control next year.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is racing toward new records.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/la-based-credit-key-raises-33-million-for-its-business-to-business-payments-platform/">LA-based Credit Key raises $33 million for its business-to-business payments platform</a> &#8212; in light of the Affirm IPO this round is no surprise.</li>

<li><a href="https://tomtunguz.com/interest-rates-and-exits/">This essay from Tomasz Tunguz</a>, which is good.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please stay safe this week, America. Do something boring and unfun, so that we can keep more of us alive into next year.</p>
