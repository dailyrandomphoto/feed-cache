										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies rely increasingly on machine learning models to run their businesses, it&#8217;s imperative to include anti-bias measures to ensure these models are not making false or misleading assumptions. Today at AWS re:Invent, AWS introduced <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> SageMaker Clarify to help reduce bias in machine learning models.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are launching Amazon SageMaker Clarify. And what that does is it allows you to have insight into your data and models throughout your machine learning lifecycle,&#8221; Bratin Saha, Amazon VP and general manager of machine learning told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He says that it is designed to analyze the data for bias before you start data prep, so you can find these kinds of problems before you even start building your model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Once I have my training data set, I can [look at things like if I have] an equal number of various classes, like do I have equal numbers of males and females or do I have equal numbers of other kinds of classes, and we have a set of several metrics that you can use for the statistical analysis so you get real insight into easier data set balance,&#8221; Saha explained.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2xXSwvaMQD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/">AWS launches SageMaker Data Wrangler, a new data preparation service for machine learning</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AWS launches SageMaker Data Wrangler, a new data preparation service for machine learning&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-sagemaker-data-wrangler-a-new-data-preparation-service-for-machine-learning/embed/#?secret=2xXSwvaMQD" data-secret="2xXSwvaMQD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>After you build your model, you can run SageMaker Clarify again to look for similar factors that might have crept into your model as you built it. &#8220;So you start off by doing statistical bias analysis on your data, and then post training you can again do analysis on the model,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://cmotions.nl/en/5-typen-bias-data-analytics/">multiple types of bias</a> that can enter a model due to the background of the data scientists building the model, the nature of the data and how they data scientists interpret that data through the model they built. While this can be problematic in general it can also lead <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/we-need-a-new-field-of-ai-to-combat-racial-bias/">to racial stereotypes being extended to algorithms</a>. As an example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html">facial recognition systems</a> have proven quite accurate at identifying white faces, but much less so when it comes to recognizing people of color.</p>
<p>It may be difficult to identify these kinds of biases with software as it often has to do with team makeup and other factors outside the purview of a software analysis tool, but Saha says they are trying to make that software approach as comprehensive as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you look at SageMaker Clarify it gives you data bias analysis, it gives you model bias analysis, it gives you model explainability it gives you poor inference explainability it gives you a global explainability,&#8221; Saha said.</p>
<p>Saha says that Amazon is aware of the bias problem and that is why it created this tool to help, but he recognizes that this tool alone won&#8217;t eliminate all of the bias issues that can crop up in machine learning models, and they offer other ways to help too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also working with our customers in various ways. So we have documentation, best practices, and we point our customers to how to be able to architect their systems and work with the system so they get the desired results,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>SageMaker Clarify is available starting to day in multiple regions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.calm.com/">Calm</a>, a well-known meditation app, has raised new capital at a valuation of $2 billion. The round was anticipated after the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/news-that-calm-seeks-more-funding-at-a-higher-valuation-is-not-transcendental-thinking/">reported</a> to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-13/meditation-app-calm-said-to-seek-funds-at-2-2-billion-valuation?sref=gni836kR">hunting for up to $150 million</a> at a valuation of $2.2 billion; perhaps Calm will follow in the steps of Robinhood and add a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">second tranche to the round in time</a>.</p>
<p>Prior investor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lightspeed-venture-partners">Lightspeed Venture Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> led the investment, which also saw participation from Insight, TPG and Salesforce CEO and new Slack owner Marc Benioff, among others.</p>
<p>That <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/calm-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="calm-com">Calm <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was able to secure more capital is not surprising. The company has a history of quick revenue growth, and is reportedly profitable, to boot. And the investment comes after mental health-focused startups as a category <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/">have performed well</a> from a venture capital perspective.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Calm and rival service <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> have now raised a combined $434 million according to <a href="http://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a> data, underscoring how attractive their models have proved to venture capitalists. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/calm-hits-2-billion-value-with-lightspeed-goldman-tpg-backing?sref=gni836kR">a Bloomberg interview</a>, Calm is considering acquiring smaller companies in the wake of its new capital event.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cdG8lBxTzq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/news-that-calm-seeks-more-funding-at-a-higher-valuation-is-not-transcendental-thinking/">News that Calm seeks more funding at a higher valuation is not transcendental thinking</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;News that Calm seeks more funding at a higher valuation is not transcendental thinking&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/news-that-calm-seeks-more-funding-at-a-higher-valuation-is-not-transcendental-thinking/embed/#?secret=cdG8lBxTzq" data-secret="cdG8lBxTzq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startups sells a consumer service for around $70 per year, or $15 per month. And the startup has built out a corporate arm, &#8220;Calm for Business,&#8221; that likely brings revenue stability that augments its consumer efforts.</p>
<p>As part of a release concerning today&#8217;s news, Calm detailed a number of nearly useful growth metrics. The service has over 100 million downloads (meaningless sans more incremental results), for example, and 4 million paying users (we asked if that data was inclusive of any Calm for Business customers, a question Calm did not answer).</p>
<p>Other TechCrunch queries regarding the company&#8217;s economics, revenue growth and performance compared to its pre-COVID plan also went unanswered.</p>
<p>Regardless, Calm now has a refreshed war chest heading into 2021 and a plan to go hunting. That should generate a headline or two.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://boostbiomes.com/">Boost Biomes</a>, the Y Combinator-backed developer of microbiome-based bio-fungicides and bio-pesticides for agricultural applications, has added $2 million in funding and picked up a new strategic investor in Japan&#8217;s Universal Materials Incubator.</p>
<p>To date, Boost Biomes has raised over $7 million in financing to support the development of new products like its biofungicide developed from the micro-organisms that live in the soil in a symbiotic relationship with the plants.</p>
<p>The work that Boost does is primarily on understanding the interactions between microbes and plants in the soil. &#8220;The goal is to be  the discovery engine and develop new microbial products for use in food and agriculture,&#8221; said Boost chief executive and co-founder Jamie Bacher.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The commitment from Japan&#8217;s Universal Materials Incubator expands on a $5 million institutional round led by another strategic partner, Yara International, a global crop nutrition company and venture investors like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/viking-global-investors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="viking-global-investors">Viking Global Investors <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Boost hopes to tackle issues in agriculture like spoilage, bacterial contamination and pathogen infrestations, as well as addressing diseases that can affect plant health directly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boost is already working with an undisclosed biomanufacturing partner to develop its biofungicide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UMI’s decision to invest in Boost comes from our evaluation of their team, technology, and the associated market opportunities.  We believe that Boost’s platform generates a unique data set that can be exploited for far superior products with many diverse microbiome applications in food and agriculture,&#8221; said Yota Hayama, an investor at UMI, in a statement. &#8220;These are critical areas to achieve food security and promote sustainable agriculture. We also expect Boost’s huge potential on other areas where microbiomes are utilized.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snapchat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snapchat">Snap <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today announced a new 2021 fund of $3.5 million that will be directed toward supporting Snapchat Lens creators and developers who are using the company&#8217;s Lens Studio tool to explore the use of AR technologies. The news kicked off Snap&#8217;s multi-day virtual event, <a href="https://lensfest.live/">Lens Fest</a>, where it also announced an upgraded version of its Lens Studio software and revealed that Lenses made by the Snapchat community have now been viewed over 1 trillion times.</p>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s Lenses have become a huge part of the app&#8217;s overall experience, especially now that development has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/snapchat-debuts-a-library-of-selfie-filters/">opened</a> up to the wider Snapchat community. Today, Snap says there are tens of thousands of Lens Creators worldwide who have now made over 1.5 million Lenses to date.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over 180 million people now interact with a Snapchat Lens every day &#8212; that&#8217;s up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/snapchat-debuts-a-library-of-selfie-filters/">just 70 million daily active users of Lenses</a> when the Lens Explorer section first launched in the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company wants to further invest in these community-made Lenses because they&#8217;re now driving the majority of the growth in Lens views among Snapchat users, where the top Lenses can climb to billions of views.</p>
<p>The new fund will build from Snapchat&#8217;s existing <a href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/snap-ar-creator-residency-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/snap-ar-creator-residency-program/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1607476478327000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE1pRuhv9STiLwRJvLjc82c4NMMRA">Creator Residency Program</a>, announced at the Snap Partner Summit, which had allowed developers, creators and artists to apply for funding to make their Lenses. That program was focused on using technologies like SnapML, while two additional residency programs invested in areas like games, education and storytelling.</p>
<p>Snap says it will offer more details about how creators can tap into the new AR-focused $3.5 million fund sometime early next year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084224" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084224" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2084224" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LensStudio_3.3_FaceMorph.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="278" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LensStudio_3.3_FaceMorph.jpg 717w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LensStudio_3.3_FaceMorph.jpg?resize=150,61 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LensStudio_3.3_FaceMorph.jpg?resize=300,123 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LensStudio_3.3_FaceMorph.jpg?resize=680,278 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LensStudio_3.3_FaceMorph.jpg?resize=50,20 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084224" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Snap</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the fund news, Snap revealed the update to Lens Studio (ver. 3.3), which adds new creator tools and workflows.</p>
<p>This includes a feature called My Lenses 2.0 for helping creators search and manage their own Lenses with a new tool. This lets them manage their Lenses in web browsers outside of the Lens Studio app, toggle between personal and sponsored Lens accounts, view their Lens status, set Lens visibility, as well as add tags, Scan Triggers, and Preview Videos.</p>
<p>The tool also introduces visual scripting which lets creators build complex logic for custom interactivity in their Lenses without coding. Other changes include improvements to compressing textures inside Lens Studio to help Lenses load faster and use less RAM; an updated Logger that will now group, filter and search messages; and a new Building Blocks feature that offers downloadable assets and helper scripts that help creators prototype, refine and add features to their Lens experiences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.thumbtack.com">Thumbtack</a>, a marketplace where you can hire local professionals for home improvement and other services, is announcing that it has acquired <a href="https://setter.com">Setter</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/setter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="setter">Setter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> provides its customers with video home checkups conducted by experts, then offers personalized plans for how to address any issues. In <a href="https://www.medium.com/thumbtack-blog/">a blog post</a>, Thumbtack CEO Marco Zappacosta said that by acquiring the startup, his company will be able to offer those same consultations, which in turn could lead to recommendations for different <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/thumbtack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="thumbtack">Thumbtack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> services.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an enormous step for Thumbtack,&#8221; Zappacosta wrote. &#8220;We won’t just be the platform homeowners turn to when a pipe breaks. We’ll be the only app any homeowner needs for the care and maintenance of their home. For our pros, this means there will be more projects than ever on our platform.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In response to emailed questions, Zappacosta told me that Thumbtack will &#8220;likely&#8221; offer both free and paid home consultations: &#8220;Our goal is to get this in the hands of as many people as possible and to give homeowners peace of mind when it comes to home maintenance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said the entire Setter team will be joining Thumbtack, giving the company a presence in Toronto.</p>

<p>“Homeownership is hard,&#8221; said Setter co-founder and President David Steckel in a statement. &#8220;Together with Thumbtack, we can now give our homeowners both a game plan and a way to tackle their to dos all on one platform.”</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/setter"> According to Crunchbase</a>, Setter raised a total of $12 million from investors including Sequoia Capital and NFX.</p>
<p>Thumbtack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/thumbtack-layoffs/">laid off 250 employees</a> at the end of March, after the company saw big declines in its major markets. Since then, however, Zappacosta said there&#8217;s been &#8220;a renewed focus on the home and an acceleration of digital adoption.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this new era of hyperfocus on the home, we are seeing permanent changes in consumer behavior,&#8221; he added. &#8220;People are investing in their most important asset, their home.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capital activity is high at the moment, making it difficult to keep up with the influx of new rounds that are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/finch-raises-3-5m-to-build-out-its-hr-and-payroll-focused-api-business/">being announced</a>.</p>
<p>Our cup runneth over, and I would much rather be busy than bored, but not all sectors are as busy as others. We&#8217;re not drowning in consumer social rounds, for example. We are, however, seemingly suffering from a deluge of edtech investments.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Happily for the TechCrunch crew, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> has become our resident expert on the sector, covering it week in, and week out. But even though it&#8217;s her beat, I couldn&#8217;t <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1336295025307766785">help but wonder</a> this morning upon <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/#a201208p6">yet another large edtech round</a> coming across the wires, <em>just what is going on in the sector in aggregate?</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I had to know. So, I&#8217;ve done a little digging into <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/">Crunchbase</a> data, parsed through <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/back-to-school-edtech-vc-funding-reaches-4-1b-so-far-this-year/">some other information</a> and have something approaching an idea. My goal is to help us both understand if there are more edtech rounds than ever being announced, or if it simply seems that way.</p>
<p>Into the breach!</p>
<h2>Edtech VC activity</h2>
<p>The best way to start examining at a sector is to take its aggregate performance data and cut it into smaller bits. Companies do this with quarterly results, for example, an utterly arbitrary period of time to report on that is also very useful.</p>
<p>To get a handle on edtech in 2020, I went a bit more caveman and decided to look at the sector&#8217;s funding totals in 2020 by merely comparing the first and second half of the year.</p>
<p>Per <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crunchbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crunchbase">Crunchbase&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8220;edtech&#8221; category, here&#8217;s what that data looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/ec76420728a87a79be625ee3b849033f">H1 2020</a>: 211 rounds, $2.68 billion</li>

<p>ShoppingGives allows retailers to offer a donation on behalf of a shopper to any of over 1.5 million nonprofits that are on its list &#8212; all without leaving the retailer&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>The company said that retailers can use the donation data to create a more authentic and personalized engagement with customers based on the causes they support.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ShoppingGives aligned with my values of investing in businesses and entrepreneurs who are making a difference. By creating opportunities to grow social impact with a seamless approach for retailers and brands, ShoppingGives is charting the course for all businesses to stand forth as agents of change in our society,&#8221;said Williams in a statement. </span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology helps retailers manage and report donations and is already recommended by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as one of a collection of apps for merchants setting up their online stores.

<p>ShoppingGives has already donated to over 6,000 non-profit organizations selected by customers, according to the company. Brands like <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenneth Cole, Natori, White + Warren, Margaux, Solstice Sunglasses, Tomboyx, Fresh Clean Tees, Blind Barber, Huron, and Neighborhood Goods use the service already. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">raised earlier in 2020</a> are finding success <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">again before the year closes</a>.</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.skyflow.com/">Skyflow</a>, a startup that TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/skyflow-raises-7-5m-to-build-its-privacy-api-business/">covered in May</a> when it announced a $7.5 million round. The company disclosed a new investment worth $17.5 million on Tuesday. The new round, a Series A, was led by <a href="https://www.canvas.vc/">Canvas Ventures</a>. <a href="https://foundationcapital.com/">Foundation Capital</a>, which led the company&#8217;s earlier Seed round, also took part in the deal.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/skyflow-8a8d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="skyflow-8a8d">Skyflow&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> business offers customers the ability to store sensitive data in a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3247848/what-is-zero-trust-a-model-for-more-effective-security.html">zero-trust</a> repository, or vault, that is accessible via an API. The company uses so-called polymorphic encryption to keep customer data secure, and to allow for granular access to data &#8212; <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/411.pdf">more here</a>, if you&#8217;re up for a white paper on the subject.</p>
<p>At the time of the company&#8217;s earlier Seed round, TechCrunch wrote that if its tech works as described, &#8220;Skyflow could help a host of companies that either can’t afford, or simply can’t be bothered, to properly protect your data that they have collected.&#8221;</p>
<p>It appears that the tech works, as the startup has landed a number of customers in the intervening months. After Skyflow&#8217;s product launched in July it secured its first customer in under two weeks, a seven-figure contract, according to co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/anshublog">Anshu Sharma.</a> By the woefully out-of-date rule of thumb that a software startup is ready to raise a Series A once it reaches $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), Skyflow graduated to the next level of startup maturity rapidly. Although that initial contract may have had a longer time-horizon than a single year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why does TechCrunch cover so many early-stage funding rounds?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/06/3-views-on-the-future-of-the-funding-round-story/embed/#?secret=LglGqQKjQ5" data-secret="LglGqQKjQ5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Given that its initial annual contract value (ACV) was attractive, and the company sports eight-figures worth of pipeline today according to its CEO, it&#8217;s not a surprise that Skyflow was able to raise more capital.</p>
<p>Canvas Ventures got interested even before that deal landed, pinging the startup about an investment after it announced its Seed round. Paul Hsiao, a general partner at Canvas, reached out and asked the company if it was looking to raise a Series A in June. The company balked at talking on more capital, asking Hsiao for some time to consider despite the offer coming with an attractive valuation (nine-figures, per Sharma).</p>
<p>After closing more customers, the company still had plenty of cash in the bank, but started talking to investors about taking on more capital anyway (<em>always raise when you don&#8217;t need to</em> is old venture advice for a reason). Some large funds wanted ownership stakes in the startup that failed to delight its founding team, the CEO said. In the end, the first investor to conviction won out, and Skyflow closed the deal with Canvas.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s ahead for Skyflow</h2>
<p>The startup is honing its go-to-market motion. Sharma told TechCrunch that Skyflow has built out variations of its product to target market segments like finance, healthcare, and identity, areas that are rife with regulation and sensitive data. For Skyflow, the inherent radioactivity of those datasets is what is was built to manage, so it&#8217;s not afraid to wade in.</p>
<p>Skyflow is staffing up as well, especially to handle larger customers that require a sales force. A release from the company that TechCrunch viewed before publication added that Skyflow intends to hire more engineers, and continue its work more on offering vertical-specific product variants.</p>

<p>The startup also made a few key hires in recent months, including Paul Kopackim the former CMO of Heroku who joined recently, and Karthik Rajan, a former Salesforce engineering VP.</p>
<p>With good initial traction and more capital, Skyflow is in a good spot. Now it simply needs to keep the growth coming, and all the data it is securing safe. We&#8217;ll bother the company for new growth metrics when it&#8217;s been selling for a full year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buzzy face-swap video app <a href="https://get.reface.app">Reface</a>, which lends users celebrity &#8216;superpowers&#8217; by turning their selfies into &#8220;eerily realistic&#8221; famous video clips at the tap of a button, has caught the attention of Andreessen Horowitz. The Silicon Valley venture firm leads a $5.5 million seed round in the deep tech entertainment startup, announced today.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/refaceai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="refaceai">Reface <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tells us its apps (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reface-face-swap-videos/id1488782587">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=video.reface.app&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android</a>) have been downloaded some 70 million times since it launched in January 2020 &#8212; up from 20M when we spoke to one of its (seven) co-founders back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/deepfake-video-app-reface-is-just-getting-started-on-shapeshifting-selfie-culture/">August</a>. It&#8217;s also attained &#8216;top five&#8217; leading app status in around 100 countries, the US included &#8212; as well as bagging a &#8216;top app&#8217; award in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">annual Google Play best of</a>. Quite the year, then.</p>
<p>That kind of viral growth clip has been turning heads all over the place. <span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as nabbing a16z for its seed lead, Reface has pulled in funding from a number of prominent angel investors across the gaming, music, film/content creation and tech industries. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This includes &#8212; from the gaming industry &#8212; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ilkka Paananen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEO of Supercell; and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">David Helgason</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founder of Unity Technologies. From the world of music: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scooter Braun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (known for managing top pop stars like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande);</span> and <span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Leber</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a manager to Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus, and an Uber investor. </span></p>
<p>On the film/content creation side its angels include <span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Stone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Trey Parker, and Peter Serafinowicz (via Deep Voodoo); </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Baum</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kives</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founder of K5 Global (whose clients have included the likes of Bruce Willis, Jesse Eisenberg and Eric Stonestreet); and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natalia Vodianova</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a model,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> philanthropist, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and actress.</span></p>
<p>Tech industry investors joining the round as angels are: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Elman (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ex-investment partner at Greylock and on the boards of Medium, Operator, Musical.ly and Jelly); and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sriram Krishnan (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investor and former product lead at Microsoft, Facebook, Snap and Twitter).</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of broad-based excitement that can be generated when hot trend streams like &#8216;no code&#8217; and viral social video get crossed. (At least if, like a rubbery face mask, we stretch the definition of &#8216;no code&#8217; to cover &#8212; in Reface&#8217;s case &#8212; a push-button, AI tool for pro-style content creation; the &#8216;no code&#8217; label typically refers to b2b tools that simplify app building but the common theme is supercharged accessibility.)</p>
<p>With such a sparkling portfolio of early stage backers Reface&#8217;s Ukrainian founders are surely proving the value of sticking with it where deep tech is concerned. As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/deepfake-video-app-reface-is-just-getting-started-on-shapeshifting-selfie-culture/">reported</a> back in the summer, three of the founders began working together almost a decade ago &#8212; honing their machine learning chops straight out of university. Their tenacity is now paying off in viral spades.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that Reface has the potential to be the next-generation personalization platform that enables the gamification of movies, sports, music videos, and many other fields that people are passionate about,&#8221; added Supercell&#8217;s Paananen in another statement. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to see the team grow Reface into a community that allows people to create active personal connections with artists and each other through content they love.” </span></p>

<p>Reface says the seed funding will allow it to step on the growth gas. Including stepping up work on a tool that&#8217;s capable of detecting its own fakes, which it wants to build to shrink the risk of the tech being misused.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the startup told us the detection tech would be ready by fall so it&#8217;s evidently taking a bit longer than expected. But garnering viral growth for its celeb-video face-swaps may well have reconfigured its priorities a tad.</p>
<p>A previously slated fall launch of UGC video for face-swapping has also not yet fully materialized.</p>
<p>A community that&#8217;s currently fuelled by creating and sharing high production value celebrity video clips seems a very different kind of &#8216;eerie&#8217; vs letting users loose on face-swapping themselves onto the body of their kid brother, say, or grandparent (not to mention the wider risks of not quality controlling the base material for face swaps). So taking time to get robust controls in place makes good business sense. As does focusing on stoking the viral boom with fresh celeb content by keeping content partners happy.</p>
<p>Asked about the delay, Reface told us UGC video has been &#8220;partly&#8221; launched at this point, since users <span style="font-weight: 400;">can download their GIFs. &#8220;It’s still in beta as we’re testing and improving &#8212; detection system, moderation, communication with users &#8212; to make sure that content will not be misused,&#8221; it said, adding: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Regarding video, we have a bunch of creators who provide us with content directly. This way we can test all the UGC mechanics. We plan to launch the UGC option to the public by the end of Q1.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>On the still-in-development detection tool, Reface said the plan is to launch it alongside UGC.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are training our models to maximize the detection quality,&#8221; it told us on that, adding that it hopes to have the tool finalized in April 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reface&#8217;s its overarching ambition is to build &#8220;the biggest platform of personalized content&#8221; &#8212; monetizing that by partnering with content holders and celebrities to offer head-turning &#8220;creative digital marketing solutions&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>Having a near captive audience for buzzy social content during the pandemic has clearly helped the mission, even as it&#8217;s boosted social rivals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/snap-shares-explode-after-blowing-past-earnings-expectations/">Snap</a>.</p>
<p>With so many bored kids stuck at home with their phones this year, there&#8217;s been an opportunity for growth across the board of social media. (And a16z is a backer of several other social plays, including audio-based social network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">Clubhouse</a>, and &#8212; for kids &#8212; the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/roblox-raises-150m-series-g-led-by-andreessen-horowitz-now-valued-at-4b/">Roblox</a> social gaming platform, to name just two.)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 2020, Reface says it became viral and ranked number one in the U.S. AppStore &#8212; (briefly) surpassing TikTok and Instagram. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebrities including</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Justin Bieber</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Snoop Dogg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Britney Spears,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Rogan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Chris Brown,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Miley Cyrus and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dua Lipa have all shared their refaced videos on social media this year, it also notes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year it&#8217;s inked partnerships with entertainment industry luminaries to promote new video launches, including Bieber, Cyrus and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> John Legend, as well as working with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Prime to advertise the <em>Borat</em> movie premiere &#8212; racking up</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;millions&#8221; more shares and refaces.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Funding from Andreessen Horowitz will allow us to accelerate this growth, empower our team with new talents and improve technology, as we will continue work on a fake videos detection tool to guarantee responsible use of our AI technology,” co-founder Denis Dmitrenko added in a statement. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors are buying into the shares of publicly traded <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/">Stitch Fix</a>, the personal styling online clothes store, after it <a href="https://investors.stitchfix.com/static-files/d77edf68-751c-4da8-9745-89a424773e3e">reported</a> much better-than-expected earnings yesterday.</p>
<p>Shares of the company&#8217;s stock were up $16.86, or 47.05%, in early trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange.</p>
<p>For the company&#8217;s fiscal first quarter, which ends Oct. 31, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stitch-fix" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stitch-fix">Stitch Fix <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> reported earnings of 9 cents a share. The company booked $490.4 million in revenue, a beat on analysts&#8217; expectations that the company would see $481.2 million and lose 20 cents per share, according to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/refinitiv" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="refinitiv">Refinitiv <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> data <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/stitch-fix-sfix-shares-skyrocket-on-earnings-beat-upbeat-outlook.html">reported by CNBC</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For its fiscal first quarter ended Oct. 31, Stitch Fix reported earnings of 9 cents per share on revenue of $490.4 million, topping estimates for a loss of 20 cents per share on revenue of $481.2 million, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/stitch-fix-sfix-shares-skyrocket-on-earnings-beat-upbeat-outlook.html">according to Refinitiv data</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Q1, we delivered $490 million in net revenue, reflecting 10% year-over-year growth, and grew our active client count to nearly 3.8 million, reflecting 10% year-over-year growth,&#8221;said the company&#8217;s chief executive <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/katrina-lake" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="katrina-lake">Katrina Lake <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited about the momentum in our business, confident in the future ahead, and we expect to deliver between 20% and 25% growth for the full year.”</p>
<p>Even as traditional retail suffers, due to government responses to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, online retail is grabbing increasing shares of the market. Stitch Fix&#8217;s business is no exception.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a time period where many traditional brick and mortar retailers are still experiencing double-digit year over year revenue decreases in their most recent quarter, we delivered an increase of over 240,000 net active clients quarter over quarter, a return to double-digit, year-over-year active client growth, which we expect will increase further this fiscal year,&#8221; Lake wrote in a letter to shareholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has been terrible for many industries, but the book industry has gotten a rare reprieve in an otherwise dismal past decade. Locked in homes and forced to socially distance from others, us humans have more time on our hands and more need to connect to characters than ever before.</p>
<p>That surge in interest in books has also led to a surge in interest from founders to rethink aspects of the reading experience. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/the-first-rule-of-bookclub-no-boring-book-clubs/">We profiled Salt Lake City-based BookClub</a> a few weeks ago, which is designed to create author-led book clubs to share the reading experience with others. Other startups like serialized fiction platform Radish have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/radish-softbank-kakao/">raised massive new rounds</a> as reading hits a new stride.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Before you even get to your book club though, how do you decide what to read and how do you find great books? (Outside, of course, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/gift-guide-the-best-books-for-2020-recommended-by-vcs-and-techcrunch-writers-part-1/">the TechCrunch best books of 2020 as recommended by writers and VCs</a>, which a source who declined to be named since they are writing this story told me is the only ‘best books of the year’ list you need to read).</p>

<p>That’s where BingeBooks comes in. <a href="https://bingebooks.com">BingeBooks</a> wants to become the Netflix channel surfing platform for book lovers, designed to help you find the next great book based on what you have previously read.</p>
<p>That might seem like Goodreads, the dominant dinosaur in the space, but there is so much more here. BingeBooks was developed by <a href="https://authors.ai">Authors A.I.</a>, a service pioneered by novelists and machine learning experts to build an AI-driven editor called Marlowe that can evaluate a draft of a book and provide constructive feedback, such as around pacing, consistency of characters in the plot, and more.</p>
<p>The team at Authors A.I. realized that the same technology that can evaluate, analyze and interpret a book for authors can also help identify patterns between different books and make recommendations to readers as well.</p>
<p>BingeBooks launched just before the Thanksgiving holiday last month, and has titles from the big brand houses like Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Hachette, Macmillan as well as more than 7,000 independent titles.</p>
<p>“BingeBooks is really focused on reader discovery,” Alessandra Torre, president and co-founder of Authors A.I. said. “There really isn&#8217;t anything where it&#8217;s a safe, happy community where readers and authors can interact and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re building.” She would know: Torre is the author of a number of bestsellers and 23 books across her writing career. She said that more than 120 authors were early stakeholders in the BingeBooks product.</p>
<p>Discovery is an issue for readers obviously, but it’s also an issue for authors. Authors, particularly independent authors without prodigious marketing budgets from the major presses, struggle to build a reading audience. Their work may well be the best in the world, but if you write it, they won’t necessarily come. BingeBooks wants to bridge the gap, and help both sides reach a better reading experience.</p>
<p>She’s joined by long-time author <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jd-lasica" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jd-lasica">JD Lasica <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Matthew Jockers, the writer of <i>The Bestseller Code</i> and a professor of English at Washington State University, where he specializes in computational analysis of text.</p>
<p>BingeBooks and Authors A.I. so far has been self-funded, and Lasica said that they are considering how to fundraise in the future now that their products are in the marketplace. Lasica said that crowdfunding might make more sense given the marketplace aspect of the company and their desire to engage more potential users onto the platform. The product is early, and the team hopes to expand its community features in early 2021.</p>
<p>Are we doomed to rewatch bad TikTok videos for the rest of our lives? Or can the kind of algorithms that have helped video services dominate our media culture be applied to reading? That’s what BingeBooks is asking, and hopefully, answering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is striking while its share price — and ballooning market cap — is hot, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312520312194/d60067d8k.htm">filing today</a> to sell $5 billion in shares after investors bid its equity to record levels.</p>
<p>The newly announced dilutive fundraising event is having a muted impact on its value, which is off 2.3% in pre-market trading as investors digested the news. Tesla&#8217;s market capitalization is $608 billion, meaning the stock sale is representing less than 1% of its value.</p>
<p>Tesla is working with Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays, BNP Paribas, BofA, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, SG Americas Securities, and Wells Fargo on the sale, according to a filing Tuesday with the<a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-312194/"> U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a>. The same filing notes that Tesla will sell these shares &#8220;from time to time and &#8220;at market prices.&#8221; Tesla said it will pay the banks a &#8220;commission of up to 0.25% of the aggregate gross proceeds&#8221; of the shares that they sell, or a maximum of $12.5 million.</p>
<p>Tesla has turned to the market before to access that capital. This is the second time in three months that the company has turned on the share sale spigot. In September, Tesla said it would sell <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-236678/">$5 billion in shares</a> from &#8220;time to time,&#8221; according to an SEC filing.</p>
<p>The American electric car company closed <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22">its third quarter</a> with operating cash flow of $2.4 billion, and free cash flow just under $1.4 billion. Tesla wrapped the September quarter with a staggering $14.5 billion in cash and equivalents, implying that Tesla is more taking advantage of a market moment than working to shore up its current accounts. However, it should be noted that vast number of capitally intensive building projects that Tesla has underway, including factories in Berlin and near Austin. It has also seen its operating costs rise over time. In the third quarter, Tesla reported operating costs were $1.25 billion in the third quarter, a 34% pop from $930 million in the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>Tesla shares have a 52-week low of $67.02, according to Google Finance. They also have a 52-week high of $648.79, a price that was set yesterday. It&#8217;s a good time to take some cream from the top.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The two founders of <a href="https://parrotsoftware.io/">Parrot Software</a>, Roberto Cebrián and David Villarreal, first met in high school in Monterrey, Mexico. In the eleven years since , both have pursued successful careers in the tech industry and became family (they&#8217;re brothers-in-law).</p>
<p>Now, they&#8217;re starting a new business together leveraging Cebrián&#8217;s experience running a point-of-sale company and Villarreal&#8217;s time working first at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and then at the high-growth, scooter and bike rental startup, Grin.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cebrían&#8217;s experience founding the point-of-sale company S3 Software laid the foundation for Parrot Software, and its point of sale service to manage restaurant operations. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Roberto has been in the industry for the past six or seven years,&#8221; said Villarreal. &#8220;And he was telling me that no one has been serving [restaurants] properly… Roberto pitched me the idea and I got super involved and decided to start the company.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084067" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084067" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2084067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roberto_david.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roberto_david.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roberto_david.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roberto_david.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roberto_david.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roberto_david.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roberto_david.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roberto_david.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/roberto_david.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084067" class="wp-caption-text">Parrot Software co-founders Roberto Cebrían and David Villarreal. Image Credit: Parrot Software</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Toast in the U.S., Parrot  manages payments including online and payments and real-time ordering, along with integrations into services that can manage the back-end operations of a restaurant too, according to Villarreal. Those services include things like delivery software, accounting and loyalty systems.  </span></p>
<p>The company is already live in over 500 restaurants in Mexico and is used by chains including Cinnabon, Dairy Queen, Grupo Costeño, and Grupo Pangea.</p>
<p>Based in Monterrey, Mexico, the company has managed to attract a slew of high profile North American investors including Joe Montana&#8217;s Liquid2 Ventures, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/foundation-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="foundation-capital">Foundation Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Superhuman angel fund, Toby Spinoza, the vice president of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Ed Baker, a product lead at Uber. Together they&#8217;ve poured $2.1 million into the young company.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Parrot has managed to land contracts in 10 cities, with the largest presence in Northeastern Mexico, around Monterrey, said Villarreal.</p>
<p>The market for restaurant management software is large and growing. It&#8217;s a big category that&#8217;s expected to reach $6.94 billion in sales worldwide by 2025, <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-restaurant-management-software-market#:~:text=The%20global%20restaurant%20management%20software,growth%20over%20the%20forecast%20period.">according to a reporter from Grand View Research</a>.</p>
<p>Investors in the U.S. market certainly believe in the potential opportunity for a business like Toast. That company has raised nearly $1 billion in funding from firms like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bessemer-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bessemer-venture-partners">Bessemer Venture Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the private equity firm TPG, and Tiger Global Management.</p>

AnemoCheck is the first smartphone application to measure hemoglobin levels, the company said &#8212; and through its app people can not only determine whether or not they&#8217;re anemic but also use the app&#8217;s information to address the condition, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Low code workflow has become all the rage among enterprise tech giants and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sap" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sap">SAP <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> joined the group of companies offering simplified workflow creation today when it announced SAP Cloud Platform Workflow Management, but it didn&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<p>It also announced SAP Ruum, a new departmental workflow tool and SAP Intelligent Robotic Process Automation, its entry into the RPA space. The company made the announcements at <a href="https://pages.sapteched.com/sap/sapteched2020/index">SAP TechEd</a>, its annual educational conference that has gone virtual this year due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the Cloud Platform Workflow Management tool. It enables people with little or no coding skills to build operational workflows. It includes predefined workflows like employee onboarding and can be used in combination with Qualtrics, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">it bought for $8 billion 2018</a>, to include experience data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As SAP CTO Juergen Mueller told me, the company sees these types of activities in a much larger context. In the hiring example, that means it&#8217;s more than simply the act of being hired and getting started. &#8220;We like to think in end-to-end processes, and the one fitting into the employee onboarding would be recruit to retire. So it would start at talent acquisition,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hiring and employee onboarding is the first part of the larger process, but there are other workflows that develop out of that throughout the employee&#8217;s time at the company. &#8220;Basically this is a collection of different workflow steps that are happening with some in parallel, some in sequence,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Okta adds new no-code workflows that use identity to trigger sales and marketing tasks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/okta-announces-new-no-code-workflows-for-customer-facing-identity-scenarios/embed/#?secret=axr3fSXmjy" data-secret="axr3fSXmjy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>If there are experience questions involved like which benefits you want, you could add Qualtrics questionnaires to that part of the workflow. It&#8217;s designed to be very flexible. As with all of these kinds of tools, you can drag and drop components and do some basic configuration and you&#8217;re good to go. In reality, the more complex these become, the more expertise would be required, but this type of tool is designed with non-technical end users in mind as a starting point.</p>
<p>SAP Ruum is a simplified version of Cloud Platform Workflow Management designed for building departmental processes, and if there is an automation element involved where you want to let the machine take care of some mundane, repeatable tasks, then the RPA solution comes into play. The latter tends to be more complex and require more IT involvement, but it enables companies to build automation into workflows where the machine pushes data along through the workflow and does at least some of the work for you.</p>
<p>The company joins Salesforce, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/salesforce-applies-ai-to-workflow-with-einstein-automate/">announced Einstein Workflow Automation</a> last week at Dreamforce and Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/get-to-know-google-cloud-workflows">Workflows</a>, the tool the company introduced in August. There are many others out there from companies large and small including Okta, Slack and Airtable, which all have no-code workflow tools built in.</p>
<p>The SAP TechEd conference has been going on for 24 years, and usually takes place in three separate venues &#8212; Barcelona, Las Vegas and Bangalore &#8212;  throughout the year. This year, the company is running a single-combined virtual conference for free to all comers. It runs for 48 hours straight starting today with a worldwide audience of over 60,000 sign-ups as of yesterday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Chi Xu left <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/magic-leap" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="magic-leap">Magic Leap <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and returned to China, he had big ambitions. He believed China would have its own augmented and virtual reality giants, just as how the domestic smartphone industry birthed global leaders like Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi that rival Apple today.</p>
<p>Xu, now chief executive of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nreal-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nreal-ai">Nreal, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/nreal-raises-40-million/">one of China&#8217;s highest-funded AR startups</a>, is among a group of entrepreneurs uniquely positioned to build world-class hardware. The young generation is well-versed in both worlds, with work experience in Silicon Valley and often an Ivy League degree. They are also well-connected to capital and supply chains in China, which would support them through cycles of iteration to deliver powerful yet affordable products.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Although China has been calling for more indigenous innovation, most of the advanced technologies found in AR and VR are still in the hands of foreign tech behemoths.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>They might be proud of China&#8217;s technological progress, but they recognize supremacy doesn&#8217;t come overnight. More importantly, their firms often have intricate ties to the U.S., whether it&#8217;s for sourcing core parts or testing an early market.</p>
<p>Despite Beijing&#8217;s push for technological &#8220;self-reliance,&#8221; Chinese AR and VR companies still depend on imported chips like their smartphone counterparts. Because the industry is so young and no one really has a proven model for monetization, few investors and startups in China are willing to splurge on basic research.</p>
<p>But China has one important strength, said the founder of a Chinese AR startup who declined to be named: &#8220;In cutting-edge sectors, China has always lacked the talent to take things from &#8216;zero to one.&#8217; However, China has the mass production and supply chain capabilities necessary for taking things from &#8216;one to n.'&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the case with smartphones. Once Apple demonstrated the technological and financial possibilities of handsets and gave rise to a production ecosystem around iPhones &#8212; in other words, catapulted the industry from zero to one &#8212; Chinese counterparts took cues from the American giant, made use of homegrown manufacturing resources and began delivering cheaper and even more powerful alternatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine any Chinese corporations willing to invest in AR and VR as heavily as Microsoft, Apple or Facebook today,&#8221; said the founder, whose company sells headsets both in and outside China.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, China is good at playing catch-up by spending money on a race with a clear finish line. For example, chips. If there are already contestants in the area, so long as [Chinese firms] ramp up investment and follow the direction, they can deliver results.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Chinese innovation</h2>
<p>Although China, for the last decade, has been calling for more indigenous innovation, most of the advanced technologies found in AR and VR are still in the hands of foreign tech behemoths, several industry experts told TechCrunch. <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/xr-vr-ar">Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon chips</a> are used almost exclusively by serious players, from Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/10/29/oculus-quest-2-how-snapdragon-xr2-powers-next-generation-vr">Oculus Quest</a> in the U.S. to <a href="https://medium.com/@evawxiao/meet-the-chinese-startup-cutting-the-cord-on-virtual-reality-36ccf07920e5">Pico</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/nreal-raises-40-million/">Nreal in China</a>. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Advanced optical solutions, on the other hand, mainly come from Japanese and Taiwanese firms.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1821447" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1821447" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-1821447" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1140405776.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1140405776.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1140405776.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1140405776.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1140405776.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1140405776.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1140405776.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1140405776.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-1140405776.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1821447" class="wp-caption-text">Attendees stand in line to try out the new Oculus Quest Virtual Reality (VR) gaming system at the Facebook F8 Conference at McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California, on April 30, 2019. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> AMY OSBORNE/AFP/Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say Chinese companies don&#8217;t innovate. Prominent venture capitalist and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee <a href="https://www.ncuscr.org/media/podcast/uschinainsights/kai-fu-lee-future-ai-united-states-china">famously argued</a> in his book &#8220;AI Superpowers&#8221; that while the U.S. has an edge in fundamental research, China is stronger on implementation and commercial application.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true that the more experimental efforts are happening in the U.S., though I&#8217;m not sure if any of those are mature already,&#8221; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tozhao/">Tony Zhao</a>, founder and chief executive of real-time video API provider Agora and a veteran from WebEx, told TechCrunch. &#8220;For Chinese companies, there are more opportunities in [user experience].&#8221;</p>
<p>As AR and VR come of age, Zhao&#8217;s company is devising a<a href="https://www.agora.io/en/blog/creating-composite-ar-and-video-experiences-with-arvideokit-and-agora/"> toolkit</a> to let developers and organizations stream and record AR content from devices. Use cases by China&#8217;s educators have particularly impressed Zhao. One client, for example, built a tool allowing a teacher to interact with a student through a virtual store, where the two speak English while they respectively act as the cashier and the customer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s very revolutionary because a lot of kids are going to be very excited to learn from those kinds of tools. It&#8217;s more like a real experience and would be more natural for students to learn to use a language instead of just know the grammar,&#8221; said Zhao.</p>
<p>&#8220;These solutions are already creative, but also very practical.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Chinese market offers other aspects that can keep investors excited. As Gavin Newton-Tanzer, president of Sunrise International, Asia producer of the &#8220;mixed reality&#8221; (XR) conference AWE, pointed out to TechCrunch:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many like to say that in the U.S., Magic Leap sucked all the air out of the room. They raised tons of money and as a result, few wanted to fund [other smart glass startups]. It&#8217;d be like funding a competitor to Didi in China or funding a competitor to Uber in the U.S. … Few felt like anyone else could meaningfully compete.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is launching its subscription fitness service, which is built mainly to complement Apple Watch, on December 14. Apple Fitness+ was first announced at Apple&#8217;s iPhone event in September, and will offer guided workouts on iPhone iPad and Apple TV, with live personal metrics delivered by the Apple Watch&#8217;s health metrics monitoring.</p>
<p>The fitness offering will cover 10 workout types at launch, including Hight Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), strength, yoga, dance, core, cycling, indoor walking and running, as well as rowing and cooldown. All cases are led by real trainers that Apple selected to record the interactive sessions, and they&#8217;re soundtracked from &#8220;today&#8217;s top artists&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DcdG9qgJsL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/apple-launches-fitness-subscription-service-for-just-under-80-a-year/">Apple launches fitness subscription service for just under $80 a year</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple launches fitness subscription service for just under $80 a year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/apple-launches-fitness-subscription-service-for-just-under-80-a-year/embed/#?secret=DcdG9qgJsL" data-secret="DcdG9qgJsL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The interactive elements are fed mostly by Apple Watch stats, and will display heart rate metrics, countdown timers, and goal achievement &#8216;celebration&#8217; graphics which display on the screen when a user fills up their Apple Watch Activity rings. This is a level of direct integration that&#8217;s similar to what Peloton achieves with its service, but without requiring a whole connected stationary bike or treadmill to work.</p>
<p>Other distinguishing features of the service include a recommendation engine that leverages data including previous Fitness+ courses taken by a user, as well as their Apple Watch Workout App data and other third-party health and fitness app integration information from Apple Health to recommend new workouts, trainers and exercise routines. Apple&#8217;s use of third-party integrations is particularly interesting here, since it&#8217;s using its platform advantage to inform its service personalization.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2084194" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2084194" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2084194" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple_fitness-plus-launch_applewatch-iphone12_12082020.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple_fitness-plus-launch_applewatch-iphone12_12082020.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple_fitness-plus-launch_applewatch-iphone12_12082020.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple_fitness-plus-launch_applewatch-iphone12_12082020.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple_fitness-plus-launch_applewatch-iphone12_12082020.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple_fitness-plus-launch_applewatch-iphone12_12082020.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple_fitness-plus-launch_applewatch-iphone12_12082020.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/apple_fitness-plus-launch_applewatch-iphone12_12082020.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2084194" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple is also committing to weekly updates of new content across all categories of workouts, with varying intensity and difficult levels. Anyone using Fitness+ can also share their workouts with friends and family, and compete with others directly in the app if they want.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also an optional Apple Music integration, which allows users to favorite songs and playlists directly from workouts to add them to their library, but users won&#8217;t require Apple Music in order to access the music used for the training videos, which are divided into different selectable &#8220;styles&#8221; or genres.</p>
<p>Apple Fitness+ is available starting December 14, and will retail for $9.99 per month, or $79.99 when paid for a twelve month period up front. It&#8217;s also part of Apple&#8217;s new Apple One <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/premier" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="premier">Premier <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> service bundle alongside other services.</p>
<p>This is definitely a major competitive service launch to existing subscription fitness offerings, including Peloton. Apple&#8217;s bundle offering, along with its system&#8217;s flexibility and syncing across its devices, could make it an easier choice for beginners and those just getting started with more serious training, though the lack of live classes might be a downside for some.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli cloud security firm <a href="https://orca.security/">Orca Security</a> today announced a $55 million Series B funding round led by ICONIQ Growth. Previous investors GGV Capital, YL Ventures and Silicon Valley CISO Investments also participated in the round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to date to $82 million. This includes Orca&#8217;s $20.5 million Series A round, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/orca-security-raises-20m-series-a-for-its-multi-cloud-security-platform/">announced in May</a>.</p>
<p>What makes Orca stand out is not just its focus on cloud-native technologies but what it calls its SideScanning technology. This enables it to map a company&#8217;s cloud environment and reconstruct its file system by looking at how workloads interact with the block storage services they use. Based on this, in combination with the cloud metadata it collects, it can map and scan a company&#8217;s entire data estate and its cloud assets &#8212; and find potential security issues. Because of this system, Orca also immediately discovers new hosts in the cloud without anybody having to maintain this part of the system.</p>
<p>This means the system can work without any agents, too, and hence without introducing any additional overhead into the existing systems. That, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/orca-security" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="orca-security">Orca Security <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Avi Shua argues, wouldn&#8217;t have been possible in an on-premises setting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The way it works is that &#8212; without installing any agents or running anything on the environment &#8212; it reads the block storage of your flow from the side to deduce the risk and it builds maps of your environment so you can see it in context,&#8221; Shua, who spent 11 years working at Check Point before launching Orca, explained. &#8220;Both of these things simply were not possible in the on-premise environment because you need to install agents to see. And when you install an agent, it sees the tree, it doesn&#8217;t see the forest. It isn&#8217;t able to understand where traffic comes from, it doesn&#8217;t understand that if it sees a key, what that key opens.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083959" style="width: 1033px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orca-Security-Team.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083959" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2083959" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orca-Security-Team.jpg" alt="Orca Security Team" width="1023" height="591" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orca-Security-Team.jpg 1023w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orca-Security-Team.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orca-Security-Team.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orca-Security-Team.jpg?resize=768,444 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orca-Security-Team.jpg?resize=680,393 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Orca-Security-Team.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2083959" class="wp-caption-text">Orca Security Team</p></div></p>
<p>He also noted that Orca wants to be as comprehensive as possible so that companies don&#8217;t have to use different tools for detecting misconfigurations, malware, vulnerabilities, etc. The company also aims to make the process of getting started with its technology frictionless. Indeed, Shua argues that the Achilles heel of the whole industry is that companies get to maybe 50 percent of coverage if they work hard, but then hit a brick wall because deploying a lot of security tools can be quite hard. &#8220;Usually people are not getting breached because the walls are not high enough but because they are not covering the thing that they&#8217;re trying to protect,&#8221; Shua said.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image2.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2083960" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image2.gif" alt="" width="399" height="399" /></a>Orca also aims to provide security practitioners with relevant alerts based on the context of the exposure and business impact. A company may be running a lot of software that is vulnerable to remote code execution in the NTP service, for example. But the environment doesn&#8217;t expose NTP and it&#8217;s blocked by default in all of the company&#8217;s security groups, so while this may look like a major vulnerability in the overall stack, it doesn&#8217;t actually represent a real risk. Shua told me of a customer who, after installing Orca, found more than a million critical issues. The company&#8217;s tools helped the security team reduce those to 33 that it should focus on.</p>
<p>&#8220;The common denominator amongst just about every company we see is that the solutions are very complex &#8212; the problems they&#8217;re trying to solve are complex and the solutions tend to be complex,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ggv-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ggv-capital">GGV Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> managing partner Glenn Solomon told me. &#8220;One of the amazing things about Orca is &#8212; and I think that this is a result of Avi and Gil [Geron] and the rest of the co-founders having a lot of experience at Check Point &#8212; they understood from day one like that a big part of the value here is being able to install and just provide value really quickly and seamlessly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The service currently supports AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure and their various container services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083961" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083961" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2083961" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image3.gif?w=600" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2083961" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Orca Security</p></div></p>
<p>Clearly, Orca has hit on a winning formula here. Shua tells me that the company grew more than 10x this year already and instead of growing the team to about 50 employees, it&#8217;s already at 70 now. At one point this summer, simply scheduling a call with a salesperson at Orca could take three weeks. Given this, it&#8217;s maybe no surprise that Orca wanted to raise to continue to accelerate this growth (and that VCs would want to put more money into the company).</p>
<p>&#8220;This massive $55 million round will really help propel Orca to cloud security dominance,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yl-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yl-ventures">YL Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> managing partner Yoav Leitersdorf told me. &#8220;Already year-over-year growth is stunning &#8212; higher than anything I&#8217;ve ever seen &#8212; literally hundreds of percent. They are incredibly unique in the market with their SideScanning technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to increase continue building out its product and increase its sales and marketing efforts. In addition, Orca plans to increase its R&amp;D efforts and open a number of new sales offices around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As TC readers know, the tricky trade-off of the modern web is privacy for convenience. Online tracking is how this &#8216;great intimacy robbery&#8217; is pulled off. Mass surveillance of what Internet users are looking at underpins <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> dominant search engine and Facebook&#8217;s social empire, to name two of the highest profile ad-funded business models.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s own corporate overlord, Verizon, also gathers data from a variety of end points &#8212; mobile devices, media properties like this one &#8212; to power its own ad targeting business.</p>
<p>Countless others rely on obtaining user data to extract some perceived value. Few if any of these businesses are wholly transparent about how much and what sort of private intelligence they&#8217;re amassing &#8212; or, indeed, exactly what they&#8217;re doing with it. But what if the web didn&#8217;t have to be like that?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Berlin-based <a href="https://www.xayn.com">Xayn</a> wants to change this dynamic &#8212; starting with personalized but privacy-safe web search on smartphones.</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s launching a search engine app (on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xayn.search">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xayn/id1514123811">iOS</a>) that offers the convenience of personalized results but without the &#8216;usual&#8217; shoulder surfing. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This is possible because the app runs on-device AI models that learn locally. The promise is no</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> data is ever uploaded (though trained AI models themselves can be).</span></p>
<p>The team behind the app, which is comprised of 30% PhDs, has been working on the core privacy vs convenience problem for some six years (though the company was only founded in 2017); initially as an academic research project &#8212; going on to offer an open source framework for masked federated learning, called <a href="https://www.xaynet.dev">XayNet</a>. The Xayn app is based on that framework.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve raised some €9.5 million in early stage funding to date &#8212; with investment coming from European VC firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/earlybird-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="earlybird-2">Earlybird; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Dominik Schiener (<a href="https://www.iota.org">Iota</a> co-founder); and the Swedish authentication and payment services company, Thales AB.</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;re moving to commercialize their XayNet technology by applying it within a user-facing search app &#8212; aiming for what CEO and co-founder, Dr Leif-Nissen Lundbæk bills as a &#8220;Zoom&#8221;-style business model, in reference to the ubiquitous videoconferencing tool which has both free and paid users.</p>
<p>This means Xayn&#8217;s search is not ad-supported. That&#8217;s right; you get zero ads in search results.</p>
<p>Instead, the idea is for the consumer app to act as a showcase for a b2b product powered by the same core AI tech. The pitch to business/public sector customers is speedier corporate/internal search without compromising commercial data privacy.</p>
<p>Lundbæk argues businesses are sorely in need of better search tools to (safely) apply to their own data, saying studies have shown that search in general costs around 18% of working time globally. He also cites a study by one city authority that found staff spent 37% of their time at work searching for documents or other digital content.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a business model that Google has tried but failed to succeed,&#8221; he argues, adding: &#8220;We are solving not only a problem that normal people have but also that companies have&#8230; For them privacy is not a nice to have; it needs to be there otherwise there is no chance of using anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the consumer side there will also be some premium add-ons headed for the app &#8212; so the plan is for it to be a freemium download.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2y6YVGSYEQs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<h2>Swipe to nudge the algorithm</h2>
<p>One key thing to note is Xayn&#8217;s newly launched web search app gives users a say in whether the content they&#8217;re seeing is useful to them (or not).</p>
<p>It does this via a Tinder-style swipe right (or left) mechanic that lets users nudge its personalization algorithm in the right direction &#8212; starting with a home screen populated with news content (localized by country) but also extending to the search result pages.</p>
<p>The news-focused homescreen is another notable feature. And it sounds like different types of homescreen feeds may be on the premium cards in future.</p>
<p>Another key feature of the app is the ability to toggle personalized search results on or off entirely &#8212; just tap the brain icon at the top right to switch the AI off (or back on). Results without the AI running can&#8217;t be swiped, except for bookmarking/sharing.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the app includes a history page which lists searches from the past seven days (by default). The other options offered are: Today, 30 days, or all history (and a bin button to purge searches).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a &#8216;Collections&#8217; feature that lets you create and access folders for bookmarks.</p>
<p>As you scroll through search results you can add an item to a Collection by swiping right and selecting the bookmark icon &#8212; which then opens a prompt to choose which one to add it to.</p>
<p>The swipe-y interface feels familiar and intuitive, if slightly laggy to load content in the TestFlight beta version TechCrunch checked out ahead of launch.</p>
<p>Swiping left on a piece of content opens a bright pink color-block stamped with a warning &#8216;x&#8217;. Keep going and you&#8217;ll send the item vanishing into the ether, presumably seeing fewer like it in future.</p>
<p>Whereas a swipe right affirms a piece of content is useful. This means it stays in the feed, outlined in Xayn green. (Swiping right also reveals the bookmark option and a share button.)</p>
<p>While there are pro-privacy/non-tracking search engines on the market already &#8212; such as US-based DuckDuckGo or France&#8217;s Qwant &#8212; Xayn argues the user experience of such rivals tends to fall short of what you get with a tracking search engine like Google, i.e. in terms of the relevance of search results and thus time spent searching.</p>
<p>Simply put: You probably have to spend more time &#8216;DDGing&#8217; or &#8216;Qwanting&#8217; to get the specific answers you need vs Googling &#8212; hence the &#8216;convenience cost&#8217; associated with safeguarding your privacy when web searching.</p>
<p>Xayn&#8217;s contention is there&#8217;s a third, smarter way of getting to keep your &#8216;virtual clothes&#8217; on when searching online. This involves implementing AI models that learn on-device and can be combined in a privacy-safe way so that results can be personalized without putting people&#8217;s data at risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Privacy is the very fundament&#8230; It means that quite like other privacy solutions we track nothing. Nothing is sent to our servers; we don&#8217;t store anything of course; we don&#8217;t track anything at all. And of course we make sure that any connection that is there is basically secured and doesn&#8217;t allow for any tracking at all,&#8221; says Lundbæk, explaining the team&#8217;s AI-fuelled, decentralized/edge-computing approach.</p>
<h2>On-device reranking</h2>
<p>Xayn is drawing on a number of search index sources, including (but not solely) Microsoft&#8217;s Bing, per Lundbæk, who described this bit of what it&#8217;s doing as &#8220;relatively similar&#8221; to DuckDuckGo (which has its own web crawling bots).</p>
<p>The big difference is that it&#8217;s also applying its own reranking algorithms in order generate privacy-safe personalized search results (whereas DDG uses a contextual ads-based business model &#8212; looking at simple signals like location and keyword search to target ads without needing to profile users).</p>
<p>The downside to this sort of approach, according to Lundbæk, is users can get flooded with ads &#8212; as a consequence of the simpler targeting meaning the business serves more ads to try to increase chances of a click. And loads of ads in search results obviously doesn&#8217;t make for a great search experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We get a lot of results on device level and we do some ad hoc indexing &#8212; so we build on the device level and on index &#8212; and with this ad hoc index we apply our search algorithms in order to filter them, and only present you what is more relevant and filter out everything else,&#8221; says Lundbæk, sketching how Xayn works. &#8220;Or basically downgrade it a bit&#8230; but we also try to keep it fresh and explore and also bump up things where they might not be super relevant for you but it gives you some guarantees that you won&#8217;t end up in some kind of bubble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of what Xayn&#8217;s doing is in the arena of federated learning (FL) &#8212; a technology Google has been dabbling in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/show-dont-tell/">in recent years</a>, including pushing a &#8216;privacy-safe&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">proposal</a> for replacing third party tracking cookies. But Xayn argues the tech giant&#8217;s interests, as a data business, simply aren&#8217;t aligned with cutting off its own access to the user data pipe (even if it were to switch to applying FL to search).</p>
<p>Whereas its interests &#8212; as a small, pro-privacy German startup &#8212; are markedly different. Ergo, the privacy-preserving technology it&#8217;s spent years building has a credible interest in safeguarding people&#8217;s data, is the claim.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/embed/#?secret=FY4AhZAJug" data-secret="FY4AhZAJug" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;At Google there&#8217;s actually [fewer] people working on federate learning than in our team,&#8221; notes Lundbæk, adding: &#8220;We&#8217;ve been criticizing TFF [Google-designed <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/federated">TensorFlow Federated</a>] at lot. It is federated learning but it&#8217;s not actually doing any encryption at all &#8212; and Google has a lot of backdoors in there.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to understand what does Google actually want to do with that? Google wants to replace [tracking] cookies &#8212; but especially they want to replace this kind of bumpy thing of asking for user consent. But of course they still want your data. They don&#8217;t want to give you any more privacy here; they want to actually &#8212; at the end &#8212; get your data even easier. And with purely federated learning you actually don&#8217;t have a privacy solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to do a lot in order to make it privacy preserving. And pure TFF is certainly not that privacy-preserving. So therefore they will use this kind of tech for all the things that are basically in the way of user experience &#8212; which is, for example, cookies but I would be extremely surprised if they used it for search directly. And even if they would do that there is a lot of backdoors in their system so it&#8217;s pretty easy to actually acquire the data using TFF. So I would say it&#8217;s just a nice workaround for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Data is basically the fundamental business model of Google,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;So I&#8217;m sure that whatever they do is of course a nice step in the right direction&#8230; but I think Google is playing a clever role here of kind of moving a bit but not too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how, then, does Xayn&#8217;s reranking algorithm work?</p>
<p>The app runs four AI models per device, combining encrypted AI models of respective devices <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">asynchronously &#8212; with homomorphic encryption &#8212; into a collective model. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A second step entails this collective model being fed back to</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> individual devices to personalize served content, it says. </span></p>
<p>The four AI models running on the device are one for natural language processing; one for grouping interests; one for analyzing domain preferences; and one for computing context.</p>
<p>&#8220;The knowledge is kept but the data is basically always staying on your device level,&#8221; is how Lundbæk puts it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can simply train a lot of different AI models on your phone and decide whether we, for example, combine some of this knowledge or whether it also stays on your device.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have developed a quite complex solution of four different AI models that work in composition with each other,&#8221; he goes on, noting that they work to build up &#8220;centers of interest and centers of dislikes&#8221; per user &#8212; again, based on those swipes &#8212; which he says &#8220;have to be extremely efficient &#8212; they have to be moving, basically, also over time and with your interests&#8221;.</p>
<p>The more the user interacts with Xayn, the more precise its personalization engine gets as a result of on-device learning &#8212; plus the added layer of users being able to get actively involved by swiping to give like/dislike feedback.</p>
<p>The level of personalization is very individually focused &#8212; Lundbæk calls it &#8220;hyper personalization&#8221; &#8212; more so than a tracking search engine like Google, which he notes also compares cross-user patterns to determine which results to serve &#8212; something he says Xayn absolutely does not do.</p>
<h2>Small data, not big data</h2>
<p>&#8220;We have to focus entirely on one user so we have a &#8216;small data&#8217; problem, rather than a big data problem,&#8221; says Lundbæk. &#8220;So we have to learn extremely fast &#8212; only from eight to 20 interactions we have to already understand a lot from you. And the crucial thing is of course if you do such a rapid learning then you have to take even more care about filter bubbles &#8212; or what is called filter bubbles. We have to prevent the engine going into some kind of biased direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>To avoid this echo chamber/filter bubble type effect, the Xayn team has designed the engine to function in two distinct phases which it switches between: Called &#8216;exploration&#8217; and (more unfortunately) &#8216;exploitation&#8217; (i.e. just in the sense that it already knows something about the user so can be pretty certain what it serves will be relevant).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to keep fresh and we have to keep exploring things,&#8221; he notes &#8212; saying that&#8217;s why it developed one of the four AIs (a dynamic contextual multi-armed bandit reinforcement learning algorithm for computing context).</p>
<p>Aside from this app infrastructure being designed natively to protect user privacy, Xayn argues there are a bunch of other advantages &#8212; such as being able to derive potentially very clear interests signs from individuals; and avoiding the chilling effect that can result from tracking services creeping users out (to the point people they avoid making certain searches in order to prevent them from influencing future results).</p>
<p>&#8220;You as the user can decide whether you want the algorithm to learn &#8212; whether you want it to show more of this or less of this &#8212; by just simply swiping. So it&#8217;s extremely easy, so you can train your system very easily,&#8221; he argues.</p>
<p>There is potentially a slight downside to this approach, too, though &#8212; assuming the algorithm (when on) does some learning by default (i.e in the absence of any life/dislike signals from the user).</p>
<p>This is because it puts the burden on the user to interact (by swiping their feedback) in order to get the best search results out of Xayn. So that&#8217;s an active requirement on users, rather than the typical passive background data mining and profiling web users are used to from tech giants like Google (which is, however, horrible for their privacy).</p>
<p>It means there&#8217;s an &#8216;ongoing&#8217; interaction cost to using the app &#8212; or at least getting the most relevant results out of it. You might not, for instance, be advised to let a bunch of organic results just scroll past if they&#8217;re really not useful but rather actively signal disinterest on each.</p>
<p>For the app to be the most useful it may ultimately pay to carefully weight each item and provide the AI with a utility verdict. (And in a competitive battle for online convenience every little bit of digital friction isn&#8217;t going to help.)</p>
<p>Asked about this specifically, Lundbæk told us: &#8220;Without swiping the AI only learns from very weak likes but not from dislikes. So the learning takes place (if you turn the AI on) but it’s very slight and does not have a big effect. These conditions are quite dynamic, so from the experience of liking something after having visited a website, patterns are learned. Also, only 1 of the 4 AI models (the domain learning one) learns from pure clicks; the others don’t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xayn does seem alive to the risk of the swiping mechanic resulting in the app feeling arduous. Lundbæk says the team is looking to add &#8220;some kind of gamification aspect&#8221; in the future &#8212; to flip the mechanism from pure friction to &#8220;something fun to do&#8221;. Though it remains to be seen what they come up with on that front.</p>
<p>There is also inevitably a bit of lag involved in using Xayn vs Google &#8212; by merit of the former having to run on-device AI training (whereas Google merely hoovers your data into its cloud where it&#8217;s able to process it at super-speeds using dedicated compute hardware, including bespoke chipsets).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been working for over a year on this and the core focus point was bringing it on the street, showing that it works &#8212; and of course it is slower than Google,&#8221; Lundbæk concedes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google doesn&#8217;t need to do any of these [on-device] processes and Google has developed even its own hardware; they developed TPUs exactly for processing this kind of model,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;If you compare this kind of hardware it&#8217;s pretty impressive that we were even able to bring [Xayn&#8217;s on-device AI processing] even on the phone. However of course it&#8217;s slower than Google.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lundbæk says the team is working on increasing the speed of Xayn. And anticipates further gains as it focuses more on that type of optimization &#8212; trailing a version that&#8217;s 40x faster than the current iteration.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t at the end be 40x faster because we will use this also to analyze even more content &#8212; to give you can even broader view &#8212; but it will be faster over time,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>On the accuracy of search results vs Google, he argues the latter&#8217;s &#8216;network effect&#8217; competitive advantage &#8212; whereby its search reranking benefits from Google having more users &#8212; is not unassailable because of what edge AI can achieve working smartly atop &#8216;small data&#8217;.</p>
<p>Though, again, for now Google remains the search standard to beat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now we compare ourselves, mostly against Bing and DuckDuckGo and so on. Obviously there we get much better results [than compared to Google] but of course Google is the market leader and is using quite some heavy personalization,&#8221; he says, when we ask about benchmarking results vs other search engines.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the interesting thing is so far Google is not only using personalization but they also use kind of a network effect. PageRank is very much a network effect where the most users they have the better the results get, because they track how often people click on something and bump this also up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interesting effect there is that right now, through AI technology &#8212; like for example what we use &#8212; the network effect becomes less and less important. So actually I would say that there isn&#8217;t really any network effect anymore if you really want to compete with pure AI technology. So therefore we can get almost as relevant results as Google right now and we surely can also, over time, get even better results or competing results. But we are different.&#8221;</p>
<p>In our (brief) tests of the beta app Xayn&#8217;s search results didn&#8217;t obviously disappoint for simple searches (and would presumably improve with use). Though, again, the slight load lag adds a modicum of friction which was instantly obvious compared to the usual search competition.</p>
<p>Not a deal breaker &#8212; just a reminder that performance expectations in search are no cake walk (even if you can promise a cookie-free experience).</p>

<h2>An opportunity for competition?</h2>
<p>&#8220;So far Google has so far had the advantage of a network effect &#8212; but this network effect gets less and less dominant and you see already more and more alternatives to Google popping up,&#8221; Lundbæk argues, suggesting privacy concerns are creating an opportunity for increased competition in the search space.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not anymore like Facebook or so where there&#8217;s one network where everyone has to be. And I think this is actually a nice situation because competition is always good for technical innovations and for also satisfying different customer needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course the biggest challenge for any would-be competitor to Google search &#8212; which carves itself a marketshare in Europe in excess of 90% &#8212; is how to poach (some of) its users.</p>
<p>Lundbæk says the startup has no plans to splash millions on marketing at this point. Indeed, he says they want to grow usage sustainably, with the aim of evolving the product &#8220;step by step&#8221; with a &#8220;tight community&#8221; of early adopters &#8212; relying on cross-promotion from others in the pro-privacy tech space, as well as reaching out to relevant influencers.</p>
<p>He also reckons there&#8217;s enough mainstream media interest in the privacy topic to generate some uplift.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have such a relevant topic &#8212; especially now,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Because we want to show also not only for ourselves that you can do this for search but we think we show a real nice example that you can do this for any kind of case.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t always need the so-called &#8216;best&#8217; big players from the US which are of course getting all of your data, building up profiles. And then you have these small, cute privacy-preserving solutions which don&#8217;t use any of this but then offer a bad user experience. So we want to show that this shouldn&#8217;t be the status quo anymore &#8212; and you should start to build alternatives that are really build on European values.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s certainly true EU lawmakers are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/tech-driven-change-a-key-priority-for-new-ec-president/">big on tech sovereignty talk</a> these days, even though European consumers mostly continue to embrace big (US) tech.</p>
<p>Perhaps more pertinently, regional data protection requirements are making it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">increasing challenging</a> to rely on US-based services for processing data. Compliance with the GDPR data protection framework is another factor businesses need to consider. All of which is driving attention onto &#8216;privacy-preserving&#8217; technologies.</p>

<p>Xayn&#8217;s team is hoping to be able spread its privacy-preserving gospel to general users by growing the b2b side of the business, according to Lundbæk &#8212; so it&#8217;s hoping some home use will follow once employees get used to convenient private search via their workplaces, in a small-scale reverse of the business consumerization trend that was powered by modern smartphones (and people bringing their own device to work).</p>
<p>&#8220;We these kind of strategies I think we can step by step build up in our communities and spread the word &#8212; so we think we don&#8217;t even need to really spend millions of euros in marketing campaigns to get more and more users,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>While Xayn&#8217;s initial go-to-market push has been focused on getting the mobile apps out, a desktop version is also planned for Q1 next year.</p>
<p>The challenge there is getting the app to work as a browser extension as the team obviously doesn&#8217;t want to build its own browser to house Xayn. tl;dr: Competing with Google search is mountain enough to climb, without trying to go after Chrome (and Firefox, and so on).</p>
<p>&#8220;We developed our entire AI in Rust which is a safe language. We are very much driven by security here and safety. The nice thing is it can work everywhere &#8212; from embedded systems towards mobile systems, and we can compile into web assembly so it runs also as a browser extension in any kind of browser,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Except for Internet Explorer of course.&#8221;</p>
