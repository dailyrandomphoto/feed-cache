										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever left a job, chances are you left your 401(k) plan along with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, if you’re like many Americans and change jobs every few years or so, you could have multiple 401(k) plans spread out at various companies, doing their own thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us don’t deal with the hassle of trying to consolidate accounts, which can lead to lost money over many years.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter <a href="https://www.hicapitalize.com/">Capitalize</a>. The New York-based startup aims to address this very problem with a platform that it claims makes it virtually painless to locate misplaced 401(k) accounts, select and open individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and consolidate retirement plans &#8212; for free. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s just raised $12.5 million in a Series A round to help grow that platform. Canapi Ventures led the round, with participation from existing backers including Bling Capital, Greycroft, RRE  Ventures and Walkabout Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian-born Gaurav Sharma co-founded the company after years of working in traditional finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I enjoyed investing, I started peeling back the layers and saw a host of systemwide problems with the 401(k) market,” he recalls. “One of those being that our accounts are tied to our employers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma said that about one-third of the people who change jobs end up cashing out their 401(k) plans, and paying the related penalties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another several million leave it behind for an extended period of time, ultimately because it’s complicated to move the money,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma teamed up with CTO Chris Phillips in late 2019 to form Capitalize, which went on to raise a $2 million seed round last March led by Bling Capital. Since its formal launch last September, the rollover platform has processed almost $10 million in volume. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were a lot of layoffs during the summer last year as a result of the pandemic,” Sharma said. “So a lot of our early users while we were in beta were people who had been impacted by those layoffs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was curious about how Capitalize’s offering differs from the services that financial advisors provide. According to Sharma, the difference lies in the process and eligibility requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you have an advisor, they will help you do some of this but in a really manual way, whereas we have built an online platform to help consumers find and consolidate retirement accounts,” Sharma told TechCrunch. “And usually, you have to have a few hundred thousand in assets to even get an advisor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was one of the things that motivated Sharma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you have $500 or $500,000 in assets, we’ll help you,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, Capitalize’s service is free to consumers, who can go to the site and let the company manage the consolidation process for them. If they need to open an IRA, the platform can help them do that, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We help them compare IRAs from leading fintech providers and established institutions,” Sharma explained. If Capitalize has forged a commercial relationship with one of those providers, it is compensated by them for the referral in a model that is similar to NerdWallet, PolicyGenius and Credit Karma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if they already have an IRA, Capitalize will still help with consolidation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitalize also offers employers a free onboarding service to help departing employees “roll over quickly at the point of job change,” Sharma said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is also great for the employer, who can save money on administrative fees and reduce fiduciary risk,” he added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canapi Venture partner Jeffrey Reitman said his fintech venture fund, which has about 43 banks as LPs, was attracted to a number of things about Capitalize’s team and platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, he described Sharma as “one of the best early-stage CEOs” he’s seen when it comes to recruiting, company building and decision making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canapi also had one of its VPs and family members try out the product in its early beta format.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They said, according to Reitman, that the platform “worked like magic and removed so much friction in the process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So when you have a team member that has such a strong reaction to it, that’s such a validator of what it can be at scale,” he told TechCrunch. “That made it a bit of a no-brainer for us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides also being drawn to the company’s “mission-driven” approach, Reitman noted that about 80% of its existing bank LP base has existing IRA and individual retirement account products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of them are digital in nature, we believe there should be a lot of synergies between what banks are trying to accomplish as they further digitize their product suite and what Capitalize is looking to accomplish in reducing friction for as many people as possible in that process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Capitalize plans to use its new capital to refine and streamline its product, and continue to invest in technology.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shauntelpoulson/">Shauntel Garvey</a> and <a href="https://www.reachcapital.com/team-member/jennifer-carolan/">Jennifer Carolan</a> liked edtech before the sector was cool, so the duo co-founded Reach Capital in 2015 with a <a href="https://golden.com/wiki/Reach_Capital-JNZXNM6">$53 million debut fund. </a>The San Francisco-based venture firm has since put checks into education startups including Newsela, Sketchy, ClassDojo and Outschool, landing six exits so far.</p>
<p>Now, after seeing its portfolio accelerate in the wake of the coronavirus, Reach is announcing its third fund aimed at backing edtech startups. Reach Capital III is a $165 million fund, the firm’s biggest to date. Reach’s team, which also includes Chian Gong, Wayee Chu and Esteban Sosnik, started raising the investment vehicle over the summer. New LPs in the fund include Sesame Workshop, National Geographic, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111922" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111922" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2111922" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Reach-Team-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Reach-Team-2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Reach-Team-2.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Reach-Team-2.png?resize=300,98 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Reach-Team-2.png?resize=768,250 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Reach-Team-2.png?resize=680,221 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Reach-Team-2.png?resize=1536,499 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Reach-Team-2.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111922" class="wp-caption-text">The Reach Capital team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reach Capital</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reach plans to reserve half of its fund for follow-on investments for its startups, and the other half will go toward net-new investments. The firm intends to back 20 startups through Reach III, targeting about 15% ownership in each deal.</p>
<p>The edtech market raked in more than $10 billion in venture capital investment globally in 2020, but for students, parents and teachers, the past 12 months were defined more by its scramble than its surge. Reach as well as other firms have the opportunity to back startups that could change the broken bits, which is no easy feat.</p>
<p>Carolan, who taught in Chicago public schools for seven years before joining venture, said that the entire education system’s restructure has opened the door for more innovation and opportunities.</p>
<p>“What parents were experiencing with remote learning was the result of underinvestment in edtech for a long time,” she said. “The companies that were adopted to meet the ends were fragmented, many of the products were inoperable and many of them were built for the home school market and repurposed for schools.” Now, Carolan sees opportunity in the fact that more students have digital devices due to 1:1 technology infrastructure in schools.</p>
<p>“There has never been a more exciting time to be investing in education,” she said. Reach plans to back companies across edtech subsectors, from early childhood to K-12 to post-secondary learning. The firm is also joining a number of investors betting on lifelong learning, a term being used to describe education <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">opportunities outside of a traditional classroom context. </a></p>

<p>Reach is one of the few venture capital firms that specifically back edtech companies. Others in the category include Owl Ventures, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/owl-ventures-new-pair-of-funds-gives-edtech-a-585-million-boost/">which closed $585 million </a>in a pair of investment vehicles in September, and Learn Capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/union-square-ventures-and-learn-capital-file-paperwork-indicating-new-funds/">which closed $132 million </a>in December.</p>
<p>The pandemic has opened the software market in education and we’re just in the beginning of that opening,” Carolan said. “Education has gone from let’s hire 10 instructional coaches to let’s adopt some software to do that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.superannotate.ai">SuperAnnotate</a>, a NoCode computer vision platform, is partnering with <a href="https://opencv.org">OpenCV</a>, a non-profit organization that has built a large collection of open-source computer vision algorithms. The move means startups and entrepreneurs will be able to build their own AI models and allow cameras to detect objects using machine learning. SuperAnnotate has so far raised $3M to date from investors including Point Nine Capital, Fathom Capital and Berkeley SkyDeck Fund.</p>
<p>The AI-powered computer vision platform for data scientists and annotation teams will provide OpenCV AI Kit (OAK) users with access to its platform, as well as launching a computer vision course on building AI models. SuperAnnotate will also set up the AI Kit’s camera to detect objects using machine learning and OAK users will get $200 of credit to set up their systems on its platform. </p>
<p>The OAK is a multi-camera device that can run computer vision and 3D perception tasks such as identifying objects, counting people and measuring distances. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/opencv-ai-kit-aims-to-do-for-computer-vision-what-raspberry-pi-did-for-hobbyist-hardware">Since launching</a>, around 11,000 of these cameras have been distributed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The AI Kit has so far been used to build drone and security applications, agricultural vision sensors or even COVID-related detection devices (for example, to identify people whether someone is wearing a mask or not).</p>
<p>Tigran Petrosyan, co-founder and CEO at SuperAnnotate said in a statement that: &#8220;Computer vision and smart camera applications are gaining momentum, yet not many have the relevant AI expertise to implement those. With OAK Kit and SuperAnnotate, one can finally build their smart camera system, even without coding experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Competitors to SuperAnnotate include Dataloop, Labelbox, Appen and Hive .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The venture capital scene in Africa has consistently grown, with an influx of capital from local and international investors reaching unprecedented heights in recent years. To understand how much growth has occurred, African startups </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/23/the-rise-of-silicon-savannah-and-africas-tech-movement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a meagre $400 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015 compared to the $2 billion that came into the continent in 2019, according to Africa-focused fund Partech Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that figure isn&#8217;t the only yardstick. With other outlets like media publications WeeTracker and Disrupt Africa disclosing different results for the African venture capital market, we compared and contrasted their results last year. The result of that investigation detailed differences in methodology, as well as similarities.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uIYBMC3fHb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/did-african-startups-raise-496m-1b-or-2b-in-2019/">Did African startups raise $496M, $1B or $2B in 2019?</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In comparison to Partech&#8217;s $2 billion figure for 2019, WeeTracker estimated that African startups raised $1.3 billion while Disrupt Africa, $496 million for the same year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was expected that these figures would increase in 2020. But with the pandemic bringing in utter confusion and panic, companies downsized as investors re-strategized, and due diligence slowed during the first few months of the year. Also, new predictions came into light in May with some pegging expected deals to close </span><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/06/african-venture-capital-to-drop-by-40-at-the-end-of-the-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">between $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investments did pick up, and from July, VC funding on the continent had a bullish run until December. Although 2020 didn&#8217;t witness the series of mammoth deals in 2019 and didn&#8217;t reach the $2 billion mark, it proved to be a good year for acquisitions. Sendwave&#8217;s $500 million purchase by WorldRemit; Network International buying DPO Group for $288 million; and Stripe&#8217;s larger than $200 million acquisition of Paystack were high-profile examples.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To better understand how VCs invested in Africa during 2020, we&#8217;ll look into data from Partech Africa, Briter Bridges and Disrupt Africa.</span></p>
<h2>Behind the numbers</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, </span><a href="https://partechpartners.com/2020-africa-tech-venture-capital-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partech Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that a total of $2 billion went into African startups. For 2020, the number dropped to $1.43 billion. </span><a href="https://briterbridges.com/africa-investment-report-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pegged total 2020 VC for African startups at $1.31 billion (for disclosed and undisclosed amounts), up from $1.27 billion in 2019.  </span><a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/funding-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disrupt Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted an increase in its figures moving from $496 million in 2019 to $700 million in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as last year, contrasting methodologies from the type of deals reviewed, to the definition of an African startup contributed to the numbers&#8217; disparity. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://partechpartners.com/team/cyril-collon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyril Collon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, general partner at Partech says the firm&#8217;s numbers are based on equity deals greater than $200,000. Also, it defines African startups &#8220;as companies with their primary market, in terms of operations or revenues, in Africa not based on HQ or incorporation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When these companies evolve to go global, we still count them as African companies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges has a similar methodology. According to <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/dario-giuliani/en-us">Dario Giuliani</a>, the firm’s director, the research organisation avoided using geography to define an African startup due to factors contributing to business identities like taxation, customers, IP, and management team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Disrupt Africa, the startups featured in its report are seven years or less in operation, still scaling, and a potential to achieve profitability. It excluded &#8220;companies that are spin-offs of corporates or any other large entity, or that have developed past the point of being a startup, by our definition of one.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>The continued dominance of fintech and the Big Four</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the drop in total funding, Partech says African startups closed more total deals in 2020 than previous years. According to the firm, 347 startups completed 359 deals compared in 2020 compared to 250 deals in 2019. This can be attributed to an increase in seed rounds (up 88% from 2019) and bridge rounds due to shortage of cash amidst a pandemic-induced lockdown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common theme in the three reports shows fintech, healthtech, and cleantech in the top five sectors. But, as expected, fintech retained the lion&#8217;s share of African VC funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Partech, fintech represented 25% of total African funding raised last year, with agritech, logistics &amp; mobility, off-grid tech, and healthtech sectors following behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges reported that fintech companies accounted for 31% of the total VC funding over the same time period. Cleantech came second; healthtech, third; agritech and data analytics, in fourth and fifth.</span></p>
<p>Fintech startups raised 24.9% of the total African VC funding counted by Disrupt Africa. E-commerce, healthtech, logistics, and energy startups followed respectively.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 also showed the Big Four countries’ preponderance in terms of investment destination, at least in two out of the three reports.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2111737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The countries remained unchanged on Partech&#8217;s top five as Nigeria remained the VC&#8217;s top destination with $307 million. At a close second was Kenya accounting for $304 million of the total investments in the continent. Egypt came third with its startups raising $269 million, while $259 million flowed into South African startups. Rounding up the top five was Ghana with $111 million, displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech&#8217;s 2019 list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sequence remained unchanged from Disrupt Africa&#8217;s 2019 list as well. Funding raised by Kenyan startups reached $191.4 million; Nigeria followed with $150.4 million; South Africa, third at $142.5 million; Egypt came a close fourth with $141.4 million; while Ghanaian startups raised $19.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges took a different approach. Whereas Partech and Disrupt Africa highlighted funding activities per country of origin and operations, Briter Bridges chose to attribute funding to the startups&#8217; place of incorporation or headquarters. This premise slightly altered the Big Four&#8217;s positions. Startups headquartered in the US received $471.8 million of the total funding, according to Briter Bridges. Those in South Africa claimed $119.7 million. Mauritius-headquartered companies received $110 million while African startups headquartered in the U.K. and Kenya raised $107.6 million and $77.1 million respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On why Briter Bridges went with this narrative, Giuliani said the company wants its data to be an impartial conversation starter which can be used to investigate more complex dynamics such as the need for better policies, regulation, or financial availability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This speaks particularly to the absence of Nigeria as a primary location for incorporation. Due to unfriendly regulations, business and tax conditions, Nigerian startups are increasingly incorporating their startups abroad and other African countries like Seychelles and Mauritius. It&#8217;s a trend that may well continue as most foreign VCs prefer African startups to be incorporated in countries with business-friendly investment laws.</span></p>
<h2>Regional and gender diversity check</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/francophone-africa-has-most-promising-tech-startups-and-they-are-looking-investors">increase in startup activity</a> in Francophone Africa, one would&#8217;ve expected an uptick in VC funding in the region. Well, that&#8217;s not exactly the case. Senegal, the region&#8217;s top destination for VC funding dropped from $16 million in 2019 to $8.8 million in 2020 according to Partech. The country was 9th on the list while Ivory Coast, placed 10th, raised a meagre sum of $6.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the good news is that 22 other countries received investments outside this Big Four this year, according to Partech data. Will we see this continue? And if yes, which countries will likely join the nine-figure club?</span></p>
<p><a href="http://partechpartners.com/team/tidjane-deme/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tidjane Deme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a general partner of Partech Africa, believes Ghana might be next. He references how it previously used to be a Big 3 of Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa before Egypt became a dominant force, and says a similar event might happen with the West African country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see a clear diversification happening as investors are going into more markets. Ghana, for instance, is already attracting above $100 million. Of course, we all wish it would happen faster, but we also recognize that this is a learning process for both investors entering new markets and for founders learning about this game.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghana also emerged in Giuliani&#8217;s forecast. He adds the likes of Tunisia, Morocco, Rwanda as second-tier countries quickly entering global investors&#8217; radar and building more sophisticated ecosystems.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/tom-jackson-36289220"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Jackson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-founder of Disrupt Africa, doesn&#8217;t mention any names. But he thinks that while there are some positives from other markets, the Big Four dominance will continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Funding will filter down to other markets more and more, and there are already positive signs in that regard. But the space is still relatively early-stage and those four big markets have a big head start and will remain far ahead for years to come,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another diversity check that cannot be overlooked is that of gender. Despite all the talk of inclusion, Briter Bridges reported that 15% of the funded startups in 2020 had women as founders, co-founders, or C-level executives. Partech, on the other hand, places this number at 14%. There&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done to increase this figure, and we might see more early-stage firms looking to plug that gap.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crypto-currency pioneer and early Bitcoin thought-leader <a href="https://dianabiggs.com/">Diana Biggs</a> has joined Swiss-based startup <a href="https://valour.com">Valour</a>, which lets investors easily buy digital assets through their bank or broker. The move is significant with the news that Tesla has bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, thus massively boosting the mainstream markets for crypto assets. Biggs explored the potential for blockchain technology to help solve humanitarian challenges through her venture, Proof of Purpose, in 2017, and her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6TtI9qEiTU">TEDx speech on Blockchain Technology</a> that year is considered by many in the blockchain space to be one of the best in the genre.</p>
<p>Valour, a  Zug, Switzerland-based issuer of investment products, brought in Biggs, the former Private Banking Global Head of Innovation for HSBC, as CEO after recently launching <a href="https://valour.com/products/">Bitcoin Zero</a>, a fee-free, digital asset ETP product, which trades on the NGM stock exchange.</p>
<p>Biggs, who has been in the Bitcoin space since 2013 told TechCrunch: “I have never seen this much attention to Bitcoin and other crypto-assets&#8230; The time for decentralized technologies has arrived, and their potential is increasingly realized by institutional investors.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Johan Wattenström, the founder of Valour, said: “Diana is the perfect candidate to lead the company through this next phase of growth and expansion. With a wealth of experience in traditional finance, as well as fintech, and her vision for bringing digital assets into the mainstream, we feel very lucky to have her on board.” Wattenström created and listed the digital asset ETP on Nasdaq Nordic, in 2015.</p>
<p>Biggs is an Associate Fellow at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School and served as Head Tutor for their Blockchain Strategy Programme from 2018 to 2020. She is on the Board of the World Economic Forum’s Digital Leaders of Europe community and is a member of the Milken Institute’s Young Leaders Circle. Prior to joining Valour, Biggs was Global Head of Innovation for HSBC Private Banking, where she led on fintech partnerships and driving open innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>, the U.K. challenger bank with just shy of 5 million customers, has recruited a new U.S CEO to head up its efforts states-side, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>Carol Nelson, who previously spent ten years as CEO of Cascade Bank and prior to that was a long time senior vice president of Bank of America, will start as early as next week, staff at Monzo were informed this morning. Notably, she has been a strategic advisor to Monzo U.S. for more than a year, so she&#8217;ll already be familiar with the bank&#8217;s U.S. ambitions and general culture.</p>
<p>Technically, Nelson takes over from TS Anil, who is now Monzo&#8217;s U.K. CEO and held both CEO titles temporarily after Monzo founder Blomfield relinquished CEO duties to become president in May. Then, last month, we broke news that Blomfield had decided to cease his involvement with Monzo entirely, the challenger bank and now fintech unicorn he founded six years ago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Details of Monzo&#8217;s U.S. ambitions first broke cover in January 2019 (again, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/04/monzo-american-dream/">thanks to this publication</a>), and were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/across-the-pondo/">officially confirmed</a> the following June. Since then, Monzo U.S. has only seen a tentative soft launch, reminiscent of its early U.K. beta all those years ago and an understanding that product-market-fit is key for different geographies.</p>
<p>The current U.S. team is still roughly ten people as the bank works through its U.S. banking charter application and supports a limited pool of U.S. customers. I understand there are currently over 20,000 signups to the U.S. waitlist, and that post pandemic Monzo will choose San Francisco for its U.S. HQ.</p>
<p>(In April last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/monzo-to-shutter-las-vegas/">Monzo shuttered its Las Vegas customer support office</a>, amid a round of cutbacks. However, that satellite office was to serve U.K. customers overnight and separate to its U.S. plans.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recruiting of a new U.S. CEO comes hot on the heels of Monzo reportedly raising further top up funding. First reported by Sky&#8217;s Mark Kleinman via a tweet (yes, really) and with additional details <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/monzo-uk-challenger-banking-fintech-bringing-in-new-us-investor-2021-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">sourced</a> by Business Insider, the challenger bank is closing a further £50 million, thought to be on the same terms as its recent Series G funding. Backing comes from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/monzo-the-u-k-challenger-bank-picks-up-additional-60m-in-funding/">existing investors</a> &#8212; Novator, and Kaiser &#8212; and new investor Octahedron Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://spacelift.io">Spacelift</a>, a startup that automates the management of cloud infrastructure, has raised $6 million in a Series A funding round led by London’s Blossom Capital. Polish fund Inovo Venture Partners and Hoxton Ventures are also investing.</p>
<p>The Polish and US-based startup is taking advantage of the opportunity presented by the increasingly complex cloud world, with what it dubs as an ‘infrastructure-as-code (IaC)’ and a ‘policy-as-code’ platform. This allows teams to automate processes, it says, in a more efficient manner without the risk of downtime.</p>
<p>Co-founder Marcin Wyszynski hit upon the idea after working for companies like Deliveroo in the UK and Berlin-based scooter operator TIER Mobility. The company is headquartered in Redwood City, California, US with an additional office in Warsaw, Poland.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wyszynski said in a statement: “The switch to using cloud servers and infrastructure as code has benefits for businesses but it has created new challenges for teams, particularly when they are distributed. The slightest mistake can cause major outages and downtime which is obviously bad for business. We designed Spacelift to minimize these issues, by providing automation, control, and visibility tools to teams wherever they are.”</p>
<p>Imran Ghory, co-founder and partner at Blossom Capital commented: “Managing infrastructure has been a persistent pain point for fast-growing teams and the need for specialized management tool platforms has been underlined by the fact that so many teams are now working remotely.”</p>
<p>Spacelift’s competitors include HashiCorp (which raised $349.2M) and Scalr (raised $7.5M).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since M-Pesa&#8217;s mobile money infrastructure came into play in 2007, there has been a proliferation of fintech services ranging from wallets to savings and loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this mobile money ecosystem growing in double-digits year-on-year, a lot of data is being created in the process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this has left some fragmentation, where one person&#8217;s information </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is diverse and can be accessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> channels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For banks and financial institutions, it becomes difficult to understand and provide insights from users&#8217; data. Over the past three years, some platforms have looked to solve this problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> users&#8217; financial data and share it with these financial players through APIs driving more data-driven insights and value-added products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One such platform is </span><a href="https://pngme.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Africa-focused but U.S.-based unified financial data platform announced its seed round of $3 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment, led by</span><a href="https://t.sidekickopen87.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cN84YW5MlxqH2zGCwVN8Jbw_8QsRtKMnNpH2dnLGMN16gGDtf0YTm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW49HRfc3F4FngW4kBMz443Whc8f43SNpp04&amp;si=8000000001670236&amp;pi=00deaacb-fd0f-4671-ad3f-dcd18e9fd6ac"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Radical Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://t.sidekickopen87.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cN84YW5MlxqH2zGCwVN8Jbw_8QsRtKMnNpH2dnLGMN16gGDtf0YTm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-49HSjjW43Wg3M43Xxg2W3Fbt5S4cQh_BW4fGBqD1LxjkMW3zdYNw3zd14rF3K8RlSW1v31&amp;si=8000000001670236&amp;pi=00deaacb-fd0f-4671-ad3f-dcd18e9fd6ac"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Raptor Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://t.sidekickopen87.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cN84YW5MlxqH2zGCwVN8Jbw_8QsRtKMnNpH2dnLGMN16gGDtf0YTm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW3ZSzDS3zfJ3pF43nppZmLX71&amp;si=8000000001670236&amp;pi=00deaacb-fd0f-4671-ad3f-dcd18e9fd6ac"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lateral Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://t.sidekickopen87.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cN84YW5MlxqH2zGCwVN8Jbw_8QsRtKMnNpH2dnLGMN16gGDtf0YTm101?te=W3R5hFj26QkHmW4mKDsX3F7y_dw3DJppJ48S2&amp;si=8000000001670236&amp;pi=00deaacb-fd0f-4671-ad3f-dcd18e9fd6ac"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">EchoVC</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was closed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Q3 2020 and came after the fintech startup raised $500,000 in pre-seed two years ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It further reflects the continued customer growth from banks, fintechs, credit bureaus and microfinance banks in Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanplayford"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brendan Playford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caterung"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cate Rung</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Pngme started </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a lending platform in 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Playford, who grew up in the U.K., came to East Africa in 2007 to work on philanthropic biofield projects. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He ended up writing short-term loans to entrepreneurs, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania, and during this time formed the basis for which he as CEO and Rung as COO founded Pngme</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was sort of the impetus we needed and also the experience of being credit invisible in the U.K. led Cate and me to found the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focusing on providing access to finance to Africans,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Rung, the company&#8217;s initial thesis was that entrepreneurs didn&#8217;t get enough help, capital-wise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But g</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oing into 2019, when the company raised its pre-seed round, the founders realized another problem &#8212; the lack of data infrastructure to access risk when giving out loans or capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their stint in an accelerator based in Toronto, Canada helped to better understand the more valuable version of the company &#8212; the B2C layer which connects entrepreneurs with finance or the data infrastructure layer to understand risk or a person&#8217;s financial identity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were building two different companies at once, so we had to choose one path. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realised that the data infrastructure layer was critical and a massive pain point in most of sub-Saharan Africa,&#8221; the COO added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme had to make a swift pivot to the latter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building this would have a much more significant impact. Being able to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile money transactions, bank transactions, loan data, behavioural data, process all that data into a structured format and make it available as an open API to developers, fintechs or banks across the continent will provide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">data to power real-time credit and new financial products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the company found out in the course of building that consumers want to understand their finances more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps to navigate their way to financial wellness using credit and, later, more sophisticated products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, financial institutions need the data to know what customer segments to expand to or increase their bottom line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Therefore, placing emphasis on the customers&#8217; needs is one of the company&#8217;s core value propositions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re hyper-focused on providing the highest real-time data coverage on credit-invisible customers, something that no other API is offering in our markets,&#8221; said Playford regarding the company&#8217;s consumer-centric play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Pngme&#8217;s customers include <a href="https://www.simplefi.ng/">SimpleFi</a>, Pavelon, <a href="https://www.readycash.com.ng/">ReadyCash</a>, CashTopUp and <a href="https://www.rigomfb.com/">Rigo Microfinance</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to this, the CEO says the company will integrate with large institutional banks next month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite similarities to other API fintech startups in the region with Plaid-esque functionalities, Playford says Pngme intends to be different from the billion-dollar company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, its focus on traditional channels like USSD data &#8212; which has the highest financial coverage on the continent &#8212; attests to that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve gone a step beyond </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> providing rails to actually building on top of the data. We also provide machine learning insights for our customers,&#8221; Rung said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the platform&#8217;s SDK collects user-permissioned data through a partner’s existing app using a one-click data-sharing feature</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is served</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up through an easy to integrate API that delivers real-time financial data and alerts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 300% month-on-month growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pngme forecasts the number of user-permissioned data profiles created on its platform to reach hundreds of thousands and millions by 2022</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme&#8217;s revenue model is subscription and API-call driven. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform has different tiers; developers can get a set number of free API calls with no subscription with the free tier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he enterprise tier for banks and fintech, API calls </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are charged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and can be discounted in some instances</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides that, the company has a white-glove onboarding process where Playford says developers and startups can reach out to build specific use cases on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since raising its pre-seed round, Pngme has been in stealth mode, working with a close group of customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But with this seed round, the company is going full tilt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Pngme, the investment is being used to grow its Lagos and Nairobi teams, particularly the engineers and data scientists, and scaling its product for banks, mobile money operators and fintechs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lateral Capital, one of the investors in this round, also backs another API fintech startup in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">Mono</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On the firm&#8217;s decision to invest in Pngme, managing partner, Rob Eloff said to TechCrunch that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;over the past five years, we have seen a growing appreciation for the continent-wide challenge of providing accurate relational data for financial services customers across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pngme, we are fortunate to have met a team with a unique solution to the root cause of financial exclusion in Africa, and a unique culture that spans the best of Africa and the U.S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For EchoVC Partners, a Lagos-based early-stage VC, it&#8217;s the remarkable job the Pngme team has done in building and delivering a unified financial data API platform for credit identity and access. This is according to Damilola Thompson, the VP and associate general counsel at the firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, Pngme is processing millions in data points per month. With that scale, Rung </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hopes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it will lead to the creation of new technology and more sophisticated financial products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is most exciting is the way mobile money leapfrogged any sort of traditional financial infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is how we&#8217;re seeing open banking in the U.S. give way to so many new financial products for the end consumer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope that by providing forward-thinking open API layers, the same can happen in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India may soon have another fintech unicorn. BharatPe said on Thursday it has raised $108 million in a financing round that valued the New Delhi-based financial services startup at $900 million, up from $425 million last year.</p>
<p>Coatue Management led the three-year-old startup&#8217;s Series D round. Other six existing institutional investors &#8212; Ribbit Capital, Insight Partners, Steadview Capital, Beenext, Amplo and Sequoia Capital &#8212; also participated in the round, which brings BharatPe&#8217;s total to-date raise to $233 million in equity and $35 million in debt.</p>
<p>The startup said as part of the new financing round it returned $17.17 million to its angel investors and employees with stock option.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With the balance sheet well capitalized (more than US$ 200M in bank), we are now going to keep our heads down and deliver US$30B TPV and build a loan book of US$ 700mn with small merchants by March 2023,&#8221; said Ashneer Grover, co-founder and chief executive of BharatPe.</p>
<p><a href="https://bharatpe.com/">BharatPe</a> operates an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/bharatpe-raises-75m-to-help-indian-merchants-accept-digital-payments-and-secure-working-capital/"> eponymous service to help offline merchants accept digital payments</a> and secure working capital. Even as India has already emerged as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/whatsapp-india-users-400-million/">second largest internet market</a>, with more than 600 million users, much of the country remains offline.</p>
<p>Among those outside of the reach of the internet are merchants running small businesses, such as roadside tea stalls and neighborhood stores. To make these merchants comfortable with accepting digital payments, BharatPe relies on QR codes and point of sale machines that support government-backed UPI payments infrastructure.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111978" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111978" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111978 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="527" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg 1722w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=768,395 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=680,350 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=1536,790 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111978" class="wp-caption-text">Scores of giants and startups are attempting to serve neighborhood stores in India.</p></div></p>
<p>The startup, which serves over 6 million merchants, said it had deployed over 50,000 PoS machines by November of last year, and enables monthly transactions worth more than $123 million. It does not charge merchants for universal QR code access, but is looking to make money by lending. Grover said the startup&#8217;s lending business grew by 10x in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;This growth reiterates the trust that the small merchants and kirana store owners have showed in us. This is just the beginning of our journey and we are committed to build India’s largest B2B financial services company that can serve as one-stop destination for small merchants. For BharatPe, merchants will always be at the core of everything we build,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>BharatPe&#8217;s growth is impressive especially because it was not the first startup to help merchants. In a recent report to clients, analysts at Bank of America said BharatPe has proven that fintech is not the winner takes all market.</p>
<p>&#8220;BharatPe perhaps has the late mover advantages in the space. It was one of the first companies to act as a universal consolidator of QR codes on UPI, giving the merchant the advantage to have one QR code (eventually others like Paytm followed). Unlike its Fintech peers, BharatPe is not educating the merchants but instead following its larger peers who have already educated the merchants,&#8221; they wrote in the report, reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup, which has presence in 75 cities today, plans to further expand its network in the nation with the new fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.northmill.com/international/">Northmill Bank</a>, the Sweden-based challenger that has around 200,000 customers across three European countries, has raised around $30 million in new funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is M2 Asset Management, the Swedish investment company controlled by Rutger Arnhult, and asset management firm Coeli. The injection of cash will be used for continued geographical expansion and to accelerate the development of new products. Notably, this will include plans to launch in 10 new markets as Northmill aims to step on the gas. Next stop, Norway.</p>
<p>As it stands, 2006-founded Northmill is available in Sweden, Norway and Finland, where it competes with incumbent banks with physical branches and the likes of Lunar, Revolut and Klarna (which operates as a bank in its home country of Sweden, and Germany).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More adjacent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/anyfin/">another competitor is Anyfin</a>, which is similar to Northmill&#8217;s &#8220;Reduce&#8221; product, which promises to help customers consolidate their existing loans/credit and lower their interest payments. &#8220;Our fastest-growing product and main driver today is Reduce, which lowers people’s interest on existing credits, part-payments and credit cards,&#8221; explains a Northmill spokesperson.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Yqb81bKvzO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/">Making sense of Klarna</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Founded nearly 15 years ago and originally operating as a credit provider, in 2019 Northmill secured a full banking license, regulated by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. The bank employs 150 people and offers savings, credits, payments and insurances. More generally, it has taken a different and slower path than most of the newer crop of challengers in Europe, relying less on investment to fuel its growth and claims to have been profitable from nearly the get-go.</p>
<p>Cue statement from Rutger Arnhult, chairman of the board of M2 Assets Management: “Northmill Bank is already a profitable company with a proven and sustainable business model, which stands out among today&#8217;s tech investments. We have been following their journey for a while and have been impressed by the founders, as well as the company. The banking market is well on its way to change and the winners will be those who best can adapt to the new digital reality. For me, this is an investment in a tech company with long-term owners, who are just at the beginning of their journey. I see great growth potential in the bank.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This afternoon Bumble priced its IPO at <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/10/2173640/0/en/Bumble-Inc-Prices-2-2-Billion-IPO.html">$43 per share,</a> ahead of its raised IPO range of $37 to $39 per share.</p>
<p>Bumble <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/bumble-files-to-go-public/">filed to go public in mid-January</a>, and offered up its first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">price range on February 2</a>. That range, $28 to $30 per share, wound up coming up short. Bumble <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/with-a-higher-ipo-valuation-is-bumble-aiming-for-match-coms-revenue-multiple/">raised its price range to $37 to $39 per share earlier this week</a>.</p>
<p>Before counting a possible underwriters&#8217; option, Bumble raised $2.15 billion by selling 50,000,000 million shares in its public offering. The company will begin to trade tomorrow morning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bumble&#8217;s debut comes amidst a number of other 2021 offerings, including MetroMile&#8217;s SPAC-led public combination earlier this week. Other well-known companies are anticipated to list this year, including Coinbase and, perhaps, Robinhood.</p>
<p>The public offering of Bumble shares comes after a sustained period when one company, Match, was presumed to be the only possible public dating company. However, the smaller Bumble has proven that there is room for at least one more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://scalarr.io/">Scalarr</a>, a startup that says it uses machine learning to combat ad fraud, is announcing that it has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The company was founded by CEO Inna Ushakova and CPO Yuriy Yashunin, who previously led the mobile marketing agency Zenna. Ushakova told me that while at Zenna, they realized that ad fraud had grown to the point that it posed a real threat to their business.</p>
<p>At the same time, the team wasn&#8217;t impressed by any of the existing anti-fraud solutions, so it built its own technology. Eventually, they shut down Zenna completely and moved the entire team over to Scalarr.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s products include AutoBlock, which is supposed to detect fraud before the advertiser bids on an ad, and DeepView, which is used by adtech platforms (including ad exchanges, demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms).</p>
<p>Scalarr says it can detect 60% more fraud than existing products on the market and that it saved its clients $22 million in ad fraud refunds in 2020. Ushakova attributed this in large part to the startup&#8217;s extensive use of machine learning technology.</p>
<p>She added that while large ad attribution companies are adding anti-fraud products, they aren&#8217;t the focus. And historically, companies have tried to detect fraud through a &#8220;rules-based approach,&#8221; where there&#8217;s a list of behaviors that suggest fraudulent activity — but no matter how quickly they create those rules, it&#8217;s hard to keep up with the fraudsters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fraud is ever evolving,&#8221; Ushakova said. &#8220;It’s like a Tom and Jerry game, so they are ahead of you and we are trying to catch them.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for why machine learning works so much more effectively, she said, &#8220;Only ML could help you predict the next step, and with ML, you should be able to detect abnormalities that are not classified. Right after that, our analytics should be able to take a look at those abnormalities and decide whether something is statistically important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scalarr&#8217;s Series A was led by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, with participation from TMT Investments, OTB Ventures and Speedinvest. Among other things, the company will use the money to expand its presence in Asia and continue developing the product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, there are a number of website builders aimed at creators who want to point fans to a dedicated landing page from their social media profile. If you&#8217;ve spent any time on TikTok or Instagram, you&#8217;ve likely come across one of these simplified &#8220;link in bio&#8221;-style websites &#8212; like those hosted by <a href="https://linktr.ee/">Linktree</a>, for example. A new startup called <a href="https://beacons.ai/">Beacons</a> is now entering this market with the goal of making &#8220;link in bio&#8221; websites even more powerful. Its website builder offers creators an expanded set of tools to monetize their community, including through donations, sales, paid requests, affiliate shopping and more.</p>
<p>After signing up for the service, <a href="https://beacons.ai/">Beacons</a> walks the user through a series of questions, many which can be answered with just a &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; For example, Beacons may ask the user if they want to accept donations or collect followers&#8217; emails, if they make TikTok or YouTube videos, and which category they&#8217;re in, in terms of the content they create.</p>
<p>This information is used to set up their Beacons landing page with the right content sections, which Beacons calls &#8220;blocks.&#8221; At launch, Beacons offers around a dozen of these configurable blocks, like email and SMS collection modules, video embed blocks for TikTok or YouTube creators, music blocks for embedding a track or album, a Twitter block to embed a tweet or Twitter profile, and link blocks, similar to Linktree, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s even a &#8220;friends&#8221; block, which is like a modern-day Myspace Top 8. This lets you link out to your friends on either Beacons, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok.</p>
<p>An area where Beacons differentiates itself from other &#8220;link in bio&#8221; website builders, however, is with its set of &#8220;monetization&#8221; blocks. Today, it has four tools for creators who want to generate revenue from their online presence. One of these is similar to <a href="https://www.cameo.com/">Cameo</a>, as it allows the creator to set up a menu of options to take fan requests for personalized content. For instance, fans could ask a fitness influencer to critique their routine, or they could pay to have their burning questions answered by someone they admire. The creator can then send out a personalized response either publicly or privately.</p>
<p>Other monetization blocks allow creators to accept donations or sell digital downloads &#8212; like e-books or paid video content, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111827" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111827" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111827" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="341" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png 2524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=1536,770 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=2048,1027 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-sites.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111827" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://beacons.ai/gallery">Beacons</a></p></div></p>
<p>The fourth, and perhaps most interesting, monetization block is a TikTok shopping feature. It allows creators to embed their TikTok videos where they recommend products directly on their Beacons website. From here, they can add affiliate links to the products in question, allowing them to directly generate revenue when fans purchase the items they&#8217;ve featured.</p>
<p>This particular feature comes at an opportune time. Today, TikTok is only beginning to formalize its plans around e-commerce. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/629c1c17-3daa-46af-8177-1814baaa2bed">In a recent presentation to marketers,</a> TikTok spoke of its plans to launch new online shopping tools that would allow brands to more directly reach TikTok&#8217;s younger audience. TikTok has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">partnered with Shopify</a> on social commerce, and has experimented with live video shopping, including with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">a holiday event hosted by Walmart</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>But TikTok&#8217;s creators have already been driving shopping trends across categories like <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-tiktok-changed-fashion-this-year">fashion</a>, <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/tiktok-biggest-fashion-beauty-trends-1234684172/">beauty</a>, <a href="https://www.whowhatwear.com/tik-tok-home-decor-trends">home décor</a>,<a href="https://people.com/lifestyle/viral-tiktok-finds-amazon/"> household items</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/tiktok-is-driving-massive-toy-sales-during-coronavirus-pandemic.html">toys</a> and much more, to the point that <em>&#8220;TikTok made me buy it,&#8221;</em> has become a common excuse for the impulse purchases prompted by TikTok&#8217;s viral content. By allowing creators to now more directly and financially benefit from these trends is the next logical step.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111830" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111830" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111830" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="407" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg 1270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/beacons-monetize.jpeg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111830" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Beacons</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for Beacons comes from co-founders Neal Jean, Jesse Zhang, Greg Luppescu and David Zeng. Neal, Jesse and David met while in the PhD program at Stanford studying different areas of research, like machine learning and AI. Greg, meanwhile, did his Master&#8217;s at Stanford, then went on to work at Apple on the Apple Watch team.</p>
<p>Neal, Jesse and David had teamed up on Beacons and went through the Y Combinator Summer 2019 batch, iterating on ideas and pivoting the product several times. Some of those early concepts may eventually return &#8212; like a Shopify integration that would connect creators with brands selling on Shopify, for example.</p>
<p>The broader focus, however, had always been on helping creators make money, says Neal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even before our current product, we were really focused on trying to help creators solve monetization,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;When we kind of made this mini-pivot into the more Linktree-like product, we thought about building features that can help creators actually generate revenue &#8212; which I don&#8217;t think Linktree or any of the existing incumbents in the space were doing. Even today, you can&#8217;t actually make any money through Linktree,&#8221; he notes.</p>
<p>Linktree, of course, is only one of many &#8220;link in bio&#8221; websites on the market today, which means Beacons still faces <em>a lot</em> of competition. Other rivals include <a href="https://later.com/linkinbio/">Linkin.bio</a>, <a href="https://lnk.bio/">Lnk.bio</a>, <a href="https://dash.shorby.com/smartpage?&amp;lp">Shorby</a>, <a href="https://tap.bio/@tap.bio">Tap.bio</a>, <a href="https://embedsocial.com/feedlink/">Feedlink.io</a>, <a href="https://linkinprofile.com/">Link in Profile</a>, <a href="https://milkshake.app/">Milkshake</a>, <a href="https://campsite.bio/">Campsite</a>, <a href="https://bio.fm/">bio.fm</a>, <a href="https://url.bio/">url.bio</a> and <a href="https://biolincs.me/">biolincs.me</a>, for example.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hM-HxQWYC1A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike some of its competitors, Beacons offers its tools for free and instead monetizes through a <a href="https://pricing.beacons.ai/">premium plan</a> ($10/mo) that allows creators to use their own custom domain. It also makes money by taking a percentage of sales on the requests and sales blocks, which is either 9% on the free plan or 5% on the paid plan. This rev share doesn&#8217;t bring in much money today &#8212; only &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of dollars &#8212; but the team believes that will scale as the startup grows and gains a large user base.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our strategy is&#8230;to continue building out more of these different kinds of revenue streams for creators,&#8221; says Neal. &#8220;And as we do that, I think, the fraction of transactional revenue will become higher relative to the subscription revenue than it is today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since launching in private beta last September, Beacons has seen 90,000 sign-ups and now has over 20,000 people who are considered active users of the product &#8212; most arrived in the last couple of months when the service began to roll out some of its newer features. So far, Beacons hasn&#8217;t done any paid marketing, with around 77% of new users coming to Beacons because they saw it on someone else&#8217;s profile.</p>
<p>The team raised a small, post-YC angel round of around $600,000 but is looking to fundraise in the future.</p>

<p>For in-person interviews not recorded in Pineapple’s Brooklyn studio, my basic reporting kit includes a Zoom H5, which has two XLR channels and allows me to give one Rode NTG-2 shotgun mic to the host Natalia and the other to the interviewee. (On mic stands, of course — the mic itself is prone to handling noise.) I’ve got a Rode pistol grip for when we, say, knock on doors in the neighborhood of the former Chippendales club in LA, looking for people who had been around when the party scene at the club was supposedly causing wars between the owners, neighbors and the police. (Luckily, we found Naomi, 94, who had been there since 1972 and had stories for days. She’s in the podcast.) Christine showed me how she brilliantly uses a cross-body camera strap attached to her recorder so she can hang it comfortably around her. For gear bags I used to swear by the Lowepro Passport Sling, but now that I’m older (lol), one-strapping isn’t comfortable for a long day in the field, so I use a regular backpack. My kit also includes Sony MDR-7506 headphones, an assortment of three- and six-foot XLR cables (always have backups), a deadcat, extra SD cards, an Electro Voice RE50/B mic, pens, snacks, release forms and batteries. So many batteries.</p>

<p>Then the pandemic hit. We all went on lockdown. We had done most of our interviews but there were a few we still needed, plus all the host tracking for the series. So we shipped Natalia a kit: a Zoom H6, a Shure SM7B cardioid dynamic announcer microphone, a CloudLifter CL-1 Microphone Activator, a broadcast arm, XLR cables and a windscreen. Natalia set up shop in her closet, surrounded by clothes, a fleece blanket on the floor, and as many cushions as she was willing to pull off her couches and chairs. (Sound bounces off of hard surfaces. The soft materials absorb it so the recordings won’t sound echoey or “roomy.”) We sent our amazing engineer Hannis Brown mic tests so he could diagnose the set-up from afar and suggest tweaks. And Natalia, bless her, was incredibly game to essentially become her own recording engineer ON TOP OF hosting an entire show. We quickly got accustomed to doing everything remotely and over Zoom, as all of us everywhere did.</p>

<p>When it came to remote interviewing, we would connect over Zoom, and both Natalia and our interviewee would record themselves. (We always recorded the Zoom as a backup too.) It was up to us producers to talk our interviewees through self-syncing. Experience and teamwork was of the utmost importance here. Interviewees only had so much time, and explaining how to set up a recording on a smartphone (or iPod!, yes, really) and transfer a test recording quickly, and then troubleshooting any audio problems in their location was important to getting a high-quality interview without taxing anyone&#8217;s patience. There are several useful guides and graphics out there that walk through the set-up. There’s something a little bit lost, of course, when we don’t get to walk into people’s homes for interviews, or even when former Chippendales dancers can’t produce their original costume in the middle of the interview — as one guy did. But everyone was incredibly kind and patient and willing to do this for us, for which we are very, very grateful.</p>
<p>In the end, we interviewed about 70 people for this series. We wrote 26 drafts of our first episode. We reviewed 100+ hours of archival footage. And I believe there are still more stories to be told when it comes to Chippendales.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no matter where in the world anyone is, we have the tools to do it.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a deep tech investor, I have often noticed that deep tech startups go through a different evolution cycle than a typical B2B or B2C company.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the challenges they face along the way are different — commercialization tends to be more complex and founders are often required to approach it differently.</p>
<p>Deep tech companies are usually built around a novel technology that offers significant advances over existing solutions in the market; often they create new markets that don’t yet exist. Taking these technologies from &#8220;lab to market&#8221; requires substantial capital carrying a much higher degree of risk than an average venture investment.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The majority of VCs are often surprised by the amount of complexity involved in building a successful deep tech company.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Typically, the underlying intellectual property (IP) of a deep tech company is unique and hard to recreate, resulting in a significant competitive advantage.</p>
<h2>High risk, high reward</h2>
<p>Since most deep tech companies are built around a fundamentally new and unproven technology, they carry higher risk. Typically, the tech has been tested in a lab or a research center and the early results are therefore often derived in a controlled environment. As a result, while building a product, founders are likely to encounter technical challenges along the way and won’t be able to eliminate the technology risk until later in the process.</p>
<p>By comparison, if a company is building a marketplace for used cars, for example, the technology risk is almost zero. Deep tech companies have the capability to create new markets with little competition and can replace existing technologies while fundamentally transforming an industry.</p>
<p>Microsoft, Nvidia, ARM, Intel and Google were all deep tech startups in the beginning. These companies will almost always require higher capital, carry higher risk and have longer time to return on investment.</p>
<p>However, if successful, they could deliver outsized returns over an average venture investment.</p>
<h2>Technology-first approach</h2>
<p>An obvious, but fundamental difference with deep tech companies is their technology-first approach. Typically, the founder has developed a novel technology or IP as part of their Ph.D. thesis or postdoc work and is in search for a real-world problem it can solve. Most startups, in general, pick an existing problem in a market they know well and develop a product that solves for that problem and they have a clear sense of the problem they need to solve.</p>
<p>Deep tech entrepreneurs take the opposite approach and as a result they often suffer from SISP (a solution in search of a problem), as Y Combinator calls it. Founders need to be aware of this and must be willing to pivot and repivot based on market and customer feedback. Investors should be prepared for this before backing the company and support the founders as they navigate through the challenges of building a successful deep tech company.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota Motor North America said Wednesday it will bring three new electrified vehicles to the U.S. market, as the automaker seeks to win over customers by offering a variety of lower emission and zero-emission cars and SUVs.</p>
<p>Two of the new vehicles will be all electric and one will be a plug-in hybrid, the company said Wednesday. Sales of the vehicles are expected to being in 2022.</p>
<p>The aim, according to Bob Carter, TMNA&#8217;s executive vice president of sales, is to offer customers multiple choices of powertrain that best suits their needs. The automaker is developing and selling hybrids and plug-in hybrids like the Toyota Prius and Toyota RAV4 and fuel cell vehicles such as the Toyota Mirai.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said that by 2025 all of its Toyota and Lexus models will have an electrified option. The automaker is also developing a dedicated battery electric platform called e-TNGA that can be configured to meet different needs.</p>
<p>This all-of-the-above approach is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and capturing more market share, which Toyota believes can only be achieved through variety. Toyota wants to have 40% of new vehicle sales be electrified models by 2025. By 2030, the company expects that to increase to nearly 70%.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe the fastest way to lower greenhouse gases in the transportation sector is to offer drivers lower carbon choices that meet their needs,&#8221; Gill Pratt, chief scientist of Toyota Motor Corporation and CEO of Toyota Research Institute, said in a statement. &#8220;At every price point and with multiple powertrains, we can put more people in cleaner automobiles across North America to have the greatest near-term impact on total carbon emissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s internal research, which was <a href="https://github.com/khamza075/PVC">built off of a tool</a> that shows the trade-off between GHG Emissions and total cost of ownership, found that emissions of a currently available battery-electric model and a plug-in hybrid model are roughly the same in on-road performance when factoring in pollutants created by electricity production for the average U.S. energy grid used to charge batteries.</p>
<p>Manufacturing is a component of GHG emissions, Toyota noted. Researchers found that the production of a PHEV emits less GHG since it uses a smaller, lighter weight battery. The company also argued that plug-in hybrids are less expensive to buy and own, compared to a BEV.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s argument — that BEVs and PHEVs can provide similar environmental benefits — syncs up with its business plan. One of the BEVs will be Toyota branded and imported from Japan at the start of production, according to the automaker.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since the start of the year, I&#8217;ve covered nine M&amp;A deals already, the largest being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/citrix-is-acquiring-wrike-from-vista-for-2-25b/">Citrix buying Wrike for $2.25 billion</a>. But not every deal involves a huge price tag. Today we are going to look at three smaller deals that show there is plenty of activity at the lower-end of the acquisition spectrum.</p>
<p>As companies look for ways to enhance their offerings, and bring in some talent at the same time, smaller acquisitions can provide a way to fill in the product road map without having to build everything in-house.</p>
<p>This gives acquiring companies additional functionality for a modest amount of cash. In smaller deals, we often don&#8217;t even get the dollar amount, although in one case today we did. If the deal isn&#8217;t large enough to have a material financial impact on a publicly traded company, they don&#8217;t have to share the price.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at three such deals that came through in recent days.</p>
<h2>Tenable buys Alsid</h2>
<p>For starters, <a href="https://www.tenable.com/">Tenable</a>, a network security company that went public in 2018, bought French Active Directory security startup <a href="https://www.alsid.com/">Alsid</a> for $98 million. Active Directory, Microsoft&#8217;s popular user management tool, is also a target of hackers. If they can get a user&#8217;s credentials, it&#8217;s an easy way to get on the network and Alsid is designed to prevent that.</p>
<p>Security companies tend to enhance the breadth of their offerings over time and Alsid gives Tenable another tool and broader coverage across their security platform. &#8220;We view the acquisition of Alsid as a natural extension into user access and permissioning. Once completed, this acquisition will be a strategic complement to our Cyber Exposure vision to help organizations understand and reduce cyber risk across the entire attack surface,&#8221; according to the<a href="https://investors.tenable.com/investor-resources/investor-faqs"> investor FAQ on this acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>Emmanuel Gras, CEO and co-founder, Alsid says he started the company to prevent this kind of attack. &#8220;We started Alsid to help organizations solve one of the biggest security challenges, an unprotected Active Directory, which is one of the most common ways for threat actors to move laterally across enterprise systems,&#8221; Gras said in a statement.</p>
<p>Alsid is based in Paris and was founded in 2014. It raised a modest amount, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/alsid-raises-14-7-million-to-secure-your-active-directory-installation/">approximately $15,000</a>, according to Crunchbase data.</p>

<h2>Copper acquires Sherlock</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.copper.com/">Copper</a>, a CRM tool built on top of the Google Workspace, announced it has purchased <a href="https://www.sherlockscore.com/">Sherlock</a>, a customer experience platform. They did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>The pandemic pushed many shoppers online and providing a more customized experience by understanding more about your customer can contribute to and drive more engagement and sales. With Sherlock, the company is getting a tool that can help Copper users understand their customers better.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sherlock is an innovative engagement analytics and scoring platform, and surfaces your prospects&#8217; and customers’ intentions in a way that drives action for sales, account management and customer success professionals,&#8221; Copper CEO Dennis Fois wrote in <a href="https://www.copper.com/resources/copper-acquires-sherlock-engagement-analytics-platform?utm_source=pr&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=sherlockannouncement">a blog post announcing the deal</a>.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Relationships are based on engagement, and with Sherlock we are going to create CRM that is focused on action and momentum.&#8221;</p>

<h2>RapidAPI snags Paw</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that APIs have changed the way we think about software development, but they have also created a management problem of their own as they proliferate across large organizations. <a href="https://www.rapidapi.com/">RapidAPI</a>, an API management platform, announced today that it has acquired <a href="https://paw.cloud/">Paw</a>.</p>
<p>With Paw, RapidAPI adds the ability to design your own APIs, essentially giving customers a one-stop shop for everything related to creating and managing the API environment inside a company. &#8220;The acquisition enables RapidAPI to extend its open API platform across the entire API development lifecycle, creating a connected experience for developers from API development to consumption, across multiple clouds and gateways,&#8221; the company explained in a statement.</p>
<p>RapidAPI was founded in 2015 and has raised over $67 million, according to Crunchbase data. Its most recent funding came last May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/rapidapi-api-marketplace-funding/">a $25 million round</a> from Andreessen Horowitz, DNS Capital, Green Bay Ventures, M12 (Microsoft’s Venture Fund) and Grove.</p>
<p>Each of these purchases fills an important need for the acquiring company and expands the abilities of the existing platform to offer more functionality to customers without putting out a ton of cash to do it.</p>

<p>In the last year alone, Zynga acquired two game studios based in Istanbul — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/">Peak Games for $1.8 billion</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">Rollic for $180 million</a> (in the latter case, it only acquired 80% of the company initially).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There are now four or five examples of us having done this successfully,&#8221; Gibeau said. &#8220;When we started, nobody was picking up our phone calls. Now when we call, we are a bit of a destination of choice for a lot of developers out there.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zmQ2SS31ZO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/goodbye-flash-goodbye-farmville/">Goodbye Flash, goodbye FarmVille</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Goodbye Flash, goodbye FarmVille&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/goodbye-flash-goodbye-farmville/embed/#?secret=zmQ2SS31ZO" data-secret="zmQ2SS31ZO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Gibeau and I were speaking about Zynga&#8217;s fourth quarter earnings, in which the company reported all-time high revenue of $616 million and a net loss of $53 million (though another measure of profitability, adjusted EBITDA, was actually positive at $90 million). Daily active users were up 77% year over year, to 36 million, while monthly active users were up 103%, to 134 million.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Zynga is forecasting revenue of $2.6 billion (a 32% year-over-year increase) and adjusted EBITDA of $450 million for 2021. And while another acquisition could significantly grow the business, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Gibeau noted that the company&#8217;s forecasts have &#8220;no acquisitions assumed,&#8221; adding, </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We&#8217;re in a great position, because we would prefer to do acquisitions in 2021, but we don&#8217;t have to do any deals.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>There are new games lined up for 2021, including Puzzle Combat, Farmville 3 and a Star Wars title. The company also plans to continue developing hypercasual games, to develop more cross-platform games, to expand internationally and to continue building out its ad network — in fact, he suggested that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/apple-app-tracking-transparency/">Apple&#8217;s upcoming privacy changes</a> could be good for Zynga.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of traditional marketing services are not going to be able to survive very well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because we’re a first-party data company — all the data we generate is coming to our services from our games — and because we&#8217;re at scale … IDFA is an opportunity for our company.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>We’ve been having a tough time filling vacant engineering and other positions at our company and are planning to make a more concerted effort to recruit internationally. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have suggestions for attracting workers from abroad?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Proactive in Pacifica</strong></p>
<p>Dear Proactive,</p>
<p>Yes, I have many suggestions on what you can do to support international talent interested in moving to the United States. Immigration is a great benefit for attracting the best and the brightest team members from around the globe. And providing immigration security through visa practices and green card programs supports retaining these valued individuals. Consider sponsoring international students and other qualified candidates in the upcoming H-1B lottery in March.</p>
<p>As it now stands, the H-1B lottery will be random this year, not pay-to-play. We anticipate the electronic lottery process will follow these dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>March 9 at 9 a.m. PST: H-1B registration process opens.</li>
<li>March 25 at 9 a.m. PDT: H-1B registration process closes.</li>
<li>March 31: You’ll know if your H-1B beneficiaries were selected electronically in this initial round of the lottery.</li>
<li>April 1: First date to file H-1Bs selected in the lottery to request a 10/1/2021 or later start date.</li>
<li>June 30: Last anticipated day to complete filing of selected H-1B petitions in this initial round of the lottery.</li>
<li>After June 30: Possibility of a second lottery for registrations submitted in March.</li>
</ul>

<p>Through the H-1B and other proactive immigration-support measures you can take, your international team members will enjoy a greater sense of immigration security. This allows them to focus on their job rather than worrying about their immigration status. Here are my recommendations for drawing international talent from abroad and fostering productivity and loyalty.</p>
<h2>Establish your company&#8217;s immigration policy</h2>
<p>I recommend working with an experienced immigration attorney who can help your company develop an immigration policy based on your company’s core values, recruiting and immigration budget, and growth plan. Think of immigration as a benefit and a way to differentiate your company from others when recruiting top talent. Providing immigration benefits and immigration security goes a long way toward building team member loyalty and longevity.</p>
<p>For some companies, the best policy may be to have no policy, but it’s important to be deliberate about it and how that will affect your ability to make decisions and budget. For other companies, they implement a limited immigration policy to, for example, hire 40 engineers as soon as possible. Even with a decentralized workforce, a new recruit may be happy to move from Ukraine to Idaho even if your company is not based there.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
