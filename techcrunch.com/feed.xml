										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Treasury is wading into the fight against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> by sanctioning virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> exchange Suex for its role in facilitating ransomware payments.</p>
<p>The sanctions are the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364">first of its kind</a> against a cryptocurrency exchange, and prohibit Americans from doing business with the company.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest action as part of a U.S. government-wide effort to counter the rise of ransomware — including a cross-agency taskforce and a $10 million bounty for information on state-backed cybercriminals — that has so far seen mixed results. Just this week, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">BlackMatter ransomware group</a> demanded $5.9 million in ransom from a hacked Iowa farm services provider.</p>
<p>But experts believe that the Treasury’s action against Suex, and the U.S. government’s apparent decision to employ the age-old tactic of following the money rather than the criminals themselves, will come as a major blow to many of the biggest ransomware operators. While the sanctions won’t end ransomware attacks for good, dismantling the mechanisms for ransomware groups to cash out their cryptocurrency could be vital in slowing them down.</p>
<p>Chanalysis, which aided the U.S. in its investigation of Suex, has lauded the move as a “big win”, labeling the exchange as one of the worst-offenders of cryptocurrency-based money laundering. In <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ofac-sanction-suex-september-2021">a blog post</a>, the blockchain analysis firm said Suex netted almost $13 million from ransomware operators like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/universal-health-services-ransomware/">Ryuk</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/maze-ransomware-group-shutting-down/">Maze</a> since the exchange was founded in 2018. Chanalysis also said the exchange took in more than $24 million from crypto scam operators.</p>

	</p>
<p>The Treasury said that over 40% of known Suex transactions were associated with bad activity.</p>
<p>Gurvais Grigg, Chainalysis’s global public sector and chief technology officer, believes the U.S. will continue to target exchanges, yet his analysis shows that illicit activity is largely concentrated to just a few services.</p>
<p>“A group of just five received 82% of all ransomware funds from 2020, based on our data at the time,” he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Paul Sibenik, lead case manager at blockchain forensics company CipherBlade, said the U.S. is likely to also go after lesser-known nested services and over-the-counter (OTC) brokers — where trading happens directly between two parties but utilizes a major exchange for liquidity. Suex, for example, uses the infrastructure of a larger exchange to handle its transactions.</p>
<p>“The usage of a rogue OTC like Suex can be an effective workaround so that an attacker need not have an account at the applicable exchange, but ultimately it&#8217;s fair to say that the exchange is still facilitating the transaction from the ransomware attacker,” Sibenik tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Exchanges have an obligation to monitor suspicious transactions going into applicable accounts, but it&#8217;s also critically important for exchanges to ensure that whatever rogue OTCs and nested services they do business with are compliant themselves,” said Sibenik. “Otherwise, there can absolutely be a threat of enforcement actions, and arguably legal liability as well.”</p>
<p>The Treasury’s latest sanctions — and the threat of more — will undoubtedly see ransomware actors change their tactics, just as some have done by shifting to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">double extortion techniques</a>. Rather than just encrypting files, double extortion ransomware exfiltrates the data first and threatens to publish the files if the ransom isn&#8217;t paid.</p>
<p>Sibenek has already seen some threat actors moving from Bitcoin to Monero, which he describes as “untraceable in any meaningful and practical way.” Even this is less viable for ransomware groups moving to cash out, with many exchanges having delisted so-called privacy coins due to regulatory guidance.</p>
<p>“Cryptocurrency is only useful if you can buy and sell goods and services or cash out into fiat, and that is much more difficult with privacy coins,&#8221; Grigg says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making smartphones more accessible is always a good idea, and Google&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/making-android-more-accessible">latest features</a> bring quick actions and navigation to people whose expressions are their primary means of interacting with the world. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.vision.switches">Project Activate</a> and <a href="http://g.co/cameraswitches">Camera Switches</a> let users perform tasks like speaking a custom phrase, or navigating using a switch interface, through facial gestures alone.</p>
<p>The new features rely on the smartphone&#8217;s front-facing camera, which can watch the user&#8217;s face in real time for one of six expressions: a smile, raised eyebrows, opened mouth, and looking left, right, or up. It relies entirely on local computing and no image data is saved, nor is it doing what is generally understood as &#8220;facial recognition&#8221; — this type of machine learning can focus specifically on, for example, identifying the eyebrows and sending a signal whenever they move past a certain, customizable threshold.</p>
<p>Each expression can be assigned a different role. Camera Switches integrates with Android&#8217;s existing switch compatibility, by which people who use assistive tech like a joystick or blow tube can navigate the phone&#8217;s OS. Now that can be done without any peripheral device at all, and users can pick various facial gestures for iterating through selections, confirming a choice, backing out, and so on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206267" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206267" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2206267" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="550" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg 1772w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=768,412 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=680,365 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=1536,824 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/google-activate-1.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2206267" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Using Project Activate, expressions can be tied to self-contained actions like speaking a phrase. Many people with disabilities rely on caretakers for a variety of reasons, but one thing you can&#8217;t ask a caretaker to do is get your caretaker&#8217;s attention! So one useful application might be assigning (say) an extended eyebrow raise to have the device speak the phrase &#8220;hey!&#8221; or &#8220;I need help with something,&#8221; or &#8220;thanks!&#8221;</p>
<p>The gestures can also be used to play an audio file, or text or call a predetermined number. More expressions and more capabilities are on the way, as well as more languages — of course faces don&#8217;t have languages, but the app and support documentation do, so Project Activate will start with English-speaking countries and move out from there. Camera Switches, on the other hand, will be available in 80 languages from the start.</p>
<p>Note that these can&#8217;t both be used at once, since they both require access to the camera and expression recognition thing. So users should make sure they have a backup method for navigation. Both should run on pretty much any Android phone from the last five years or so.</p>

<p>Lastly, an update to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/googles-lookout-app-for-vision-impaired-now-scans-food-labels-and-long-documents/">Lookout</a> app, which reads labels for people with visual impairments, adds the ability to scan and read out handwritten content the way it can with printed things. That&#8217;s useful for sticky notes, &#8220;gone fishing&#8221; type signs on the doors of stores, and things like greeting cards with notes from the sender. The app has seen big increases in usage over the last year so they&#8217;re building it out. (Support for identifying euro and Indian rupee banknotes should help fuel that growth too.)</p>
<p>All the new stuff should be available later this week free of charge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla broke ground on its &#8220;Megafactory,&#8221; a new production facility in California, so christened because it will produce the company’s large-scale battery system Megapack.</p>
<p>News of the previously unannounced factory was confirmed by the Lathrop Mayor Sonny Dhaliwal, in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sonny.dhaliwal.5">Facebook post</a> that was deleted and re-posted. “We are proud to be the home of the Megafactory, Tesla’s most recent expansion here,” he said. “The future of green energy will be produced right here in our community.”</p>
<p>The factory, in the small northern California city of Lathrop, is near Tesla’s automotive plant in Fremont. Lathrop is also home to Tesla’s 870,000-square-foot distribution center.</p>
<p>Megapacks, as well as Tesla’s other energy storage products, were being manufactured at the electric automaker’s so-called &#8220;Gigafactory” in Sparks, Nevada. This is the first facility dedicated to the Megapack, though it’s unclear if production of Tesla&#8217;s other storage products – which include Powerwall and Powerpacks – will shift to the new factory.</p>
<p>The new factory is a positive signal for the automaker’s growing Energy division. As opposed to the Powerwall, which is a home consumer battery product, the Megapack is meant for utility-scale energy storage. Utilities building solar and wind farms are increasingly pairing these with large batteries to store excess energy to discharge to the grid later. Just last week, the Arizona electric utility Salt River Project brought online a 100 megawatt-hour Megapack project.</p>
<p>In a second-quarter earnings call in June, CEO Elon Musk confirmed that there was “significant unmet demand” for these storage products, adding that the Megapack was “basically sold out through next year.&#8221; He also estimated demand for Powerwall to be in excess of 1 million units per year.</p>
<p>Much of the bottleneck isn’t merely due to production capacity – Musk also told investors that cell supply and the global semiconductor shortage were creating production ceilings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwall as you do in a car, so it&#8217;s like, which one do want to make?” he said. “Cars or Powerwalls? So we need to make cars, so that will &#8212; Powerwall production has been reduced.”</p>
<p>The chip shortage, however, seems to show no signs of abating; in fact, the White House on Thursday will be hosting its second summit with semiconductor manufacturers and purchasers to address the ongoing effects on the technology and auto industries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How’s this for a bit of regional synchronicity? This week, a pair of Chinese robotics firms secured $200 million rounds. It’s all part of a booming ecosystem that we get some insight into every so often. There are so many players in China’s robotics space it can be hard to keep track of some of the innovation over there, but these sorts of large funding rounds are a surefire way to make some waves.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is anticipated to be a major acceleration point for the country, on the tail of some major manufacturing shortages that brought the world’s supply chains to a standstill. But this week’s pair of big raises point toward an adoption of automation that moves beyond manufacturing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124338" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124338" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2124338" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6049932f64b5c.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124338" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hai Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Hai Robotics grabbed the bigger headlines of the two with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/hai-robotics-picks-up-200m-for-its-warehouse-robot/">announcement of a joint Series C and D that amount to $200 million</a>. The company’s Shenzhen location puts it smack in the heart of China’s manufacturing zone, but the company’s specialty is warehouse/fulfillment robotics. It already has a decent-sized international footprint with deployment in 30 countries, including a recent deal with Booktopia, a large Australian online book retailer.</p>
<p>5Y Capital and Capital Today led the C and D, respectively. The rounds also featured Sequoia Capital China, Source Code Capital, VMS, Walden International and Scheme Capital. The funding will be used to further Hai’s international expansion and build out its existing presence in China.</p>

The round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, with participation from CICC ALPHA and Prosperity7 Ventures. The company specializes in service robots &#8212; not dissimilar from the sorts of robo-waiters we’ve seen from California-based Bear Robots. It’s a sizable industry on its own, though the company has already begun expanding its use cases, including hotels and hospitals.</p>

<p>Keenon says its robots have been deployed in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and Singapore, and the funding will go toward further expanding that footprint.</p>
<p>“We believe robotic solutions can have a profound impact across the services industry by assisting with repetitive, tedious workflows,” SoftBank’s Kentaro Matsui said in a release. “Using AI and machine learning, combined with advanced manufacturing capabilities, Keenon is building innovative robotics to help increase productivity for restaurants, hotels, and hospitals in China and globally.”</p>

<p>Newly flush with cash, Locus Robotics (which seems to make its way into this roundup more often than not), <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/locus-robotics-acquires-waypoint-robotics-301380031.html">has agreed to acquire Waypoint Robotics</a>. Waypoint more or less operates in the same warehouse category as Locus. Its flagship product is Vector, an autonomous omnidirectional robot capable of moving around up to a 300-pound payload.</p>
<p>&#8220;Locus is the proven leader in the development of highly productive and innovative AMR technology that efficiently solves our customers&#8217; needs for total warehouse optimization,&#8221; Locus CEO Rick Faulk said in a release. &#8220;As order fulfillment and labor shortages continue to grow around the world, the acquisition of Waypoint Robotics will accelerate our ability to meet these global needs in just months rather than years, helping us drive the digital transformation of the warehouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Locus announced a $150 million Series E in February and an additional $50 million this month. The company is clearly looking to build a robust fulfillment ecosystem it hopes can probably compete with Amazon’s offering.</p>

<p>The first fruits of Boston Dynamics’ acquisition by Hyundai <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/boston-dynamics-owner-hyundai-deploys-spot-for-factory-safety-monitoring/">are finally arriving</a>. The drably-named “Factory Safety Service Robot” is effectively a bespoke Spot robot designed to patrol factories, starting with a pilot at the Hyundai-owned Kia Plant in Seoul. The robot comes equipped with lidar and a thermal camera and can patrol the factory floor autonomously or be controlled remotely through a browser.</p>

<p>This week, Nvidia and Open Robotics announced a partnership that looks to be beneficial for both parties. Essentially, the agreement is designed to make Nvidia’s Jetson development platform and Open Robotics’ ROS 2 software work together. The deal is designed to speed up development time for roboticists using Nvidia’s perception technology.</p>
<p>“As more ROS developers leverage hardware platforms that contain additional compute capabilities designed to offload the host CPU, ROS is evolving to make it easier to efficiently take advantage of these advanced hardware resources,” Open Robotics CEO Brian Gerkey <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-ai-perception-coming-to-ros-developers/">said in a release</a>. “Working with an accelerated computing leader like NVIDIA and its vast experience in AI and robotics innovation will bring significant benefits to the entire ROS community.”</p>

<p>And hey, happy Disrupt week! Shout-out to RoboDeck, the deck maintenance robot. The company is competing in this week’s Startup Battlefield with a product they assure us is more than just “Roomba, but for resealing your deck” (to quote Greg’s piece). The system applies sealant and uses built-in mapping technology to determine the edges of the surface to avoid falling off.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201759" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201759" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2201759" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg" alt="Picture of a RoboDeck device designed to keep your house's deck looking good" width="1024" height="596" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg 1072w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg?resize=768,447 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/RoboDeck.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201759" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> RoboDeck</p></div></p>
<p>The company has a prototype at the moment, capable of handling 500 square feet of deck in a charge. RoboDeck plans to offer the devices as an RaaS rental model when it comes to market. The company has thus far raised $500,000, with most of the funding coming from SOSV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The battle to win Startup Battlefield began long before TechCrunch Disrupt kicked off Tuesday. Startup founders from all over the world applied to what has been described as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/announcing-the-startup-battlefield-companies-pitching-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">most competitive batch in TechCrunch history</a>. Twenty startups competed this week on the TechCrunch virtual stage for $100,000 in equity-free prize money and last night, we announced the finalists: <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://adventr.io/">Adventr</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.cellinobio.com/">Cellino</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.withkoa.com/">Koa</a>, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://nthcycle.com/">Nth Cycle</a> and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://tatum.io/">Tatum</a>.</p>
<p>The stakes stretch beyond prize money, however. The winner will become known to investors and potential partners and customers, thanks to global press coverage the event enjoys. It&#8217;s a hefty award and one that requires a panel of expert judges to help determine who should receive it. It&#8217;s a critical appointment — while brief — that can have a lasting impact on the founders who win, as well as help maintain TechCrunch&#8217;s reputation as an outlet that finds innovative tech and entrepreneurs behind it.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are the five judges who will pick the 2021 Startup Battlefield winner:</p>
<p><b>Kirsten Green</b> is the founder and managing partner of Forerunner Ventures, a San Francisco-based VC firm she formed in 2010. Green has built her career as a VC by becoming an expert within the fields in which she invests, beginning in the consumer space and expanding to health and wellness, durable supply chains and more. Before starting Forerunner, the UCLA business economics graduate and licensed CPA was an equity research analyst and investor at Banc of America Securities, formerly Montgomery Securities, covering publicly traded retail and consumer stocks.</p>
<p>Green, who has collected a series of accolades, including being honored in Time’s 100 Most Influential People and named a Top 20 Venture Capitalists by The New York Times, currently serves as a board member on several portfolio companies, including Glossier, Faire, Hims-Hers, Curated, Ritual and Modern Fertility. She is also on the board of Nordstrom and previously served on the boards of Dollar Shave Club and Bonobos.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Lanzone </strong>was named earlier this month as the next <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/jim-lanzone-breaks-up-with-tinder-swipes-right-to-take-the-ceo-job-at-yahoo-renate-nyborg-takes-tinder-ceo-role/">CEO of Yahoo Inc</a>. (formerly Verizon Media and new TechCrunch corporate parent), a job he will officially begin September 27. The appointment comes <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">less than two weeks after Apollo Global completed its acquisition of the media group from Verizon for $5 billion. Lanzone is leaving his current CEO position at dating app Tinder to take this new role.</span></p>
<p>Lanzone has a long history in media and as an entrepreneur. He worked at Ask.com (formerly Ask Jeeves), a division of IAC/InterActiveCorp., for seven years, eventually leading the internet company. He went on to found Clicker, <span id="m_2435934466641439592m_4193223825249713276:2hy.2" role="menuitem" aria-haspopup="true">an</span> internet video search and programming guide.

					<description><![CDATA[The lesson appears to be that revenue growth matters more than near-term margins for fintech companies, allowing them to secure valuations that far surpass their final private marks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startups are having one hell of a week.</p>
<p>On the heels of Boston-based software-and-payments company Toast&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/indications-of-a-hot-market-abound-as-freshworks-toast-price-ipos/">strong IPO pricing</a>, Remitly <a href="https://ir.remitly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/remitly-announces-pricing-initial-public-offering">priced</a> shares in its own debut above its proposed range yesterday evening. The Seattle-based fintech company sold 12,162,777 shares (7,000,000 primary) at $43 apiece. The company had previously targeted a $42 per-share max price for its IPO equity.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>At $43 per share, Remitly is valued less like a fintech company with gross margins in the 50% to 60% range and more like a middle-tier public SaaS firm, flush with recurring revenues and net-dollar retention north of 100%.</p>
<p>Toast, after seeing its shares rise sharply after starting to trade yesterday, sports a similar revenue multiple despite far weaker blended gross margins.</p>
<p>The lesson from today&#8217;s public markets appears to be that revenue growth matters more than near-term margins for fintech companies, allowing them to secure valuations that far surpass their final private marks. It&#8217;s an incredibly bullish set of results for fintech startups; they are worth more than they might have thought, or than their investors previously were willing to pay.</p>

It&#8217;s just perhaps even <em>better </em>than that for fintech upstarts.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the math, and then ask when the hell Chime and Klarna are going to get off their duffs and go public.</p>
<h2>Fintech is the new SaaS?</h2>
<p>In the second quarter of 2021, Toast <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001650164/000119312521276664/d166297ds1a.htm#tx166297_1">reported revenues</a> of $424.7 million and revenue costs of $336.3 million, giving the company a blended gross margin of just under 21%. Toast has high-margin SaaS revenues, low-margin fintech revenues and then smaller business lines that float around breakeven. It shakes out to a somewhat modest figure.</p>
<p>And worth $30.856 billion this morning, according to Yahoo Finance data, Toast has a run-rate multiple of 18.2x. Per <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">Bessemer data</a>, that&#8217;s roughly on par with the median revenue multiple for public SaaS companies.</p>
<p>Our read of the Toast revenue multiple is that public markets are valuing it far more on growth than margins, which means that fintech startups can accrete SaaS multiples no matter their gross margins, provided sufficient near-term revenue upside. Notable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/22/governor-newsom-signs-nation-leading-legislation-expanding-protections-for-warehouse-workers/">this week signed a bill</a> aimed at protecting warehouse workers from unsafe quotas. The bill, which cites issues around bathroom breaks, rest periods and other safety laws, has been seen as a repudiation of longstanding complaints against workplace conditions at Amazon fulfillment centers.</p>
<p>Introduced by Assembly Member Lorena Gonzalez in February,<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB701"> the bill</a> is designed to increase the transparency of quotas imposed on employees at warehouse distribution centers. Under the law, employers are required to inform workers of speed quotas. The legislation is also designed to mitigate punitive retaliation for not meeting quotas, including skipping breaks.</p>
<p>“This bill would provide that if a current or former employee believes that meeting a quota caused a violation of their right to a meal or rest period or required them to violate any occupational health and safety law or standard,” it reads, in part, “they have the right to request, and the employer is required to provide, a written description of each quota to which the employee is subject and a copy of the most recent 90 days of the employee’s own personal work speed data.”</p>
<p>The legislation was the most prominent in a list of 33 bills signed by the embattled Governor, along with a pair of vetoes. In statement tied to the news, Newsom commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We cannot allow corporations to put profit over people. The hardworking warehouse employees who have helped sustain us during these unprecedented times should not have to risk injury or face punishment as a result of exploitative quotas that violate basic health and safety. I’m proud to sign this legislation giving them the dignity, respect and safety they deserve and advancing California’s leadership at the forefront of workplace safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>For her part, Gonzalez has been more direct about the bill’s intended impact on Amazon, citing the company’s track record in <a href="https://a80.asmdc.org/press-releases/20210922-governor-signs-gonzalez-bill-creating-nations-first-protections-against">a statement released</a> following the governor’s signing.</p>
<p>“Amazon’s business model relies on enforcing inhumane work speeds that are injuring and churning through workers at a faster rate than we’ve ever seen. Workers aren’t machines. We’re not going to allow a corporation that puts profits over workers’ bodies to set labor standards back decades just for ‘same-day delivery,’ ” Gonzales writes. “This bill is simply about giving workers some basic dignity back and empowering them to keep themselves safe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In recent years, Amazon fulfillment centers have been a flash point for worker unionization efforts. Most recently, workers at one of the company’s Alberta fulfillment centers filed to hold a union vote, with a representative for Teamsters Canada<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/canadian-amazon-facility-files-union-vote-union-2021-09-14/"> calling the company</a>, “profoundly anti-worker.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new forecast on the state of the app economy indicates the third quarter will see record-breaking revenues spent on apps and games. According to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/q3-2021-biggest-quarter-yet/">App Annie</a>, consumers worldwide will spend $34 billion on apps and games in Q3, a 20% year-over-year increase on spending. The increase indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on consumer habits and behavior is having a lasting effect when it comes to how people are now using apps for entertainment, shopping, work, education and more.</p>
<p>App Annie, we should note, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">made headlines last week</a> for having massaged its data in earlier years using confidential sources, then misrepresented this to its trading firm clients as having been statistically modeled with internal controls to prevent such a thing from occurring. This resulted in a $10+ million securities fraud settlement with the SEC, as firms used the data to make investment decisions, as a result.</p>
<p>But App Annie data today still remains a fairly accurate representation of the mobile market, despite these manipulations, and for now is still one of many top companies that supply large app publishers, marketers and investors with information related to the mobile ecosystem.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2LY4zmEv2h"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">App Annie and co-founder charged with securities fraud, will pay $10M+ settlement</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;App Annie and co-founder charged with securities fraud, will pay $10M+ settlement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/embed/#?secret=2LY4zmEv2h" data-secret="2LY4zmEv2h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The firm said that the largest contributor to app revenue in Q3 continues to be in-game spending and mobile subscriptions &#8212; the latter, a focus of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/fortnite-likely-isnt-coming-back-to-the-app-store-anytime-soon/">lawsuits</a> and increased regulation as both Apple and Google fight to retain their right to a cut of the purchases flowing through their app store platforms. Gaming continues to account for the majority of consumer spend, though non-gaming spending has grown its share over the past few years, thanks to subscriptions.</p>
<p>Android also still continues to outpace iOS on downloads, but the reverse is true when it comes to consumer spending.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207456" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207456" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Downloads-1024x576-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207456" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Downloads in Q3 will have grown by 10% year-over-year to reach a record high of 36 billion, driven by Google Play and particularly downloads in emerging markets like India and Brazil. The strongest growth was also seen in Brazil, the Philippines and Mexico, and the Latin American market has begun to catch the attention of global publishers now, as well, as one with growth potential.</p>
<p>Industries driving download growth include travel, education and medical &#8212; all three of which have had pandemic impacts. Travel app downloads grew 35% quarter-over-quarter on Google Play and 15% on iOS as the summer travel season has picked up amidst widespread vaccine rollout. Medical and education apps, of course, have pandemic ties, as users turned to mobile technology to keep up with online learning and with doctors&#8217; appointments, COVID testing and vaccine appointments.</p>
<p>But iOS still reigns when it comes to revenue generated by mobile apps, accounting for 65% of app stores&#8217; consumer spending globally, which is in line with the past four quarters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207455" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207455" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-Q3-Worldwide-Consumer-Spend-1024x576-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207455" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>Consumer spending on iOS apps grew 15% year over year to $22 billion, and 15% year-over-year on Google Play to reach around $12 billion. Most of this revenue is generated by gaming apps, which account for 66% of the spend across both apps stores. In terms of non-gaming apps, iOS commands 76% of consumer spending. Much of the growth outside of gaming, across both platforms, comes from entertainment apps, photo and video apps, social media and dating apps, the firm says.</p>
<p>The U.S. and China are the largest iOS markets for consumer spending, with Japan, the U.S. and Taiwan accounting for the strongest growth. On Google Play, the U.S., Japan and South Korea were the largest markets by consumer spend, but Japan, Russia and Australia drove the growth.</p>
<p>While examinations of revenue and downloads have historically helped to paint a broad picture of the state of the mobile economy, as markets mature there&#8217;s greater interest in user engagement with apps &#8212; like those consumers already have installed on their devices.</p>
<p>A report from an App Annie competitor <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/state-of-app-engagement-report-2021">Sensor Tower, also out today</a>, dives into active users, sessions and retention metrics for games and non-games alike. The firm found that the top 500 apps worldwide now average 91.7 million monthly active users and this number has grown by 8.4% year-over-year during the second quarter, up from 84.6 million in Q2 2020.</p>

<p>Business apps saw the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between Q1 2018 and Q2 2021, climbing nearly 42% over that time frame, Sensor Tower said. Meanwhile, consumers in Q2 2021 spent the most time in entertainment apps, with each of the top 100 seeing nearly 29 minutes of daily usage, on average.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207461" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207461" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207461" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg 2304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/business-MAU-growth-q2-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207461" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>Among games, shooter genre games &#8212; like PUBG Mobile and Garena Free Fire &#8212; saw the most daily active users in Q2, as the top 50 games in this genre averaged 7.6 million daily active users. In terms of weekly actives, however, hypercasual games came out on top.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower also credits earlier increases in active users across apps to the COVID-19 pandemic as users who turned to mobile devices during lockdowns. But after a slight dip in Q3 2020, growth in active users has now returned to pre-pandemic levels, it said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors has now joined a slew of other major automakers, including Toyota, Chinese state-backed SAIC Motor and Mercedes-Benz AG, in putting its chips behind Chinese autonomous driving startup Momenta.</p>
<p>GM, the largest automaker in the U.S. in terms of vehicle sales, said Tuesday it will invest $300 million in Momenta to accelerate the development of AV tech for future GM vehicles in China. Julian Blissett, executive VP of GM and president of GM China, said in a statement that the investment will help the automaker bring “solutions tailor-made for [GM’s] consumers in China.”</p>
<p>The news comes less than six months after Momenta closed a nearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/momenta-500-million-fundraise/">$500 million</a> funding round, which saw participation from SAIC, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz AG and Bosch. As TechCrunch’s Rita Liao notes, “mega-fundraising has become common in the capital-intensive autonomous vehicle world.” But it appears that the startup is moving closer to commercialization as it aims to mass-produce cars equipped with its software by the end of this year.</p>
<p>This is just the latest aggressive investment into next-gen technology from GM, which said in June it had earmarked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion</a> for electric and AV ventures through 2025. Here in the U.S., GM’s interest in autonomous technology is best-known via its self-driving subsidiary, Cruise, which recently tapped a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/cruise-secures-5b-credit-line-to-buy-electric-autonomous-cruise-origin-vehicles-from-gm/">$5 billion</a> line of credit from the automaker’s financial firm.</p>
<p>But GM has also established a strong series of partnerships in China, as it seeks to take a firm foothold in the world’s largest EV market. The country’s best-selling electric vehicle, a tiny city car called the Wuling Mini EV, is manufactured by SAIC-GM-Wuling &#8212; as the name suggests, a joint venture between GM, SAIC and Wuling Motors. SAIC-GM-Wuling also manufactures the popular brand Baojun.</p>
<p>Chinese municipal governments have also taken a notably progressive stance toward autonomous driving, Chinese AV startup executives noted at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/the-rise-of-robotaxis-in-china/">TC Mobility in June</a>.</p>
<p>“In China, each local government is incentivized to really act like entrepreneurs like us,” Huan Sun, Europe general manager at Momenta, said during the event. “They are very progressive in developing the local economy… What we feel is that autonomous driving technology can greatly improve and upgrade the [local governments’] economic structure.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>While GM declined to state when drivers would see Momenta tech in its Chinese vehicles, a spokesperson for the automaker confirmed that the partnership between the two companies would not extend to GM vehicles manufactured and sold in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous vehicle company Motional is expanding its operations and employee headcount in Las Vegas, including tripling the size of its testing facility, in the run up to its planned 2023 commercial deployment of robotaxis.</p>
<p>The company, the product of a $4 billion joint venture between Aptiv and Hyundai, has been in Las Vegas for nearly four years. Motional first began testing it autonomous vehicle in Las Vegas through a partnership with Lyft. The two companies kicked off with what was supposed to be a weeklong pilot program to offer rides in autonomous vehicles on the Lyft network in Las Vegas during the 2018 CES tech trade show.</p>
<p>The partnership predates the joint venture with Hyundai. At the time, Motional was known as Aptiv Autonomous Mobility Group. That temporary experiment, which has always included a human safety driver, was extended and still exists today. As of February 2020, the program had given more than 100,000 paid self-driving rides in Aptiv’s — now Motional’s — self-driving vehicles, per the Lyft app. Motional has not provided an updated number on the number of paid rides taken through the Lyft app.</p>
<p>Motional&#8217;s operations in Nevada extend beyond its partnership with Lyft. The company also tests on public roads on an ongoing basis in Nevada.</p>
<p>The expansion plans at its Las Vegas facility also include doubling its operations center. What this actually means is that the company is now using its entire 130,000-square-foot technical center that Motional opened several years ago to house its fleet of autonomous vehicles as well as an engineering team dedicated to research and development of software and hardware systems, validation and mapping.</p>
<p>As part of this expansion, Motional is also hiring more than 100 new employees. The company currently employs more than 250 people in Las Vegas.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FkTuGlpZqQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/motional-ceo-hints-at-an-autonomous-future-in-logistics/">Motional CEO hints at an autonomous future in logistics</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Motional CEO hints at an autonomous future in logistics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/motional-ceo-hints-at-an-autonomous-future-in-logistics/embed/#?secret=FkTuGlpZqQ" data-secret="FkTuGlpZqQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Motional&#8217;s growing operations in Las Vegas — and notably a closed track that will allow four times the volume of testing — are in preparation for its next-generation robotaxi based on the all-electric Hyundai Ioniq 5. Motional&#8217;s President and CEO Karl Iagnemma said the expansion will allow the company to accelerate testing ahead of the commercial deployment of its fully driverless robotaxis in 2023.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas announcement comes a month after Motional <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/">expanded operations in California</a>. The company said in August it is opening a new operations facility in Los Angeles to support testing on public roads, hiring more engineers and adding an office in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The investment into California and this latest plan to grow operations in Nevada follows a hiring spree that has pushed Motional’s total headcount to more than 1,000 people, an expansion into Seoul and its announcement last December to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/">fully driverless robotaxi services</a> in major U.S. cities in 2023 using the Lyft ride-hailing network.</p>
<p>Motional didn&#8217;t disclose its investment into the California expansion, nor has it shared financial details of its plans for the Las Vegas facility. A company spokesperson said it &#8220;does represent Motional’s largest investment in our Nevada operations.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Clarification: Motional announced it was doubling its operations. It is not doubling the size of its facility, instead it is using the entire center and adding more than 100 employees. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever had to take out a loan, you know just how many documents are involved in the approval process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is tedious and time-consuming, and in many more cases than you’d expect &#8212; still manual.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ocrolus.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a startup that is hoping to change that with an automation platform that it says analyzes financial documents with over 99% accuracy. To that end, the New York-based company today has announced that it has raised $80 million in Series C funding toward its mission of helping lenders automate the underwriting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fin VC led the financing, which values New York-based Ocrolus at “north of $500 million” and brings its total funding raised since its 2014 inception to over $100 million. Thomvest Ventures, Mubadala Ventures, Oak HC/FT, FinTech Collective, QED Investors, Bullpen Capital, ValueStream Ventures, Laconia, RiverPark Ventures, Stage II Capital and Cross River Bank also participated in the latest round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is one that is refreshingly transparent about its financials. From the first quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2021, Ocrolus has grown its revenue from $1 million to $20 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), according to co-founder and CEO Sam Bobley. It has managed to land a number of high-profile fintech customers, including Brex, Enova, LendingClub, PayPal, Plaid and SoFi. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s done that by spending roughly $10 million in total sales and marketing expenses, Bobley said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it’s ready to go after more traditional financial institutions too. With its new capital, the startup plans to “more aggressively” build products for the mortgage lending and banking industries and expand its U.S. operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus uses a combination of technology, including OCR (optical character recognition), machine learning/AI and big data to analyze financial documents. But what sets it apart, says Bobley, is the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) component also used in document processing to further ensure accuracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the company aims to help lenders make “faster, data-driven decisions.” Its technology can classify financial documents, capture key data fields, detect fraud and analyze cash flows, according to Bobley. It’s clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a digital acceleration in many industries, with financial services being among the most affected. Prior to the pandemic, less than 1% of loans in the world were made online, notes Bobley. But since the COVID-19 outbreak, demand for digital lending technology among traditional financial services firms has “accelerated dramatically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, as COVID-19 has forced financial institutions to evolve, every lender and bank has no choice but to offer online options to customers,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fin VC managing general partner and founder Logan Allin agrees, pointing out that fintechs and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">banks alike still struggle with “mountains” of digital and paper documents in extracting the financial data they need to process and analyze during the loan application process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ocrolus has emerged as one of the pillars of the fintech ecosystem and is solving for these challenges using OCR, AI/ML, and big data/analytics,” he wrote via email. “We believe that Ocrolus is just getting started in terms of the use cases and scope of their platform and we are excited about this unconstrained TAM.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus is not the only player in the space, but what’s helping drive its growth and set it apart, Allin believes, is its fraud detection and compliance overlay capabilities, as well as its tailored analytics and benchmarking capabilities for its customer base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Ocrolus started </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the intent to automate the long-term care Medicaid application process. It found that “well-paid professionals” were spending their time combing through documents page by page, line by line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we started to research the problem and what we learned is that existing technology in the market simply was not accurate enough to be useful,” Bobley told TechCrunch. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon and Google offer OCR products, but many struggle at reading text off of PDFs and images, particularly when the documents are semi-structured or unstructured, Bobley said. It’s also difficult for machines to make sense of all the varying formats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted to create a new way of doing this. And what we did was we built a machine learning-based platform that also incorporates humans,” he said. “The goal was that no matter what the document that was submitted looks like &#8212; if it&#8217;s a clean document from Chase, or a blurry cell phone image from a community bank in Kansas &#8212; we&#8217;ll be able to process it with perfect accuracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the solution can’t do automatically, it slices into smaller tasks and routes to its own team of analysts and quality control specialists to perform data verification. The company then uses a series of algorithm checks to make sure its workers did the work correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Long story short, we deliver back perfectly accurate structured digital data for every single file we process,” Bobley said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206996" style="width: 2493px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206996" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2206996 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ocrolus-data-extraction-e1632373276873.jpg" alt="" width="2483" height="1674" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206996" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocrolus </span></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About a year or so into the company’s life, the team realized that “lending was a much bigger and more attractive market opportunity”  than Medicaid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really entered the fintech lending space at the right place at the right time,” Bobley told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2016, the company had launched its official product and was generating revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the benefits of our software is that it has really helped fintech lenders scale,” Bobley said. “Our product, frankly, is 10x better than doing it manually. Once we processed the loans instantly or in a matter of minutes, when everybody else was taking hours or days, people started to come to us &#8212; including big fintech lenders &#8212; without us even having a sales force.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for Bobley, the startup is more than just about speeding up the loan process. It is also about financial inclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform helps lenders automate underwriting and intelligently leverage cash flow and income data for credit scoring” Bobley said. “By enabling lenders to more quickly analyze diverse sources of financial data, Ocrolus levels the playing field for every borrower, providing expanded access to credit at a lower cost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to also use its new capital to continue to hire, with a focus on its machine learning and data science teams. It’s also planning to open a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new data quality control facility in Florida to accommodate financial institutions and government entities with onshore data requirements. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Open banking &#8212; a new approach to payments and other financial services that disrupts traditional card-based infrastructure by linking directly into banks &#8212; is having a moment. On the heels of open banking startup TrueLayer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/truelayer-nabs-130m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-open-banking-rises-as-a-viable-option-to-card-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hitting a $1 billion valuation</a> in its latest round after seeing strong traction for its services, today another open banking startup, <a href="https://www.payvyne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vyne</a>, is officially opening for business, and announcing seed funding of $15.5 million to help it grow.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from Hearst, Entrée Capital, Triplepoint, Seedcamp, Venrex, Founder Collective and Partech, with Alex Chesterman (founder of Rightmove and CEO of Cazoo), Charlie Dellingpole (CEO and founder of ComplyAdvantage) and Will Neale (founder of Grabyo) also participating. CEO Karl MacGregor said in an interview that the round was &#8220;massively oversubscribed.&#8221;</p>
<p>London-based Vyne has been quietly building its platform &#8212; which targets merchants to help them build open-banking-based payment services &#8212; for the past 18 months, honing the tools based on feedback from early customers that it&#8217;s picked up ahead of today&#8217;s wider launch. The sizable seed round from strong investors is due to a few factors. Firstly, because of its early traction &#8212; the company says that it&#8217;s already processing millions of pounds in transactions in the UK each month, and is growing currently at a rate of 95% each month &#8212; in what (secondly) many believe is poised to be a big market in coming years. And thirdly, because of the pedigree of its four founders:</p>
<p>MacGregor&#8217;s long financial services resume included years as an executive at Barclays (at Barclaycard), online betting company Ladbrokes (where he oversaw not just payments but also fraud), and Worldpay. COO Damien Cahill spent years at Worldpay, as well as Amazon. CTO Adam Rowland was also a Worldpay alum, among other financial services roles elsewhere. And business development head Nick Daniel spent years in financial services at Logica (now part of CGI) and VocaLink (which was acquired for nearly $1 billion by Mastercard a few years ago).</p>
<p>With a lot of that experience covering payment systems based on cards and card networks, it was the perfect knowledge bank for understanding why open banking was such an important innovation, and why it had an opportunity to disrupt a lot of what&#8217;s in place today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our key takeaway over those years [of experience] was that payment cards are not a great fit for e-commerce,&#8221; MacGregor said. &#8220;They were designed 40 years ago, and are costly and inefficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that the annual cost of dealing with fraud is now at €25 billion (there is a comparable number in <a href="https://www.merchantsavvy.co.uk/payment-fraud-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this report</a>), and that&#8217;s before considering other issues related the friction of using cards for payments, such as shopping cart abandonment (users give up instead of pulling out cards and punching numbers in), mistyped details, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Because of that, MacGregor said many in the industry, including Vyne&#8217;s co-founders, &#8220;saw open banking as a huge opportunity&#8221; to transform the rails around how people get paid. &#8220;That is a global scale opportunity, and this is what motivates us,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p>MacGregor claims that implementing an open-banking-based system can save a merchant up to 65% in costs because of the added speed and efficiency (and no longer needing to pay fees to card networks).</p>
<p>TrueLayer&#8217;s value in the market, as one of the early movers in this space, has been in how it worked with a wide range of major and smaller banks to help build the infrastructure and services to integrate their banking services into a wider network where they could be used for direct payments and providing other kinds of financial data about their customers. It then used that critical mass to build out the connectors to those who wanted to use those integrations to do stuff: build payment flows, authenticate users and more.</p>
<p>As a later entrant, Vyne&#8217;s value has been in using some of that groundwork to then focus more on the merchant end of that ecosystem, and to make their open-banking-based services work more seamlessly for their customers. For example, if a customer selects an open banking option for payment in an app, the customer is then redirected to the banking app used for banking to authenticate the transaction and the connection without needing to enter any details. &#8220;The UX has been significantly improved,&#8221; MacGregor said.</p>
<p>Targeting primarily digitally native consumers as the most likely early adopters, Vyne also lets merchants build QR codes and pay-by-link to complete transactions.</p>
<p>The fact that we&#8217;re still talking about early adopters, however, speaks to the bigger challenges that exist, not just for Vyne but all startups focused on open banking. Open banking is at its most mature state in the UK, but even here it&#8217;s relatively young: regulations only came into effect at the start of January 2018. Europe has followed on, and although there are companies like Plaid in the U.S. that have made some interesting headway in building services that bypass payment rails, regulation has been <a href="https://www.finextra.com/the-long-read/234/why-bidens-executive-order-is-a-green-light-for-us-open-banking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow to follow</a>. Some have even <a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/open-banking-treasury-prime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculated</a> it may never arrive.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s catchily-named <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Banking Implementation Entity</a> (OBIE for short), a trade body for those building in this area, is predictably upbeat about growth. However, if the numbers speak for themselves, there is clear opportunity. The OBIE <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/three-years-since-psd2-marked-the-start-of-open-banking-the-uk-has-built-a-world-leading-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a recent report</a> that some 300 fintechs are now in the open banking ecosystem, and more than 2.5 million consumers in the UK are using services enabled by open banking (these include payments, getting lines of credit, authenticating services, and more). And, API call volumes reached 6 billion in 2020, up from just 66.8 million in 2018. Adoption is coming, if perhaps slowly and not as internationally as what open banking is trying to replace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our view is that this is the hockey stick of growth that all VCs like,&#8221; Megumi Ikeda, the MD for Hearst Investments, said in an interview. &#8220;The second factor is the habits of consumers. They have shifted to a cashless economy [but] merchants are still operating on old banking rails&#8230; Open banking helps the merchants catch up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps just as importantly, by giving customers a more direct grip on how and where their financial data is used, by dis-intermediating the card companies (and credit ratings, and many others involved) in the process, open banking is part of a bigger evolution in how personal data and information are being used. As systems catch up with what we use them for, that can only be a good thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earning passive income as an investor in single-family rental homes is a dream for many, but also something that can be intimidating to break into.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.awning.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a startup that aims to make the process less intimidating through a platform designed to allow individuals to invest in single-family rental homes not just in the cities or states in which they live but in other markets remotely as well. And today, the San Francisco-based real estate brokerage is coming out of stealth with $9.3 million in a seed funding round led by Global Founders Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MassMutual Ventures and several strategic angel investors, including Side co-founders Guy Gal &amp; Ed Wu, SafeGraph founder Auren Hoffman, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opendoor’s former VP of Analytics Peter Fishman, Lightspeed Ventures Partner Justin Overdorff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Scale founder Lucy Guo, also participated in the financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Shri Ganeshram</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danaus Chang in 2019 to start</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning after stints as a founding team member at FlightCar and lead product and engineering at Eaze. Prior to becoming an entrepreneur, Ganeshram had dropped out of high school in Texas after gaining early admission to MIT (where he later co-founded FlightCar).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform launched in closed access earlier this year, and is today open to investors across the U.S. and Canada. Currently, it connects buyers with listings in three states &#8212; California, Texas and Florida. Part of the plans for the new capital is to add new markets to its portfolio in the coming months.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning works by using machine learning and data analytics in an effort “to surface the best nationwide single-family rental properties for investors, with estimations of their financial returns.” A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wning customers are paired with advisors to determine their investment strategy, and Awning’s local agents “qualitatively” review every property. Those advisors can also help investors secure financing and connect buyers with &#8220;vetted&#8221; property managers to oversee their properties and manage leasing and day-to-day maintenance.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a similar, but different, model to another startup we covered recently &#8212; Mynd, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a company that also aims to make it easier for people to buy and manage single-family rental properties, which last week announced it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/mynd-raises-57-3m-from-qed-investors-at-a-870m-valuation-to-give-people-a-way-to-invest-in-rental-properties-remotely/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $57.3 million in funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from QED Investors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unlike Mynd, Awning won’t manage the properties for investors. It is also different in that it is focused on helping individual investors, while Mynd also serves institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning’s &#8220;advisors&#8221; (also licensed real estate agents) curate properties that they believe are the best fit for an investor based on their budget and goals, and using the startup’s proprietary machine learning model, can estimate the rent, expenses, appreciation and potential ROI on every listing on the market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform does this by ingesting all the listings from different MLSes in the various markets, and automatically analyzes each one for returns and risks after an advisor learns about a potential investor’s financial goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once an investor is ready to move further, they can use our platform to communicate with an advisor and place offers,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ganeshram said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207226" style="width: 2828px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207226" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2207226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg" alt="" width="2818" height="1528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg 2818w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=768,416 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=1536,833 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=2048,1110 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Awning-2.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2818px) 100vw, 2818px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207226" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Awning</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ganeshram, the process to invest in single-family rentals has been “cumbersome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels like it’s stuck in the last century,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awning’s “strong” human and technology components make it a faster and easier experience, the company claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the platform has helped facilitate the sale of $5 million in real estate. It makes money by taking a commission from the seller, just as other real estate brokerages do, and doesn’t charge any additional fees. That commission is typically 6% built into the listing, paid upon closing &#8212; with 3% going to the respective agents for the buyer and seller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later this year, Awning plans to launch in Florida and Alabama, and then other markets over the next year. Expansion can be challenging because the company must set up a licensed brokerage in each state it wants to enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Founders Capital’s </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donaldstalter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Stalter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said his firm has known Awning co-founders “for years” before Awning&#8217;s formation, and when they approached his firm about starting the company, he “knew that we needed to lead their first round of financing,” Stalter wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kendrickgeluzkho/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kendrick Kho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Global Founders Capital said he has invested in other real estate investment startups over the past five years, and believed that Awning stands out from other offerings with its focus on individual buyers, rather than institutions. He also likes the company’s approach of  “getting buyers familiar with their potential investments as actual physical houses instead of lines on a spreadsheet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With their product and engineering expertise, they have quickly built a platform where curation, education, and data accuracy are superior to alternatives,” Kho wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also attracted to the fact that Awning does not reject the idea of partnering with real estate agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of entrepreneurs in real estate tech believe that human agents are superfluous, but don&#8217;t realize that when a buyer in New York City wants to buy their very first investment property and are looking at homes hundreds of miles away,” Kho added, “he or she wants a human agent there to answer questions and be an expert guide on the process.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EU lawmakers are finally set to standardize charging ports for consumer electronics devices like smartphones and tablets &#8212; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613">announcing</a> a proposal today that, once adopted, will see the region settle on USB-C as a universal charging port for gadgets which will also include cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld videogames consoles.</p>
<p>Some smaller consumer electronics devices &#8212; like smart watches and fitness bands &#8212; are being excluded owing to factors like their size and conditions of use.</p>
<p>The Commission plan will also see regional lawmakers unbundle the sale of chargers from mobiles so they are not automatically included in the box.</p>
<p>Fast charging standards will also be harmonized under the proposal &#8212; while device makers will have requirements to provide users with &#8220;relevant information about charging performance&#8221;, including info on the power required and if a device supports fast charging.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will make it easier for consumers to see if their existing chargers meet the requirements of their new device or help them to select a compatible charger,&#8221; the Commission notes, going on to suggest that the full package of measures will help consumers limit the number of new chargers they buy and help them save €250M a year on unnecessary charger purchases.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613">announcement</a> of the proposal, the Commission acknowledges that the &#8220;voluntary approach&#8221; it has pursued for over a decade &#8212; attempting to nudge the electronics industry toward a common standard through mechanisms like a Memorandum of Understanding &#8212; has failed to deliver the sought for standard, with still three different types of mobile phone chargers in play for instance.</p>
<p>The wider aim here is to make a meaningful dent in the global e-waste mountain by reducing a portion generated by the consumer electronics sector &#8212; with the Commission noting, for example, that consumers already own around three mobile phone chargers on average, of which they use two on a regular basis. Ergo, there&#8217;s simply no call for device makers to put a new charger in the box every time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Disposed of unused chargers are estimated to represent some 11,000 tonnes of e-waste annually, the Commission adds.</p>
<p>One of the non-standard chargers still on the mobile market belongs to the iPhone maker Apple, of course &#8212; which has resisted pressure to put a standard port in its devices &#8212; so a pan-EU law to enforce a universal charger could force the tech giant to finally abandon its proprietary Lightning port.</p>
<p>For years, Apple has presided over a sprawling and doubtless highly lucrative accessories business rather than switch to more standard ports on its devices. Indeed, sometimes it has even removed standard ports &#8212; deleting the 3.5mm headphone jack off of the iPhone, for instance. It means that users of Apple&#8217;s devices typically have to purchase dongles if they wish to gain access to more standard ports &#8212; generating yet more future e-waste.</p>
<p>Whether the EU&#8217;s legislative proposal will actually outlaw Apple&#8217;s dongle-based workaround to embedded universality remains to be seen. (We&#8217;ve put the question to the Commission.)</p>

<p>Commenting on the Commission proposal in a statement, Margrethe Vestager, its EVP for digital strategy, said: “European consumers were frustrated long enough about incompatible chargers piling up in their drawers. We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger. This is an important win for our consumers and environment and in line with our green and digital ambitions.”</p>
<p>In a mirror statement, Thierry Breton, the EU&#8217;s internal market, added: “Chargers power all our most essential electronic devices. With more and more devices, more and more chargers are sold that are not interchangeable or not necessary. We are putting an end to that. With our proposal, European consumers will be able to use a single charger for all their portable electronics – an important step to increase convenience and reduce waste.”</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s other institutions &#8212; the European Parliament and Council &#8212; will still need to back the proposal in order for it to become law. Although the European Parliament has long expressed frustration with the Commission&#8217;s failure to deliver a common charging standard &#8212; and voted overwhelmingly for tougher action on the issue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/eu-lawmakers-take-fresh-aim-at-apples-lightning-connector-with-latest-e-waste-push/">last year</a> &#8212; so MEPs will likely be keen to make a pan-EU law on this happen.</p>
<p>Even so, there won&#8217;t be a radical change overnight. The Commission has suggested a transition period of 24 months from the data of adoption of the legislative &#8212; so even if the Parliament and Council quickly agree to the plan it will still be years, plural, before device makers have to comply.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s PR notes that it wants to give industry &#8220;ample time&#8221; to adapt to the planned law change, even though the sector has had over a decade of pressure on exactly this issue.</p>
<p>A further step will be needed for Europe to get the common charger solution the Commission wants &#8212; with more harmonization required to ensure interoperability of the external power supply. Legislators say that piece will be dealt with by the review of the Ecodesign Regulation &#8212; slated to be launched later this year with the aim of it also entering into force at the same time as the common charger port requirement.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_4614">FAQ</a> on the latter proposal, the Commission answers its own question on why it&#8217;s taken it so long to grasp the legislative nettle with this issue, writing that it had initially sought to continue with a more &#8220;ambitious&#8221; voluntary approach in the hopes that the sector would engage. However it said proposals put forward by the industry &#8220;fell short&#8221; &#8212; and would not have delivered a common charging solution.</p>
<p>Legislators learning that they do actually need to legislate looks like an important lesson as the world gears up to tackle other existential environmental challenges &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/uns-ipcc-report-on-climate-change-sounds-code-red-for-planet/">climate change</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/calyxia-bags-17-6m-to-tackle-the-global-microplastics-problem/">microplastics pollution</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly been devastating on many levels. But if there’s any silver lining in the global crisis, it could be that it’s less taboo to talk about feeling anxious, depressed or burnt out. Because chances are, the person you’re talking to is feeling one of those things too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s no surprise that therapists and psychiatrists alike are struggling to keep up with demand. But not all therapists are created equal and unfortunately, there are psychiatrists out there that can be too quick to dole out medicine to treat a person’s issues.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.meruhealth.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meru Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a startup that aims to solve a number of the challenges associated with getting access to quality mental health care, with what it describes as a comprehensive online mental health solution. Kristian Ranta founded the San Mateo, California-based company in 2016 after his brother, Peter, committed suicide. In his view, if his brother had access to better mental health options, he might not have taken his own life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As COVID forced people to seek online options for all types of healthcare, including mental health, it’s no surprise that Meru Health grew its customer base by 10x and saw about 700% revenue growth in 2020. And today, the startup is announcing that it has secured $38 million in a Series B round of funding, bringing its total raised since its 2016 inception to $51.3 million. Industry Ventures led the $30 million equity round. The remaining $8 million was secured in debt. Early backers Bold Capital Partners, Freestyle VC, FMZ Ventures and Leksell Social Ventures also participated in the equity financing, while J.P. Morgan funded the debt portion of the round.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first two or three years of Meru Health’s life, Ranta focused mostly on research to determine just how well digital therapy and “old school” psychiatry was working. The evidence out there, he felt, was flimsy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things the company concluded was that “digital is great bu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t without the human touch, it&#8217;s not going to get utilization.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or in other words, purely app-based solutions just won’t cut it when it comes to treating depression, anxiety and burnout.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But if there’s no kind of accountability, there or there is no human connection, it’s going to be much harder to keep people engaged and people end up dropping out,” Ranta told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meru Health works with employers such as Stanford University and several Fortune 100 and 500 companies, EAPs such as Wellspring and healthcare payers such as Cigna, Humana and Moda Health to provide an online mental healthcare program that it says </span><a href="https://www.meruhealth.com/science#studies"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strong and lasting clinical outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has been able to sell its solution to employers by demonstrating that the benefits of offering the program to employees far outweighs the cost. Specifically, Meru estimates that the average cost savings for an employer for its program is over $6,000 per enrolled participant because the downstream healthcare costs and reduced worker productivity of untreated anxiety and depression are so high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s interesting about Meru Health’s approach is that it aims to be a holistic one &#8212; treating both the mind and body concurrently, rather than just focusing on one thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We learned, for example, if we just do talk therapy, it doesn’t work for all mental health struggles,” Ranta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it helps patients with getting better sleep and nutritional coaching because, as Ranta puts it, “sleep is interconnected to mental health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We still haven’t seen anyone else look at the food and mood connection,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also provides a wearable device to capture physical biomarkers so people can see the effects of things like deep breathing and “start to control their own response to stress,” Ranta said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ne of the challenges in mental health grades, but there&#8217;s just a lot of self report, so we&#8217;ve been bringing in these elements of more objective data capture and also provide feedback for our patients,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holistic approach seems to be resonating, and Meru’s plans with the capital include getting fully covered by carriers in more states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are building out our nationwide network, and how to be in 40 states by year’s end,” Ranta said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also, naturally, plans to add to its staff of about 170.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also intends to continue clinical trials, and “do science properly,” as Ranta puts it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do open data sharing through trials with the best universities and share all the results openly,” he said. “We’re now showing with research that this approach has 3-5x better clinical results than the standard of care in the U.S., and a roughly 80% completion rate, which compares to 30% to 50% in traditional therapy because we engage people dramatically better.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That engagement caught the eye of Industry Ventures VP Fanni Fan, who said her firm has been following the mental health space for years and “looking to back entrepreneurs leveraging technology to improve access and quality of care in behavioral health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meru Health stood out among its competitors in many ways, she told TechCrunch, including its “exceptionally high engagement and completion rates, strong clinical outcomes validated by long-term clinical studies and three month curriculum coupled with biofeedback that drive engagement and also enable payers to measure outcomes more easily.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cinematic Mode on the iPhone 13 Pro models had a marquee spot in Apple’s presentation about the devices last week. The reviews so far this week have people acknowledging the cleverness but questioning its usefulness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been testing out the feature for the past week and this weekend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/the-iphone-13-pro-goes-to-disneyland/">took it to Disneyland</a> to give it a real-world rundown in a way that thousands or even millions of people might do over the next few years. Aside from my personal testing, some of which I’ll talk about here and more about which you can find in my iPhone review here, I wanted to dig a bit deeper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I spoke to Kaiann Drance, VP, Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing and Johnnie Manzari, a designer on Apple’s Human Interface Team about the goals and creation of the feature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew that bringing a high quality depth of field to video would be magnitudes more challenging [than Portrait Mode],” says Drance. “Unlike photos, video is designed to move as the person filming, including hand shake. And that meant we would need even higher quality depth data so Cinematic Mode could work across subjects, people, pets, and objects, and we needed that depth data continuously to keep up with every frame. Rendering these autofocus changes in real time is a heavy computational workload.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The A15 Bionic and Neural Engine are heavily used in Cinematic Mode, especially given that they wanted to encode it in Dolby Vision HDR as well. They also didn’t want to sacrifice live preview &#8212; something that most Portrait Mode competitors took years to ship after Apple introduced it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the concept of Cinematic Mode didn’t start with the feature itself, says Manzari. In fact, he says, it’s typically the opposite inside of this design team at Apple. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn&#8217;t have an idea [for Cinematic Mode]. We were just curious &#8212; what is it about filmmaking that&#8217;s been timeless? And that kind of leads down this interesting road and then we started to learn more and talk more&#8230;with people across the company that can help us solve these problems.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drance says that before development began, Apple’s design team spent time researching cinematography techniques for realistic focus transitions and optical characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you look at the design process,” says Manzari, “we begin with a deep reverence and respect for image and filmmaking through history. We&#8217;re fascinated with questions like what principles of image and filmmaking are timeless? What craft has endured culturally and why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when Apple decides to deviate from the classical techniques, Manzari says, they try to make those decisions thoughtfully and respectfully in regards to the original context. The team focuses on finding a way to create something that removes complexity and unlocks potential for people by leveraging Apple’s design and engineering capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/hands-on-with-the-iphone-7-plus-crazy-new-portrait-mode/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">process of developing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Portrait Lighting feature, Apple’s design team on an exploration of classic portrait artists like Avedon and Warhol and painters like Rembrandt and Chinese brush portraits. In many cases going to visit the original pieces and breaking down those characteristics in the lab. A similar process was used to develop Cinematic Mode.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing that the team did was go to speak to some of the best cinematographers and camera operators in the world. They also went to movies and watched examples of films through time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In doing this, certain trends emerge,” says Manzari. It was obvious that focus and focus changes were fundamental storytelling tools, and that we as a cross functional team needed to understand precisely how and when they were used.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They then worked closely with directors of photography, camera operators and 1st ACs, whose responsibilities include focus pulling. Observing them on set and asking questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was also just really inspiring to be able to talk to cinematographers about why they use shallow depth of field. And what purpose it serves in the storytelling. And the thing that we walked away with is, and this is actually a quite timeless insight: You need to guide the viewer&#8217;s attention.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now the problem is that today, this is for skilled professionals,” Manzari notes. “This is not something that a normal person would even attempt to take on, because it is so hard. A single mistake &#8212; being off by a few inches&#8230;this was something we learned from portrait mode. If you&#8217;re on the ear and you&#8217;re not on their eyes. It&#8217;s throwaway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not even counting tracking shots, where a focus puller is continually adjusting focus as the camera moves and even the subject moves in relation to the camera. It’s a highly skilled operation. To pull off a tracking shot, a focus puller must practice and train extensively for years. This, Manzari says, is where Apple sees an opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We feel like this is the kind of thing that Apple tackles the best. To take something difficult and conventionally hard to learn, and then turn it into something, automatic and simple.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the team started working through the technical problems in finding focus, locking focus and racking focus. And these explorations led them to gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In cinema, the role of gaze and body movement to direct that story is so fundamental. And as humans we naturally do this, if you look at something, I look at it too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they knew they would need to build in gaze detection to help lead their focusing target around the frame, which in turn leads the viewer through the story. Being on set, Manzari says, allowed Apple to observe these highly skilled technicians and then build in that feel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re on set and we have all these amazing people and they&#8217;re really the best of the best. And one of the engineers noticed that the focus puller has this focus control wheel, and he&#8217;s just studying the way that this person does this. Just like when you look at like someone who&#8217;s really good at playing the piano, and it looks so easy, and yet you know it&#8217;s impossible. There&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re going to be able to do this,” says Manzari. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This person is an artist, this person is so good at what they do and the craft they put into it. And so we spent a lot of time trying to model the analog feel of a focus wheel turning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This included the way that long distances of focus change are covered differently than short distances because of the way that the speed of handling a focus wheel ramps up and down. If, he notes, the focus changes don’t feel deliberate and natural, you don’t end up with a storytelling tool. Because a storytelling tool should feel invisible. If you’re watching a movie and notice a focus technique it’s probably because it’s soft and the focus puller missed their mark (or an actor did). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, a lot of these artistic and technical desires that the team came away from their explorations with became really challenging machine learning problems. Thankfully, Apple has a team of machine learning researchers and a silicon team that built the Neural Engine on hand to collaborate with. Some of the problems contained inside the Cinematic Mode are genuinely new and unique ML problems. Many of them ended up being fairly thorny, involving </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333523373_On_the_Potential_for_Open-Endedness_in_Neural_Networks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">open-endedness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> techniques to keep the effects nuanced and organic feeling.</span></p>
<p><b>Testing Cinematic Mode</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My aim in my tests was to shoot what I could in 1 day (and a bit of an afternoon at the pool) just like anyone going to Disneyland would hope to do. One person holding the camera, no setup and very little direction. Now and then I asked a kid to look at me. That&#8217;s about it. What you see in this reel is as close as possible to what you would experience doing this yourself, which is the whole point. There isn’t a bunch of b-roll, I didn’t re-shoot this stuff over and over. What you see is what was shot. The only editing that I did here was using Cinematic Mode to pick some points of focus after the fact, either for effect or because the automatic detection chose something I didn&#8217;t like. I didn’t have to do a lot of that but I was happy I was able to.</span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3JcEG5Vjt-w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This footage is not perfect by any means, and neither is Cinematic Mode. The synthetic bokeh that Apple has gotten so good at with Portrait Mode absolutely suffers from having to be performed so many times per second. The focus tracking can still be a bit jumpy too &#8212; making post-shooting editing far more common that it is probably intended to be. And though I found that it does work just fine in low light settings, it’s best if you’re within range of the LiDAR array (about 10 feet or less) if you want accurate results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you can see what they are after and where it is headed. And I found it absolutely usable and fun right now. I know a lot of reviews kind of breezed over it but I think that artificially testing this kind of new thing is a rough way to interpret how it will work for the normal person. It’s one of the reasons I started testing iPhones at Disneyland in 2014. We were exiting the speeds and feeds era with haste as the iPhone began to be used by millions of people &#8212; strapping it to a dyno to test the ol’ HP just wasn’t an important thing to do any more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not all that shocked that an artificial testing framework caused a lot of early reviewers to see primarily flaws (they are there!) but I see a lot more potential.</span></p>
<p><b>What it is</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cinematic Mode is actually a bundle of functions that exist in a new section of the camera app. It leverages nearly every major component of the iPhone to do its thing. It utilizes the CPU and GPU, of course, but also Apple’s Neural Engine for machine learning work, accelerometers for tracking and motion and of course the upgraded wide-angle lens and stabilized sensor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the individual components that make up Cinematic Mode include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subject recognition and tracking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus locking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rack focusing (moving focus from one subject to another in an organic-looking way) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Image overscan and in camera stabilization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synthetic Bokeh (lens blur)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A post-shot editing mode that lets you alter your focus points even after shooting</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And all of those things are happening in real-time.</span></p>
<p><b>The way it works</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The processing power to do all of this in a real time preview and in post edits and 30 times per second is intense, to say the least. This is why you see those big leaps forward in performance in the Neural Engine and </span><a href="https://creativestrategies.com/iphone-13-and-apple-silicon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">massive leaps in GPU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Apple’s A15 chips. It’s needed to pull stuff like this off. What’s crazy is that I didn’t really notice any appreciable hit in battery life even though I played with the mode a lot throughout the day. Once again Apple’s power-per-watt work in evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even while you’re shooting, the power is evident as the live preview gives you a pretty damn accurate view of what you’re going to see. And while you shoot, the iPhone is using signals from your accelerometer to predict whether you’re moving </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">toward</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">away</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the subject that it has locked onto so that it can quickly adjust focus for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time it is using the power of ‘gaze’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gaze detection can predict which subject you might want to move to next and if one person in your scene looks at another or at an object in the field, the system can automatically rack focus to that subject. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Apple already overscans the sensor for stabilization &#8212; effectively looking ‘beyond the edges’ of your frame &#8212; the design team found that they could utilize this for subject prediction as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A focus puller doesn&#8217;t wait for the subject to be fully framed before doing the rack, they&#8217;re anticipating and they&#8217;ve started the rack,” notes Manzari, “before the person&#8217;s even there. And we realize that by running the full sensor we can anticipate that motion. And, by the time the person has shown up, it&#8217;s already focused on them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see this in one of the later clips in my video above, where my daughter enters the frame bottom left already in focus, as if an invisible focus puller was anticipating her entering the scene and drawing the viewer’s attention there &#8212; to the new entry into the story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even after you shoot, you can correct the focus points or make creative decisions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One cool thing about the post-shooting focus selection is that because the lenses in iPhones are so small, they naturally have an extremely deep field of focus available to them (hence the synthetic Bokeh of Portrait and Cinematic Mode). This means that unless you are extremely close to an object, anything in the frame is available for you to pick from to focus on. The changes are then made in real-time using the depth information and segmentation masking that Cinematic Mode carries along with every video shot to re-generate the synthetic lens blur. </span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/the-iphone-13-pro-goes-to-disneyland/">review of the iPhone 13 Pro</a> I said this about Cinematic Mode: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the marketing, this mode is intended to unlock new creative possibilities for the vast majority of iPhone users who have no idea how to set focal distances, bend their knees to stabilize and crouch-walk-rack-focus their way to these kinds of tracking shots. It really does open up a big bucket that was just inaccessible before. And in many cases I think that those willing to experiment and deal with its near-term foibles will be rewarded with some great-looking shots to add to their iPhone memories widget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t care what filmmakers Apple brings in to demo the feature &#8212; I do not actually believe that those people who are the most capable with a camera are the ones that stand to gain the most from the feature. Instead, it is the rest of us that have a hand free if we’re lucky and some basic desire to capture the feeling of what it was like to be there &#8212; sometimes instead of the harsh reality. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s the power of the language of cinema: transportation. Though it’s far from perfect in this initial iteration, Cinematic Mode gives ‘normal people’ a toolkit to build a doorway into that world in a way that’s far easier and far more accessible than it has been in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, there’s lots to complain about if you’re staring closely. But also lots to love if you’ve got one shot to get your kid’s reaction to seeing Kylo Ren in the flesh for the first time. And it’s hard to argue </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">against</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accessibility of these tools just because they aren’t yet perfect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One thing that just makes me so proud is when somebody comes to me and they show me their photos&#8230;and they are so proud of what they&#8217;ve captured, and they&#8217;re just beaming because they all of a sudden feel like I&#8217;m creative! I didn&#8217;t even go to art school, I&#8217;m not a designer. No one ever thought of me as a photographer, but my photos look amazing,” says Manzari. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cinema kind of showed us the range of human emotion and the range of human stories and that if you get the fundamentals right they can be communicated. And life&#8217;s unfolding with your phone right on you. We&#8217;ve been working really hard on this for a long time. I can&#8217;t wait to see customers get their hands on it.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The behavioral health startup helps therapists launch their own private practices that are covered by insurance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Behavioral health is not only a business for Jake Cooper, it is also personal. The <a href="https://growtherapy.com/">Grow Therapy</a> co-founder and CEO has been managing ADHD since he was a child.</p>
<p>He began working with a psychiatrist, and his parents could afford the $300 per session, but when they tried to find an in-network clinician, they came up short. Though Cooper was fortunate his parents were able to make the finances work, he recognizes that this type of care is out of reach for most Americans.</p>
<p>With a mission of providing access to affordable, in-network therapists, Cooper, who came from an investment background, joined with friends he met in college: Dr. Manoj Kanagaraj and Alan Ni, a former product manager at Stripe and Google, to create Grow Therapy, a behavioral health startup that helps therapists launch their own private practices that are covered by insurance.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mental health startups are raising spirits and venture capital&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/embed/#?secret=LYx36VLZq3" data-secret="LYx36VLZq3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, the New York-based company announced $15 million in Series A funding, led by SignalFire, bringing the company’s total funding to date to $16.6 million since the company was founded in October 2020.</p>
<p>“On average, our providers have over 10 years of clinical experience, but for 85% of them this is their first time having an independent practice,” Cooper told TechCrunch. “They have come from community settings and other clinical jobs and wanted their own shingle.”</p>
<p>About <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/graisondangor/2020/11/19/this-startup-raised-26-million-to-help-people-find-in-network-therapists/?sh=a9abec7808b1">70% of therapists do not accept insurance</a> due to administrative burdens like all of the paperwork involved to file a claim. Add to that, over <a href="https://www.kff.org/statedata/mental-health-and-substance-use-state-fact-sheets/">30% of American adults reported symptoms of anxiety and/or depression</a>, up from 11% of adults prior to the global pandemic.</p>
<p>To make it less of a burden to accept insurance, Grow Therapy functions as the technology and centralized team providing the resources to help therapists operate in-network. In fact, one of the unique aspects of the company is that it is already working with all of the major insurance payers, Cooper said.</p>
<p>He considers Grow Therapy sitting at the intersection of payers, providers and clients. By being in-network through Grow Therapy, it cuts the price of an average visit to less than $40, and in many cases the visits are all covered. For those who choose not to go with insurance, the company enables therapists to set a sliding scale for price. Meanwhile, Grow Therapy makes revenue in the form of payments from the insurance companies when providers have a visit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We have to make sure we can deliver,” Cooper said. “Being paid by the payer is not only a privilege, but a necessity. If we can only provide out-of-pocket, we would be ignoring 90% of America.”</p>
<p>He explained that the best way to expand the company’s network was to raise capital and partner with a firm that has deep experience in building businesses and a reputation for being a true partner.</p>
<p>Cooper was referring to SignalFire and venture partner Wayne Hu, who is joining the board. Hu was connected to Cooper through a colleague who used to work with him.</p>
<p>Hu considers the approach that Grow Therapy is taking to be the “holy grail” of being able to address the supply and demand balance. The company is helping to grow the supply of people wanting to build a practice while freeing up their time from the non-core activities of maintaining a practice, like scheduling and paperwork.</p>
<p>In addition, he liked that the company was vertically integrated to provide the entire range of services for each practice so that therapists could take insurance for the first time.</p>
<p>“When you do that, you are the synthesizer of care,” Hu added. “They have all of the notes, unlike other players. They can also take the infrastructure data and make it accessible to everyone that touches the patient.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company currently has over 1,000 clinicians on its platform and is operating in five states. With the funding, it will be expanding to 10 states. Cooper is also investing in a team of folks from a degree of specialties like clinical care systems and engineering.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Loyal is building an animal pharmaceutical company that is developing therapeutics aimed at extending both lifespan and healthspan for dogs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Francisco startup <a href="https://loyalfordogs.com/">Loyal</a> is rethinking the concept of longevity and starting with man’s best friend.</p>
<p>The company raised $27 million in Series A funding in a round, led by Khosla Ventures and including First Round Capital, Box Group, Collaborative Fund, The Longevity Fund and Lachy Groom — all companies involved in Loyal’s $11 million seed round raised in 2020, as well as a group of angel investors. To date, the company has raised $38 million since being founded in 2019 by founder and CEO Celine Halioua.</p>
<p>She touts her choice of investor makeup, 50% female, as a way of elevating more women in the areas of deep tech and longevity. Halioua herself comes from a background of both. She began in neuroscience at The University of Texas and from there briefly studied gene therapy at the University of Oxford before leaving to join The Longevity Fund as its chief of staff and an entrepreneur-in-residence.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-anti-aging-drugs-market-survey-2021-analysis-with-top-countries-data-growth-sizecurrent-situation-value-research-method-trend-application-and-forecast-by-2027-with-covid-19-impact-analysis-2021-09-20#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20global%20Anti,Drugs%20Scope%20and%20Market%20Size.">global anti-aging drugs market</a> was valued at nearly $8 billion in 2020 and is projected to double by 2027. Though Botox is well known in this space for its ability to smooth out wrinkles, Halioua told TechCrunch that by addressing aging it could be preventative medicine for age-related diseases affecting humans, like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MRkiPtYBiT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-next-healthcare-revolution-will-have-ai-at-its-center/">The next healthcare revolution will have AI at its center</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The next healthcare revolution will have AI at its center&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-next-healthcare-revolution-will-have-ai-at-its-center/embed/#?secret=MRkiPtYBiT" data-secret="MRkiPtYBiT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company’s thesis is that by intending to improve the healthspan and lifespan in dogs, that research will uncover more about how to do the same in humans. Halioua explained that a dog’s lifespan is similar to a human’s due to proximity — dogs have shared environmental factors, sometimes share the same diet and can develop the same aging diseases as humans like cardiac problems and cancer.</p>
<p>Loyal is building an animal pharmaceutical company that is developing therapeutics aimed at extending both lifespan and healthspan for dogs, utilizing companion dog citizen science studies of over 500 dogs to better understand dog aging and eventually parlay that R&amp;D into products intended for humans.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Loyal grew from a team of three to 30 people. The new funding will enable the company to build out a bigger computation biology team to continue focusing on its products: one aimed at expanding the life of large breed animals, which are known to have shorter lifespans than their small breed counterparts, and one for improving cognitive function.</p>
<p>Both of these will go into clinical studies next year, working toward U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, Halioua said. After the company can show that its drugs are doing what it says they can do — help dogs to live longer, healthier lives —Loyal will then focus on building a consumer brand that is direct-to-consumer selling directly to both veterinarians and pet parents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our next steps are to build out our biology team and data over time so we can take on the gnarly problem of quantifying the aging process,” she added. “There is an opportunity to build a pharmaceutical brand that people love versus being confused by it. These are drugs meant for something happy — giving more years to a dog.”</p>
<p>Pets are a big industry with American spending on pets reaching nearly <a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2020-04-15/annual-spending-pets-nearing-100b">$100 billion</a> in 2020, up from $95.7 billion in 2019, according to the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/american-pet-products-association">American Pet Products Association</a>. Venture capital investment into the space is also growing, for example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/softbank-backed-embark-veterinary-valued-at-700m-after-75m-series-b/">Embark Veterinary announced a $75 million</a> round from SoftBank in July. The company offers DNA testing with the goal of curbing preventable diseases and increasing the lifespan of dogs by three years within the next decade.</p>
<p>Alexander Morgan, M.D. Ph.D., partner at Khosla Ventures, said that the pet space is an active one and is a large enough opportunity that if Loyal just wanted to focus its energy there, it could build a large, profitable business.</p>
<p>Due to dogs being a good model for human health, many studies on human diseases are done on dogs. However, there is a challenge in knowing if the drug is actually beneficial, he added.</p>
<p>“Loyal is approaching longevity with a narrow mechanism,” Morgan said. “They are differentiated by focusing on overall lifespan and healthspan. Healthspan is important because you don’t want to tack on years of unhealthy life.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jscrambler">Jscrambler</a>, a Portugal-based startup specializing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> products that protect organizations against web data exfiltration attacks, has secured $15 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The investment, which comes two years after the startup secured $2.3 million in seed funding, was led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ace-capital-partners">Ace Capital Partners</a> and backed by existing investors Sonae IM and Portugal Ventures. Jscrambler said it will use the cash injection to &#8220;strengthen and accelerate&#8221; its product roadmap to meet its customers&#8217; expanding requirements as threat actors increasingly turn to the web.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing clear growth in complex attacks targeting the client-side of websites and yet there are currently no simple and effective solutions to deal with them,” Rui Ribeiro, Jscrambler co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “This partially stems from misinformation surrounding technologies such as web application firewalls, and the current native browser defenses are severely lacking when it comes to effectively preventing client-side attacks.”</p>
<p>Jscrambler claims it addresses this shortfall. Its Code Integrity tool, which includes polymorphic obfuscation, code locks, and self-defending capabilities, scrambles web source code into a form that is extremely hard to reverse-engineer, helping organizations to prevent intellectual property theft, application abuse, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/piracy/">piracy</a>, and data leakage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The startup also offers a Webpage Integrity module that protects against web <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/supply-chain-attack/">supply-chain attacks</a> by detecting any sign of malicious behavior on the client-side and defining rules that effectively block and prevent malicious behavior before it happens. This tool also helps to stop <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/13/magecart-hackers-persistent-credit-card-skimmer-groups/">Magecart web skimming attacks</a> by allowing companies to create rules that effectively prevent the skimmers from running on the website and exfiltrating credit card information.</p>
<p>&#8220;This marks the beginning of an era where companies will be able to take ownership of their client-side and control everything that happens there,&#8221; Ribeiro said.</p>
<p>The startup’s Series A investment will be used to add more capabilities, including an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>integrated solution that enables website owners to protect the client-side to secure user data and improve compliance with regulations such as Europe&#8217;s GDPR, California&#8217;s CCPA, and U.S. health privacy rules HIPAA.</p>
<p>Jscrambler, which was founded in 2014 and currently has 40 employees, also announced that Pedro Abreu has joined the startup as an independent board member. Abreu is currently COO at Silicon Valley-based cyber risk startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/exabeam/">Exabeam</a>, having previously served as an executive at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/forescout/">ForeScout</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/McAfee/">McAfee</a>.</p>
