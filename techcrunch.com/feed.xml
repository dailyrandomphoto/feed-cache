										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indonesia-based startup GoTo Group announced today it has secured more than $1.3 billion in the first close of its pre-IPO funding. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest round was led by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), with participation from Avanda Investment Management, Fidelity International, Google, Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), Primavera Capital, SeaTown Master Fund, Temasek, Tencent and Ward Ferry. Further investors are expected to join in its final close of the funding in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goto Group will use the proceeds to fuel its growth and bolster its customer service. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company declined to comment on its valuation. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to media reports, GoTo Group’s valuation is estimated at between <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/57df6b26-79c2-41a3-9498-dffb9861fbc6">$28.5 billion</a> and $30 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ride-hailing giant Gojek and e-commerce company Tokopedia, Indonesia’s two biggest startups, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">merged to form GoTo Group</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in May this year. GoTo Group is creating synergies with Gojek, Tokopedia and Goto Financial brands across transport, e-commerce, food and grocery delivery, logistics and financial service industries. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goto Group, the largest technology group in the Southeast Asia nation, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is preparing for a dual listing</a> in New York and Jakarta later this year.   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Goto Group claims that it generated over 1.8 billion transactions in 2020, with gross transaction value of over $22 billion, contributing to more than 2% of Indonesia’s GDP. Indonesia has more than $1 trillion in GDP with a population of 270 million.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Indonesia and Southeast Asia are some of the most exciting growth markets in the world, and the backing we’ve secured shows the confidence that investors have in the region’s rapidly expanding digital economy and our market-leading position,” said Andre Soelistyo, CEO of GoTo Group. “Consumer demand is being unlocked by growth in digital adoption that has brought many new users online. As a result, demand for our service continues to increase, underscored by our commitment to continuously deliver selection, value and convenience to users across the ecosystem.” </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We foresee secular growth opportunities for Indonesia and GoTo across e-commerce, on-demand mobility and fintech – all segments in which Primavera has extensive investment experience. We’re excited to partner and grow together with GoTo, leveraging our expertise and resources where helpful for management,” Michael Woo, managing director of Primavera Capital Group. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria-based health tech startup <a href="https://heliumhealth.com/about.html">Helium Health</a> has acquired <a href="https://www.meddy.com/">Meddy</a>, a Qatar-headquartered and UAE-based doctor booking platform for an undisclosed amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acquisition,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> termed “a great deal” by Helium Health CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adegokeolubusi/">Adegoke Olubusi</a> on a call, is unusual in the sense that it overlaps two regions that rarely do in tech: Africa and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meddy CEO <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/harisaghadi">Haris Aghadi</a> and COO <a href="https://qa.linkedin.com/in/abedalkarimkhattab">Abed Alkarim Khattab</a> will join Helium’s leadership team as part of the deal. They will “play integral roles in Helium’s execution of its GCC strategy and operations.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230944" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helium Health’s acquisition of Meddy is a major expansion play. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded by Olubisi, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/dimeji-sofowora">Dimeji Sofowora</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tito-ovia-51aa0413a">Tito Ovia</a> in 2016, is well-known for its core electronic medical records (EMR) and hospital management solutions in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has since evolved to offer other services under its platform, including HeliumPay, a billing and payments solution; a collateral-free loan product, HeliumCredit; patient-provider and revenue cycle management service HeliumDoc; and data analytics services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a presence in six African countries — Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Liberia, Kenya and Uganda — Helium Health has signed more than 500 healthcare facilities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Over 7,000 medical professionals from these facilities now provide care to more than 300,000 patients monthly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an enterprise client needs various services on one platform — from electronic medical record and management information systems to revenue cycle management, consolidated analytics and telemedicine services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most platforms in the GCC have use cases that are more vertical than horizontal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Vezeeta and Okadoc help users book appointments, access teleconsultation services and order medications; Bayzat offers an online platform for HR administration, payroll management and health insurance; and Clinicy runs a digital healthcare management system. So, for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enterprise clients to get a holistic EMR experience, they will need to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stack these different products on top of each other.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the SF-based Helium Health has a wide range of B2B offerings, it lacks in these other areas especially in telemedicine and appointment bookings, which are more consumer-facing products. The company could have built out these services but acquiring Meddy presented a better option due its expansion play. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from providing a doctor booking platform and telemedicine product to manage bookings and patient reviews, Meddy offers marketing solutions for hospitals to improve their online presence and attract new patients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232550" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232550" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2232550" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/97CA2C67-4213-4FDF-8B3B-6AC7FE14D394.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232550" class="wp-caption-text">Helium Health</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Meddy, the Y Combinator and Tencent-backed Helium Health can now cover a broader range of services health groups need. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meddy will merge with Helium Health’s patient-provider and revenue cycle management platform under the name Helium Doc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t have a lot of people who can provide a suite like ours in the GCC. If they do, they’re doing it at a price point that’s so high that they’ve already priced out the market in that sense,” Olubusi said to TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But we can provide a full suite where you can do your appointments booking, marketing solution, EMR, hospital management information system, and have everything in a one-stop shop. It saves you a lot of stress in the process from trying to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> many different systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aghadi adds that the partnership gives interoperability to its clients, an absent feature in other EMRs and siloed individual platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many legacy and new products do not have open APIs and that makes it difficult for data to move between them. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ealthcare providers feel the brunt of this missing interoperability when they use such platforms to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make uninformed health decisions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Interoperability is a very big challenge in the region, and having this one-stop place like ours </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">solves that,” Aghadi remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While two obvious factors — exploiting what other healthcare platforms lack and taking advantage of a growing opportunity in the GCC region (where investment in digital infrastructure will <a href="https://www.ld-export.com/en/numerous-opportunities-for-investment-in-gcc-healthcare_news_f5ebd2.html#:~:text=by%20regional%20Governments.-,According%20to%20the%20report%2C%20digital%20infrastructure%20will%20be%20high%20on,investments%20from%202023%20to%202030.">account for 30% of healthcare investment</a> between 2023 to 2030) — drove this acquisition and partnership, there is a third, more subtle factor Olubisi and Aghadi point out: the teams</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to both founders, the Helium Health and Meddy teams are identical in operations, technology execution, culture and market price points. These similarities made it easy for both companies to sign off the deal in less than four months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Beyond the actual product and market opportunity, what made this possible was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the composition of the team, how well they executed the fact that they share a DNA and culture that’s very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ours,” said Olubusi</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meddy currently serves more than 150 private clients within the UAE and Qatar. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, backed with just $1.8 million in VC funding, has facilitated over 200,000 doctor appointments while enabling healthcare providers to generate approximately $130 million in billings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As both companies come together, Olubusi says the next plan is to figure out how better to serve the GCC market with its complete EMR solutions and, at the same time, roll out telemedicine and doctor booking services for its clients in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the next few months, a lot of what we’re doing is being able to better roll out these consolidated product suites in our markets and serve them more,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, we want to double, triple the growth of our client base over the next two to three years and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extend our reach even further to make sure that Helium Health is the top health tech provider in the GCC region </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as it is in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hive levels the logistics playing field by streamlining fulfillment so that DTC companies get the same inventory management, cost structure and customer notifications that big brands use.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.hive.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hive</a> announced $34 million in new investment Wednesday as it continues developing its technology that provides direct-to-consumer brands an alternative way to manage operations.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Oskar Ziegler, Franz Purucker and Leo von Kleist in July 2020 to offer software and operational services, including transparent cost structures, special features and sustainable packaging and shipping.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232361" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232361" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2232361" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?w=680" alt="Hive" width="680" height="477" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg 3797w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=768,539 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=1536,1078 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=2048,1437 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-Founder-Hive-042021.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232361" class="wp-caption-text">Hive founders, from left, Oskar Ziegler, Franz Purucker and Leo von Kleist. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hive</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232350" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ziegler, who started out in food delivery with foodpanda in Hong Kong, said he began consulting on e-commerce and logistics, and during a discussion with friends who were building DTC brands, the topic turned to operational problems.</p>
<p>“It was then that I thought we could build something to give small retailers the same logistics power as Amazon,” he added.</p>
<p>Purucker explained that when DTC brands get started, the founders are passionate about sales, marketing and finding the right message and influence to get their brand out into the world. However, when they go beyond 30 orders per month to more like 1,000, it becomes more difficult to check inventory from their homes, and they are not getting the cost-competitive rates from freight forwarders that the big brands are getting.</p>
<p>Hive levels that playing field by using data to streamline fulfillment, which he considered “the heart of the operation,” by providing a variety of delivery choices and the ability to get the same inventory management, cost structure and customer notifications that companies like Amazon are using.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding round was led by existing investors Earlybird and Picus and also includes new investor Tiger Global Management. It gives Hive total funding of $44 million and boosts its valuation to $157 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have looked extensively at the fulfillment space and gained conviction that the full stack model is superior due to its full control over the ultimate service quality,” Fabian Heilemann, partner at Earlybird, said via email. “Hive has compiled the strongest team in the European market to execute on that vision. That’s why we doubled down on our investment in this round.”</p>
<p>Now armed with the new capital, Hive intends to invest in product development and build out new services for supply chain and business teams that will have it triple its tech team by next year. It will also expand geographically, starting with Paris in early 2022. The company aims to bring down delivery times to two days in most places in Europe and next-day for core markets.</p>
<p>In 18 months, Hive quickly grew into a team of more than 100, working on the warehousing of products and the processing of orders through its own fulfillment center. During that time, the company’s revenue grew 10 times and it is processing a few thousand packages per day.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The fall hasn&#8217;t been kind to Disney&#8217;s streaming ambitions. Disney+ added just 2.1 million subscribers in its <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2021-earnings-results-webcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">fourth quarter</a>, giving it a total of 118.1 million customers. That&#8217;s in line with the company&#8217;s already cautious estimate (in the &#8220;low single-digit millions&#8221;) and 60 percent more total customers than a year earlier, but well below what some analysts expected. <em>CNBC</em> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/disney-dis-fiscal-q4-2021-earnings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">noted</a> that StreetAccount predicted 9.4 million new users this quarter.</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s streaming-oriented Direct-to-Consumer division also lost $630 million (versus $374 million a year earlier) due in part to extra spending on production, marketing and &#8220;technology costs.&#8221; These were expected due to the growing service, but they suggest Disney+ isn&#8217;t yet a net positive for Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-star-wars-mandalorian-disney-plus.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">two years after launch</a>. During an earnings call, company chief Bob Chapek was still confident the company would hit subscriber targets (over 230 million users by September 2024) and turn a profit.</p>
<p>The media giant had warned of &#8220;headwinds.&#8221; While it didn&#8217;t initially shed much light on the problems, we&#8217;d note that Disney+ had a relatively quiet summer for shows, with series like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-nine-series-finale-120020465.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><em>What If&#8230;?</em></a> and <em>Monsters at Work</em> shouldering the load. The company did stream two blockbuster movies, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><em>Black Widow</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-rock-jungle-cruise-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-170319455.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><em>Jungle Cruise</em></a>, but original films weren&#8217;t a strong point.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232626" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Things are looking brighter for the fall. Disney+ is streaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-imax-enhanced-marvel-mcu-140052678.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1"><em>Shang-Chi</em></a> on November 12th, launching shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hawkeye-disney-plus-november-24-premiere-155812908.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1"><em>Hawkeye</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-book-of-boba-fett-trailer-star-wars-disney-plus-the-mandalorian-151919443.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a>, and expanding into countries like South Korea. All of those could boost subscribers and viewership. The issue is whether or not there&#8217;s enough ongoing content and expansions to return Disney+ to form — particularly when the company is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="1">returning to theater-first movie premieres</a>.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t the only long-term plan, either. Chapek teased the prospect of a Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="32" data-v9y="1">metaverse</a> that would involve the company&#8217;s charcters and meld both the physical and virtual worlds. However, the CEO stressed that it was a long-term goal and didn&#8217;t share timelines or other technical details. For now, this is more an attempt to counter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="33" data-v9y="1">Facebook&#8217;s Meta rebranding</a> than a tangible project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Discord founder and CEO Jason Citron sought to reassure users Wednesday that the company doesn&#8217;t have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/discord-nfts-metamask-crypto/">impending plans</a> to shift its business toward NFTs.</p>
<p>In a tweet earlier this week, Citron shared an image of crypto wallet MetaMask integrated into Discord&#8217;s user interface with the text &#8220;probably nothing&#8221; — shorthand language in the NFT space for something that&#8217;s about to be a big deal. He contextualized the previous tweet Wednesday evening, noting that Discord has &#8220;no current plans&#8221; to integrate crypto wallets into its app.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks for all the perspectives everyone. We have no current plans to ship this internal concept. For now we&#39;re focused on protecting users from spam, scams and fraud. Web3 has lots of good but also lots of problems we need to work through at our scale. More soon.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232530" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; Jason Citron (@jasoncitron) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Discord also provided the following statement clarifying its plans to TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We appreciate all the perspectives we’ve been hearing in response to the internal concept you may have seen in a tweet earlier this week and want to clarify we have no plans to ship it at this time. We’re excited about the potential for web3 technology and the positive ways these communities are coming together on Discord, especially those organized around environmentally friendly, creator-focused projects. However, we also recognize there are some problems we need to work through. For now we&#8217;re focused on protecting users from spams, scams and fraud.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Citron casually shared the screenshot Monday in a reply, not as an official company announcement, but passionate Discord users immediately jumped on the tweet. The company quickly explained that the screenshot was part of a community hack week project and not something around the corner for the social chat app, but the horse had left the barn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Discord users wary of the crypto space quickly encouraged each other to ditch their Nitro subscriptions, Discord&#8217;s paid premium service that helps the platform stay ad-free. As the backlash spread, outraged Discord fans also pointed to a <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1457751651465449475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1457751651465449475%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2021%2F11%2F09%2Fdiscord-nfts-metamask-crypto%2F">recent poll</a> from the company asking for their thoughts on Web3 and NFTs.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7DwAetRZxi"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/discord-nfts-metamask-crypto/">NFTs and crypto wallets could be in Discord&#8217;s future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NFTs and crypto wallets could be in Discord&#8217;s future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/discord-nfts-metamask-crypto/embed/#?secret=7DwAetRZxi" data-secret="7DwAetRZxi" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the screenshot was only a pre-release mockup of what crypto wallet integration might look like, Discord was indeed actively exploring how blockchain technology could complement its existing mission. Now, some of that work will go on pause as Discord reevaluates how to best keep its values aligned with the communities that have built bustling home bases on the platform.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh No <a href="https://t.co/YEfVt8Xrwe">pic.twitter.com/YEfVt8Xrwe</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jason Scott (@textfiles) <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/1457751651465449475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Some Discord users chalked their strong reactions to the Citron&#8217;s tweet up to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. Others more broadly objected to &#8220;NFT bros.&#8221; But even within Discord&#8217;s many NFT communities, users expressed concerns that integrated crypto wallets would only exacerbate rampant crypto scams on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cancel your nitro immediately and select other &#8211; cite the CEO&#8217;s tweet about it as your reasoning why,&#8221; one tweet with 20,000 likes stated. &#8220;A loud, immediately public drop in revenue is the only thing that will change it at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citron&#8217;s clarification makes it clear that Discord is listening to its community, and while many NFT projects do call the platform&#8217;s servers home, a vocal part of Discord&#8217;s user base evidently doesn&#8217;t want the company to touch the crypto business with a ten-foot pole.</p>
<p>While no company likes backlash, the negative reaction to Discord&#8217;s nascent crypto interests does signal just how much the company&#8217;s users enjoy its product in its current iteration. All social media users are afraid of change — just check the tweets around any minor Instagram UI tweak — but Discord&#8217;s users appear particularly keen to protect the product they have.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elon Musk has sold about $5 billion worth of Tesla stock, according to a slew of regulatory filings that posted late Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial filings showed Musk had <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0000899243-21-041857/index.html">sold 934,091 shares</a> for about $1.1 billion out of more than 2.1 million options he received as part of a compensation package. Musk disclosed in a regulatory filing that he sold some of his stake to satisfy tax obligations related to exercising stock options. The CEO is facing income tax on stock gains that were awarded in 2012 at the $6.24 per share price. Musk is taxed on the income between the exercise price of $6.24 and the value of the share when it was sold. The shares were sold at prices between about $1,100 and $1,200.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filings that posted later Wednesday revealed Musk sold another 3.58 million shares in Tesla. That sale is valued at about $4 billion. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The stock sales followed a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1457064697782489088%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2021%2F11%2F08%2Felon-musk-stock-twitter-poll-taxes%2F">Twitter poll</a> last weekend that asked his followers whether he should sell 10% of his stock, in which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/elon-musk-stock-twitter-poll-taxes/">57.9% voted for and 42.1% voted against</a>. However, at least some of these shares — specifically the options — had a pre-set sale date that had been established weeks before the Twitter poll.</p>
<p>The stock sales news isn&#8217;t exactly surprising. Musk has already said that he would sell a large block of his Tesla stock publicly before, and the SEC filing reveals that Musk was already planning to sell the stock on September 14, making his show on Twitter just that — a show. In addition, during a conversation with tech journalist Kara Swisher in September, Musk said a large portion of his stock options would expire in August 2022 and more or less promised to sell them in Q4.</p>
<p>Musk still holds 166.9 million Tesla shares.</p>
<p><em>The article was updated to reflect the updated stock sale figures.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every year, tons of food ends up in landfills because of cosmetic issues (they won’t look nice in stores) or inefficiencies in the supply chain. Singapore-based <a href="https://www.thetreedots.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TreeDots</a>, which says it is the first food surplus marketplace in Asia, wants to help. The company is focused on creating a vertically integrated supply chain with a B2B marketplace and a social commerce feature for group buying by consumers. It is also developing its own cold-chain logistics infrastructure to help food reach end users more quickly. TreeDots announced today that it has raised an $11 million Series A led by Amasia and East Ventures, with participation from investors including Active Fund, Seeds Capital, author Nir Eyal and actress Fiona Xie.</p>
<p>The funding, which brings TreeDots’ total raised to $15 million, will be used to grow its operations in Malaysia, where it expanded last year, enter other markets and continue optimizing its logistics and supply chain business, called TreeLogs. The startup says its gross merchandise volume (GMV) has grown more than 4x year-over-year.</p>
<p>TreeDots was founded in 2017 as a surplus food marketplace for F&amp;B businesses, before it expanded its business to include social commerce, too. About <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/food/news/why-is-one-third-of-food-wasted-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third of food produced in the world</a> is never eaten. In Asia specifically, TreeDots&#8217; team says this is usually because of inefficient supply chains or aesthetically “imperfect” foods. For example, a grocery chain might reject a chicken that is too big or has a broken bone. But F&amp;B businesses like restaurants usually don’t care how their ingredients look, because they cook and plate food before it reaches the customer. TreeDots’ surplus food marketplace was originally created to sell food to F&amp;B businesses at up to 90% cheaper than other suppliers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231976" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>In an email, TreeDots co-chief executive officer Tylor Jong explained that the company does not redistribute food from retailers. “Instead, we solve the food loss problem further upstream where you have food that is imperfect due to various cosmetic standards set by different groups of buyers (businesses, but ultimately driven by consumers) and food that is in surplus, as most countries want to ensure that all varieties are accessible and therefore keep more inventory than needed at every step of the supply chain.”</p>
<p>For suppliers, the benefits of selling food to TreeDots include earning incremental revenue and saving the money they would have spent to send surplus products to landfills. TreeDots also helps them digitize their operations through its app and onboard to TreeLogs. The logistics infrastructure was built using a combination of in-house and external services to fulfill demand from social commerce and business buyers, Jong said. It improves on traditional cold-chain logistics by “being tech-driven and striving for higher utilization, heavier delivery density and best practices,” he added.</p>
<p>In a statement about its investment in TreeDots, East Ventures managing partner Roderick Purwana said, “Food loss is already a trillion dollar problem, but what got us excited was the fact that suppliers started to use the system for all of their revenue, not just food loss products. If one of their trucks could make a delivery to a zone, TreeDots could make five deliveries on that same trip working across suppliers. The increased network density allows for decreased logistics costs and lower emissions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric light-duty truck manufacturer Lordstown Motors has officially sold its 6.2-million-square-foot Lordstown, Ohio factory to Foxconn, the Taiwanese hardware manufacturing company best known for making Apple&#8217;s iPhone. The $230 million deal is expected to close by the end of April next year, according to a statement from Lordstown.</p>
<p>The terms of the deal are in line with the agreement in principle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/lordstown-motors-in-talks-to-sell-its-6-2m-square-foot-factory-to-taiwans-foxconn/">the two companies entered into on September 30</a>, after which Foxconn promptly bought $50 million in common stock directly from Lordstown at $6.8983 per share. Foxconn is now on the hook for a $100 million down payment by November 18 and subsequent payments of $50 million in both February and April before the final close targeted for April 30, 2022.</p>
<p>Foxconn also agreed to pursue a contract agreement with Lordstown to help the struggling EV company manufacture its Endurance pickup truck, according to a statement from Lordstown. The two parties will also pursue a joint venture to co-design and develop commercial fleet vehicle programs for North American and international markets. Finally, once the deal is done, Foxconn will get 1.7 million warrants to buy Lordstown common stock at $10.50 per share for the next three years. Lordstown will keep its electric motor production line and battery module and pack assembly lines.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232513" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">Foxconn signed an agreement with electric car startup Fisker</a> to co-develop and manufacture its new vehicle under Fisker&#8217;s PEAR program in North America. Foxconn has since signaled that Fisker&#8217;s vehicles will also be produced at the Ohio factory, which Lordstown had purchased from General Motors back in 2019. With this factory purchase, Foxconn gets its first automotive factory and a big shot at expanding beyond the manufacturing of phones and laptops.</p>
<p>Lordstown, which is under investigation by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice after a research firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">accused the company of faking EV truck pre-orders</a>, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">combating financial woes</a> as well as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/troubled-ev-company-lordstown-motors-gets-400m-lifeline-in-stock-sale-agreement/">loss of many executives</a>, including president Rich Schmidt, who resigned on Wednesday morning. This deal could help Lordstown reduce its raw material and component costs. Foxconn has a strong supply chain network, logistics capabilities and purchasing powers needed to help reduce production costs and handle a volatile supply chain. Foxconn is also an expert at software-hardware integration, which is very important for electric vehicles.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Going public will enable Brivo to go after more M&#038;A opportunities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smart building technology company Brivo reached an agreement to go public via special purpose acquisition with Crown PropTech Acquisitions. The SPAC deal values Brivo at $808 million.</p>
<p>Once the merger closes in early 2022, the combined company will operate as Brivo and is expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BRVS.”</p>
<p>Steve Van Till, founder and CEO of Brivo, will lead the combined company. Brivo was founded in 1999 and sells SaaS building access management services and connected devices to enterprise and property owners.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232497" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Van Till told TechCrunch that the proptech boom has accelerated adoption of cloud-based technologies in the industry over the past five years. That has driven the company to be able to tout itself as “the single largest access control system in the world,” working with over 44,5000 customer accounts across over 300 million square feet of commercial property in 42 countries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brivo had been looking at both SPAC and IPO, and once it was in the private equity markets, “the SPAC offers came rolling in,” Van Till said.</p>
<p>He noted that the SPAC option yielded the company larger amounts of capital and was the more attractive option for what the company wanted to do in the long term, which included M&amp;A opportunities. The company has already been dabbling in M&amp;A, having acquired Parakeet, a keyless entry system company, in March 2020.</p>
<p>“The SPAC also gives us more access to capital, and from a customer perspective, more visibility,” Van Till said. “One of the markets we are moving into is the enterprise market, and we are dealing with other public companies as customers. Being a public company will enable them to see us as a peer.”</p>
<p>The SPAC company, Crown PropTech Acquisitions, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210211005947/en/Crown-PropTech-Acquisitions-Announces-Closing-of-276-Million-Initial-Public-Offering-Including-Full-Exercise-by-Underwriters-to-Purchase-Additional-Shares">raised $276 million in a February IPO</a>. It is led by Richard Chera, chairman and CEO.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 10, 2021! I spent the bulk of today on a train being whisked up the Eastern Seaboard back home, which meant that I was reading novels instead of tech news. And that means I am also catching up today. Thank gosh TechCrunch wrote a zillion stories for us both. We have work to do! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/electric-automaker-rivian-largest-ipo-2021/"><strong>Rivian’s IPO revs Wall Street:</strong></a> The public-market debut of electric vehicle company Rivian stormed to a per-share price north of $100 today after pricing its shares at $78. TechCrunch reports that the company’s valuation makes it worth more than GM or Ford, storied automakers with global footprints, and, well, revenues. Something that Rivian has not that much of. The return of high-risk IPOs is really, truly here.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/expensify-david-barrett-ipo-day/">Expensify’s CEO talks public debut:</a> </strong>TechCrunch caught up with Expensify founder and CEO David Barrett today to discuss his company’s public offering. We wanted to know why he chose a traditional IPO and just how big his company’s market is (Airbase and others are waging war on one another to snag share). More on the company’s economics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/inside-expensifys-ipo-filing/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/crypto-volatility-continues-to-flummox-wall-street/">Public investors struggle to grok crypto:</a> </strong>Shares of Coinbase are lower today in the wake of its Q3 earnings report. Despite warning investors that its trading incomes would drop in the period, Wall Street was still let down by its numbers. In short, public-market investors appear to be struggling to properly estimate how well crypto-focused companies will perform quarter to quarter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bheater">Brian Heater</a> is a busy man. He’s busy getting his robotics-focused newsletter ready for launch — it’s called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/actuator/">Actuator</a> and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up here</a> for free. And he wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1/">huge feature for the site on Bowery</a>, which plays in the vertical farming space. So, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/vertically-farmed-wasabi-arugula-isnt-a-hypothetical/">had him on the Equity podcast</a> to chat farming that is more tall than broad.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232425" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/new-venture-fund-aims-to-become-the-investment-and-innovation-arm-of-the-autism-community/">Meet the Autism Impact Fund:</a> </strong>A new venture capital fund wants to “revolutionize the status quo for diagnosing, treating and living with autism” through investing. It wants to put capital to work in products and companies that may have a positive impact on the larger autism community. Which sounds pretty cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/subscription-carbon-offsetting-platform-ecologi-hits-8m-total-raised-includes-general-catalyst/"><strong>Now you can subscribe to trees:</strong></a><strong> </strong>No, this is not a cannabis joke. A startup called Ecologi is building a subscription service that lets consumers pay regular fees to help plant lots of trees. Trees consume carbon, of course, changing the global climate balance. It just raised $5.75 million. Trees as a service! TaaS!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/momentum-announces-5m-seed-to-automate-sales-tasks-in-slack/"><strong>There’s still white space in sales tooling:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s the lesson I am taking away from Momentum’s $5 million seed round. The company is building a Slack integration that wants to bring the sales processes closer to other parts of an org. Which is ambitious, given that a CRM giant now <em>owns </em>Slack.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/cacheflow-drops-stealth-tag-raises-6m-to-simplify-the-saas-buying-experience/"><strong>Cacheflow leaves stealth, announces $6M round:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The SaaS buying experience is old-fashioned, Cacheflow reckons, giving it a shot at shaking up how customers pay for software. The startup, announcing itself to the world for the first time today, is offering a way for software companies to get paid all at once, while allowing customers to pay ratably.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/controlup-nabs-100m-to-monitor-and-improve-desktop-computing-performance-across-disparate-work-environments/"><strong>Mega-round #1:</strong></a> ControlUp has raised a $100 million round to continue scaling its IT-focused service that helps improve desktop performance.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/workato-storms-to-a-5-7b-valuation-after-raising-200m-for-its-enterprise-automation-platform/">Mega-round #2:</a> </strong>Workato has raised $200 million to help enterprise customers automate more of their regular work. The company is now worth $5.7 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/daily-grabs-another-40m-so-developers-can-add-video-audio-features-to-any-product/"><strong>Daily raises $40M for its video-focused software:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I recall <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/">when Daily raised a $4.6 million seed round</a>. That was back in May 2020. Now the company is flush with a new eight-figure round that our own Christine Hall notes will help the company continue to build and sell its API-delivered video embed service.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/moov-an-online-marketplace-for-used-manufacturing-equipment-raises-41m-from-tiger-global-and-others/"><strong>Tiger likes Moov’s moves:</strong></a><strong> </strong>So it put a $41 million Series A into the company. What does Moov do? It has built a marketplace for used manufacturing equipment. Given the role that used IRL tooling is playing in the global chip shortage, the company could be onto something major.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/digital-restaurant-startup-zak-orders-up-new-capital-on-mission-to-be-toast-of-latam/"><strong>Latin American Toast is big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Not the burned bread, but the Toast model. Toast, a U.S. software and hardware and payments company, has soared in value in recent quarters. Zak wants to bring a similar business to Latin America. And it has raised $15 million to do so.</li>
<li>To close out our startup coverage, TechCrunch wrote about how <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/how-african-refugees-used-bitcoin-to-build-their-own-grassroots-economy/">the eruption of a volcano in the Democratic Republic of the Congo led to the displaced using bitcoin to rebuild their lives</a>.</strong> It’s a story worth reading.</li>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-discusses-the-future-of-work-and-the-one-thing-hed-do-over/">In an expansive interview,</a> Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and TechCrunch Managing Editor Jordan Crook looked back at how the travel company has adapted since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Their chat covered topics as far afield as Airbnb&#8217;s &#8220;work anywhere&#8221; policy, how it&#8217;s addressing liability issues for hosts and his biggest regret from the COVID-19 era:</p>
<blockquote><p>I overrode the host cancellation policy and refunded more than a billion dollars of guest bookings. I think it was the right thing to do. But I did it unilaterally, without consulting the hosts. They got really pissed off and it broke some trust with some of our host community.</p></blockquote>

The goal is to prevent abuse, which makes some sense. It’s a bummer that humans are such regular jerks that this is a needed product move, but here we are.</li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/"><strong>Instagram wants to help you use it less:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Users of the Meta-owned social service can now enable reminders to stop scrolling after a set time period. Recall that Meta is Facebook but under a new moniker.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/apple-introduces-device-management-solution-aimed-at-small-business/"><strong>Apple builds SMB hardware service:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Keeping hardware up to date and safe is no small challenge. That’s why companies like Jamf are in business. But now Apple is rolling out “the beta of a device management solution called Apple Business Essentials aimed squarely at businesses with less than 500 employees.”</li>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Zero-party data has very quickly become the biggest buzzword in marketing and digital advertising. Unlike third-party data, which is collected by aggregators and ad platforms through third-party cookies and unsavory tracking techniques, <a href="https://www.octaneai.com/blog/the-complete-guide-to-zero-party-data-marketing-for-ecommerce-merchants">zero-party data</a> is collected voluntarily and directly from customers.</p>
<p>Think of the kind of things you’d tell a store associate helping you find the right gifts to purchase for your family — size, style, skin concerns, gender, budget, taste profile, eating habits, what type of pet they have, etc. That’s zero-party data.</p>
<p>Zero-party data marketing started when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/the-downfall-of-ad-tech-means-the-trust-economy-is-here/">the scrutiny on ad tracking ramped up</a>, but became a necessity with iOS 14.5. With the vast majority of users opting out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">data tracking on iOS</a>, marketers need new sources of data to power their campaigns and replace the data they currently borrow from tracking cookies — which will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/is-google-about-to-delay-its-depreciation-of-tracking-cookies/">also go away in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This is especially true as more consumers <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005287/en/Personalize-or-Perish-New-Data-from-Twilio-Segment-Shows-Customer-Loyalty-Hinges-on-Personalized-Experiences">demand personalized experiences</a> from the places they shop. Implemented correctly, zero-party data marketing allows you to treat every customer as an individual, personalize their experience with your brand and build real relationships.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>While a lot of articles have discussed the importance of zero-party data, very few have gone into how to collect this valuable data and properly leverage it for better conversions, loyalty and customer satisfaction. That’s why I decided to write this piece. Think of it as a miniguide on how to begin your journey as a zero-party data marketer.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some of the most important tools for zero-party data collection.</p>
<h2>Quizzes and recommendations are the backbone of zero-party data</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2232097" style="width: 1112px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232097" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2232097 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png" alt="An example of a quiz to help customers buy a product" width="1102" height="278" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png 1102w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=300,76 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=768,194 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=680,172 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tc-diagram1-zpd.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1102px) 100vw, 1102px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232097" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Octane AI</p></div></p>
<p>When you hear &#8220;quiz,&#8221; you might be tempted to think of a BuzzFeed-style personality assessment, but in reality, they are the fundamental way we figure out what products we want to buy and what package to get.</p>
<p>Think about entering a cosmetics store. You know you need some collection of skincare products, but you don’t know which routine to follow or all the possible options for each part of the routine. A store associate does, however, and they usually help you find the right skincare routine and products based on a series of questions they ask about your skin’s condition, concerns, allergies and more.</p>

<p>So, it should go without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely amped to have Choksi join us on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-norwest-venture-partners-and-birdies?utm_source=TC%20Post&amp;utm_campaign=post" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 17 at 12 p.m. PST/3 p.m. EST for an episode of TechCrunch Live</a>. Choksi will be joined by founder Bianca Gates of <a href="https://birdies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Birdies</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. The first step in that, usually, is getting some funding. We&#8217;ll talk to Choksi and Gates about how they first met, what drew Choksi to invest in Birdies and how they&#8217;ve worked together since. We&#8217;ll also take a look through Birdies&#8217; early pitch deck and hear what really sang for NVP and other investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232075" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Founders, this is a great opportunity to learn what makes VCs tick and refine your fundraising process accordingly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blackshark.ai, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/meet-the-startup-that-helped-microsoft-build-the-world-of-flight-simulator/">the Austrian startup</a> behind the digital globe you fly over in Microsoft&#8217;s Flight Simulator, has raised a $20 million round A to develop and scale its replica-Earth tech. The potential applications for a planetary &#8220;digital twin&#8221; are many and various, and the company has a head start even on mapping giants like Google.</p>
<p>The world got a glimpse of a fully traversable and remarkably (if not 100%) accurate globe in Flight Simulator last year; we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/microsofts-new-flight-simulator-is-a-beautiful-work-in-progress/">called it a &#8220;technical marvel&#8221;</a> and later went into detail about how it was created and by whom.</p>
<p>Blackshark.ai was spun out of gaming studio Bongfish with the intention, founder and CEO Michael Putz told me, of taking their world-building technology beyond game environments. The basis of their technique is turning widely available 2D imagery into accurate 3D representations with machine learning, a bit of smart guesswork and a lot of computing power.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231468" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The details are here, but essentially the Blackshark.ai system has a canny understanding of what different buildings look like from above, even in suboptimal lighting and incomplete imagery. The machine learning system they&#8217;ve built can extrapolate from imperfect outlines by considering the neighborhood (residential versus commercial), roof type (slanted versus flat) and other factors like the presence of air conditioning units and so on. Using all this it creates a plausible 3D reconstruction of the building.</p>
<p>The hard part, of course, isn&#8217;t how to do that <em>once</em> but how to do it <em>a billion times on a regular basis</em>, in order to create an up-to-date 3D representation of every building on the planet. As Putz explained: &#8220;Even if you could afford to buy all the computing power for this, building the back end to serve it is hard! This was a real-world issue we had to deal with.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7DADSF9--0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Their solution, as is often necessary for AI-powered services, was to optimize. Putz said that the process of calculating the 3D model for every building on the planet originally took about a month of computation but now can be done in about three days, an acceleration of about 300x.</p>
<p>Having this ability to update regularly based on new imagery from satellites is crucial to their business proposition, Putz explained. A lot of 3D map data, like what you see in Google and Apple&#8217;s maps, is based on photogrammetry, aerial photography combining multiple aerial images and comparing parallax data (like our eyes do) to determine size and depth. This produces great data … for when the photo is taken.</p>
<p>If you want your 3D map to represent what a block in Chicago looked like <em>last week</em>, not two years ago, and you want to provide that level of recency to as much of the globe as possible, the only option these days is satellite imagery. But that also necessitates the aforementioned 2D-to-3D method.</p>

<p>Putz noted that although the Blackshark.ai 3D map and those from Google and Apple have superficial similarities, they&#8217;re not really competitors. All provide a realistic &#8220;canvas,&#8221; but they differ greatly in intention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google Maps is the canvas for local businesses,&#8221; he said, and what&#8217;s important to both the company and its users is locations, reviews, directions, things like that. &#8220;For us, say for flooding, a climate change use case, we provide the 3D data for say, Seattle, and others who specialize in water physics and fluid simulation can use the real world as a canvas to draw on. Our goal is to become a searchable surface of the planet.&#8221;</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the total flat rooftop area available in this neighborhood of San Diego? What regional airports have an open 4,000-square-meter space? How do wildfire risk areas overlap with updated wind models? It&#8217;s not hard to come up with ways this could be helpful.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one of those ideas where the more you think about it, the more use cases come up,&#8221; Putz said. &#8220;There&#8217;s obviously government applications, disaster relief, smart cities, autonomous industries — driving and flying. All these industries need synthetic environments. This wasn&#8217;t just like, &#8216;Hey we want to do this,&#8217; it was needed. And this 2D-3D thing is the only way to solve this massive problem.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The $20 million round was led by M12 (Microsoft&#8217;s venture fund) and Point72 Ventures. Putz was excited to have a few familiar advising faces aboard: Google Earth co-founder Brian McClendon, former CEO of Airbus Dirk Hoke and Qasar Younis, former Y Combinator COO and now CEO of Applied Intuition. (These folks are <em>advising</em>, not <em>joining</em> the board, as this paragraph mistakenly had earlier.)</p>
<p>Scaling is more a matter of going to market rather than building out the product; while of course more engineers and researchers will be hired, the company needs to go from &#8220;clever startup&#8221; to &#8220;global provider of 3D synthetic Earths&#8221; in a hurry or it may find some other clever startup eating its lunch. So a sales and support team will be built out, along with &#8220;the remaining pieces of a hyperscaling company,&#8221; Putz said.</p>
<p>Beyond the more obvious use cases he listed, there&#8217;s a possibility of — you knew it was coming — <em>metaverse</em> applications. In this case however it&#8217;s less hot air and more the idea that if any interesting AR/VR/etc. applications, from games to travel guides, wanted to base their virtual experience in a recently rendered version of Earth, they can. Not only that, but worlds beyond our own can be generated by the same method, so if you wanted to scramble the layout of the planet and make a  new one (and who could blame you?) you could do so by the end of the week. Doesn&#8217;t that sound nice?</p>
<p>Once the new funding gets put to use, expect to see &#8220;powered by Blackshark.ai&#8221; or the like on a new generation of ever more detailed simulations of the complex markets and processes taking place on the surface of our planet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ample, a startup developing battery swapping technology for electric vehicles, has scored another $30 million from The Blackstone Group and Spanish multinational financial services company Banco Santander.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company should be at or near unicorn status, considering its valuation back in August was $890 million, according to PitchBook. Unicorn status means a company that is valued at $1 billion.</p>
<p>The bulk of this round came from The Blackstone Group, who provided $25 million, with Banco providing the remainder. Ample has raised $260 million to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232101" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ample’s concept is relatively straightforward: instead of an EV pulling up to a charging station to get more power, the company proposes outfitting vehicles with Ample’s modular battery packs, which can be swapped out at dedicated stations.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Ample landed a partnership with Uber to use the company&#8217;s battery swapping stations at a few locations in the Bay Area. Both companies have agreed to extend their partnership to Europe, where Uber aims to electrify half the rides that are booked across seven European capitals — London, Amsterdam, Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Madrid and Lisbon — by 2025.</p>
<p>Ample co-founder John de Souza told TechCrunch in a statement that the funding will go toward scaling operations. &#8220;In order to deploy tens of thousands of vehicles in the near future, we will need to expand our production, deployment and support functions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Geographically we will be expanding into Europe next year. The need for scale is being driven both by the market demand and also by the urgency of moving to EVs that was clearly highlighted at COP26.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ample also scored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/ev-battery-swapping-startup-ample-charges-up-operations-in-japan-nyc/">a partnership with Sally</a>, an EV rental company based in New York City, to deploy the startup’s swapping service across San Francisco, NYC, Los Angeles and Chicago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Taken together, the two initial partnerships — Uber and Sally — reflect the startup’s focus on fleet companies, for whom time spent recharging an EV battery is time wasted. Ample sees battery swapping as a good solution for individual consumers as well, especially those like apartment dwellers who may not have reliable access to overnight charging, the company has told TechCrunch in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The second annual <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sight Tech Global</a> conference, a virtual, free event on December 1-2, will convene the world’s top experts on advanced technologies, notably AI, addressing accessibility and assistive tech for people who are blind or visually impaired.</p>
<p>Today we’re excited to roll out the main stage agenda. These 10 expertly moderated fireside and panel sessions capture a remarkable cross section of the work going on today at Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon, to name just four of the giants in the field. We will announce another half dozen breakout sessions in the coming days.</p>

It&#8217;s free, virtual and very screen-reader friendly.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232167" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Sight Tech Global December 1</h2>
<p><strong>Designing for Everyone: Accessibility and Machine Learning at Apple<br />
</strong>Apple’s iPhone and VoiceOver are among the greatest breakthroughs ever for accessibility, but Apple never rests on its laurels. The next wave of innovation will involve what’s known as “machine learning” (a subset of artificial intelligence), which uses data from sensors on the phone and elsewhere to help make sense of the world around us. The implications for accessibility are just starting to emerge.</p>

<p><strong>Seeing AI: What Happens When You Combine Computer Vision, Lidar and Audio AR?<br />
</strong>The latest features in Microsoft’s Seeing AI app enable the app to recognize things in the world and place them in 3D space. Items are literally  announced from their position in the room; in other words, the word “chair” seems to emanate from the chair itself. Users can place virtual audio beacons on objects to track the location of the door, for example, and use the haptic proximity sensor to feel the outline of the room.</p>
<p>All of this is made possible by combining the latest advances in AR, computer vision and the iPhone 12 Pro’s lidar sensor. And that’s only the start.</p>

<p><strong>W3C ARIA-AT: Screen readers, Interoperability and a New Era of Web Accessibility<br />
</strong>Who knew that screen readers, unlike Web browsers, are not interoperable. Web site developers don’t worry about whether their code will work on Safari, Chrome or any other browser, but if they take accessibility seriously they have to test for JAWS, VoiceOver, NVDA and the rest. That’s about to change, thanks to the W3C ARIA-AT project.</p>
<p>(This session will be followed December 2 by a live breakout session with King and Fairchild, as well as several other members of the W3C ARIA-AT team.)</p>

<p><strong>The “Holy Braille”: The Development of a New Tactile Display Combining Braille and Graphics in One Experience<br />
</strong>Today, instant access to the written word in braille is much less available to someone who is blind than the printed word is for someone who is sighted. Tools such as single line refreshable braille displays have been available for years, but a single line at a time gives the user a very limited reading experience. This limitation is especially felt when users are reading lengthy documents or when they encounter content such as charts and graphs in a textbook. The American Printing House for the Blind (APH) and HumanWare have teamed to develop a device capable of rendering multiple lines of braille and tactile graphics on the same tactile surface. Currently referred to as the Dynamic Tactile Device (DTD), this tool aims to provide blind users with a multi-line book reader, tactile graphics viewer and so much more.</p>
<p>(This session will be followed by a live breakout Q&amp;A session with Greg Stilson, head of APH’s Global Technology Innovation team, and HumanWare’s Andrew Flattres, Braille Product Manager.)</p>

<p><strong>Indoor Navigation: Can Inertial Navigation, Computer Vision and Other New Technologies Work Where GPS Can’t?<br />
</strong>Thanks to mobile phones, GPS and navigation apps, people who are blind or visually impaired can get around outdoors independently. Navigating indoors is another matter.</p>
<p>For starters, GPS IS often not available indoors. Then there are the challenges of knowing where the door is, finding the stairs or avoiding the couch someone moved. Combining on-phone and in-cloud technologies like inertial navigation, audio AR, lidar and computer vision may be the foundation for a solution, if product developers can map indoor spaces, provide indoor positioning and deliver an accessible user interface.</p>

<p><strong>Why Amazon’s Vision Includes Talking Less to Alexa<br />
</strong>As homes become increasingly more technology-driven, inputs from multiple sources — teachable AI, multimodal understanding, sensors, computer vision and more — will create a truly ambient, surround experience. Already, one in every five Alexa smart home interactions is initiated by Alexa without any spoken command. As Alexa develops an understanding of us and our home well enough to predict our needs and act on our behalf in meaningful ways, what are the implications for accessibility?</p>

<p><strong>Inventors Invent: Three New Takes on Assistive Technology<br />
</strong>Inventors have long been inspired to apply their genius to helping blind people. Think of innovators like Mike Shebanek (VoiceOver, Apple) or Jim Fruchterman (Bookshare, Benetech), to name just two. Today, innovators have a nearly miraculous array of affordable technologies to work with, including lidar, computer vision, high-speed data networks and more. As a result, innovation is moving ahead at a dizzying pace. In this session, we will talk to three product innovators on the forefront of turning those core technologies into remarkable new tools for people who are blind or visually impaired.</p>

<p><strong>Product Accessibility: How Do You Get it Right? And How Do You Know When You Have?<br />
</strong>Accessibility awareness is on the rise, but even teams with the best of intentions can flounder when it comes to finding the right approaches. One key is to work closely with the appropriate communities of users to get feedback and understand needs. The result is not trade-offs but a better product for everyone. In this session, we’ll hear from experts on the frontline of accessibility in product development.</p>

<p><strong>For Most Mobile Phone Users, Accessibility Is Spelled Android<br />
</strong>Nearly three-quarters of mobile phone users in the world use phones built on Google’s Android operating system, not Apple’s iOS on the iPhone. For people who are blind or have low vision, the key app is Google’s Lookout, which draws on the vast resources of Google’s AI infrastructure, including its computer vision database and Google maps. How is Google approaching the huge accessibility opportunity Lookout represents?</p>

<p><strong>Getting around: Autonomous Vehicles, Ridesharing and Those Last Few Feet<br />
</strong>Summoning a ride from a smart phone is a dream come true for many, but when you have difficulty finding that ride, even when it’s a few feet away, the experience can be a nightmare, not to mention dangerous. How are rideshare and autonomous taxi companies working to make those last few feet from rider to car safer and better for blind and low-vision riders?</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think what is really driving this, honestly, is just liquidity for our early shareholders. We haven't raised money in so long that our VCs basically just need liquidity."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After spending more than a decade building out its expense management platform, Expensify went public today, listing on the Nasdaq under the ticker “EXFY.” Early returns have been positive, as the company revised its original listing price up &#8212; and still saw its shares rise 40% on its first day of trading.</p>
<p>We’ve written a fair amount about Expensify already, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">deep dive from my colleague Anna Heim</a> that follows it from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">the company’s foundation</a> all the way up through its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/expensify-ec1-business/">continued focus on product-led growth</a>. Meanwhile, Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/inside-expensifys-ipo-filing/">took a peek into the company’s S-1</a> when it filed to go public last month.</p>
<p>Today, though, I got the chance to catch up with Expensify founder and CEO David Barrett to discuss why the company decided to go public now, why it chose a traditional listing as opposed to a SPAC or direct listing and how it sees the expense management category shaping up as corporate travel begins to pick up post-COVID and a group of startups like Ramp and Brex seek to offer spend management solutions based on their own corporate card programs.</p>
<p>Below, Barrett explains why he believes Expensify’s listing is the “most pro-employee IPO ever,” how expense management &#8212; particularly SMB expense management &#8212; is a trillion-dollar opportunity and why he doesn’t see the likes of Brex as competition.</p>
<p><em>The transcript of this conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: Congratulations on this milestone. But the obvious question is, why was now the right time to take the company public? Was it the company readiness? Market multiples? A frothy IPO market? </strong></p>
<p>David Barrett: We often get this question, and I think our attitude is much more like, “Why not?” We&#8217;re not optimizing for a single transaction, and we could wait a month, a year, or 10 years and will be the same company. But we would rather have liquidity along that path.</p>
<p>I think what is really driving this, honestly, is just liquidity for our early shareholders. We haven&#8217;t raised money in so long that our VCs basically just need liquidity. I could wait another year and get an even more insane return, but I&#8217;ve already banked such a gigantic return I just kind of need to give it back.</p>
<p>Because we&#8217;re a very profitable company, we actually did a leveraged buyout of Redpoint. So one of our earliest VCs, we actually gave them liquidity just off our balance sheet. That was great, but at some point, you know, we&#8217;re profitable, but not so profitable that we can buy out our investors to like hundreds of millions of dollars a year. We can&#8217;t get that level of liquidity.</p>

<p>It really came down to &#8212; there&#8217;s no future where we don&#8217;t end up going public at some point. So then it&#8217;s no longer <em>if</em> we should go public, it&#8217;s really about <em>when</em>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Congress is making its biggest push ever to stop drunk driving with President Biden&#8217;s huge infrastructure bill. As we previously reported, one of the provisions included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/infrastructure-bill-drunk-driving-technology-173739727.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">a mandate for anti-drunk driving technology</a> in new cars. Now, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-faces-fresh-challenges-infrastructure-050328752.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has passed Congress</a> with the measure intact, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/11/10/drunk-driving-car-technology-infrastructure-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>Autoblog (AP) reports</em></a>, and it&#8217;s expected to be signed by the President soon. As part of the legislation, carmakers will have to include technology to detect and stop drunk drivers by as early as 2026.</p>
<p>First, though, the Department of Transportation will have to determine the best solution to curtail intoxicated drunk driving. Specifically, the bill requires something that will “passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired.” That sounds similar to infrared camera solutions already used today by GM, Nissan and others, Sam Abuelsamid, principal mobility analyst for Guidehouse <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/insight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Insights</a>, tells the <em>AP</em>. It goes without saying that we&#8217;d need something more advanced than breathalyzers, which are already used as a punishment for convicted drunken drivers.</p>
<p>Around 10,000 people die every year in the US from drunk driving accidents, the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving#:~:text=Driving%20after%20drinking%20is%20deadly.&amp;text=In%20fact%2C%20on%20average%20over,the%20United%20States%20in%202019." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">NHTSA says</a>. Now that we have smarter sensors and plenty of camera technology to monitor driver behavior, it makes sense to explore solutions that could help prevent those sorts of accidents. Within a decade, it should feel as commonplace as seatbelts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232388" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The infrastructure bill also includes other safety measures, like rear seat reminders that could notify parents about children left in carseats. Additionally, Congress will also require automatic emergency braking and lane departure warnings, features that many new cars already offer. It&#8217;s unclear when true self-driving cars will be a reality, but until then, at least human drivers can look forward to more ways to prevent accidents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Department of Justice is suing ride-hailing giant Uber over claims that the company discriminates against passengers with disabilities, in violation of the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Wednesday, alleged that Uber’s practice of imposing “wait time” fees on passengers with disabilities constituted discrimination, as those passengers may need more time to board the vehicle due to that disability. Uber launched its wait time policy in April 2016, charging fees from two minutes after the Uber vehicle arrives at the designated pickup location.</p>
<p>Uber does not give discretion to drivers to waive or otherwise alter wait time fees, which are calculated automatically in the app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232335" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The DOJ said Uber failed to give those passengers adequate boarding time or provide equitable fares, in violation of the ADA. Mobility aids that need to be broken down, like wheelchairs and walkers, or myriad other reasons, could mean that a disabled passenger requires more than two minutes to board a vehicle, the suit says.</p>
<p>The complaint described the experiences of two specific passengers, referred to only as, “Passenger A” and “Passenger B.” Passenger A, a 52-year-old woman who has quadriplegia and uses a manual wheelchair, took at least five minutes on average to board vehicles she booked using Uber. She was charged a wait time fee for each ride she took, but due to limited other transportation options, she continued using Uber each day. She attempted to request a refund and was denied.</p>
<p>Passenger B, a 34-year-old man with cerebral palsy, also uses a manual wheelchair and was also charged a wait time fee for nearly every ride through the app. Uber initially refunded the fees, but later told him that he had reached “the maximum amount of refunds.”</p>
<p>“Similar to Passengers A and B, other individuals with disabilities throughout the country have likewise been discriminated against by Uber by being charged wait time fees because of their disabilities,” the suit says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ADA is a landmark piece of legislation enacted by Congress in 1990. While Uber is a private company, the DOJ says the ADA has authority to address discrimination in transportation services provided by private entities.</p>
<p>“As Uber and other similar providers have gained popularity over traditional taxi services as the primary option for on-demand transportation, Uber plays an important role in ensuring independence for countless people with disabilities who choose to – or simply must – rely on its services to travel,” the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Uber for comment and will update the story if the company responds.</p>
<p>The case number is 3:21-cv-08735.</p>

<p>Just two days after SpaceX safely returned four astronauts from the International Space Station, it’s sending another quartet to orbit. Check out the launch live on the video above &#8212; SpaceX will start providing coverage from 4:45 PM EDT, with liftoff scheduled for 9:03 PM EDT. You can also watch a livestream of the launch on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&amp;ab_channel=NASA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA TV YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The launch, called Crew-3, was originally scheduled to take off on the auspicious date of Halloween, but it encountered a series of delays, first due to adverse weather and then a “minor medical issue” involving one of the crew members. (NASA did not provide any further details on the issue, only specifying that it was not not an emergency nor related to COVID-19.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232297" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But now the launch is back on track. The foursome &#8212; NASA’s Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, Kayla Barron and the European Space Agency’s Matthias Maurer &#8212; will be ferried to the ISS in a SpaceX Dragon capsule they&#8217;ve dubbed &#8220;Endurance,&#8221; aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. It will be the first time in space for Maurer, Barron and Chari, and the third mission for Maurer. They’re scheduled to spend the next six months on the station, where they’ll join just one NASA astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts.</p>
<p>Crew-3 is part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, a partnership between the agency and private industry to develop and use human space transportation vehicles. SpaceX began providing transportation services to and from the ISS under the CCP in 2020, under a $3.1 billion contract for six missions. Boeing was awarded a $4.8 billion contract under the program for its Starliner capsule, which has faced a series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/nasa-and-boeing-confirm-starliner-wont-fly-until-first-half-of-2022-as-valve-investigation-continues/">technical snafus</a> that will likely keep it grounded until the first half of next year.</p>
<p>Liftoff will take place from launchpad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the astronauts scheduled to arrive on the ISS by Thursday evening. Should weather conditions prove unfavorable for launch, SpaceX will have another opportunity 24 hours later.</p>
<p>Following stage separation, the Falcon 9 booster is anticipated to land autonomously on the “A Shortfall of Gravitas” barge stationed off the Florida coast.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It takes such a galactic amount of time, effort and expense to build a successful space startup, that you might find it difficult to justify carving out two days to attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> on December 14-15.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. This event places you and your startup in the orbital path of the most influential people in the space ecosystem. The check-writers, the potential partners and customers that are essential for your ultimate success — all of them focused on pushing the boundaries of the space economy.</p>
<p>We can lather-rinse-and-repeat that fact from here to Alpha Centauri and back, but it might be more helpful to hear a testimonial from one of your own.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230631" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>But first:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=TRUE">Buy your pass today</a>, and you’ll save $100 with the general admission price.</p>
<p>Now, let’s hear more about why one space CEO says attending TC Sessions: Space 2021 is an excellent use of your time, energy and budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/brian-manning-d115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Manning</a>, the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xona-space-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xona Space Systems</a>, an early-stage startup focused on precision LEO satellite navigation services, attended TC Sessions: Space 2020, our inaugural space conference. Here’s what he had to say about the overall experience.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Why did you decide to attend and exhibit at TC Sessions: Space 2020?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> Our company was very new at that point, and our main goal was to gain exposure and to make connections. We also believed the event speakers and presentations would bring a great crowd of both potential investors and customers. We were excited about exhibiting and pitching.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How did that pitching opportunity come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> We were one of 10 startups chosen by Starburst Aerospace — a global space accelerator — to participate in a pitch-off called Pitch Me to the Moon. It was a great opportunity to pitch live to a panel of high-profile judges from across the industry. We won the pitch-off and, along with terrific exposure, we received a strategy session with Starburst, free tickets to Disrupt 2021 and a podcast interview.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you talk a bit about your networking experience? </strong></p>
<p><strong>BM: </strong>Last year everything went into virtual mode, which made 2020 interesting for events. The conference went well, and TechCrunch handled the setup and all the networking breaks cleanly. Networking virtually is always a challenge, but we did have several useful, spontaneous conversations.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What, if anything, came as a result of attending TC Sessions: Space 2020?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BM:</strong> The event directly led to conversations with several potential high-value customers. A few of them came from unexpected areas, which pleasantly surprised us. In the past year, we’ve run into quite a few people who mentioned they remembered us from the TechCrunch event. Overall, we received great exposure that was very relevant to our company.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=space2021&amp;utm_content=generaladmission&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=xonaspace&amp;display=TRUE">Buy your pass</a> (or passes) and expose your startup to an astronomic dose of out-of-this-world opportunity.</p>
