										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past several years, institutional investors had largely shied away from China&#8217;s e-cigarette makers, an industry that was teeming with shoddy workshops and lacked regulatory oversight. But investors&#8217; attitude is changing as China sets in motion its strictest ever regulation on electronic cigarettes.</p>
<p>Myst Labs, a Chinese e-cigarette maker co-founded in 2019 by Chenyue Xing, a chemist who was part of the team at Juul <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/27/myst-labs-profile/">that invented nicotine salts</a>, a key ingredient in vaping, recently raised &#8220;tens of thousands of dollars&#8221; from a Series B funding round. The financing was led by its existing investor, IMO Ventures. Thomas Yao, CEO and another co-founder of Myst, is a founding partner of IMO Ventures.</p>
<p>In March, one of China&#8217;s top tech policy makers <a href="https://www.miit.gov.cn/jgsj/zfs/gzdt/art/2021/art_e233af8bb3484ed59e98dbb79e49a0bd.html">published</a> a set of draft rules that would bring e-cigarettes under the same regulatory scope as traditional tobacco, which means vaping companies will need licenses for production, wholesale and retail operations in the world&#8217;s largest manufacturer and exporter of e-cigarettes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These changes will deal a blow to small producers with poor quality control, leaving the industry with a handful of established and compliant players, Fang Wang, head of marketing at Myst, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>For one, standardizing production is costly, Li said. From ceramic coils, batteries, to fragrance, every component and ingredient of a vape will need to meet stringent requirements. E-cigarette companies will also need to pay tobacco taxes, an important source of tax revenue for the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The other challenge is how to lower nicotine content. Many current products on the market have a relatively high nicotine concentration at 3-5%, so if China is in line with the European Union standard of<a href="https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/study-significant-differences-juul-s-chemical-make-and-health-risks-us-and-europe">Â 1.7%</a>, many small brands will be forced out of business because they lack the know-how to produce low-nicotine vapes that still satisfy users&#8217; crave, suggested Li.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve received a lot of investor interest in the past few months. Before that, professional, institutional investors often avoided e-cigarette companies, but they are showing more willingness now as regulations take shape,&#8221; Li added.</p>
<p>Myst declined to list its other investors but said they include high-profile individuals invovled in the e-bike sharing company Lime, Facebook and the bitcoin industry.</p>
<p>Most of Myst&#8217;s current sales are from China, where it has opened 600 stores and plans to reach a footprint of 1,000 stores in the next few quarters. Overseas, the startup has a retail footprint in Malaysia, Russia, Canada and the United Kingdom, where it&#8217;s selling in over 30 shopping malls and a few hospitals through its distribution partner, Ecigwizard.</p>
<p>The new funding will allow Myst to further expand its sales network and strengthen its research and development. The company prides itself on its product containing 1.7% nicotine, which it claims can deliver the effect of a 3% counterpart. At her lab, Xing is currently working on e-liquids with &#8220;natural tobacco contents&#8221; and without organic acids, additives that allow nicotine salts to vaporize and be absorbed.</p>
<p>Myst is still a relatively small player compared to China&#8217;s market dominator Relx, which went public in New York earlier this year and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/china-relx-gears-up-for-us-entry/">applying for a license to sell in the U.S.</a> But Yao is optimistic about Myst&#8217;s future. Vaping, he said, is one of the fastest-growing consumer categories in China. Myst&#8217;s recent sales are tripling every three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;In other consumer areas, you rarely see a top player commanding 60-70% of the market, so there is still a lot of room for the top 10 players to grow,&#8221; the CEO said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase shares tumbled today to their their <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/coinbase-stock-price-lowest-since-ipo-crypto-exchange-2021-5-1030398413">lowest point</a> since the company began trading publicly on April 14. The market often moves in mysterious ways, but several drivers could be at play, including Coinbase&#8217;s high opening price at the time of its direct listing, its reliance on margins that are all but certain to drop owing to growing competition, and the lack of a lock-up period, meaning more insiders might now be offloading some of their highly valued shares, driving down their price in the process.</p>
<p>Whether Coinbase&#8217;s shares fall further still is an open question, but one early investor, Garry Tan, believes what outsiders misunderstand about Coinbase is its potential going forward. Indeed, Tan has said previously that a major revenue driver for the company could ultimately tie to a startup called <a href="https://bisontrails.co/">Bison Trails</a> (also backed by Tan) that Coinbase <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/19/coinbase-acquires-bison-trails-crypto-builder-deal/">quietly acquired</a> late last year for an estimated $80 million in stock and that Tan recently likened to an AWS inside of the cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>Curious to learn more, we talked recently with Joe Lallouz, the cofounder and CEO of Bison Trails, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/kleiner-perkins-joins-24-5m-funding-led-by-blockchain-capital-for-bison-trails">$35 million from investors</a> and is now being run as an independent product line by Coinbase. We asked Lallouz &#8212; who previously cofounded and <a href="https://blog.etsy.com/news/2014/etsy-acquires-grand-st/">sold a company to Etsy</a> &#8212; about the opportunity he&#8217;s chasing and how his 70-person team fends off what appears to be a growing number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/alchemy-raises-80m-at-a-505m-valuation-to-be-the-aws-for-blockchain/">direct competitors</a>. Our conversation has been edited for length below. To listen to our full conversation, including more specifics about Bison&#8217;s operations, you can <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8438468">do that here</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: Your last company connected hardware makers with buyers. What led you to start a crypto infrastructure business?</strong></p>
<p>JL: First, I often speak in the plural we because I have a co founder [Aaron Henshaw] who I&#8217;ve worked with on every company for about 20Â  years. Prior to Bison Trails, the company that was acquired by Etsy was a pretty large marketplace and I [remained] on the leadership team for a few years, and it was actually there that my interest in crypto and Bitcoin and the blockchain space was really piqued &#8212; mostly in the form as an investor. I do have a technical background, I&#8217;m an engineer. Aaron is an engineer. And so this idea of programmable money was really interesting to me, and I start doing some angel investing, and suddenly, some of the weirdest and smartest people I&#8217;ve ever met were switching careers and focusing on building blockchains or blockchain technology. And [Aaron] and I couldn&#8217;t get away from this idea that blockchains and the technology that powers blockchains &#8212;Â  crypto protocols &#8212; were going to be super influential in every piece of software that&#8217;s built over the next 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What was the next step?</strong></p>
<p>JL: It was a lot of a whole lot of experimentation. [Aaron and I] built probably each built about three or four different products that weren&#8217;t Bison Trails before we built Bison Trails. For one reason or another, they probably weren&#8217;t valuable or viable as products but they did give us an incredible amount of insight into what the blockchain ecosystem needed. There was a huge gap in the blockchain market in the infrastructure space. Just really simple things like connecting to a blockchain network, reading from the blockchain network, writing to that blockchain network, doing very blockchain-native things like staking and mining &#8212; all that stuff that you may have heard about or read about, it just took a tremendous amount of time.</p>

<p><strong>TC: So you created this company to make it easier for folks to not have to spend time on those things. But you&#8217;re not alone. Last week, a company called Alchemy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/alchemy-raises-80m-at-a-505m-valuation-to-be-the-aws-for-blockchain/">raised money</a> from Coatue and Addition to do something similar. Are you direct rivals?</strong></p>
<p>J: Not exactly. This isn&#8217;t a zero sum community. Everyone who&#8217;s focused on building blockchain products &#8212; whether they&#8217;re new blockchains, or infrastructure, or companies around it &#8212; is incredibly collaborative.</p>
<p>I do know Alchemy and another company that does similar stuff called <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a> and a couple other companies that maybe haven&#8217;t raised financing recently so [haven&#8217;t been in the news] but are doing really great work in the space to make it easier for people to build. And this isn&#8217;t uncommon in a nascent technology space, where companies come in and say, &#8216;This is a really hard piece of technology to work.&#8217; With blockchains, in particular, we need to make it easier, and different companies are doing that from different angles.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Whose life are you making easier?</strong></p>
<p>JL: We&#8217;ve seen a lot of success in supporting the world&#8217;s biggest crypto companies. Prior to Coinbase acquiring Bison Trails, we&#8217;d announced partnerships with Coinbase to help power their staking nodes proof-of-stake protocols, which is a paradigm shift in the blockchain space. But we&#8217;ve also been helping a lot of the other companies that are getting into the space, everyone from that one person who has a smart contract and a dream, all the way to the world&#8217;s biggest financial institutions that are building new crypto new products. Whether banks or neobanks, all of them are trying to build on top of these blockchains and a lot of them have been Bison Trail customers for years.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Katie Haun on saying yes to Coinbase and where a16z&#8217;s crypto fund is placing its bets now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/katie-haun-on-saying-yes-to-coinbase-and-where-a16zs-crypto-fund-is-largely-placing-its-bets-now/embed/#?secret=diffspNxtr" data-secret="diffspNxtr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>TC: You mentioned the shift to proof of stake from proof of work. Proof of work centers on mining cryptocurrency and proof of stake sounds a little like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/wanted-founders-in-favor-of-tenured-voting/">tenured voting</a>, meaning people are getting rewarded for holding on to currencies longer than others and having a bigger position in them. Is that anywhere near accurate?</strong></p>
<p>JF: It&#8217;s almost simpler than that. At its core, the blockchain is a ledger, and a whole lot of people who don&#8217;t work together maintain that ledger, which is how mining works. Proof of stake works the same way, but if you hold currency in that blockchain, you vote on what the state of the ledger is. So rather than relying on complex mining algorithms and these large mining operations like Bitcoin does, it relies on people who are incentivized for the state of the blockchain to be right to be correct, because they hold the currency to vote. So really all it is, is a mechanism to incentivize everyday holders of any token to vote on the blocks that are being produced.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And this is is already happening.</strong></p>
<p>JL: So it&#8217;s already happening. One of the major blockchains that&#8217;s in the middle of this shift is Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0. Ethereum has obviously become a very popular blockchain because it was one of the first to enable very intricate, smart contracts, which enables folks to build applications on top of it. And the reason Ethereum has been making the shift is to help it scale. The process of proof of work &#8212; mining &#8212; can bog down the scalability of a blockchain, meaning how fast it is, how expensive it is, how easy it is to post transactions, and to update the ledger and to maintain the ledger. So this has been a pretty serious trend because it enables blockchains to reach more people and power more intricate applications. It&#8217;s a really key piece to blockchain adoption.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And to underscore what Bison Trails is offering to do, what are the features exactly that you&#8217;re promising your customers, and do you charge a conventional monthly subscription for these features and services?</strong></p>
<p>JL: We&#8217;re a platform not unlike Google Cloud or an AWS where if you&#8217;re a builder or someone who wants to participate in a chain, you come to us and instead of needing a team of engineers to spin up nodes and run those and make sure that they&#8217;re up and running so that, say, your wallet app is able to connect to a blockchain or that you can take on a new chain or stake on Ethereum; you can instead just click a few buttons in our interface and do that really easily.</p>
<p>The business model is really what we call crypto native SaaS, so folks will pay us in a combination of U.S. dollars, or the crypto equivalent &#8212; in some cases like a stablecoin. But also each of the proof-of-stake protocols, as you participate in them, you&#8217;re rewarded for participating them, and Bison Trails as a company takes a small cut of that reward.</p>
<p><em>Again, for more of this conversation, including a look at which nascent crypto startups Lallouz is backing as an investor, you can hear it in its entirety <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8438468">here</a>.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank has picked its bet in China&#8217;s flourishing industrial robotics space. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/youibot">Youibot</a>, a four-year-old startup that makes autonomous mobile robots for a range of scenarios, said it has notched close to 100 million yuan ($15.47 million) in its latest funding round led by SoftBank Ventures Asia, the Seoul-based early-stage arm of the global investment behemoth.</p>
<p>In December, SoftBank Ventures Asia led the financing round for another Chinese robotics startup called KeenOn, which focuses on delivery and service robots.</p>
<p>Youibot&#8217;s previous investors BlueRun Ventures and SIG also participated in the round. The startup, based in Shenzhen where it went through SOSV&#8217;s HAX hardware accelerator program, <a href="https://www.youibot.com/newsinfo/1066790.html?templateId=1133604">secured three financing rounds</a> during 2020 as businesses and investors embrace industrial automation to minimize human contact. Youibot has raised over 200 million yuan to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by a group of PhDs from China&#8217;s prestigious Xi&#8217;an Jiaotong University, Youibot develops solutions for factory automation, logistics management, as well as inspection and maintenance for various industries. For example, its robots can navigate around a yard of buses, inspect every tire of the vehicles and provide a detailed report for maintenance, a feature that helped it rack up Michelin&#8217;s contract.</p>
<p>Youibot&#8217;s &#8220;strongest suits&#8221; are in electronics manufacturing and electric power patrol, the company&#8217;s spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup is also seeing high growth in its semiconductor business, with customers coming from several prominent front-end wafer fabs, which use the firm&#8217;s robots for chip packaging, testing, and wafer production. Youibot declined to disclose their names due to confidentiality.</p>
<p>Chinese clients that it named include CRRC Zhuzhou, a state-owned locomotive manufacturer, Huaneng Group, a state-owned electricity generation giant, Huawei, and more. China currently comprises 80% of Youibot&#8217;s total revenues while overseas markets are rapidly catching up. The firm&#8217;s revenues tripled last year from 2020.</p>
<p>Youibot plans to spend the fresh proceeds on research and development in its mobile robots and propietary software, team building and market expansion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/brex-ramp-tout-their-view-of-the-future-as-divvy-is-said-to-consider-a-sale-to-bill-com/">expected</a>, Bill.com is <a href="https://investor.bill.com/news/news-details/2021/Bill.com-to-Acquire-Divvy-a-Leader-in-Spend-Management-for-SMBs/default.aspx">buying</a> <a href="http://divvy.com">Divvy</a>, the Utah-based corporate spend management startup that competes with <a href="http://brex.com">Brex</a>, <a href="http://ramp.com">Ramp</a>Â and <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a>. The total purchase price of around $2.5 billion is substantially above the company&#8217;s roughly $1.6 billion post-money valuation that Divvy set during its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/divvy-7ad9-series-d--66af9dd1">$165 million, January 2021 funding round</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Divvy&#8217;s growth rate tells us that the company did not sell due to performance weakness.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Per Bill.com, the transaction includes $625 million in cash, with the rest of the consideration coming in the form of stock in Divvy&#8217;s new parent company.</p>
<p>Bill.com also reported its <a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/404137088/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/BILL-Q3'21-Earnings-Press-Release-Final.pdf">quarterly results</a> today: Its Q1 included revenues of $59.7 million, above expectations of $54.63 million. The company&#8217;s adjusted loss per share of $0.02 also exceeded expectations, with the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3691266-bill-com-q3-2021-earnings-preview">street expecting</a> a sharper $0.07 per share deficit.</p>
<p>The better-than-anticipated results and the acquisition news combined to boost the value of Bill.com by more than 13% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, Bill.com released a deck that provides a number of financial metrics relating to its purchase of Divvy. This will not only allow us to better understand the value of the unicorn at exit, but also its competitors, against which we now have a set of metrics to bring to bear. So, this afternoon, let&#8217;s unpack the deal to gain a better understanding of the huge exit and the value of Divvy&#8217;s richly funded competitors.</p>
<h2>Divvy by the numbers</h2>
<p>The following numbers come from the Bill.com deck on the deal, which you can read <a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/404137088/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Bill.com-to-Acquire-Divvy-Presentation-Final.pdf">here</a>. Here are the core figures we care about:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;~$100 million annualized revenue,&#8221; calculated using the company&#8217;s March results multiplied by 12. That puts Divvy&#8217;s March, 2021 revenues at around $8.3 million.</li>
<li>&#8220;&gt;100% revenue growth YoY,&#8221; again calculated by leaning on the company&#8217;s March results. So, we can&#8217;t be sure that its full Q1 2021 growth was over the 100% mark. Still having its most recent Q1 month generate a three-figure growth rate is good. It also lets us know that the company did no more than $4 million or so in March 2020 revenue.</li>
<li>&#8220;~$4 billion annualized TPV,&#8221; or total payment volume. Again, this is a March number annualized.</li>
</ul>
<p>This lets us price the company somewhat. Divvy sold for around 25x its current revenue rate. That&#8217;s a software-level multiple, implying that the company has either incredibly strong gross margins, <em>or </em>Bill.com had to pay a multiples-premium to buy the company&#8217;s future growth today. I suspect the latter more than the former, but we&#8217;ll have to scout for more data when Divvy shows up in Bill.com results after the deal closes; that data is a few quarters away.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Succession is a major issue for many venture firms. Institutional investors, founders &#8212; even reporters &#8212; often get attached to senior members of a team, and when one of those individuals decides to hang up his or her cleats, it can be tricky for the rest of the partnership.</p>
<p>For its part, Emergence, a highly successful enterprise-focused venture firm, has been thinking about succession for at least the last decade, suggests Jason Green, who co-founded the outfit with Gordon Ritter and Brian Jacobs in the winter of 2002 and who says the team has long focused on hiring <a href="https://www.emcap.com/thoughts/living-our-values-why-jake-saper-is-now-a-general-partner-and-lotti/">younger investors</a> who can someday steward the firm.</p>
<p>That planning seems to be paying off. Emergence just yesterday revealed it has raised $950 million across <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/emergence-known-for-its-enterprise-bets-just-rounded-up-nearly-1-billion-across-two-new-funds/">two new funds</a>, and the firm&#8217;s backers committed that capital despite that Green &#8212; who has enjoyed a high profile &#8212; let them know he&#8217;s ready to move on to new endeavors. We talked with Green about that decision, and how other firms might do a better job of handing over the reins. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of your peers are starting to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/longtime-vc-todd-chaffee-of-ivp-says-late-stage-scene-is-now-ma-world/">segue out</a> of their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/report-bill-gurley-is-stepping-away/">longtime</a> venture roles, but a lot are sticking around. What was the impetus for you?</strong></p>
<p>JG: Well, I&#8217;m not leaving; I would say I&#8217;m transitioning to a different role. I&#8217;m still on eight boards and going to be actively involved in mentoring. But it&#8217;s the kind of thing we planned when we started the firm. We wanted to build an enduring franchise and grow from within and ultimately have the founders kind of step aside and let the next generation take over.</p>
<p>Gordon is obviously still fully engaged, but it felt like the right time [for me to do this]. The firm is in such a great position, and for me personally, I&#8217;ve been doing this for 30 years and I&#8217;ve achieved a lot &#8212; probably more than I expected, frankly &#8212; and I&#8217;m interested in having an impact in some other ways going forward. [Editor&#8217;s note: The firm&#8217;s third cofounder, Jacobs, left several years ago to launch a seed-stage fund called <a href="https://www.moai.vc/">Moai Capital</a>.]</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s the plan going forward?</strong></p>
<p>JG: I started a <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/823458443">family foundation</a> that&#8217;s going to be doing philanthropic work in a few areas of interest &#8212; climate change, ending mass incarceration, working on homelessness, working on educational opportunities for disadvantaged youth.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also excited to become an LP in emerging funds run by diverse managers. I&#8217;ve [invested in] half a dozen teams with African American leads or female leads or Latino leads, but while our industry has made some progress over the last, whatever, 10 to 15 years, it&#8217;s not nearly enough. [Helping them] is somewhere where I think I can move the needle. I&#8217;ve been at three venture firms and started one from scratch, so for me, in some ways I feel even more confident [in] coaching and mentoring other emerging managers than I do entrepreneurs.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Are you modeling your transition after anyone you know and admire?</strong></p>
<p>JG: A guy who has been a mentor of mine for many years is Russ Carson, who started [the private equity firm] Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe. He has kind of become a role model of what I&#8217;d like to do for the next phase of my career. He&#8217;s on the boards of The Rockefeller University and has funded charter schools and been really impactful in the community.</p>
<p>I definitely have interest in supporting the local community in the Bay Area, but I also think some of these [areas I&#8217;ll be focusing on] are almost global in scope, and part of [leaving Emergence] is having the freedom to just be curious and learn about things as I go, then figure out where where I can make a difference and have some fun along the way.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Did you and Gordon arm wrestle over who&#8217;d get to bounce first?Â </strong></p>
<p>JG: [Laughs.] Yeah, we&#8217;re around the same age. I think the difference is that I&#8217;ve been in the venture business 30 years and he&#8217;s been in the business 15 years; he really started in the venture business with Emergence and I think he&#8217;s totally jazzed to stay totally in the game for the foreseeable future [whereas] I&#8217;m ready to shift from hunting to farming.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Any advice for other firms that are contemplating how to handle succession?</strong></p>
<p>JG: We hired somebody every couple of years and we made the decision not to hire multiple people at the same level. We basically said, &#8216;Everybody that we hire in this firm can be successful long term here, and your job is to make other people around you successful. That&#8217;s the best way of ensuring your own success.&#8217; And so there was this shared sense of success and failure that I think that we institutionalize in the firm.</p>
<p>At a lot of firms, it&#8217;s a little bit more of an eat-what-you-kill kind of mentality. I think in the venture business that&#8217;s a little bit misplaced, because there&#8217;s so much luck involved in the business. You never know which partner is going to have that big home run. It can take 10 years to actually figure out what were the big wins [in a fund], so you&#8217;re going to judge somebody based on the deals they&#8217;ve done in the first two years or three years of the business? We tend to focus a lot more on the inputs than the outputs because the outputs are very variable and have a lot of uncertainty associated with them, but the inputs you can control.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What fun thing are going to pick up now that you&#8217;ll maybe have more time?Â </strong></p>
<p>JG: I&#8217;m trying to squeeze as much time as I can with my kids, who are juniors and senior in high school right now. They&#8217;ll be off to college soon and spending time with them is a priority, for sure. Health and wellness is also important and something that tends to take a backseat given how busy we all are, so that&#8217;s going to become more of a priority. But also just building and spending time with great friends and hopefully having more opportunities to create some great memories. I&#8217;ve no doubt my plate will be full.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The City of New York&#8217;s<a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=g8TmA5ZdGILa38ZKXUiorg==">Â lawsuit</a> against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/joco/">JOCO</a>, the docked electric bike-share service, hit a snag with the court Thursday, when it was denied temporary restraining order to end the company&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city alleges in the lawsuit field Wednesday that JOCO is operating illegally because all bike-sharing systems within the city require prior written authorization from the Department of Transportation. JOCO has argued that itâs not violating any laws since its docking stations are all on private property and thus outside the jurisdiction of the cityâs regulation. In late April, the city issued a cease-and-desist notice to JOCO, which the company ignored.Â </span></p>
<p>The court denied Thursday the city&#8217;s request to temporarily halt JOCO&#8217;s operations <span style="font-weight: 400;">in advance of a hearing scheduled for June 16.Â </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">âWe are pleased with the result in court today, and in the months ahead we will be expanding our operations to help New Yorkers with more mobility options as they return to work and begin to again enjoy the city as it re-opens and recovers from the pandemic,â said the co-founders of JOCO, Johnny Cohen and Jonny A. Cohen, in a statement.</span></p>
<p>JOCO launched 300 e-bikes at 30 stations around Manhattan in April, and said it plans to nearly triple that number by June. The company has partnerships with parking garages in the city, including the iconic Icon Parking, the city&#8217;s largest operator of private garages.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit filed this week, which includes a request to impose a civil penalty against JOCO of $5,000 for every day a violation occurs, specifies that Citi Bike, a subsidiary of Lyft, is the only company presently authorized by the DOT to operate a bike share in any of New Yorkâs five boroughs. The Citi Bike system, which launched in 2012 and has recorded more than 111 million trips, originated in a request for bike-share proposals from the department that would benefit the public, including mandated safety, service levels and maintenance standards, as well as privacy and consumer protections.Â </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why micromobility may emerge from the pandemic stronger than before&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/why-micromobility-is-poised-to-come-out-of-the-pandemic-stronger-than-before/embed/#?secret=NnpAhOIqiR" data-secret="NnpAhOIqiR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re committed to the highest safety standards,&#8221; the two Cohens told TechCrunch. &#8220;We have fleet management, we give free helmets to all our members. We are a responsible startup making sure we have all our bases covered in this regard, and to add onto that, we&#8217;re using a very reputable bike.&#8221;</p>
<p>A JOCO spokesperson declined further comment regarding the city&#8217;s justification for regulation and exclusivity with Citi Bike.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">â</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all live on top of each other in NYC,â </span><a href="https://twitter.com/LizKrueger/status/1389229189316947970"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> New York State Senator Liz Krueger in response to the lawsuit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. âOur street space requires thoughtful regulation to be functional and safe. Any transportation service that moves people in large numbers on the public right-of-way needs oversight, public accountability and to obey the laws that exist.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exclusive operations rights afforded Citi Bike are also an incentive for the investment of private capital needed to expand the system, according to language in the lawsuit. The cityâs contract with Lyft, which was most recently amended in 2020, includes an investment of $300 million to expand the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Lyft spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Itâs safe to say WhatsApp didnât have the ideal start to 2021. Less than a week into the new year, the Facebook-owned instant messaging app had already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">annoyed hundreds of thousands of users</a> with its scary worded notification about a planned policy update. The backlash grew fast and millions of people, including several high-profile figures, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">started to explore rival apps Signal and Telegram</a>.</p>
<p>Even governments, including India&#8217;s &#8212; WhatsApp&#8217;s biggest market by users &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/india-tells-court-to-block-whatsapps-policy-update-says-new-change-violates-laws/">expressed concerns</a>. (In the case of India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/india-antitrust-body-orders-investigation-into-whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes/">also an antitrust probe</a>.) The backlash prompted WhatsApp to offer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/following-backlash-whatsapp-to-roll-out-in-app-banner-to-better-explain-its-privacy-update/">a series of clarifications and assurances</a> to users, and it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">postponed the deadline</a> for enforcing the planned update by three months. Now with the May 15 deadline just a week away, we are able to quantify the real-world impact the aforementioned backlash had on WhatsAppâs user base: Nada.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users that WhatsApp has notified about the planned update in recent months have accepted the update, a WhatsApp spokesperson told TechCrunch. And the app continues to grow, added the spokesperson without sharing the exact figures. The company also didn&#8217;t share how many users it has notified about the planned update.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebookâs recent earnings call gives us some idea: The companyâs family of apps had 3.45 billion monthly active users as of March 31, 2021, up from 3.3 billion on December 31 and 3.21 billion on September 30.</p>
<p>Users who donât agree to the new terms, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/whatsapp-details-what-will-happen-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-privacy-changes/">TechCrunch has previously reported</a>, wonât lose access to their accounts or any feature on May 15, WhatsApp said. But after an unspecified number of weeks, such users will lose several core functionalities &#8212; though <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect">not at the same time</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weâll continue to provide reminders to those users within WhatsApp in the weeks to come,â the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>Since 2016, WhatsAppâs privacy policies have granted the service permission to share with Facebook certain metadata such as user phone numbers and device information.</p>
<p>The new terms allow Facebook and WhatsApp to share payment and transaction data in order to help them better target ads as the social juggernaut broadens its e-commerce offerings and looks to merge its messaging platforms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">real estate tech company </span><a href="https://www.compass.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forged ahead with its initial public offering and is now valued at several billions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/compass-ceo-hails-ipo-as-a-fundraising-event-amid-challenging-market/">At that time</a>, TechCrunch Senior Editor Alex Wilhelm caught up with founder and CEO </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RobReffkin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Reffkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to chat about his companyâs debut in the marketâs </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suddenly choppy waters for tech and tech-enabled debuts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, I caught up with Reffkin on a whole other topic: his path to entrepreneurship as a child raised by a disowned single mother whose father had died homeless. Reffkin is so passionate about inspiring others from nontraditional backgrounds to pursue their dreams that he wrote </span><a href="https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/No-One-Succeeds-Alone/9780358454618"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about it.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our discussion, Reffkin shared what he believes are the secrets to his success (hint: one of them involves lots of listening) and his advice for his young entrepreneurs, especially those from non-privileged backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: As the mother of a teen who is already trying to start his own business, I&#8217;m intrigued by your DJing as a teenager. What finally got you motivated to care about school and how did you manage to graduate in such a short amount of time?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reffkin: Well, I think your son might just be on the right track! Please give him a word of encouragement from me, from one entrepreneur to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mom says that a lot of other parents thought she was crazy for letting me launch my DJ business. But starting a successful DJ business in high school helped me learn about myself and my passion for entrepreneurship â and it ultimately helped me get into Columbia, forming the core of both my personal statement and the relationships I built with several members of the admissions team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe the first step is always to dream big. For me, my big dreams for my college future started on a trip to New York City. I toured Columbia and fell in love with it, but I knew it was going to be hard for me to get in. In fact, my high school guidance counselor said, âDonât even apply. It wouldnât be worth your time and money on the application fee.â In that moment, my desire to go to Columbia went from strong to absolute, because suddenly it felt like it was about something larger than myself â not just where I went to school, but about a broader struggle for opportunity for people like me. So I poured myself into my SAT prep to show that even though I had a C average, I had what it took to keep up at a top school. And thankfully, it paid off.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In high school and college, I was a C-student in part because I didnât see how studying calculus or Western Civilization related to my life or my dreams. I knew that excelling in school wasnât going to be the way I was going to distinguish myself in the world. At the same time, I was energized by my entrepreneurial efforts and my summer internships. I moved as quickly as I could to get through school and have my real life begin, because the real world made so much more sense to me.</span></p>

<p><b>TC: How do you think being raised by a single mother without privilege helped shape you as a man, and entrepreneur? How would you say being a person of color impacted your path?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reffkin: Growing up, it was just me and my mom. Sheâs an Israeli immigrant, disowned by her parents because I was Black. My father abandoned us and died, homeless, when I was young. What shaped me most as an entrepreneur was learning from my mother. She embodied the entrepreneurial spirit and taught me one of the most important principles: every time you get knocked down, youâve got to bounce back with passion. I saw her face bad relationships, bankruptcy and the stream of daily rejections that comes from being an agent. And she always bounced back. So when the world told me I couldnât do something or that I was destined to fail, I was ready for them. Thanks to my mom, I already knew how to bounce back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being Black and Jewish, Iâve felt out of place my entire life. In most classes in high school and college, I was the only Black person. In almost every meeting early in my career, I was the only Black person. When I was raising capital for Compass, I almost never saw someone Black on the other side of the table. But Iâve been very fortunate. Iâve been lucky to get terrific advice along the way from so many Black mentors, from the late Vernon Jordan, to Ken Chenault, the former CEO of American Express, to Bayo Ogunlesi, who is lead director for Goldman Sachs. Thereâs a really strong community of people whoâve all supported each other.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: You&#8217;ve had some impressive mentors over the years. How did those relationships develop? How have they been valuable besides the obvious?Â </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reffkin: Growing up, I was hungry for advice. Coming from a single-parent home, I looked for guidance and wisdom on how to create a better life wherever I could find it. My mom connected me to several nonprofits when I was in high school that helped open my eyes to how much opportunity and support there was out there in the world.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important lesson Iâve learned in my life is that feedback is a gift. Even when itâs hard to hear, feedback is a gift. My relationships with many of my mentors deepened because I started asking them for really tough, candid feedback â the sort of things they thought other people wouldnât tell me. And then, Iâd actually take their advice, apply it in my life and let them know how it had helped me. That did two things: First, it led to more honest and practical advice that helped me get better faster. Second, it made the people who had given me advice feel far more invested in my success and the success of what I was working on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other thing my mentors gave me was the sense that even though the world was telling me I couldnât be successful, I could be. Meeting someone like Vernon Jordan who advised presidents and CEOs alike, had a profound impact on me. He was a father figure to me. I met him when I was 23 years old, and at that time, it wasnât clear to me that you could be successful in the business world as a Black man. I just hadnât seen it before. When I started at Lazard, Vernon Jordan was the only other Black investment banker there. He was not just a senior partner, he was a legend, widely known for serving on more Fortune 500 boards than anyone in history. He took a strong interest in me, and with his support and advice, he made me feel like I belonged and helped me see a path where I could be as successful as I wanted to be.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I founded a nonprofit in my twenties called America Needs You that has provided mentorship, career development and college support to thousands of students. I wrote my new book, &#8220;</span><a href="http://noonesucceedsalonebook.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No One Succeeds Alone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; as a way to pay it forward by making the lessons Iâve been fortunate enough to learn from so many remarkable people available to everyone â and itâs why Iâm donating all of my proceeds to nonprofits that help young people realize their dreams.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: What advice would you give to young, aspiring entrepreneurs, especially those from non-privileged backgrounds?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reffkin: Hereâs the advice Iâd give to someone from an underrepresented group who just graduated college and is in their first job:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Donât let anyone get in the way of your dream. Not society, not your colleagues, not even yourself. Whenever anyone tells you to slow down, speed up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) Spend the next 10 years learning as much as you can from the smartest people you can. Find mentors in your job and outside that will give you the honest feedback that others wonât. Feedback is a gift. Itâll be hard for you to hear, but itâs actually even harder for them to give it to you. So you may have to ask for it directly and let people know that you can take it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3) Learn how to turn negativity into positive energy that fuels you. There will always be skeptics, doubters and haters telling you that you canât do something or that you donât belong.Â </span></p>
<p><b>TC: What&#8217;s next after Compass?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reffkin: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe that to be truly successful, you canât have a Plan B. As a CEO, you have to be all-in, and thatâs what I am for Compass: 100% dedicated to our 23,000 agents and employees. One of my mentors told me about the âshower testâ once â that if youâre not excited enough about your job to think about it in the shower, youâre probably not in the right job. And Iâll tell you: Iâm so passionate about the company weâre building that Iâm still thinking about Compass in the shower. At Compass, weâve accomplished much in the past eight years, but weâre truly just getting started.Â </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What would have been a celebratory earnings call in just about any other quarter ended on a somber note today, as Peloton CEO John Foley kicked things off with an apology.</p>
<p>âWe are a members-first organization,â the executive stated. âAnd that means for all of us at Peloton, the safety of our member community comes first. I want to be clear, though. Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commissionâs Request that we recall our Tread+ product. We should have been more open to a productive dialogue with them from the outset.â</p>
<p>The tone marks something of a 180, from the company that pushed back against CPSC statements last month, when Foley said the company was âtroubledâ by the commissionâs âinaccurate and misleadingâ filings. Yesterday, Peloton and the CPSC issued a joint announcement of a voluntary recall for the Tread+ product, which has been linked with 72 reported incidents, including 29 injuries to children and one death.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Peloton apologizes, agrees to treadmill recall&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-apologizes-agrees-to-treadmill-recall/embed/#?secret=aFpFXAP1O1" data-secret="aFpFXAP1O1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company also agreed to an additional recall for the lower-cost Tread, which thus far has only officially launched in Canada and the U.K., with availability to âselect usersâ in the U.S. The recall will result in a delayed launch of the product in the States.</p>
<p>The issue, while potentially serious, has thus far amounted to far less than the Tread+âs belt issues. âWhile the new Tread as been well received, there have been some minor quality issues related to how the tablet console is attached to the Tread,â Foley explained. âThe touchscreen attaches to the tread with screws. In a handful of cases, weâve had reports of the screws loosening, causing the console to detach from the unit.â</p>
<p>While the company reported more excellent financial news, amid strong lockdown home fitness growth and a loosening of the supply chain constraints that hampered delivery early on the pandemic, the massive recall had an almost instantaneous impact on the companyâs stock price. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-stock-crashes-following-recalls-security-report/">Alex noted late yesterday</a> a 13.6% dip in shares.</p>

<p>Following Foleyâs presentation, CFO Jill Woodworth laid out the expected impact to company revenue. âWe estimate the revenue impact of Tread and Tread+ recall will be approximately $165 million,â the executive noted.</p>
<p>The figures include $105 million for ending deliveries on the impacted products. The offer of a full refund on the products will hit the companyâs return reserves next quarter to the tune of $50 million, while the decision to waive three months of monthly fees for the All Access subscription to Tread and Tread+ users will make up the remaining $10 million. The company says it will continue to produce content while the CPSC evaluates the product.</p>
<p>The company is working on a hardware fix to the Treadâs dislodging tablet. Foley says the process generally takes six to eight weeks, but could take longer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunchâs biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello friends, welcome to Daily Crunch, where we bring you the dayâs most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.</p>
<p>The fintech world is front and center today, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/chime-has-agreed-to-stop-using-the-word-bank-after-a-california-regulator-pushed-back/">big news from Chime</a> lighting up the analytics boards here at TechCrunch. But we also explored impressive earnings from fintech giants today, asking ourselves how much market the PayPals and Squares of the world <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/how-much-product-room-will-fintech-giants-leave-for-startups/">will leave for startups as they build ever-broader product sets</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The answer could matter for more than just the buy-now-pay-later world, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">hot startup category in recent quarters</a>. We donât buy into the idea of hard kill-zones around the biggest tech companies, but all the same, the competitive fintech landscape is changing. Especially in emerging markets, where startup activity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/payments-lending-and-neobanks-rule-fintechs-in-emerging-markets-report-says/">has been blistering</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, if you reply to this email I will receive the note directly in my inbox. Feel free to say hi!</p>

<h2>When is a neobank not a bank?</h2>
<p>Fintech darling Chime <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/chime-has-agreed-to-stop-using-the-word-bank-after-a-california-regulator-pushed-back/">has agreed to not refer to itself as a bank</a> after running afoul of California regulators. As TechCrunch reported, Chime has <em>mostly</em> avoided calling itself a bank. In a televised interview, for example, as <a href="https://twitter.com/cookie?lang=en">Connie</a> wrote, its CEO, Chris Britt, said that his company is âmore like a consumer software company than a bank.â</p>
<p>Sure. Anyway, we arenât going to stop calling Chime a neobank, because thatâs what it is. Weâll leave the linguistic nuance to the regulators.</p>
<p>The dustup with the Cali powers isnât itself a huge deal, but it does underscore how Chime and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/which-neobanks-will-rise-or-fall/">myriad global competitors</a> are <em>not</em> in too much hot water with governments. Ask yourself: When was the last time you saw Chime in the news for misbehaving? Now, repeat the same experiment with, say, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">Robinhood</a>? Totally different, right?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/building-a-fintech-giant-is-very-expensive/">neobank game is expensive</a>, but potentially lucrative. Chime is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability/">generating positive EBITDA</a>, for example. Thatâs a fancy way of saying that it no longer burns much, if any, cash. Something that Uber and Lyft are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/ubers-mixed-q1-earnings-portray-an-evolving-business/">still struggling to do</a>.</p>
<h2>Startups and venture capital</h2>
<p>Weâll get into a host of startup funding rounds shortly, but first I want to talk business models. Namely the evolution of SaaS. SaaS is just a fancy way of saying âmodern software,â of course; the sort of stuff you pay a regular fee to use, and someone else hosts and delivers to your browser.</p>
<p>SaaS became the de facto startup business model some time ago. Why? Itâs lucrative with strong revenue quality (high gross margins) and dependable (recurring) incomes. But in recent quarters, thereâs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/whats-driving-api-powered-startups-forward-in-2020/">been a shift</a> toward <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">more <em>on-demand</em> pricing</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/investors-founders-report-hot-market-for-api-startups/">hereâs the investor perspective</a>). Which is like SaaS, but potentially even better.</p>
<p>And the trend away from SaaS toward on-demand is not slowing. For example, I chatted with Twilioâs CFO yesterday. Despite having bought some more SaaSy companies lately, he said that his company will keep its center of gravity in the on-demand world. Weâre not surprised, but it was a data point worth sharing. (More on this below.)</p>
<p>Now, the dayâs hottest funding rounds:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/personal-skin-problems-leads-founder-to-launch-skincare-startup-noie-raises-12m-series-a/">Personal skin problems lead founder to launch skincare startup NÃ¸ie, raises $12M Series A </a>&#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher">Mikeâs</a> coverage of NÃ¸ie is notable for two reasons. First, because itâs fun to write âÃ¸,â and second, because the skin care market is <em>massive</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/bitski-raises-19-million-from-a16z-to-become-the-shopify-for-nfts/">Bitski raises $19 million from a16z to become the âShopify for NFTsâ</a> &#8212; Either NFTs are going to be with us forever and venture bets like this one are brilliant, or NFTs wonât provide durable consumer value, and the current rage is merely a passing kerfuffle. Investors are placing their bets.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/from-bootstrapped-to-a-2-1b-valuation-recharge-raises-227m-in-growth-capital/">From bootstrapped to a $2.1B valuation, ReCharge raises $227M for subscription management platform</a> &#8212; Look, SaaS is evolving, but that doesnât mean that itâs going away. As <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann</a> reports, the company&#8217;s software âis designed to give e-commerce merchants a way to offer and manage subscriptions for physical products.â Cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/metafy-adds-5-5m-to-its-seed-round-as-the-market-for-games-coaching-grows/">Metafy adds $5.5M to its seed round as the market for games coaching grows</a> &#8212; I wrote this one. Metafy is building a marketplace for game coaching. But donât think that itâs just an esports play. Metafy has a much broader vision.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/lightmatters-photonic-ai-ambitions-light-up-an-80m-b-round/">Lightmatterâs photonic AI ambitions light up an $80M B round</a> &#8212; This round is a bit outside my domain expertise (I have none), so Iâll let Devin explain: âLightmatter plans to leapfrog Mooreâs law with its ultrafast photonic chips specialized for AI work, and with a new $80 million round, the company is poised to take its light-powered computing to market.â If that works, bring on the future!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Freemium isnât a trend â itâs the future of SaaS</h2>
<p>While we adopted new pandemic habits like rearranging house plants to create pleasing Zoom backgrounds and having groceries delivered, top SaaS companies also tried something new â offering their products for free or at deep discounts.</p>
<p>Because many enterprises had to make snap decisions to digitize their operations, decision-makers were averse to making long-term plans. As a result, companies like Shopify, GoDaddy and GitHub roiled out free, free-trial and low-priced offerings aimed at end users.</p>
<p>Freemium conversion and expansion is here to stay, says Kyle Poyar, VP of Growth at VC firm OpenView. &#8220;The merits of launching a free plan should no longer need to be debated,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead, more companies should be asking: Are we giving enough away for free?&#8221;</p>

<h2><strong>The tech giantsÂ </strong></h2>
<p>Letâs talk about Google. Namely its Chromebook push. Anyone who recalls the UMPC boom, or even the ill-fated netbook phenom, could have been forgiven for dismissing Chromebooks. After all, they were nearly the same idea. But, unlike their predecessors, Chromebooks are kinda working? TechCrunch reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/chromebook-shipments-grew-275-in-q1/">earlier this week</a> that Chromebook sales were up 257% in Q1, for example. And today Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/google-reveals-a-slate-of-chromebook-docks-as-it-pushes-to-appeal-to-enterprise-users/">dropped some docks</a> to try and get big companies to buy Chromebooks? For work? The latter bit makes no sense to me, though I will heartily admit that as far as couch computers go, Chromebooks are amazing.</p>
<p>Today, instead of another item or two from another Big Tech conglomerate, weâre turning to China. Recall that the Chinese Communist Party is in the process of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/china-s-crackdown-will-shake-up-world-s-largest-fintech-market">cutting its fintech sector to a smaller size.</a> The countryâs tech industry seems to be in a general retreat as the government works to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/16/chinas-big-tech-crackdown-not-model-us">assert more control</a> over its operations and influence.</p>
<p>Weâll see what impact that has on venture capital numbers over time. But thereâs news from the country that matters to you and me. First, Chinese EV company Nio &#8212; which <a href="https://www.nio.com/formulae/">also has a Formula E team</a> &#8212; is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/chinese-ev-maker-nio-is-stepping-outside-of-china-for-the-first-time/">starting to sell cars in another country</a>. A first. Norway, you win! And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/china-expresses-concern-over-its-absence-in-indias-5g-trials/">China is irked</a> that India is not allowing Chinese companies to compete for a piece of its 5G hardware market. I am surprised that China is making noise about the matter, because after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/india-bans-another-43-chinese-apps/">India banned apps from its companies</a>, you would imagine that it would take a similar stance toward hardware that many countries eschew over security concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple&#8217;<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">s new AirTag item trackers are pretty small, but not </span><em style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">quite</em><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> small enough to slip into most wallets without adding an obvious bit of bulk.</span></p>
<p>Fortunately, as one talented AirTag owner has found, that&#8217;s nothing you can&#8217;t fix with a heat gun, a bit of soldering and an understanding that you could totally fry your shiny new AirTag in the blink of an eye. Oh, and a 3D printer.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rHyAAkf5tE">Andrew Ngai</a> realized that much of AirTag&#8217;s thickness came from its PCB and its battery being stacked atop each other, he set out to instead arrange them side-by-side. With the help of some <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50145/airtag-teardown-part-one-yeah-this-tracks">iFixit guides</a> (which, by the way, provide an awesome peek inside the AirTag if you&#8217;re curious what&#8217;s in there but aren&#8217;t looking to dissect one yourself), Andrew tore the AirTag down to its key components. After making sure everything still worked in its freshly disassembled state, he 3D printed a new case, soldered in wires to connect the board to the battery at a distance, and put everything back together. Success! And he did it all within just days of AirTag being released.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While this sort of project requires a pretty broad set of skills to pull off, Andrew has kindly handled one of the steps for anyone looking to take it on: he&#8217;s uploaded the STL file for the 3D-printed card holder as a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4850601">free download on Thingiverse</a>.Â <em>(Or you could, of course, just buy a Tile Slim. But that doesn&#8217;t involve soldering irons and 3D printing, so where&#8217;s the fun in that?)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1385527493931593728">confirmed earlier reports</a> that itâs testing a new Tip Jar feature.

<p>âTip Jar is an easy way to support the incredible voices that make up the conversation on Twitter,â the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-tip-jar.html">wrote in a blog post</a> confirming the news. âThis is a first step in our work to create new ways for people to receive and show support on Twitter &#8212; with money.â</p>

<p>Currently available on both iOS and Android, the feature is designed to give users a way to quickly tip creators with a few taps. Tip Jar is beginning to roll out to select groups of users, including nonprofits, journalists, experts and creators. The company has further plans to roll it out to additional groups and languages.</p>
<p>For now, those using Twitter in English will be able to send a tip. Those profiles that have enabled it will show the Tip Jar icon on their profile page to the left of the Follow button. Hitting that will show a list of the aforementioned third-party money transfer apps. The opt-in feature will pop up in the mobile app, letting qualified users choose which payment platforms they&#8217;ll accept.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">David Swensen, among the most highly regarded money managers in the world after growing Yaleâs endowment from $1 billion when he joined as a 31-year-old former grad student of the school, to the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/the-short-list-college/articles/10-universities-with-the-biggest-endowments">second-largest</a> school endowment in the country after Harvard, has passed away at age 67. The cause was cancer, which Swensen had been battling since first being diagnosed in 2012.</p>
<p>The news is likely sending shockwaves and sadness throughout endowment offices, many of which closely followed the moves of Swensen, who famously pulled the school into non-traditional asset classes like hedge funds, private equity, venture funds and real estate.</p>
<p>Many endowment heads learned from working with him directly, in fact. As a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-swensen-yale-endowment-chief-who-changed-the-course-of-institutional-investing-dies-at-67-11620305438?mod=hp_lead_pos11">WSJ piece</a> about his death notes, Princeton&#8217;s endowment chief for the past 26 years, Andrew Golden, spent five years as a senior associate in Yale&#8217;s investment office in the 1980s, yet it helped him form a blueprint for his career. As he told the outlet in 2017, &#8220;90% of my good ideas on how to organize the office and develop a culture Iâve stolen from Yale.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania, Bowdoin College, Wesleyan University and MIT also recruited Swensen protÃ©gÃ©s over the years. Robert Wallace, who has headed up the Stanford Management Company since 2015, is another former Yale investment manager.</p>
<p>As wealth management recruiter <a href="https://www.davidbarrettpartners.com/">David Barrett</a> told the WSJ in 2015, when hiring an investment chief, wealthy universities often asked the same question, which was: &#8220;Is there anyone at Yale?&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hL2VGpdTGX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/yale-may-have-just-turned-institutional-investing-on-its-head-with-a-new-diversity-edict/">Yale may have just turned institutional investing on its head with a new diversity edict</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Yale may have just turned institutional investing on its head with a new diversity edict&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/yale-may-have-just-turned-institutional-investing-on-its-head-with-a-new-diversity-edict/embed/#?secret=hL2VGpdTGX" data-secret="hL2VGpdTGX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Even as he battled cancer, Swensen was pushing Yale forward in new directions. In 2018, despite, or because of, extreme volatility in the world of cryptocurrencies, he approved investments in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/yale-investment-chief-david-swensen-jumps-into-crypto-with-bets-on-two-silicon-valley-funds.html">two then-new crypto funds</a>: the inaugural crypto fund of Andreessen Horowitz and the debut fund of Paradigm, co-founded by the co-founder of Coinbase, Fred Ehrsam, and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang. Yale was among the first schools of its stature to make such a bet.</p>
<p>In a separate but meaningful decision that&#8217;s expected to have lasting impact on the broader industry, Swensen last fall told the firms that manage Yale&#8217;s money that they risked losing the school&#8217;s backing if they didn&#8217;t hire more women and minorities into their ranks &#8212; and keep them there.</p>
<p>It was a decision that was years in the making, Swensen suggested, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yales-david-swensen-puts-money-managers-on-notice-about-diversity-11603450800">telling the Journal</a> that he&#8217;d held off on any kind of systematic effort relating to diversity because he long believed there existed an insufficient pipeline of diverse candidates; he said the Black Lives Matter movement helped him to recognize that far more needed to be done &#8212; and that Yale could do nothing or that it could be part of the solution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Of the 22 million comments submitted to the FCC regarding 2017&#8217;s controversial rollback of net neutrality, some 18 million were fake, <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-issues-report-detailing-millions-fake-comments-revealing">an investigation by the New York Attorney General&#8217;s office has found</a>. The broadband industry funded the fraudulent creation of about 8.5 million of those, while a 19-year-old college student submitted 7.7 million, and the remainder came from unknown but spurious sources.</p>
<p>The damning report, issued today, is the result of years of work; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/29/new-yorks-attorney-general-sets-up-a-page-to-report-fraudulent-fcc-comments/">it set up a tip line</a> early on so people could report fraudulent comments, and no doubt received plenty, as people were already independently finding themselves, dead relatives and other obviously fake submissions among the record.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jatRF2FdeI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/18/more-dead-commenters-appear-to-come-out-against-net-neutrality/">More dead commenters appear to come out against net neutrality</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;More dead commenters appear to come out against net neutrality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/18/more-dead-commenters-appear-to-come-out-against-net-neutrality/embed/#?secret=jatRF2FdeI" data-secret="jatRF2FdeI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It turns out that a huge number of these comments were paid for by a consortium of broadband companies called Broadband for America, which laid out about $4.2 million for the purpose. They contracted with several &#8220;lead generator&#8221; companies, the kind of shady operations that offer you free trials of &#8220;male enhancement pills&#8221; or the like if you fill out a form â in this case, asking the person to write an anti-net-neutrality comment.</p>
<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t bad enough, the lead-generation companies didn&#8217;t even bother plying their shady trade in what passes for an honest way; instead they fabricated the lists and comments with years-old data and, in one case, with identities stolen in a major data breach. The practice was near universal:</p>
<blockquote><p>In all, six lead generators funded by the broadband industry engaged in fraud. As a result, nearly every comment and message the broadband industry submitted to the FCC and Congress was fake, signed using the names and addresses of millions of individuals without their knowledge or consent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The broadband companies are off the hook on a technicality, since they were careful to firewall themselves from the practices of those they were contracting with, even though the record shows it was plain that the information being collected and used was fraudulent. But because the actions were, ostensibly, independently taken by the enterprising lead generators, the buck stops there.</p>

<p>Notably, these scams were also involved in more than a hundred other advocacy campaigns, including submitting over a million fake comments for an EPA proceeding and millions of other letters and digital comments.</p>
<p>The wholesale undermining of the processes of government earned fines of $3.7 million, $550,000 and $150,000 for Fluent Inc., React2Media and Opt-Intelligence, respectively. There are also &#8220;comprehensive reforms&#8221; imposed on them, though it may be best not to expect much from those.</p>
<p>Internet rights advocacy organization Fight for the Future <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2021-05-06-fight-for-the-future-group-who-originally-exposed/">issued a king-size &#8220;I told you so&#8221;</a> noting that they had flagged this process at the time and helped bring it to the attention of both government officials and ordinary folks.</p>
<p>Another 7.7 million fake comments were submitted by a single person, a California college student who simply combined a fake name generation site with disposable email service to provide plausible identities. The person automated an individual comment submission process, and somehow the FCC&#8217;s systems didn&#8217;t flag it. Another unknown person used similar means to submit another 1.6 million fake comments.</p>

<p>Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement that &#8220;Todayâs report demonstrates how the record informing the FCCâs net neutrality repeal was flooded with fraud. This was troubling at the time because even then the widespread problems with the record were apparent. We have to learn from these lessons and improve because the public deserves an open and fair opportunity to tell Washington what they think about the policies that affect their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, at the time, Rosenworcel<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/schneiderman-delay-fcc-vote/"> suggested delaying the vote</a>, joining many in the country who felt the scale of the shenanigans warranted further investigation â but then-Chairman Ajit Pai brushed aside their concerns, one of many decisions that have considerably tarnished his legacy.</p>
<p>Altogether it&#8217;s a pretty sad situation, and the broadband companies and their lobbyists get off without so much as a slap on the wrist. The NY AG report has a variety of recommendations, some of which no doubt have already been implemented or suggested as the FCC&#8217;s comment debacle became clear, but the bad guys definitely won this time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Orbital launch company Virgin Orbit has scheduled its next mission to space.</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit will be returning its LauncherOne rocket to orbit in June to deliver payloads for the U.S. Department of Defense Space Test Program, SatRevolution and the Royal Netherlands Air Force.</p>
<p>The manifest includes three CubeSat satellites as part of the DoDâs Rapid Agile Launch Initiative; a CubeSat satellite called BRIK II, Norwayâs first military satellite to go to space; and two optical imaging satellites from SatRevolution for Earth observation. DoD awarded the launch to Virgin Orbit&#8217;s defense-focused subsidiary VOX Space last April.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LauncherOne will take its payload to a target orbit of around 310 miles above Earth.</p>
<p>This will be LauncherOneâs first take-off since a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/virgin-orbit-reaches-orbit-for-the-first-time/">demonstration mission in January</a>, during which the LauncherOne carried satellites to low Earth orbit on behalf of NASA. That most recent demonstration was the first time Virgin Orbit proved that its unique hybrid aircraft/orbital rocket system actually works. The first try, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/25/virgin-orbits-first-orbital-test-flight-cut-short-after-rocket-released-from-carrier-aircraft/">which took place in May</a> of last year, ended after the rocket initiated an automatic safety shutdown after detaching from the Boeing 747 that takes it to launch altitude.</p>

<p>The mission will be conducted from the Mojave Air and Space Port in California on a yet-to-be-announced date in June. The rocket will be shipped out to the Mojave site âin the coming daysâ for prelaunch operations, the company said. Virgin Orbit will offer a public livestream of the mission on its website.</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit is part of a small cohort of private orbital launch companies that have actually sent payloads to space. As opposed to providers like SpaceX, which uses massive rockets similar to legacy designs from agencies like NASA, LauncherOne is essentially a 747 thatâs been retrofitted with a rocket. Besides being smaller and able to take off from traditional airplane runways, the 747 saves on costs by being completely reusable.</p>
<p>Virgin Orbit was spun out of Virgin Galactic in 2017, with the latter focusing exclusively on commercial human spaceflight services. In homage to its beginnings as a humble record company, the mission has been christened âTubular Bells, Part One,â so named after the first track on the first album ever released by Virgin Records.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio has chosen Norway â an EV hotspot â for its first foray into international markets. Nio Norway will offer a European version of ES8, Nio&#8217;s flagship electric SUV, to Norwegian customers from September this year. The ET7 sedan will follow in 2022.</p>
<p>âThe decision to have Norway as our first destination overseas is backed by long-term thinking,â Nio founder William Li explained at an event Thursday. âNorway is the most EV-friendly company.â Among the European countries, Norway is the biggest adopter of battery electric vehicles. The company&#8217;s relationship with Norway stretches back to 2018 when Norges Bank, the country&#8217;s sovereign fund, gave the automaker âcritical supportâ during its initial public offering, Li said at the event. Nio signed a strategic partnership agreement with the Norwegian EV Association, also in 2018.</p>
<p>That high EV adoption rate also means Nio will be making its pitch to a growing consumer base of savvy EV owners. In Norway, Nio will face competition from Chinese automakers like XPeng, international rivals Tesla and European automakers such as Volkswagen and Audi.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to vehicle sales, the company also detailed plans to open dedicated service centers, vehicle charging stations and its Nio Power Swap battery swapping stations in Norway. The company aims to build four battery swapping stations around Oslo by the end of 2021, with additional swapping stations coming to the Norwegian cities Bergen, Trondheim, Stavanger and Kristiansand in 2022. Nio&#8217;s Norway team is composed of around 15 people, but that number is expected to grow to around 50 by the end of 2021, according to the company.</p>
<p>The Chinese automaker has had a slow start since its founding in 2014, but started gaining ground in the second half of 2020 through the latest quarter. Nio <a href="https://ir.nio.com/node/8156/pdf">reported deliveries</a> of 20,060 vehicles in the first quarter, a 422.7% jump from the same period last year when COVID-19 was busy upending the economy on a global scale. Sales in the first quarter of 2021 were also 15.6% higher from the fourth quarter. It has delivered 102,000 vehicles to date. These deliveries helped the company increase its vehicle sales by 489% compared to the first quarter of 2019.</p>

<p>Still, Nio is losing money, albeit the gap between revenues and net loss continues to narrow.</p>
<p>The boost in sales was likely due in part to the January debut of the ET7, its flagship electric sedan and the first vehicle model to be fitted with its so-called &#8220;Nio Autonomous Driving&#8221; software. The company has been an outlier when it comes to charging, adopting a battery-swap option in addition to traditional plug and charge stations. Nio has already completed more than 2.4 million swaps for Chinese users, Li said &#8212; a number thatâs growing by 10,000 every day. Last August, the company also debuted its âbattery-as-a-serviceâ purchasing option, which allows drivers to lease the battery from the company and only purchase the vehicle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Months after Apple&#8217;s App Store <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">introduced privacy labels for apps</a>, Google announced its own mobile app marketplace, Google Play, will follow suit. The company today <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">pre-announced its plans</a> to introduce a new &#8220;safety&#8221; section in Google Play, rolling out next year, which will require app developers to share what sort of data their apps collect, how it&#8217;s stored and how it&#8217;s used.</p>
<p>For example, developers will need to share what sort of personal information their apps collect, like users&#8217; names or emails, and whether it collects information from the phone, like the user&#8217;s precise location, their media files or contacts. Apps will also need to explain how the app uses that information &#8212; for example, for enhancing the app&#8217;s functionality or for personalization purposes.</p>
<p>Developers who already adhere to specific security and privacy practices will additionally be able to highlight that in their app listing. On this front, Google says it will add new elements that detail whether the app uses security practices like data encryption; if the app follows Google&#8217;s<a href="https://developer.android.com/google-play/guides/families"> Families policy</a>, related to child safety; if the app&#8217;s safety section has been verified by an independent third party; whether the app needs data to function or allows users to choose whether or not to share data; and whether the developer agrees to delete user data when a user uninstalls the app in question.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps will also be required to provide their privacy policies.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lzL5O3fQlh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/building-customer-first-relationships-in-a-privacy-first-world-is-critical/">Building customer-first relationships in a privacy-first world is critical</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Building customer-first relationships in a privacy-first world is critical&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/building-customer-first-relationships-in-a-privacy-first-world-is-critical/embed/#?secret=lzL5O3fQlh" data-secret="lzL5O3fQlh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While clearly inspired by Apple&#8217;s privacy labels, there are several key differences. Apple&#8217;s labels focus on what data is being collected for tracking purposes and what&#8217;s linked to the end user. Google&#8217;s additions seem to be more about whether or not you can <em>trust</em> the data being collected is being handled responsibility, by allowing the developer to showcase if they follow best practices around data security, for instance. It also gives the developer a way to make a case for why it&#8217;s collecting data right on the listing page itself. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Apple&#8217;s &#8220;ask to track&#8221; pop-ups on iOS</a> now force developers to beg inside their apps for access user data.)</p>
<p>Another interesting addition is that Google will allow the app data labels to be independently verified. Assuming these verifications are handled by trusted names, they could help to convey to users that the disclosures aren&#8217;t lies. One early criticism of Apple&#8217;s privacy labels was that many were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/29/apple-privacy-nutrition-label/">providing inaccurate information</a> &#8212; and were getting away with it, too.</p>
<p>Google says the new features will not roll out until Q2 2022, but it wanted to announce now in order to give developers plenty of time to prepare.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148631" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148631" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2148631" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="358" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=768,404 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=1536,809 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-06-at-12.25.23-PM.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148631" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>There is, of course, a lot of irony to be found in an app privacy announcement from Google.</p>
<p>The company was one of the longest holdouts on issuing privacy labels for its own iOS apps, as it scrambled to review (and re-review, we understand) the labels&#8217; content and disclosures. After initially claiming its labels would roll out &#8220;soon,&#8221; many of Google&#8217;s top apps then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/google-restarts-updates-for-some-ios-apps-after-long-pause-triggered-by-lack-of-privacy-labels/">entered a lengthy period where they received no updates at all</a>, as they were no longer compliant with App Store policies.</p>
<p>It took Google months after the deadline had passed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/06/google-apps-privacy-label-updates/">provide labels for its top apps</a>. And when it did, it was mocked by critics &#8212; like <a href="https://twitter.com/DuckDuckGo/status/1371509053613084679">privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo</a> &#8212; for how much data apps like Chrome and the Google app collect.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s plan to add a safety section of its own to Google Play gives it a chance to shift the narrative a bit.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a privacy push, necessarily. They&#8217;re not even called privacy labels! Instead, the changes seem designed to allow app developers to better explain if you can trust their app with your data, rather than setting the expectation that the app should not be collecting data in the first place.</p>
<p>How well this will resonate with consumers remains to be seen. Apple has made a solid case that it&#8217;s a company that cares about user privacy, and is adding features that put users in control of their data. It&#8217;s a hard argument to fight back against &#8212; especially in an era that&#8217;s seen too many data breaches to count, careless handling of private data by tech giants, widespread government spying and a creepy adtech industry that grew to feel entitled to user data collection without disclosure.</p>
<p>Google says when the changes roll out, non-compliant apps will be required to fix their violations or become subject to policy enforcement. It hasn&#8217;t yet detailed how that process will be handled, or whether it will pause app updates for apps in violation.</p>
<p>The company noted its own apps would be required to share this same information and a privacy policy, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Battlefield is one of the most popular parts of our annual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt conference</a>Â which is happening on September 21-23 this year. Now we&#8217;re very excited to reveal one of the fine people who will be judging Startup Battlefield at this year&#8217;s all-virtual event in September: Shauntel Garvey, a general partner at Reach Capital, a VC specializing in the world of education technology.</p>
<p>Startup Battlefield sees startups applying far and wide for a chance to pitch their ideas to a panel, and to all of us in the audience, giving the finalists a lot of exposure and a shot at winning the grand prize of $50,000. Startups: You can <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply to be a part of the action here</a>.</p>
<p>Edtech has seen a huge surge of interest in the last year of pandemic living, and that&#8217;s led to a pretty notable rise in education startups, more funding for education technology and a lot more attention paid to voices in edtech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s because not only is edtech of huge importance to society and our economy, but those in the field have picked up a lot of learnings that apply well outside of edtech.</p>
<p>They know firsthand about engagement and how to get it; connecting with larger ecosystems of stakeholders; learning to work with public and private bodies; and the ins and outs of tapping into the latest innovations in areas like streaming, artificial intelligence and graphics to get the most out of a concept.</p>
<p>All of this makes Garvey a great person to have as a judge, someone with specific-area knowledge but very aware of how it relates to the wider challenges and opportunities in tech.</p>
<p>Garvey is a co-founder and general partner at Reach Capital, a Silicon Valley VC focused on the wider opportunity within the educational spectrum, backing the likes of ClassDojo, Springboard, Outschool, Handshake, Winnie and <a href="https://www.reachcapital.com/companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more</a>. Garvey herself currently sits on the boards of Riipen, FourthRev, Holberton School and Ellevation Education.</p>
<p>Her experience in edtech extends back years. Before Reach, she was a partner at the NewSchools Seed Fund and she has invested in more than 40 early-stage edtech companies, including Newsela, Nearpod and SchoolMint. She is also not all about edtech: Before turning to education and startups, Garvey trained and worked as a chemical engineer. We&#8217;re really looking forward to her input as a Startup Battlefield judge.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t gotten your tickets yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> is coming up around the corner, September 21-23. This will be our second year of having the conference in an all-virtual format, and we have a lot of great speakers, networking opportunities and other things planned &#8212; free of physical constraints, we can fly! &#8212; and we really hope you&#8217;ll join us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chromebooks have been having banner quarter after banner quarter for the past year. While PC and tablet sales in general have been doing well as people shifted to remote working and learning, Googleâs operating system has been leading the charge, in terms of the growth. Thatâs due in large part to the companyâs wins in education.</p>
<p>With an extremely solid foothold in that category, Google is pushing to make a big play in enterprise &#8212; a category traditionally dominated by Microsoft (and, to a lesser degree, Apple). Today the company is announcing the launch of a new series of docks as part of the Works With Chromebook certification program it launched last year.</p>
<p>Launch partners including Targus, Belkin, Acer and Hyper. The hope is pretty clear: making the traditionally limited hardware more capable for a work setting. There are two different types of docks &#8212; one designed for remote working and the other for office/enterprise. Per Google:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Employees can benefit from two types of docks: larger docks capable of extending up to 3 external displays via HDMI, DP or USB-C, and smaller docks that extend to one external HDMI display for those in need of a more compact, travel-friendly docking solution.</p></blockquote>
<p>More details are forthcoming from the third parties, which will be releasing the devices âin the coming months.â The Hyper system (pictured at top of the post), for instance, launches in August for $240, which put it around as much as some Chromebooks.</p>
<p>Among the upshots are the fact that these will also be compatible with PCs and Macs, to some degree &#8212; an upshot for enterprise buyers.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Which disease results in the highest total economic burden per annum? If you guessed diabetes, cancer, heart disease or even obesity, you guessed wrong. Reaching a mammoth financial burden of <a href="https://everylifefoundation.org/burden-study/">$966 billion</a> in 2019, the cost of rare diseases far outpaced diabetes ($327 billion), cancer ($174 billion), heart disease ($214 billion) and other chronic diseases.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Cognitive intelligence, or cognitive computing solutions, blend artificial intelligence technologies like neural networks, machine learning, and natural language processing, and are able to mimic human intelligence.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Itâs not surprising that rare diseases didnât come to mind. By definition, a rare disease affects fewer than 200,000 people. However, collectively, there are thousands of rare diseases and those affect around 400 million people worldwide. About half of rare disease patients are children, and the typical patient, young or old, weather a diagnostic odyssey lasting five years or more during which they undergo countless tests and see numerous specialists before ultimately receiving a diagnosis.</p>
<h2>No longer a moonshot challenge</h2>
<p>Shortening that diagnostic odyssey and reducing the associated costs was, until recently, a moonshot challenge, but is now within reach. About 80% of rare diseases are genetic, and technology and AI advances are combining to make genetic testing widely accessible.</p>
<p>Whole-genome sequencing, an advanced genetic test that allows us to examine the entire human DNA, now costs under $1,000, and market leader Illumina is targeting a $100 genome in the near future.</p>
<p>The remaining challenge is interpreting that data in the context of human health, which is not a trivial challenge. The typical human contains 5 million unique genetic variants and of those we need to identify a single disease-causing variant. Recent advances in cognitive AI allow us to interrogate a personâs whole genome sequence and identify disease-causing mechanisms automatically, augmenting human capacity.</p>
<h2>A shift from narrow to cognitive AI</h2>
<p>The path to a broadly usable AI solution required a paradigm shift from narrow to broader machine learning models. Scientists interpreting genomic data review thousands of data points, collected from different sources, in different formats.</p>
<p>An analysis of a human genome can take as long as eight hours, and there are only a few thousand qualified scientists worldwide. When we reach the $100 genome, analysts are expecting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml9QdqtHHk8">50 million-60 million people</a> will have their DNA sequenced every year. How will we analyze the data generated in the context of their health? Thatâs where cognitive intelligence comes in.</p>
