										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The value of bitcoin fell under the $40,000 mark in early morning trading today.</p>
<p>The popular cryptocurrency sold off sharply this morning, while rival tokens like ether also lost value. Currently worth $39,831 per coin, bitcoin is off 4.3% and ether 5.1%, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price">according to Coinbase data</a>.</p>
<p>While it is always risky to cover price changes in the crypto world, the fall in the value of bitcoin has crossed the threshold from notable to material. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com">Yahoo Finance</a> indicates that bitcoin&#8217;s recent all-time high saw the cryptocurrency trade as high as $68,789.62 per coin. Today&#8217;s price puts bitcoin&#8217;s current drawdown at just over 42%.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255560" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s twice the swing required for bitcoin to have entered a technical bear market, and four times what it would need to meet the requirements of a correction.</p>
<p>But price declines in the value of certain cryptocurrencies are not slowing the decentralized world. Crypto-focused publication <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/129693/nft-marketplace-opensea-kicks-off-the-new-year-with-strong-volumes">The Block noted this morning</a> that NFT trading volumes at the popular OpenSea marketplace are strong to start the year. So, web3 activity appears strong by some measures, despite recent price declines; whether today&#8217;s selloff will have an impact on NFT trading activity, to stick with that particular example, is not yet clear.</p>
<p>For other crypto market participants, the selloff could harm near-term results. There is a historical, positive connection between rising crypto prices and trading volumes. Companies like Coinbase and others make their daily bread off trading fees, meaning that falling crypto prices are generally bearish for their financial performance. Of course, the past is not a perfect predictor of the future, but today&#8217;s selloff is not precisely bullish.</p>
<p>Cryptos are not the only volatile asset that is trading lower this morning: Tech stocks as a whole are off 1.81% (Nasdaq Composite), while software stocks are off an even more painful 2.62% (WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The public and private markets have traded the Most Bullish baton back and forth in recent years, but today's situation feels riskier than ever.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/vcs-and-founders-are-max-bullish-as-public-markets-flash-warning-signs/">TechCrunch noted</a> a week ago that private markets appeared strongly bullish on future startup value creation, while public markets were drifting lower, repricing possible exit values for today&#8217;s upstart companies. The was, it seemed, a rising gap between the level of bullishness in the private and public markets.</p>
<p>That dissonance has only increased in volume in the intervening days. New data from China&#8217;s private market, sharper central banking forecasts, sliding tech shares and rampantly bullish funding rounds make today&#8217;s startup cocktail even more confusing than what we saw a week ago.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In broad terms, the era of cheap money is coming to a close as startups continue to raise record sums, creating a possible collision course between private-market enthusiasm and a tightening stock market. And the discrepancy is only getting bigger.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s changed?</h2>
<p>This morning, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-10/goldman-now-expects-four-fed-hikes-sees-faster-runoff-in-2022">Goldman Sachs updated its expectation</a> regarding how quickly the U.S. Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy. Three hikes to the key overnight rate were anticipated this year; that figure has risen to four. The financial giant also expects the Fed to start to shrink its balance sheet in July. This is a full-on reversion of today&#8217;s policy that has kept rates at effectively zero and bond-buying afoot.</p>
<p>The macro environment is going to change mightily this year, meaning that we&#8217;ll close 2022 in a very different state than we began it. You might not know that, looking at the market today.</p>
<p>A few data points for flavor concerning startup fundraising:</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Hello readers and Happy New Year (I was gone last week): Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Welp, CES 2022 came and went. And while other news did happen this week, we&#8217;re gonna give you the ultimate CES breakdown. Hang on for this galaxy brain adventure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255570" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/giphy.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2255359 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/giphy.gif" alt="galaxy brain ces information" width="496" height="419" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And nope, I did not attend. This was the second year in a row — after years and years of walking the packed convention center and the rows of startups jammed in at Eureka Park — that I didn&#8217;t go in person. It was sad, as I do love to meet up with founders and test out new tech, but then again &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps, next year.</p>
<p>Before you jump in this CES 2022 wonderland. <strong>Sec. Pete Buttigieg</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/steering-innovation-toward-the-public-good/">wrote an op-ed</a> that TechCrunch ran last week — the same day he made prepared remarks (virtually) at CES 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What did he overlook? What did he get right? And what did he get wrong? Let me know!</p>
<p>Oh and one final note, <strong>Jim Motavalli</strong>, an author and EV expert, wrote a weekend feature for us that ties in perfectly with all of the tech shown off at CES. It&#8217;s all about what he describes as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/feature-bloat-cars-chip-shortage/">&#8220;feature bloat.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s micro CES time. Whoop.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a snippet from a lengthy roundup that Rebecca Bellan and I put together. The upshot? Smarter, connected, more powerful ebikes and scooters were the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/smarter-powerful-electric-scooters-bikes-ces-2022/">top micromobility trends of CES 2022</a>.</p>
<p>We also noticed that a lot of the products that were show, weren&#8217;t actually new. But even most of those EV products included more powerful onboard computers that are synced up to apps that can help riders do things like find their vehicle, track fitness goals and control bike functions like locks and lights.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the highlights</strong>:</p>
<p><b>Bosch </b>showed up with its connected smart e-bike system, which isn’t exactly new, but it was awarded honoree status at the CES Innovation Awards.</p>
<p><strong>Cake</strong> announced new updates to its Ridecake connectivity app, including features to allow professional fleet managers to monitor and manage their vehicles.</p>
<p><b>Delfast</b>, the American-Ukrainian startup, rolled out an upgraded model of its electric Top 3.0 bike, which the company claims can go up to 200 miles on a single charge.</p>
<p><strong>Moonbikes </strong>showed off its electric snow vehicle. And while it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/the-station-a-tesla-nhtsa-fight-brews-catching-up-with-kodiak-and-how-la-is-prepping-for-air-taxis/">not exactly new</a>, this was really the first time people really got to check it out in person. It’s a single-track snowmobile that has a 3 kW (4hp) electric motor and reaches a 26 mile-per-hour top speed.</p>
<p><b>Niu</b> showed up this year with its new <a href="https://www.niu.com/en/ces2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BQi-C1 e-bike</a>, a vehicle the Chinese e-scooter company has already teased but finally shared pricing and tech specs at CES. The step-through bike is powered by a 500W continuous and 750W Bafang hub motor in the rear and can reach top speeds of 28 miles per hour in the U.S.  The BQi, priced at $1,499, will also be app-connected and feature many smart security features.</p>
<p><b>Okai</b>, another Chinese manufacturer that supplies vehicles to many big-name shared operators, came to CES with five products, including a smart helmet and a smart backpack.</p>
<p><b>Segway</b>, the electric micromobility manufacturer that not only sells personal vehicles but also supplies a number of the world’s shared operators with vehicles, came to CES with a new kick scooter line, the P-Series, and a new moped-type e-scooter, the E11a.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">There was a lot of &#8220;vehicle tech&#8221; this year. I will provide a roundup below, but first some themes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">CES 2022 was not a showcase of autonomous vehicle technology — at least not compared to years past. I base this &#8220;observation&#8221; on feedback from industry experts who were on the ground as well as examining what companies attended and their announcements.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It wasn&#8217;t absent, mind you. But it was overshadowed by a lot of advanced driver assistance system technology, services and experiences that drivers and passengers can have inside vehicles and the compute power needed to deliver it all. When automated driving did pop up, it often came in the form of future promises, narrowly defined autonomous features like parking — or both.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have a nice long <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ces-2022-best-weirdest-car-tech/">3,000 word article</a> on all the weird and cool vehicle tech we took note at CES 2022. Here are a few of those items.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">The automotive chip game was on</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Intel</strong>, <strong>Nvidia</strong> and <strong>Qualcomm</strong> all showed up in force. There were two areas where &#8220;compute&#8221; was talked about the most. The first was to provide the power to deliver <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/qualcomm-ces-auto-snapdragon-digital-chassis/">digital services and content</a> like Qualcomm&#8217;s Spandragon Digital Chassis. The other area that compute showed up was in support of automated driving features and advanced driver assistance systems. Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm also made announcements, including Intel subsidiary Mobileye announcing plans to bring a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/intels-mobileye-autonomous-driving-chip-for-consumer-vehicles/">new supercomputer</a> to market designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Connected everything</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another big theme was connectivity. Sure, sure, that&#8217;s old news, right? This year it wasn&#8217;t just talking about what <em>might</em> come from an internet connected vehicle with the right underlying operating system and processing power; companies also showcased the products and services that will be in cars imminently.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Blackberry</strong>, <strong>Cerence</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Stellantis</strong> and <strong>Volvo</strong> were some of the companies that introduced new connected features or systems. Amazon kicked off its effort in the fourth quarter last year when it announced Stellantis would became the first automaker to integrate Fire TV for in-car entertainment with its new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. At CES, Amazon said it will bring the entertainment experiences to Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler Pacifica, as well. In addition, Fire TV will come built-in on Ford Explorer and Lincoln Navigator&#8217;s 2022 models.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Google and Volvo talked about how car owners would be able to download YouTube into the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system via the Google Play Store and Cerence and Blackberry made announcements about their &#8220;digital co-pilots.&#8221;</p>
<h3>ADAS and AD</h3>
<p>I won&#8217;t get too deep into the weeds because you&#8217;d be here all day, but companies like <strong>GM</strong>, <strong>Volvo</strong>, <strong>TuSimple</strong> and <strong>Gentex</strong> made announcements about autonomous driving and ADAS.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh and how can I forget, <strong>Mobileye</strong> is partnering with Chinese automaker <strong>Zeekr</strong> to develop an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/mobileye-and-zeekr-plan-to-build-an-autonomous-ev-for-chinese-consumers/">all-electric autonomous vehicle</a> for consumers. The vehicle will be sold in China starting in 2024 and eventually roll out to other markets.</p>
<h3>Other wacky stuff</h3>
<p>You probably saw <strong>BMW</strong> showed off a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bmw-shows-off-a-color-changing-car/">color-changing car.</a> But did you hear that Vietnamese automaker Vinfast will issue the first customers to pre-order a vehicle a “VinFirst” certificate on the blockchain platform in NFT form, which the company says is a completely transparent way to prove ownership of an order number?</p>
<p>NFTs and the term digital twins popped up a few times in the automotive sector at CES 2022, including an announcement from <strong>Cerence</strong> and Vinfast.</p>
<p>The gist is this: Cerence has cloud-based software that allows Vinfast (or any other company intrigued by the product) to create a virtual representation of its entire car, including software, mechanics, electrics and physical behavior, along with driver data and environmental data.</p>
<h2>CES: It&#8217;s electric</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">CES has been used as a platform for automakers to launch new electric vehicles since at least the middle of the last decade. And this year was no different, although maybe even more than in the past. Even Sony came back with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/sony-mobility/">Vision S concept electric car</a>, and announced that the Sony Group is starting a new division &#8212; the Sony Mobility Inc &#8212; which will start commercializing its electric vehicles.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>General Motors CEO and Chair Mary Barra</strong>, who introduced the  Chevy Bolt EV on the CES stage back in 2016, came back virtually again with a bevy of announcements related to its electric vehicle plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First up was the reveal of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/the-chevy-silverado-finally-goes-electric/">Chevy Silverado EV</a>. GM introduced two trims, a basic work truck called at WT that has a range of 400 miles, up to 664 horsepower and a starting price of $39,900. Then there is the RST First Edition, a fully loaded, four-wheel steering truck that will start at $105,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Silverado EV is the third electric truck announced by GM, following the Hummer EV and the Sierra Denali. Little is known about the Denali &#8212; GM teased it just last month &#8212; but it appears the Silverado shares the majority of its parts with the impressive Hummer EV. Don&#8217;t mistake the Silverado EV as an afterthought, editor Matt Burns noted in his report. The Silverado EV is the most important of the bunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Chevy Silverado has long been the main competitor with the top-selling Ford F-150 pickup. Side note: Last week Ford said it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/ford-double-production-lightning-pickup/">doubling production capacity</a> of the new all-electric F-150 Lightning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Barra also confirmed — and showed pictures of — an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/electric-chevrolet-equinox-chevrolet-blazer-suvs-are-coming-in-2023/">electric Chevy Equinox</a> as well as a Chevy Blazer that will both come in 2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What might have been missed during the splashy event (there were a number of announcements) was an image of a pontoon boat that flashed behind Barra as she spoke.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I got confirmation from GM that this is the newest boat from Pure Watercraft, which separately revealed the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pure-watercraft-unveils-new-electric-pontoon-boat-301454425.html">new product at CES 2022</a> and opened up pre-orders. If you recall, the automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/gm-acquires-25-stake-in-electric-boat-company-pure-watercraft/">took a 25% stake</a> in the Seattle-based electric boat company last November.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is the first product to come from GM&#8217;s investment in Pure Watercraft. The boat uses GM EV components. What makes this so interesting, beyond the EV boat, is that this illustrates GM&#8217;s broader push into EV component strategy, which the company thinks has an addressable market of $20B by 2030. This includes marine applications, along with EV crate motors for historic vehicles and converting equipment like airport ground support vehicles to electric propulsion.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I chatted with <strong>Travis Hester</strong>, GM&#8217;s VP of EV growth operations so stay tuned this coming week for insights on this strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other major automakers that showed off electric vehicle concepts included <strong>Stellantis</strong> with its Airflow concept and <strong>Mercedes-Benz</strong> with the EQXX.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stellantis actually had a bunch of news, including that it will turn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/stellantis-airflow-chrysler-all-electric-brand-by-2028/">Chrysler into an all-electric brand</a>. The big overall announcement was the tip-to-tail agreement Stellantis now has with Amazon that covers a cloud computing contract, software development and supplying the e-commerce company with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/amazon-delivery-fleet-electric-ram-promaster-vans/">upcoming all-electric Ram Promaster vans</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I interviewed <strong>Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares</strong> and am saving the good stuff for this coming week.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And then there is Mercedes-Benz and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/mercedes-benzs-vision-for-the-future-is-an-ultra-efficient-luxury-620-mile-range-ev/">EQXX concept</a>. This isn&#8217;t meant to be your typical we&#8221;ll-never-see-this-again concept car.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The EQXX is meant to showcase what the automaker&#8217;s electric future will look like and includes a ton of tech and features, which <span class="il">Markus</span> <span class="il">Schäfer, a board member of Daimler AG and CTO of Mercedes-Benz AG, told me will show up in vehicles beginning in 2024. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There were lots of smaller players as well that I want to briefly mention.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>ElectraMeccanica</strong> showed off a few of its single occupant EVs, including the SOLO &#8220;O2&#8221; Oxygen, which has a redesigned dashboard and the SOLO Cargo, a modified version of the flagship vehicle, designed to accommodate a wide range of commercial applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then there was <strong>Triggo</strong>, a fun-looking single occupant electric vehicle that can actually get slimmer if needed.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">OK folks, that&#8217;s it. Thanks for hanging in there for the CES information dump. This coming week I plan to feature interviews with Stellantis&#8217; Tavares, GM&#8217;s Hester and Toyota chief scientist Dr. Gill Pratt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based <a href="https://kodlandschool.webflow.io/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kodland</a>, which started out back in 2018 offering in-person courses for children to learn digital skills like computer programming before switching focus to online learning from early 2020, has closed a $9M Series A funding round to scale into more markets.</p>
<p>The round is led by Redseed Ventures, with participation from Baring Vostok, Kismet, Flyer One Ventures, and Alexander Nevinsky, a partner at New York based I2BF.</p>
<p>Kodland&#8217;s remote courses for children aged 6-17 are currently available in the UK, Ireland, US, Canada, CIS Region, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Argentina &#8212; with the startup offering proprietary localized content for each target region (although its users are spread across some 40 countries). So far, it says some 16,000 children have been signed up for its paid courses.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244802" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new funding will be used to further expand the reach of its online courses.</p>
<p>The courses focus on group- and project-based learning, teaching kids digital skills including coding, website building, games creation, animation and video editing in a way that&#8217;s structured to be more fun and interactive than traditional classroom-based lessons. Although the online learning offered by Kodland&#8217;s platform is guided by teachers rather than self serve.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jUmu6KeVmw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/stem-toys-for-kids-and-teens/">Gift Guide: 20+ STEM toy gift ideas for aspiring young builders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gift Guide: 20+ STEM toy gift ideas for aspiring young builders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/stem-toys-for-kids-and-teens/embed/#?secret=jUmu6KeVmw" data-secret="jUmu6KeVmw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Kodland says it has around 1,000 teachers on its platform (some are employed by it, some are gig workers, depending on the market); while the &#8220;typical&#8221; ratio is one teacher per 15 pupils. It notes its platform does also offer one-to-one teaching.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The edtech startup  says it&#8217;s focused on extracurricular teaching of digital skills for kids vs selling tools and resources to schools as it&#8217;s easier to scale globally &#8212; meaning it skips the complexities of K12 procurement.</p>
<p>And with a nod towards the creator economy, it&#8217;s established its own &#8220;accelerator&#8221; &#8212; called Out of the Box &#8212; where it offers (extra) support to the most talented students to help them monetize their digital creations by turning them into &#8220;real-life&#8221; products.</p>
<p>Kodland&#8217;s latest tranche of funding &#8212; which brings its total raised to date to $11M &#8212; will be used for market expansion, with courses in a further eight languages planned over the next two years. It says it will also be spending on product development.</p>
<p>&#8220;During 2022 we will expand further in English-speaking countries, in addition to UK and Ireland, enter Spanish-speaking countries and several countries in South-East Asia,&#8221; the startup tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>A smaller slice of the funding will be ploughed into its accelerator program.</p>
<p>The Series A funding comes off the back of what Kodland bills as &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">considerable traction&#8221; with students and &#8220;robust top-line growth&#8221; &#8212; noting that it grew its revenue 6.5x in the third quarter of 2021 vs the same period last year. </span></p>
<p>Edtech generally has had a booming pandemic, given all the extra screen time caused by lockdowns and restrictions on in person mixing &#8212; not to mention the demand for support as homeworking parents have sought tools to keep their offspring gainfully employed while they try to work.</p>
<p>That does mean competition is pretty heated, though.</p>
<p>Funding giants like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/class-a-zoom-only-virtual-classroom-nears-unicorn-status-after-softbank-check/">Softbank have been ploughing millions into the space</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/">clutch of edtech unicorns</a> is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/softbank-backed-korean-edtech-startup-riiid-acquires-langoo-to-expand-further-to-japan/">driving plenty</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/booming-edtech-ma-activity-brings-consolidation-to-a-fragmented-sector/">M&amp;A activity</a>. A bunch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/edtech-leans-into-the-creator-economy-with-cohort-based-classes/">cohort-based learning platforms</a> has also been successful in attracting recent investment &#8212; by, similarly, seeking to bridge the gap between edtech and the creator economy.</p>
<p>Where kids are concerned, a giant of the category remains <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/roblox-follows-minecraft-into-the-education-market/">Roblox</a> &#8212; which leverages social gaming to get children interested in learning programming and potentially earning money off of their creations.</p>
<p>Still, Kodland&#8217;s structure and focus &#8212; STEM skills for kids delivered via teacher-led classes &#8212; may help it carve a niche in the growing sea of edtech plays.</p>
<p>Billing itself as a &#8220;international online digital skills school for kids and teens&#8221;, its marketing is geared toward pitching parents on the notion of quality educational screen time for their offspring &#8212; selling bundles of four classes (aka a &#8220;module&#8221;) for €110; or a &#8220;complete&#8221; course of 32 classes from €660.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Eugene Belov, managing partner at Redseed, said: &#8220;Traditional educational institutions have a hard time keeping up with the rapid pace of technological development in today&#8217;s world. This often leads to a disconnect between the supply (skills and abilities of young graduates) and demand for talent (the requirements of modern workplaces). [Co-founders] Alexander [Nosulich] and Oleg [Kheyfets], are working hard on filling this gap by teaching their students skills which are very often left out of classical school programs, but which are becoming essential in today&#8217;s digital universe. And the unique result-oriented way their programs are structured make them highly appealing to modern kids. We are very excited to support Kodland on their journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no monopoly in the educational segment now, which means that more and more players are entering the market to meet the growing demand for educational services,&#8221; added Vital Laptenok, general partner at Flyer One Ventures, in another supporting statement. &#8220;Those who understand the real needs of their customers will be able to become major players and set trends in the market. The Kodland team focuses precisely on the practical knowledge and opportunities for children to learn relevant professions in an interactive manner.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.doctolib.fr">Doctolib</a> held a (virtual) press conference this morning to share some metrics, look back at the company’s recent product launches and give a hint about future investments. Doctolib started as a booking platform for doctors and has expanded to other services for doctors and medical workers in general.</p>
<p>With its software-as-a-service strategy, medical workers pay a monthly subscription to use Doctolib’s tools and use them with their patients. And it’s been working well as 300,000 medical workers currently pay Doctolib every month — general practitioners, dentists, pharmacies, psychologists, etc. With a subscription price starting at €129 per month, the startup has a monthly recurring revenue ranging in the tens of millions of euros.</p>
<p>2021 has been a pivotal year for the company as the platform has reached a critical mass in France. For instance, when you want to get vaccinated against Covid-19 in France, many people visit Doctolib’s website to find the nearest vaccination center, pharmacy or doctor with free slots. Vaccination places can use <a href="https://vitemadose.covidtracker.fr">other platforms</a>, but in reality most of them use Doctolib to handle bookings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255509" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Doctolib currently operates in France, Germany and Italy. France is still the company’s main market. 60 million people have used Doctolib so far — most of them have interacted with the service to book an appointment. In 2022, the company predicts that it’ll work with an additional 100,000 medical workers.</p>
<h2>Creating a suite of products</h2>
<p>Now that Doctolib has a commercial relationship with a ton of doctors, it can release new products and build its suite of services. In many ways, Doctolib is following Salesforce’s strategy. It has a very sticky main product that acts as a springboard for other products.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/doctolib-details-how-telemedicine-appointments-work/">launched</a> remote appointments with a telemedicine add-on. Doctors who choose to pay a bit more can start video calls and use Doctolib’s payment systems for remote appointments.</p>
<p>Last year, Doctolib launched <a href="https://info.doctolib.fr/doctolib-medecin/">Doctolib Médecin</a>. It’s a back-office tool for administrative tasks. For instance, it lets you centralize documents for each patient, see a patient’s history, take notes and issue invoices.</p>
<p>“We started working on it three years ago. We thought we would start from scratch compared to what’s available,” Doctolib’s Managing Director of France Arthur Thirion said. “It is being used by a bit more than 2,000 doctors right now.”</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t the first product that helps you manage your work as a doctor. But it integrates nicely with the rest of the Doctolib ecosystem.</p>
<p>Similarly, Doctolib wants to increase the network effects of its platform with a new service called <a href="https://info.doctolib.fr/doctolib-team/">Doctolib Team</a>. This time, the company doesn’t want to create a new revenue stream, it wants to make Doctolib essential.</p>
<p>Doctolib Team is an instant messaging service that lets you find specialists and chat with them. You can also securely send documents about your patients.</p>
<p>For health professionals already using Doctolib, it’s a nice-to-have feature. For health professionals who aren’t using Doctolib already, they can create a free Doctolib Team account and start using it — and maybe they might subscribe to Doctolib’s other products down the road.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255512" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255512" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" class="size-full wp-image-2255512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg 6970w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Doctolib-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255512" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Doctolib</p></div></p>
<h2>Operating with a high level of scrutiny</h2>
<p>Doctolib isn’t your average startup as the company handles sensitive, medical data. There have been <a href="https://www.telerama.fr/medias/sur-doctolib-le-secret-medical-est-soigne-avec-beaucoup-de-legerete-6665635.php">a lot</a> <a href="https://www.franceinter.fr/justice/doctolib-le-chiffrement-des-donnees-incomplet">of reports</a> on the company’s hosting stack and design decisions.</p>
<p>And the company is well aware that it can’t act like other startups. For instance, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/doctolib-is-now-a-unicorn-with-new-170-million-round/">reached unicorn status</a>, but it has stopped sharing funding details since then. You don’t want to talk too much about money when you’re trying to improve everyone’s health.</p>
<p>“We have stopped communicating on funding rounds for the past several years,” co-founder and CEO Stanislas Niox-Chateau said. “Every quarter, every year, investors invest once again or invest for the first time based on our long-term project.”</p>
<p>Doctolib now wants to become a mission-driven company — it’s a special status that you can get if you comply with certain rules. And Stanislas Niox-Chateau founds multiple arguments to position his company as a company that improves society.</p>
<p>For instance, he said that Doctolib’s business model is quite clear — the company relies exclusively on subscriptions from health professionals. The company doesn&#8217;t monetize patient data.</p>
<p>According to him, the platform is also used widely and doesn’t create a digital divide. Many users don’t live in major cities for instance. And the product is supposedly easy enough that even elderly people can use it.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the company plans to stand still. It has ambitious expansion plans for 2022. Doctolib will grow its team from 2,300 employees to 3,000 employees. And starting today, all employees will become Doctolib shareholders. Everyone will get at least €20,000 in stock grants.</p>
<p>In 2022, the company plans to invest €300 million to improve its products and grow its platforms in France, Germany and Italy — it mostly means new hires and new offices. There won’t be any new market launch in 2022, but that might come later down the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.asknicely.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AskNicely</a> is the latest company attracting capital for its app targeting shift or frontline worker success as more businesses rightly begin to see how valuable these employees are to their bottom line and how technology can ensure these key employees are empowered to help the company grow.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255199" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255199" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255199 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?w=300" alt="Aaron Ward, AskNicely" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg 1661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaron-Ward-AskNicely.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255199" class="wp-caption-text">Aaron Ward, CEO, AskNicely. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> AskNicely</p></div></p>
<p>The Portland, Oregon-based company, which has its tech team in New Zealand, began developing its SaaS customer experience management tools in 2014 for businesses that rely on humans, co-founder and CEO Aaron Ward told TechCrunch. The tools pull in Net Promoter Score, workflow, recognition and feedback, coaching and insights so that businesses can lead from their frontline workers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255192" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Historically, we’ve been taught that businesses are top down, but what we know is that the signal often gets lost,” he added. “The ‘magic’ is to make those signals always on and for the practice of sharing feedback and delivering coaching are daily things, not just those that happen once a quarter or once a month.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, the company announced a $32 million Series B round of funding that was led by Five Elms Capital, with participation from existing investors Nexus Venture Partners and Blackbird. Five Elms’ Ryan Mandl is joining AskNicely’s board as part of the funding.</p>
<p>The new capital gives AskNicely a total of $47 million in fundraising. It previously raised its Series A in January 2019, and Ward said the driver for going after additional capital was in part the global pandemic. Many of its service business customers shut their doors as a result, and the company was contemplating if it was time to pivot. Instead, AskNicely doubled down on its mission and took the down time during the pandemic to invest in the product and its marketing, he added.</p>
<p>Those efforts paid off for the company, and Ward was able to take those early results to the capital markets, which recognized this as new technology for a class of workers largely ignored previously by technology, he said.</p>
<p>Ward believes that taking that time to focus on the company gives AskNicely a headstart on the rest of the market.</p>

<p>“We were the first to market with this and focusing on the changing technology for this class of workers,” he added. “The new capital will enable us to go deeper on product and invest in business out sales and marketing as we get ready to take our platform to market and announce ourselves.”</p>
<p>With <a href="https://1huddle.co/blog/2021-trends-digital-frontline-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">80% of the global working population</a> considered frontline workers in industries like retail, food service and healthcare, Ward says the market opportunity is a massive one. Companies also taking in venture capital as they aim to reverse this underserved market include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/blink-a-productivity-app-aimed-at-frontline-workers-raises-20m-at-a-100m-valuation/">Blink</a>, an app for frontline workers to use and engage with the various IT services used by their organizations, as well as with each other. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/shiftsmart-a-marketplace-matching-shift-workers-to-employers-grabs-95m/">Shiftsmart</a>, a marketplace matching shift workers to employers, raised $95 million, while messaging app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/when-i-work-an-messaging-app-that-lets-shift-based-teams-schedule-work-and-more-raises-200m/">When I Work</a> closed on a huge round — $200 million.

Earlier this year, we saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/homebase-raises-71m-for-a-team-management-platform-aimed-at-smbs-and-their-hourly-workers/">Homebase</a>, which raised $71 million earlier this year, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/">Workiz</a>, which focuses on home services pros, raised $13 million.</p>
<p>AskNicely has over 60 employees, and plans to double that over the next year. Ward wouldn’t get specific about company revenue other than to say the company is a “high-growth SaaS business.” He did reveal that AskNicely is working with 1,300 customers, mainly in North America, Australia and Europe, and that it has gotten to a point with its selling price that “every new customer today is worth 10 times more what we have been doing historically.”</p>
<p>“We are here to fix how frontline workers work, and in the past 24 months, companies have realized a new appreciation for what they have done,” Ward said. “They are underserved by technology and frankly underappreciated, underpaid and underestimated. We are helping them be successful, but we can’t do it alone. We need to build a movement to link arms with coalition partners and build partnerships with other players to make a difference.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Huge consolidation is afoot in the world of gaming. Today Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/news-releases/news-release-details/take-two-and-zynga-combine-bringing-together-best-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a plan to acquire mobile games giant Zynga, in a deal valued at $9.861 per share, $3.50 in cash and the remaining $6.361 in shares of Take-Two common stock. Zynga&#8217;s enterprise value in the deal works out to $12.7 billion.</p>
<p>The deal will bring together two gaming powerhouses, Take-Two in consoles and PC games (including such iconic titles as Grand Theft Auto) and Zynga in a massive swathe of mobile games, a genre that was arguably largely defined by the company (it&#8217;s behind FarmVille, Empires &amp; Puzzles, Words with Friends and more).</p>
<p>The deal, Take-Two said, will result in $6.1 billion in 12-month pro-forma net bookings (ending September 30, 2021), making it one of the largest gaming companies overall, regardless of platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The transaction is expected to be close in Q1 of fiscal year 2023, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to announce our transformative transaction with Zynga, which significantly diversifies our business and establishes our leadership position in mobile, the fastest growing segment of the interactive entertainment industry,” said Strauss Zelnick, Chairman and CEO of Take-Two, in a statement. “This strategic combination brings together our best-in-class console and PC franchises, with a market-leading, diversified mobile publishing platform that has a rich history of innovation and creativity. Zynga also has a highly talented and deeply experienced team, and we look forward to welcoming them into the Take-Two family in the coming months. As we combine our complementary businesses and operate at a much larger scale, we believe that we will deliver significant value to both sets of stockholders, including $100 million of annual cost synergies within the first two years post-closing and at least $500 million of annual Net Bookings opportunities over time.”</p>
<p>“Combining Zynga’s expertise in mobile and next-generation platforms with Take-Two’s best-in-class capabilities and intellectual property will enable us to further advance our mission to connect the world through games while achieving significant growth and synergies together,” added Frank Gibeau, CEO of Zynga. “I am proud of our team’s hard work to deliver a strong finish to 2021, with one of the best performances in Zynga’s history. We are incredibly excited to have found a partner in Take-Two that shares our commitment to investing in our players, amplifying our creative culture, and generating more value for stockholders. With this transformative transaction, we begin a new journey which will allow us to create even better games, reach larger audiences and achieve significant growth as a leader in the next era of gaming.”</p>
<p>Strauss Zelnick will lead the larger company, with Gibeau and Zynga&#8217;s President of Publishing, Bernard Kim, overseeing the larger mobile business (including integrating Zynga with Take-Two&#8217;s existing mobile operations).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As with a lot of other consolidation moves, this is about cost savings through synergies. Take-Two said the deal would help the larger business save about $100 million annually after two years (first will come integrations). Take-Two already has a number of mobile games titles and has expanded its franchises into mobile, but this will give the company a significantly larger holding in the space.</p>
<p>This is key considering how Zynga has fared over the years. Since a huge boom in its share price when it first went public, the company has been on a bit of a rollercoaster and over the last year has seen its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZNGA?p=ZNGA&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share price drop</a>, making it an acquisition target.</p>
<p>The move also puts to an end an era of sorts. As a startup based out of San Francisco&#8217;s SOMA district just as the city was coming into its own as a tech hub separate from Silicon Valley, it was an early mover in spotting and scaling the mobile gaming opportunity.</p>
<p>Initially it found huge traction as a social gaming giant leaning on growth by way of Facebook&#8217;s social graph, but as that became annoying and spammy, over time Facebook changed the rules and cut off Zynga&#8217;s audience supply. More generally, the mobile gaming market has proven to be a more precarious one when it comes to consumer tastes and usage, and so a lot of Zynga&#8217;s success has been banked around finding (and sometimes acquiring) the next hot new title and franchise to replace those that have waned in popularity. (One of its bigger recent acquisitions was acquiring, in 2020, Turkey&#8217;s Peak Games, which had already established traction with Toon Blast and Toy Blast, for<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $1.8 billion</a>.)</p>
<p>Combining with Take-Two, which also publishes Red Dead Redemption, Midnight Club, NBA 2K, BioShock, Borderlands, Civilization, Mafia, and Kerbal Space Program, will give it a large library of franchises and IP from which to build new mobile gaming experiences. Similarly, Zynga&#8217;s IP may now find new traction on in different formats and different screens.</p>
<p>What is interesting is whether and how the larger company will use its expanded content IP to think about how it engages with the market at large. These days so much action in gaming happens more on the platforms where people meet to discuss games and be social with each other, whether that is over Twitch, Discord or somewhere else.</p>
<p>The gaming market has seen a huge surge of attention in the last couple of years, as one of the &#8220;winners&#8221; in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and more people looking for diversions while staying put at home.Take-Two quoted figures that said overall the mobile gaming industry saw $136 billion in gross bookings in 2021 and is growing currently at 8%. Mobile will now account for half of Take-Two&#8217;s bookings, it said.</p>
<p>More to come</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Profiles are back in Tesla&#8217;s latest &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; beta 10.3 with an &#8220;Assertive Mode&#8221; that may perform rolling stops and other borderline maneuvers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/9/22875382/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-assertive-profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported. The update was originally released in October 2021 with three profiles (&#8220;Chill,&#8221; &#8220;Average&#8221; and &#8220;Assertive&#8221;), but was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-pulls-latest-self-driving-beta-over-left-turn-and-other-issues-063331006.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">pulled</a> just two days later over issues with traffic light left turns, unexpected stopping and more.</p>
<p>The latest update issued yesterday shows that the Full Self-Driving (Beta) profiles are back. If you choose &#8220;Assertive,&#8221; the notes state that &#8220;in this profile, your Model X will have a smaller follow distance, perform more frequent speed lane changes, will not exit passing lanes and may perform rolling stops.&#8221; As <a href="https://twitter.com/digitalhen/status/1480230704520773632" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">@Digitalhen</a> notes, the system may also perform rolling stops even in &#8220;Average&#8221; mode.</p>

<p>Generally, a rolling stop means a vehicle doesn&#8217;t come to a complete halt at a stop sign (which is illegal and <a href="https://www.automotive-fleet.com/74646/dangerous-risks-of-rolling-stops-highlighted-in-new-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">dangerous</a>) but it&#8217;s not yet clear if that&#8217;s what FSD will do. It&#8217;s also <a href="https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SLOWER-TRAFFIC-KEEP-RIGHT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">illegal in many states</a> to stay in the left or passing lane if you&#8217;re not passing anyone, and of course, it&#8217;s never a great idea to follow the vehicle ahead too closely. All of that said, the mode hasn&#8217;t been tested enough yet to demonstrate exactly how it&#8217;s doing those things.</p>
<p>On the weekend, CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla would be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fsd-price-increase-12000-002847392.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">raising the price</a> of FSD from $10,000 to $12,000, even though it&#8217;s still in beta. As we&#8217;ve pointed out before, the name &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; is misleading (much like Autopilot), as FSD does not offer true Level 4 self-driving, but simply Level 2 advanced driver assistance.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ParrotConnect is a point-of-sale software for restaurants enabling them to digitize and take advantage of the home delivery boom to accelerate growth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global pandemic threw a wrench in the plans of restaurants all over the world two years ago when diners stayed home, causing many eateries to shift their business to pickup or delivery.</p>
<p>Roberto Cebrián and David Villarreal both had experience working with restaurants in Mexico and recognized that many restaurants were not prepared to change their operations quickly, so they jumped on the opportunity to help them.</p>
<p>“There are a bunch of food tech solutions in Latin American and U.S., but it ended up turning the operations in both the front and back of the house into a mess,” Cebrián said. “The pandemic was a crazy experience. Not a lot of people knew what would happen, but the downside was that restaurants closed.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255270" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2255279" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255279" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255279 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fotos_Prensa_SerieA_-Bob6-e1641593881950.jpg?w=300" alt="Roberto Cebrián, Parrot" width="300" height="273" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255279" class="wp-caption-text">Roberto Cebrián, co-founder of Parrot. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Parrot</p></div></p>
<p>With an eye on reversing that trend, they created Monterrey-based <a href="https://pos.parrotsoftware.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parrot</a> in April 2020, and in 2021 launched with ParrotConnect, its point-of-sale software for restaurants enabling them to digitize and take advantage of the home delivery boom to accelerate growth.</p>
<p>Cebrián told TechCrunch that many restaurants were balancing an average of three delivery apps and 15 different menus at each location. Often connectivity issues and menu errors caused restaurants to get anywhere from 10% to 15% of the orders wrong or late when they were pushed from the apps to the restaurant’s point-of-sale software so that they could be made.</p>
<p>Instead, ParrotConnect offers a way for restaurants to centralize all of those fragmented operations, including table service and online orders — into one management portal where users can operate functions like menus, kitchen management, payment methods and reports.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is working with over 60 collaborators on the product and now has more than 500 restaurants across Monterrey, Mexico City and the Riviera Maya using ParrotConnect.</p>
<p>On Monday, the company announced it secured $9.5 million, led by F Prime Capital, to continue developing ParrotConnect and expand its footprint in Mexico. The new capital gives the company a total of $11.7 million in funding.</p>
<p>Parrot is the latest company raising capital as part of a broader trend of companies helping restaurants thrive in this new digital world, including<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/digital-restaurant-startup-zak-orders-up-new-capital-on-mission-to-be-toast-of-latam/"> Zak</a>, also developing point-of-sale technology for restaurants, payment system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/sunday-raises-24-million-seed-round-to-build-a-fast-restaurant-checkout-flow/">Sunday</a> and restaurant management software company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/marginedge-a-restaurant-management-software-company-raises-18m/">MarginEdge</a>.</p>
<p>Since making a soft launch in January 2021, Parrot is now working with over 500 restaurants — all paying customers, Cebrián said. It has 60 employees currently after starting in 2021 with 10 employees. The company has been focused on helping restaurants grow, and Cebrián said it was too early to disclose revenue figures. Plans for ParrotConnect start at $73 per month for companies with one POS.</p>
<p>“We are heavily investing in product because we want to give the right experience,” he added. “The restaurant industry is an old industry, and it always finds its way out, so we are happy to be helping them do that with technology. We admire the industry and how creative they are to make things work. Delivery has played a huge part in saving a lot of restaurants during this time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instant purchase and delivery of food and other essentials was one of the big bubbles of opportunity in the world of e-commerce in the last year, with dozens of startups big and small emerging and scooping up funding to build out businesses to bring items like groceries, toilet paper and Tylenol to people&#8217;s doors in 30 minutes or less. Now a startup called <a href="https://www.getarive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arive</a> that&#8217;s applying this concept to the wider world of consumer goods in a Prime Now-style service &#8212; partnering with premium stores and brands to sell and deliver items like Apple electronics and Bose headphones, Lululemon active wear, furniture and beauty and bath products and Van Moof electric bikes, and then delivering items via its own courier service &#8212;  is announcing a Series A of $20 million to see if the idea finds traction beyond essentials.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Balderton Capital, with Global Founders Capital (the firm connected to Rocket Internet&#8217;s Samwer family), Burda Principal Investments, La Famiglia and 468 Capital also participating. (La Famiglia and 468 Capital are repeat backers of Munich-based Arive, both having invested in the seed round for the company, which is not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.arive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mortgage startup</a> of the same name in the U.S.)</p>
<p>Arive&#8217;s funding, and list of backers, is notable in that it&#8217;s based on a pretty limited run so far. The startup launched only four months ago and is currently active in just four cities in Germany &#8212; Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt &#8212; although now the idea will be to use the investment to expand further across the country and to start considering which other markets to tackle next.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255486" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The reason for the vote of confidence is that so far, the numbers look promising. Arive is not disclosing how many customers it has or what its revenues are looking like, but it notes that the average order size is between €50 and €100 ($56 and $113) across some 1,000 SKUs, with the average basket containing between one and four items. That presents what Arive is doing as a very different proposition to what, say, a GoPuff or Getir is hoping to achieve with its instant delivery model, essentially replacing the weekly grocery shop with multiple baskets delivered to one&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not just about being the next quick commerce vertical but building the next generation of e-commerce,&#8221; said Maximilian Reeker, who co-founded Arive with Linus Fries (the two co-lead the company). He described that next generation like this: &#8220;Very convenient delivery of between 30 and 60 minutes, connecting people to local stores with a bike-based service, in an app optimized for the phone.&#8221; All of its couriers are employed by the company, either full-time or part-time.</p>
<p>Arive has up to now split the model into three parts, providing consignment, wholesale and, in the next 2-3 months, marketplace options for sourcing supply. Fries said that currently the wholesale part accounts for the largest part of its business and sales.</p>
<p>Beyond that, white label services &#8212; where Arive might sell its backend technology and delivery infrastructure to third-party retailers to build their own instant delivery services &#8212; is another area that the company is considering, Fries said. This could be a very interesting opportunity in areas such as fashion: typically online sales of clothes have been challenged by issues of sizing and dealing with returns, which make for a high barrier of entry for a company like Arive without making extensive and focused investments to address them. What it could do, however, is provide its technology to fashion brands and retailers that have, who are considering ways of getting apparel faster to would-be online buyers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, although it&#8217;s taking a different approach in instant delivery by eschewing groceries and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-moving_consumer_goods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FMCG</a> essentials and focusing on higher-ticket slower-moving consumer goods, Arive is still operating very much with those grocery delivery startups in mind for another reason.</p>
<p>Reeker told me that Arive actually relishes the oversupply of these startups in certain markets &#8212; indeed, the bubble has definitely started to burst for some of these startups, as they get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/after-acquiring-dija-and-fancy-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-launches-in-the-uk-en-route-to-european-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">snapped up</a> by much larger and highly capitalized rivals looking to expand to new geographies &#8212; because they become a signal for where Arive should be considering to expand to next.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to go to more places in Germany and expand internationally, and while we haven’t decided which cities, we looking at those where existing grocery plays are live,&#8221; said Reeker. &#8220;The UK, France, they are all interesting. Having those grocery companies there is an advantage for us because it&#8217;s evidence of the consumer shift that has taken place. They are already used to getting their food quickly, which is the first step.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arive is not the first company to have thought of building a service around instant delivery of virtually any kind of item a person might like to have without leaving their homes to buy it. This was basically the premise behind Amazon Prime Now, which the e-commerce giant launched the service in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/18/amazon-brings-one-hour-delivery-to-nyc-with-prime-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014</a>. Pointedly, although Amazon expanded it to several markets, eventually it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/amazon-is-shutting-down-its-prime-now-fast-delivery-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discontinued</a> the standalone app and branding it had built for Prime Now, which now exists as a faster-delivery option for some of the items that it sells via Prime.</p>
<p>The message there could be interpreted in two ways. It could point to challenges for scaling something like a fast-delivery service without also providing a wider range of options that offer cheaper options and longer delivery times to customers put off by the premium that comes with instant.</p>
<p>Or, it could point to how there remains an opportunity for a smaller and more focused company to get the model right, understanding that the market has matured in the last eight years and consumers are not only more willing to shop online than ever before due to Covid-19, but have focused their expectations of how that experience should more closely mirror the instant-gratification of shopping in person.</p>
<p>Investors are willing to bet that the two co-founders &#8212; which hatched the idea of Arive while at business school &#8212; have a shot in building something fit the latter of those.</p>
<p>“Linus, Max, and the entire team at arive are challenging e-commerce conventions with energetic execution and an acute sensitivity to the priorities of modern brands,&#8221; said Colin Hanna, partner at Balderton Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Using light electric vehicles to rapidly fulfill orders leaves a lighter footprint on our planet and ensures that customers are home to receive goods they’ve purchased online, avoiding costly failed deliveries. The team is also committed to building their UX in a way that protects, rather than erodes, the value of the brands they are lucky to work with. Finally, high basket sizes and no wastage means the company has a much stronger path to a sustainable business model over the long run.  Balderton is fortunate to be backing arive as it scales rapidly across Europe.”</p>

<p>The <a href="http://bseindia.com/stock-share-price/one-97-communications-ltd/paytm/543396/">stock</a>, which opened Monday at ₹1,226, dropped 6% at 3.30 pm India standard time. Paytm, which has been struggling to improve its stock price ever since its debut, has slid by over 46% from its issue price of ₹2,150 ($28.9). The firm’s market cap, at the time of publishing, was $10.13 billion, nearly half of what it had sought during the debut and below the $16 billion valuation at which it raised a financing round in late 2019.</p>
<p>The plunge in price follows brokerage house Macquarie&#8217;s report on Monday in which it retained its lowest rating on One97 Communications, the parent firm of Paytm, and cut its target price to ₹900 ($12.14), down from ₹1,200 that it had assigned ahead of the market debut on November 18. Paytm, which says it has amassed over 300 million users, operates a number of businesses including mobile wallet, credit top-ups, movies and travel ticketing businesses, and an e-commerce service.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255473" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Macquarie was the only brokerage firm which had such a grim view on Paytm’s outlook at the time of market debut. Analysts at Bernstein, in comparison, had estimated that Paytm&#8217;s valuation will swing between $21 billion to $24 billion. (A Bernstein spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment in November.)</p>
<p>“Post the various business updates and results, we believe our revenue projections, particularly on the distribution side, is at risk and hence we pare down our revenue CAGR from 26% to 23% for FY21- 26E. We are roughly cutting revenue estimates for FY21-26E on an average by 10% every year due to lower distribution and commerce/cloud revenues offset partially by higher payment revenues,” Macquarie analysts wrote Monday.</p>
<p>“We cut our earnings (increase our loss projections) by 16-27% for FY22-25E owing to lower revenues and higher employee and software expenses. We cut our TP (target price) sharply by ~25% owing to lower target multiple of 11.5x (price to sales ratio) (from 13.5x earlier) and lower sales numbers. Maintain UP with a revised TP of ₹900.”</p>
<p>The brokerage firm said RBI&#8217;s proposed digital payments regulations could cap wallet charges, which would hurt Paytm&#8217;s business, where payments side still accounts for 70% of the firm&#8217;s overall gross revenue. Macquarie also cited departure of senior Paytm executives and the shrinking ticket size for loans disbursed by Paytm as other factors that could impact the firm&#8217;s future outlook.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a report in the second half of December, analysts at Morgan Stanley labeled Paytm&#8217;s stock as &#8220;overweight,&#8221; and assigned a target price of ₹1,875 ($25.2), saying the firm was &#8220;well positioned to capitalize on upcoming acceleration in digital distribution of financial services/commerce in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huge TAM (total addressable market), India&#8217;s distinctive tech architecture and regula- tory supportive partnership approach are key enablers, we believe. India is under-penetrated in financial services, and across segments we expect strong growth. More importantly, the penetration of third party digital distribution of financial services is significantly low and we will see strong acceleration over the next five years &#8211; this will be helped by the distinctive rails in India around identity, payments and data sharing,&#8221; they wrote in a report to clients on December 18.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, we believe that Paytm&#8217;s financial services is synergistic, in line with the regulatory thought process and scalable. Balance sheet risk is low, and Paytm&#8217;s technology capabilities to leverage alternative data sets as well as design customized products are some key value adds against the above backdrop.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loyalty, deals and rewards services are a rarity in most African markets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unit economics and other factors such as currency instability make such businesses hard to pull off in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, <a href="https://thankucash.com/">ThankUCash</a>, a platform launched in 2018 by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/company/connectedanalytics">Connected Analytics</a>, has managed to thrive, proving that not all is gloom in the deals, coupon and rewards business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And to that end, the startup, which announced an undisclosed seven-figure seed last year, has finally closed the round at $5.3 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VC firms 500 Global and Unicorn Growth Capital co-led the Lagos-based company’s seed round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It saw participation from U.S.-based accelerator Expert Dojo, Predictive VC, SaaS Growth Ventures, Betatron Venture Group, Accelerex Holdings. Individual investors like Andrew Dell, former CEO of HSBC Africa and Craig Fenton of Google UK also took part.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255422" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use the investment to expand within its home market Nigeria &#8212; where it operates in Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja &#8212; and outside to Ghana and Kenya. It also wants to improve its product offerings and add more staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, store-like businesses in Nigeria such as supermarkets and restaurants have operated offline, relying on bookkeeping and head knowledge to record their customers’ activities in their shops. This made it difficult to offer cash back and loyalty points to customers</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online platforms like ThankUCash present these merchants with an opportunity to delve into rewards and help them retain loyalty and increase revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/simeonononobi">Simeon Ononobi</a> started ThankUCash with <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/surajms">Suraj Supekar</a>, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/madonnaononobi">Madonna Ononobi</a> and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/harshalgandole">Harshal Gandole</a>, who act as a chief technical officer, chief operating officer and senior vice president of engineering, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multi-merchant rewards platform (which means customers can hop on from one merchant to another to earn loyalty points in another) allows customers to earn rewards anytime they shop with thousands of merchants listed on its app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business raised a $320,000 pre-seed after grabbing the <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/02/12/thankucash-accepted-into-500-startups/">attention of accelerators</a> such as 500 Startups, Google Launchpad and other local investors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/">Microtraction</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/ventures-platform-announces-first-close-of-its-40m-pan-african-fund/">Ventures Platform</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until this point, ThankUCash said it has recorded over 600,000 users and onboarded over 1,000 stores on its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, it claims to have processed over $80 million in transaction volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having matured as a business, Ononobi and his team want to take on a more complicated task: building infrastructure for companies that want to offer akin services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are creating solutions that help SMEs succeed while increasing consumer buying power and opportunities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to build an infrastructure for rewards, loyalty, deals, buy now, pay later, cashback,” he said to TechCrunch on a call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cashback was our low hanging fruit and an entry point. We’re still going to go into deals, couponing, gift cards, buy now, pay later, anything that will help the business grow, but at the same time, allowing the consumer increase in opportunities of buying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ononobi, a serial entrepreneur who previously built a payments company and also apps for Nigerian banks and the government, reckons that ThankUCash will do to rewards the same thing Flutterwave and Paystack did to payments in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies such as banks have launched cashback programs via debit cards to users in the past</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But most of them have been generally inefficient, from setup down to collections and redeeming of points, and Ononobi argues that their inefficiencies boil down to no technical support. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThankUCash sees a gold mine to provide plugins banks and fintechs can tap into to offer cashback and rewards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255438" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255438" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2255438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-cofounders-1280x1023-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="543" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-cofounders-1280x1023-1.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-cofounders-1280x1023-1.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-cofounders-1280x1023-1.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-cofounders-1280x1023-1.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-cofounders-1280x1023-1.jpg?resize=680,543 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ThankUCash-cofounders-1280x1023-1.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255438" class="wp-caption-text">ThankUCash cofounders</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bit about buy now, pay later is fuzzy now since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/will-carbon-and-shahry-usher-in-a-wave-of-buy-now-pay-later-services-in-africa/">only a handful of prominent BNPL services</a> in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company seems to be positioning itself for the imminent proliferation of such services buoyed by similar happenings globally where buy now, pay later services have seen an uptake as a result of pandemic-induced consumer behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The technology is such that we have our machines in stores. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So as customers request loans, we generate a code for it, customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The code can only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested, such that at the end of the day the customer is buying straight from the merchants,” explained the founder, who also mentioned that his startup might venture into offering buy now, pay later services itself in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThankUCash’s consumer-facing platform will remain operational. But to set the infrastructure play in motion, it has signed a partnership with payments company Interswitch to onboard its merchants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which is also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the process of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making integrations with payments gateways, said a couple of bank partnerships are in its pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of how ThankUCash makes money, merchants pay the company a fee on every </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made in their stores. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, ThankUCash gets a 1.5% commission for every customer it brings into the store to redeem a 5% cashback item. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lagos-based company also takes commissions for deals and plans to charge an onboarding fee for businesses that want to use its APIs for its services, including buy now, pay later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThankUCash has perfected one offering: the cashback product where merchants can get more walk-in customers. It’s improving the deals category, allowing merchants to sell products fast </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(by hiring <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/11/22/ex-dealdey-managers-reunite-to-launch-thankucash-deals/">ex-managers of DealDey</a>, a Nigerian defunct deals company). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while currently building out its buy now pay later infrastructure (which gives businesses a chance to sell products regardless of whether customers have money or not), ThankUCash plans to add a fourth offering soon: a remittance product where merchants can sell </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the diaspora.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chief executive doesn’t give details about this product. Meanwhile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, its investors, who have doubled down while privy to information like this, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are enthused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about “the continued evolution of the company”, a remark made by Amit Bhatti, the principal at co-lead investor 500 Global.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since going through 500 Global’s accelerator in 2019, we’ve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been impressed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Simeon and the ThankUCash team’s progress in implementing a rewards system that works for Nigerian consumers, regardless of cash or credit or online or offline payment,” said the principal. “It’s a win-win for businesses and banks, too, as ThankUCash gives them the tools and data they need to grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 45-man team has hired Aaron Tindiseega to lead its expansion into Kenya and the eastern Africa region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ugandan professional has experience working for banks and tech companies like Uber, Standard Chartered Bank and Stanbic IBTC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For its expansion into Ghana, Kiki Anku, who has worked at Apple and a couple of startups, will spearhead the task.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.ankorstore.com">Ankorstore</a> has raised a $283 million Series C funding round (€250 million). Founded in November 2019, it took Ankorstore around two years to reach a post-money valuation of $2 billion (€1.75 billion). The company operates a wholesale marketplace for independent retailers across Europe.</p>
<p>Ankorstore lets independent brands sell their products to independent retailers. Those retailers can then sell those products to their own customers. It’s a B2B2C play with a focus on offline sales at the end of the chain.</p>
<p>You can find a bit of everything on Ankorstore, from household supplies to maple syrup, candles, headbands, bath salts and stationery items. Some verticals have been working quite well in particular, such as non-perishable groceries, beauty products and items for your home.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254596" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And it’s been working extremely well given the company’s trajectory. There are currently 200,000 retailers using the marketplace and sourcing items from 15,000 brands. In May 2021, when Ankorstore <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/ankorstore-raises-another-102-million-for-its-wholesale-marketplace/">raised its Series B</a>, the company told me it was working with 50,000 shops and 5,000 brands.</p>
<p>This leads us to today’s funding round. Bond and Tiger Global led the Series C. Eurazeo and Coatue also participated in the round. Some existing investors put more money on the table, such as Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, GFC, Alven and Aglae Ventures.</p>
<p>There aren’t a lot of companies competing in the space. The best known wholesale marketplace is probably <a href="https://www.faire.com">Faire</a>, a U.S.-based company that has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/indigo-fair">over $1 billion</a> — it has recently started its <a href="https://blog.faire.com/thestudio/faire-has-expanded-in-europe-to-15-countries/">European expansion</a>. <a href="https://www.creoate.com">Creoate</a> and <a href="https://www.orderchamp.com">Orderchamp</a> also operate wholesale marketplaces in Europe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>A marketplace without inventory</h2>
<p>Ankorstore has teams in five countries — France, the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. It sells products in 23 European markets. Retailers can pay up to 60 days after ordering something and there are no hidden fees for them. Essentially, Ankorstore helps retailers focus on curation, service while the startup takes care of procurement.</p>
<p>As for brands listing their items on Ankorstore, they give a 10% cut on each transaction following a higher 20% cut on the first order through Ankorstore.</p>
<p>Some brands still have direct deals with massive retailers, such as department stores. And Ankorstore doesn’t prevent brands from hiring sales people, going to fairs, etc. The marketplace is just another sales channel and another opportunity to find customers.</p>
<p>And this is the beauty of the business model of wholesale marketplaces. Ankorstore doesn’t have any warehouse and doesn’t own any inventory. The company only facilitates transactions between brands and retailers without any capital investment.</p>
<p>“We think we’re closer to LinkedIn in the way we operate — it’s a network of professionals and we help them connect with each other,” co-founder and co-CEO Nicolas Cohen told me.</p>
<p>And like all social networks, there are some strong network effects as the platform gets bigger. In particular, Ankorstore expects to expand to new categories, such as perishable food.</p>
<p>The startup already has a deal with UPS to help brands with shipping. But the company hasn’t done much when it comes to warehousing solutions for small brands. That’s another opportunity down the road.</p>
<p>With 400 employees and a lot of money in its bank account, Ankorstore could act as the unifying layer of this highly fragmented industry.</p>

<p>Here we go with the last show of 2021, recorded in mid-December. It was Frank Radice’s last show from New York before he returned to London. It was nice to bid the year goodbye, but we were careful not to say good riddance like we did in 2020. It was nice to feel good about the Zoom-connected friendships we nurtured, and nice to appreciate the flow of working from anywhere and yet still being productive.</p>
<p>For me, the heartbeat of tech and its impact on so many things we struggle with — politics, streaming, and the media business — was and remains palpable. It may be that crypto will find its moment, but I wouldn’t gamble on it. The midterms loom, and social networks are turning topsy-TicTok and live audio, but I wouldn’t bet on the kind of numbers that will turn Wall Street on quite yet if at all. Newsletters are looking more and more like publishers, and publishers are going startup to head it off at the pass, but it will take talent not venture money to make it stick.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255448" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Not since Bill Gates and the Google twins ruled the world have we seen such a shift in the stars that define the nighttime skies. Dorsey, who invented Twitter as a side project, and Andreessen, who sped up thinking from 1X to at least 2X, are skating ahead of the curve now, more aligned than the media wants them to be. Television is gone, replaced by a hybrid of computer, mobile, and small movies that will survive the machine movie behemoths of the fifties. The Beatles are now the old guard, struggling with the transition from children to parents to divorce and rebirth. The more footage we resuscitate, the more we realize what an incredible courageous process they opened to the doors of our perception. Only they were too big to fail and did anyway, and even then let us see how far collaboration can go. As James Taylor echoed:</p>
<p>Just shower the people you love with love<br />
Show them the way that you feel<br />
Things are gonna work out fine<br />
If you only will<br />
Do as I say</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What if the auto industry&#8217;s best solution to the chip shortage was not simply making more chips? Suppose we instead got a handle on what might be called &#8220;feature bloat&#8221; — the tendency, fueled by sales competition, to slather new cars with as much technology as possible?</p>
<p>Surveys show that consumers want — and expect — that their next car will be laden with whiz-bang features, demand that is a driver for the current bloat. CES 2022, which wrapped this week, provides a glimpse of what the future car might hold. Bosch said to expect double-digit annual growth in automotive software until 2030; Panasonic showed off an augmented reality head-up display with eye tracking, plus the ELS Studio 3D audio system with 1,000 watts and 25 speakers. BMW unveiled future technology that will allow owners to change the exterior color of their cars and display digital art inside them, not to mention a rear 31-inch Theatre Screen with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/amazon-fire-tv-is-coming-to-more-cars-in-2022/">built-in Amazon Fire TV</a>.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just a tiny sampling of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ces-2022-best-weirdest-car-tech/">car tech shown at CES 2022.</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252070" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But if that tech is unreliable — as some of it has proven — then it&#8217;s not a win for consumers. Meanwhile, market reality has resulted in a collision course for buyers on the ground: higher prices and spotty availability of some of the features they say they most want.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a chip shortage; we have software bloat,&#8221; said Mike Juran, CEO and co-founder of Altia, which provides graphical user interface design and tools to many automakers. &#8220;There is way too much unnecessary software out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take the Chevrolet Volt. The plug-in hybrid had more than 10 million lines of code when it was introduced for the 2011 model year;  today&#8217;s mid- to high-level vehicles have something like 100 million lines, said Michael Hill, vice president of engineering at Altia.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s at the level you might have seen in a jet fighter 10 or 15 years ago,&#8221; Hill told TechCrunch. &#8220;And there is no bug-free software.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The bad news for consumers: the feature bloat is unavoidable and getting worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s cars are being burdened with features consumers aren&#8217;t necessarily asking for or demanding,&#8221; Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>According to Fisher, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/media-room/press-releases/2021/11/consumer-reports-new-annual-auto-reliability-data-reveals-safest-bets-and-riskiest-choices-among-new-vehicles/">CR&#8217;s 2021 Auto Reliability Report</a> found that high-end electric SUVs are among the least-reliable vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not because their powertrains are problematic,&#8221; Fisher said. &#8220;Instead, automakers saw an opening with the early EV adopters to package the cars with all the technology they could come up with. They&#8217;re trying to differentiate the product&#8211;and justify the high cost. And that results in cars that aren&#8217;t very reliable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buggy software caused by inefficiency and coding problems are being driven by a shift — or more accurately, an acceleration — in the vehicle development cycle, according to Jason Williamson, vice president of marketing at Altia.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are used to seeing new phones every year, and automakers are trying to keep up with consumer electronics,&#8221; Williamson said. &#8220;They&#8217;re pushing to develop completely new cars in two years or less. And that means using building blocks that are maybe intended for laptops and not necessarily custom-built for automotive applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only expensive EVs that are enticing consumers with tech; it&#8217;s happening in many mid- and upscale product lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more feature bloat than software bloat,&#8221; said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for e-mobility at Guidehouse Insights. &#8220;The software is only there to make all the features work, and do we really need 30-way power adjustable seats with five massage-pattern options? Or sequential taillights, multi-zone automatic climate control and audio systems with concert hall and studio settings? The insatiable desire to one-up the competition is what&#8217;s driving this.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The crux for automakers</h2>
<p>Automakers that take the all-tech-is-good-tech option avoids the trickier, yet ultimately smarter approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hardest thing is to figure out what the feature set should be and stick to it,&#8221; said Mike Bell, senior vice president of digital at Lucid Group. &#8220;It can be easier to say, &#8216;We&#8217;re not sure what we&#8217;re doing, so we&#8217;re just going to throw in the whole kitchen sink.&#8217; The smart approach is to decide what customers actually want to do, then figure out how to give them the best experience. There shouldn&#8217;t be seven ways to do something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bell spent nearly 17 years at Apple, and recruited part of his Lucid tech team from there. He said one source of problems is that, contrary to tech company norms, automakers contract much of their software work out to suppliers. &#8220;You can&#8217;t farm it out and expect to have a good experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At Lucid, instead of buying from the tier whatevers, we do our own software and our own integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Automakers are beginning to acknowledge the new tech dominance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Launching a car now is not just about the hardware, but about the software, too&#8221; according to Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath.  He added in an interview that the ability to do over-the-air updates of that software &#8220;makes a big difference in consumer satisfaction. We can quickly respond to issues that come up.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Great expectations</h2>
<p>A major factor here is consumer expectations. It&#8217;s true that auto buyers don&#8217;t need certain features, but they do appear to want them. A November <a href="https://www.copilotsearch.com/">study from CoPilot,</a> a data-driven car-buying app, suggests that automakers are simply responding to public demand. It found that 65.7% of current lease holders expect better feature functionality in their next car or truck, and slightly more than 56% think they&#8217;ll pay about the same or less than they do for their current vehicle.</p>
<p>Similarly, a September <a href="https://www.carmax.com/articles/most-used-and-popular-car-tech-features">CarMax survey</a> of more than 1,000 car owners found that almost 50% &#8220;said they wish their current car had more tech features.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buyers in their 20s and 30s, a highly desirable demographic for automakers, were the most likely to say that tech features were &#8220;extremely important&#8221; to them as a purchase consideration. Overall, 15.9% considered the tech package extremely important; 36.7% saw it as very important; and 31.8% were in the &#8220;somewhat important&#8221; camp. Only 3.9% said it was &#8220;not at all&#8221; important.</p>
<p>Given the chip shortage, tech expectations are not likely to be met.</p>
<p>Pat Ryan, CEO and founder of CoPilot, said in an interview that consumers are likely on a collision course in three areas. &#8220;First, it may take three to six months just to get a car, and people aren&#8217;t used to that,&#8221; Ryan said. &#8220;The second issue is that shoppers may find that their new car actually has fewer features than the one they&#8217;re turning in.</p>
<p>Premium sound, wireless charging, even heated seats may not be available because of the chip shortage. And people used to paying maybe 95% of the sticker price may find themselves hit with stickerplus.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the desire for high-tech cars is not likely to go away. Jessica Caldwell, executive director, Insights, at Edmunds, told TechCrunch that automakers are touting their cars and trucks as multi-purpose offices and living spaces on wheels, and buyers are appreciative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers are enjoying the growing number of features and amenities, and most importantly are willing to pay for these highly contented vehicles,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The chip shortage has made it challenging to produce models with more options and features, but the consumer interest is still there. And as long as there&#8217;s a consumer appetite, automakers will find a way to feed it for the sake of their own profits and market share.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">From turkeys to gasoline, clothes to dollar stores, nearly every avenue of human activity has been hit by the specter of inflation. Across the globe, rising inflation rates are disrupting purchasing plans and spending.</p>
<p>In the face of this inflationary inferno, consumers and institutions holding devaluing fiat currency have sought out alternatives to hedge against. Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are the current weapons of choice, driving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to embrace crypto as an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/26/gemini-executive-very-bullish-on-pure-play-bitcoin-etf-in-early-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investable asset class</a>.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has witnessed <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/23/dogecoin-is-not-good-for-the-crypto-market-ripple-ceo-says.html?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Node%20Nov%2023&amp;utm_term=The%20Node%5C" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong year-to-date returns</a>, outshining traditional hedges by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/bitcoin-vs-gold-leading-gold-authorities-on-inflation-hedge-battle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rallying</a> over 130% compared to gold’s meager 4%. In addition, increased <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/bitcoin-btc-rally-partly-driven-by-more-institutional-investors-pwc-says.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">institutional adoption</a>, sustained appetite for digital assets based on <a href="https://medium.com/coinshares/volume-57-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-28ae929f9c31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly inflows</a> and growing exposure in the media strengthened bitcoin’s case among weary investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255073" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If these are the moves being made by big money, they must be smart moves. However, while the prospect of hedging against bitcoin may seem enticing to retail investors, certain lingering question marks remain over its viability in mitigating financial risk for individuals.</p>
<h2>Miscalculated expectations</h2>
<p>The ongoing discussion of bitcoin as an inflation hedge needs to be prefaced with the fact that the currency is often susceptible to market jitters and gyrations: Bitcoin’s value plummeted over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/bitcoin-crypto-crashed-hard/">80%</a> during December 2017, by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/bitcoin-loses-half-of-its-value-in-two-day-plunge.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50%</a> in March 2020 and by another <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-price-2021-gains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53%</a> in May 2021.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s ability to improve user returns and reduce volatility over the long term has yet to be proven. Traditional hedges like gold have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/bitcoin-vs-gold-leading-gold-authorities-on-inflation-hedge-battle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated efficacy</a> in preserving purchasing power during periods of sustained high inflation — take the U.S.<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/1970s-great-inflation.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> during the 1970s</a> as an example — something bitcoin has yet to be tested on. This increased risk, in turn, makes returns subject to the drastic short-term swings that sometimes affect the currency.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			 It’s far too early to be making judgments on bitcoin being an effective hedge.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Many make the argument for bitcoin based on the fact that it’s designed for a limited supply, which supposedly protects it from devaluation compared to traditional fiat currencies. While this makes sense in theory, bitcoin’s price has been shown to be vulnerable to external influences. Bitcoin “whales” are known for their ability to manipulate prices by selling or buying in large quantities, meaning that bitcoin can be dictated by speculative forces, not solely the money-supply rule.</p>
<p>Another key consideration is regulation: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still at the mercy of regulators and wildly varying laws across jurisdictions. Anti-competitive laws and shortsighted regulations could significantly hamper the adoption of the underlying technology, potentially depreciating the asset’s price further. All this is to say one thing: It’s far too early to be making judgments on bitcoin being an effective hedge.</p>
<h2>Catering to the rich</h2>
<p>Against the background of this debate, another salient trend has been driving its momentum. As bitcoin’s popularity grows, it continues to drive adoption and institutionalization of the currency among consumers, including several wealthy individuals and corporations.</p>
<p>A recent survey found that <a href="https://ifamagazine.com/article/wisdom-tree-nearly-half-of-advised-uk-investors-look-to-independently-invest-in-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">72% of U.K. financial advisers</a> have briefed their clients about investing in crypto, with nearly half of the advisers saying they believed crypto could be used to diversify portfolios as an uncorrelated asset.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There has also been a great deal of bitcoin advocacy from prolific individuals, known for being technologically progressive, namely billionaire Wall Street investor <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/paul-tudor-jones-says-crypto-is-his-preferred-inflation-hedge-over-gold-right-now.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Tudor,</a> Twitter CEO <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2020/09/17/billionaire-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-reveals-why-bitcoin-is-the-best-internet-currency/?sh=3efcf9a6439e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Dorsey</a>, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-trade-of-the-century-predict-30x-gain-2020-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Winklevoss twins</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/novogratz-sees-bitcoin-at-100-000-with-every-company-adopting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Novogratz</a>. Even powerful companies such as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/bitcoin-goldman-sachs-ramps-up-trading-in-partnership-with-mike-novogratz-galaxy-digital.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="https://decrypt.co/86820/morgan-stanley-grayscale-bitcoin-shares-heavy-discount" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morgan Stanley</a> have expressed their interest in bitcoin as a viable asset.</p>
<p>If this momentum continues, bitcoin’s infamous volatility will gradually dissipate as more and more wealthy people and institutions hold the currency. Ironically, this accrual of value on the network would lead to the concentration of wealth — the antithesis of what bitcoin was created for, subject to the influence of the elite and exclusive <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1212/average-net-worth-of-the-1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1%</a>.</p>
<p>In line with classical schools of financial thought, this would actually expose retail investors to greater risk, as institutional buying and selling would resemble whale-like market manipulations.</p>
<h2>Defying the core ethos</h2>
<p>Bitcoin’s growing popularity will no doubt lead to more people owning it, and one can argue that the people with the most money will be the ones who are going to (as usual) end up owning most of it.</p>
<p>This noticeable shift of influence toward ultra-high-net-worth individuals and firms among bitcoin and other crypto circles goes against the very ethos that the Bitcoin white paper was based upon when it described a <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">peer-to-peer electronic cash system</a>.</p>
<p>Among the <a href="https://blog.coinfund.io/what-we-look-for-the-9-core-value-propositions-of-crypto-networks-88b04d09d873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fundamental rationales</a> for cryptocurrencies is their need to be permissionless and <a href="https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/exploring-bitcoins-core-values-and-why-we-defend-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resistant to censorship</a> and control by any given institution.</p>
<p>Now, as the 1% seeks a greater slice of the crypto pie, they boost the prices of these assets in the short term in a way that traditional and less influential retail investors are unable to.</p>
<p>While this move would undoubtedly make a few wealthier, there is an argument to be made that this might leave the market at the mercy of the 1%, contradicting Bitcoin’s intended vision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> out this week. App Annie says global spending across iOS and Google Play is up to $135 billion in 2021, and that figure will likely be higher when its annual report, including third-party app stores in China, is released next year. Consumers also downloaded 10 billion more apps this year than in 2020, reaching nearly 140 billion in new installs, it found.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that was up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254994" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3>Instagram to bring back the chronological feed</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2188260" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188260" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188260" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg 1611w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/instagram-icon-ios-closeup.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188260" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/instagram-chronological-feed/">said it will begin testing a new feature</a> that will allow users to select between three different feeds: the current algorithmically generated timeline as well as two new options, Favorites and Following, which are sorted chronologically. This is similar to the Recent &amp; Favorites section that Facebook today offers &#8212; though that version is buried in the app&#8217;s More menu, making it difficult to access. It&#8217;s unclear how easy it will be to access Instagram&#8217;s new feed options &#8212; especially given the app&#8217;s growing clutter and strategic priorities. The latter even saw Instagram shifting its critical &#8220;post&#8221; button to an out-of-reach spot to give the prime real estate in the app&#8217;s navigation to Instagram&#8217;s Reels instead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feed changes were announced following a Senate hearing where Instagram head Adam Mosseri testified for the first time. The hearing had focused on the app&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">teen safety track record</a> but often branched into other areas, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-says-teen-accounts-created-on-the-web-dont-default-to-private/">like user privacy</a>, and to what extent users were being &#8220;manipulated by algorithms,&#8221; as one Senator put it. Mosseri had then responded by saying the company was developing a feature that would allow consumers to choose to view a chronological feed. In other words, it&#8217;s likely this &#8220;test&#8221; will soon evolve into a public-facing feature for all users, in order to deflect further pressure from Congress over the matter.</p>
<p>Although users have clamored for an option or full-on return to a chronological feed for some time, Instagram ignored those demands until now &#8212; when it&#8217;s a topic of legislative inquiry. That fact indicates the need for increased tech regulations as it proves companies won&#8217;t listen to user demands unless pressured to do so.</p>
<h3>South Korea blocks new &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; (P2E) games</h3>
<p>The South Korean government&#8217;s Game Management Committee in the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism (or GMC for short) has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/korean-government-tells-apple-and-google-stores-to-take-down-p2e-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked the major app stores to block any games</a> that require an in-app purchase before users play. The games, which have become popular in the crypto industry, often require that players first purchase game pieces as NFT. Players can then compete for in-game rewards and prizes, giving them the name &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; (or P2E). The GMC said it asked the app stores to remove the existing P2E games on the market and block the release of new ones.</p>
<p>The changes follow other difficulties for these types of games in South Korea, which have been battling in the courts to get age ratings required to be listed in the domestic app stores. The government limits in-game rewards to 10,000 Korean won (~$8.40), but some of the games&#8217; cashouts exceed that figure but were being listed anyway &#8212; which would technically be illegal.</p>
<p>The government views this genre of gaming as a money-making scheme and is now taking a harsher stance to get them removed from the app stores and out of kids&#8217; hands, in particular. In addition to penalizing games themselves, the new restrictions may impact other titles associated with <a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games</a> in this genre, like those tied to games like Axie Infinity and Splinterlands.</p>

<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=pa0x2dzk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> App Analytics for in-app events.</strong> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/in-app-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Events</a> are a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/07/this-week-in-apps-in-app-events-hit-the-app-store-tiktok-tries-stories-apple-reveals-new-child-safety-plan/">newer</a> feature that allow developers to promote something happening inside their app at the present time &#8212; like game competitions, the release of seasonal features, livestreamed experiences, new movie releases and more. Now developers will be able to view information about their events&#8217; performance, including event page views, reminder and notification data, and the number of downloads and redownloads that were driven by their in-app events. This data can also be viewed by territory, source type, device and more, Apple said.</li>

Later this year, Chromebook owners will also be able to instantly set up their devices using an Android handset to port over their data and logins. Smartwatches running Wear OS 3 will also be able to unlock Android phones and Chromebooks, the way Apple Watch works today. Plus, Windows PCs and Android <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/google-brings-android-and-some-windows-pcs-closer-together/">will also work more closely</a>, Google says.</li>
<li><strong>Google also at CES introduced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/google-home-youtube-integrate-with-volvo-cars/">new integration with Volvo</a> </strong>which will allow owners to do things like turn their car on and off, control the temperature, and get car information using voice commands on Google Assistant-enabled home and Android mobile devices.</li>

Amazon is still No. 1 in the U.S., however.</li>

This is maybe even more impressive than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen/">that Disney filter</a>?</li>

<h2>Fintech/Crypto</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Messaging app Signal&#8217;s cryptocurrency feature seemed to have quietly launched to worldwide users</strong> in mid-November, but was only picked up on this past week. The feature, which was previously being tested in the U.K., integrates with a privacy-focused cryptocurrency called MobileCoin. Signal users can now send MobileCoin to others in the app worldwide. MobileCoin founder Josh Goldbard <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-cryptocurrency-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed the rollout to Wired</a>, noting Signal&#8217;s adoption helped the cryptocurrency jump to thousands of daily transactions compared with just dozens before the global release.</li>
<li><strong>Spare change investing app <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-06/acorns-moves-onto-robinhood-s-turf-with-direct-stock-investing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acorns is inching into Robinhood territory</a></strong> with its plan to build a feature that allows users to customize their own stock portfolios instead of just using Acorns&#8217; own ETFs.</li>
<li><strong>China&#8217;s WeChat will <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/chinas-digital-currency-comes-to-tencents-wechat-in-expansion-push.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">begin supporting the digital yuan</a> (e-CNY),</strong> the country’s sovereign digital currency that&#8217;s been in the works since 2014. The move would bring the currency to WeChat Pay&#8217;s over 800 million MAUs.</li>
<li><strong>Apptopia revealed the <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/10-most-downloaded-finance-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top finance apps for 2021</a>, including to 10 most downloaded crypto apps</strong> &#8212; a list that was led by Binance, Crypto.com, and Coinbase.</li>

<li><strong>Twitter released a handful of new features this week,</strong> including its own take on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/twitter-tweet-takes-video-replies/">TikTok&#8217;s video reactions </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/twitter-spaces-continues-testing-podcast-like-features/">updated Spaces features</a>, including the ability for hosts to see how many listeners joined live and how many replayed the Space after the fact.</li>

<li><strong>Snap is suing the USPTO for rejecting its application to trademark the word &#8220;spectacles&#8221;</strong> for its digital AR glasses.

<li><strong>Instagram was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/instagram-is-testing-private-likes-on-stories-with-select-users/">spotted testing</a> a new Stories feature that would allow users to &#8220;like&#8221; each other&#8217;s stories, but privately.</strong> Only the person who had posted the Story would be able to see the total number of likes and that there were not any plans to make the like count public.</li>
<li><strong>Tumblr <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/">has been getting in trouble with Apple&#8217;s App Review</a> over the mature content in its app,</strong> leading it to new crackdowns that have confused Tumblr users. The company had been struggling to remove content featuring pornography, sex and other adult material from its iOS app, amid constant App Store rejections. It seems Tumblr&#8217;s own system requiring blogs to be labeled as &#8220;adult&#8221; wasn&#8217;t getting the job done to keep this sort of content out of the hands of iOS users. Complicating matters is how Apple&#8217;s review system works. Apple randomly assigns an app review to whoever is available at the time instead of allowing a company to work with an Apple employee on a more direct basis to solve a specific problem. That leads to inconsistent responses based on how each reviewer interprets Apple&#8217;s rules or their overall thoroughous. For Tumblr, it&#8217;s meant a lot of jumping through hoops to try to get its app cleaned up enough to be allowed back in the App Store.</li>

The growth took place among government crackdowns on local tech companies.</li>

<p>Consumers worldwide downloaded <a href="https://www.oculus.com/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta’s Oculus app</a>, the mobile companion for Oculus VR devices including the Quest 2, roughly 2 million times globally since Christmas Day, according to new data from third-party app intelligence firms Apptopia and Sensor Tower. Already, there had been some indication that the Quest 2 was a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/27/metas-oculus-virtual-reality-headsets-were-a-popular-holiday-gift.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popular holiday gift</a> after the Oculus app <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/12/27/win-meta-oculus-app-tops-app-store-rankings-christmas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shot to the top of the Apple App Store</a> for the first time ever on Christmas Day and became the most popular free app on Google Play in the U.S., as well.</p>
<p>During the week of Christmas in the U.S. (December 23-29), adoption of the Oculus app jumped up by 517% week-over-week to reach 1.5 million installs, <a href="https://sensortower.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensor Tower’s</a> data indicates.</p>
<p>In the week that followed, the firm saw those installs drop 77% to 345,000 from December 30 through January 5, but this figure is still higher than the week before Christmas 2021 by 42%. And it’s likely that these more recent downloads still include those who recently received a new Oculus device for the holidays, but hadn’t gotten around to setting it up yet.</p>
<p>While the U.S. accounted for the majority of the post-Christmas installs, app intelligence firms estimate that, in total, the app has seen around 2 million global installs from Christmas Day through the present across the App Store and Google Play combined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>In April 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/nextview-ventures-is-launching-a-remote-accelerator-for-startups/">NextView VC launched its debut accelerator</a> in the thick of the pandemic, while historical incubators like Y Combinator and 500 Startups were similarly rethinking their independent strategies. Key tweaks like making batches fully remote and scrapping the cohort model gave us a peek at how some of the most active pre-seed and seed investors were rethinking their jobs.</p>
<p>Fast-forward perhaps too many months, NextView partner Melody Koh tells me the accelerator <a href="https://nextview.vc/accelerator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is launching its third cohort </a>with some key tweaks, again signaling some interesting changes for the seed-stage startup scene.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254685" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The first big change is that NextView is growing its check size from $200,000 for an 8% ownership stake to $400,000 for a 10% ownership stake. Big check sizes in this economy are anything but surprising, but Koh’s perspective is that the cash will “arm companies with just a little bit more ammunition that can really set them up.” Beyond market pressure, the firm realized they were the only funding sources for a lot of cohort startups — which meant they had to make larger initial investments to truly get these companies to follow on funding.</p>
<p>“It just provides a little bit more flexibility and the ability for teams to really experiment and execute and kind of get to the next stage of the milestones that this market now is looking for,” she added. So far, more than 50% of the NextView accelerator alumni identify as underrepresented founders and come from cities including Miami, Seattle, Boston, Birmingham, San Diego and New York.</p>
<p>Considering its distributed format, the firm has had to update its mentorship. This time around, it is pairing each of its six to eight batch startups with a primary partner for weekly meetings and a secondary for monthly meetings. The former will give the company a more on-going resource while they’re in the weeds and is a result of feedback NextView has seen from previous cohorts. The more involved partnership model could bring startup founders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/18/more-than-another-check-founders-need-activation-energy/">more activation energy</a> when they need it most.</p>
<p>And finally, the firm is doubling down on its no demo day rule. Part of the argument here is that the idea of an annual, flashy event may no longer be necessary for founders to land coveted attention.</p>
<p>“We don&#8217;t feel like the artificial kind of deadlines, and the demo day date format is the best use of your time,” Koh said. “The way we engage with every company is … ‘OK each of you has a different set of milestones that make sense for you,&#8217; so we don&#8217;t really focus on demo day as the right way to expend their energy or our energy.”</p>
<p>NextView isn’t alone in rethinking demo days and its broader investing strategy. Firms like Contrary Capital and startups like Launch House are similarly looking for smarter ways to land deals and propel startups.</p>
<p>Even in a world where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/capital-is-a-commodity/">capital is a commodity</a>, investors are preparing — perhaps even more so — to find innovative ways to make their cash even more worth it to founders. “Value add” chatter can be cringey at times, but to me it just signals that an emerging class of investors are figuring out what they’re best at (beyond spotting ambitious founders). That’s fun to see, and even something as small as a tweak on accelerator format can give us something to think about.</p>

I spoke to the nonprofit board that decided to place her on leave, former employees who allege rising tensions between Bryant and the organization, and of course, Bryant herself to get the full story.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>There’s too much nuance in this story to sum it all up in a perfect blurb, so I’d really recommend those interested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/kimberly-bryant-suspended-black-girls-code/">to read the entire story.</a> As of now, the board claims it has formed a special committee to review complaints against Bryant from former and current employees and put Bryant on paid administrative leave last week “to ensure a full and fair review process.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Much has changed about the way launch pads for startups look, feel and show value today. The earliest investors are rethinking signaling risk, dilution and even the worth of a traditional demo day.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even to outsiders, the inner workings of startup accelerators has become familiar: pumped up on camaraderie and energy drinks, scrappy founders do product demos onstage before a room full of buzzy journalists and investors.</p>
<p>Fast-forward two years into a pandemic and, even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/founders-hacker-hype-homes-remote-work/">a stint with the return of hacker homes,</a> much has changed about the way launch pads for startups look, feel and show value today. The earliest investors are rethinking signaling risk, dilution and, most surprisingly, the worth of a traditional demo day.</p>
<h2>Pro rata</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a juicy topic: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/13/how-pro-rata-works-in-venture-capital-deals/">pro rata</a>.</p>
<p>Signaling risk happens when a VC chooses to not do pro rata, or follow-on investing, in an existing portfolio company. The idea is that investors who know you best — the ones who bet on you earlier than others — are choosing not to invest in you in your next phase of growth, which must mean that the deal isn’t that great. Negative perception can trickle down to other investors who, despite what their Twitter bios will tell you, are pretty risk-averse folks.</p>
<p>Accelerators have an interesting role to play here. If an accelerator like Y Combinator ever gets to host 1,000 startups per batch, an automatic pro-rata investment in each startup would be both capital-intensive and perhaps unintentionally dilute its own signal. Like clockwork, in 2020, the accelerator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/changing-policy-y-combinator-cuts-its-pro-rata-stake-and-makes-investments-case-by-case/">changed its policy on automatic pro-rata investments</a> and chose to invest on a case-by-case basis, just like 500 Startups.</p>
<p>“We have significantly exceeded the funds we raised for pro ratas, and the investors who support YC do not have the appetite to fund the pro rata program at the same scale,” the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/changing-policy-y-combinator-cuts-its-pro-rata-stake-and-makes-investments-case-by-case/">accelerator wrote in a post then.</a> “In addition, processing hundreds of follow-on rounds per year has created significant operational complexities for YC that we did not anticipate.</p>
<p>“Said simply, investing in every round for every YC company requires more capital than we want to raise and manage. We always tell startups to stay small and manage their budgets carefully. In this instance, we failed to follow our own advice.”</p>
