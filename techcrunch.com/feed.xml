										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Workspace</a>, the company&#8217;s productivity platform you&#8217;ll forever refer to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/g-suite-is-now-google-workspace/">as G Suite</a> (or even &#8216;Google Docs&#8217;), is launching a large update today that touches everything from your calendar to Google Meet and how you can use Workspace with the Google Assistant.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119041" style="width: 321px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Assistant-in-Workspace.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119041" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2119041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Assistant-in-Workspace.gif" alt="" width="311" height="640" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Indeed, the highlight here is probably that you can now use the Assistant in combination with Google Workspace, allowing you to check your work calendar or send a message to your colleagues. Until now, this feature was available in beta and ever after it goes live, your company&#8217;s admins will have to turn on the &#8220;Search and Assistant&#8221; service. And this is a bit of a slow rollout, too, with this capability now being generally available on mobile but still in beta for smart speakers and displays like Google&#8217;s own Nest Hub. Still, it&#8217;s been a long time coming, given that Google promised these features a very long time ago now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other new feature that will directly influence your day-to-day work is support for recurring out-of-office entries and segmentable working hours, as well as a new event type, Focus Time, to help you minimize distractions. Focus Time is a bit cleverer than the three-hour blocks of time you may block off on your calendar anyway in that limits notifications during those event windows. Google is also launching a new analytics feature that tells you how much time you waste spend in meetings. This isn&#8217;t quite as fully featured (and potentially creepy) as Microsoft&#8217;s Productivity Score, since it only displays how much time you spend in meetings, but it&#8217;s a nice overview of how you spend your days (though you know that already). None of this data is shared with your managers.</p>
<p>For when you go back to an office, Google is also adding location indicators to Workspace so you can share when you will be working from there and when you&#8217;ll be working from home.</p>
<p>And talking about meetings, since most of these remain online for the time being, Google is adding a few new features that now allow those of you who use their Google Nest Hub Max to host meetings at home and a laptop to set up their own second-screen experiences. What&#8217;s far more important, though, is that when you join a meeting on mobile, Google will now implement a picture-in-picture mode so you can be in that Meet meeting on your phone and still browse the web Gmail and get important work done during that brainstorming session.</p>
<p>Mobile support for <a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/10058482?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">background replace</a> is also coming, as well as the addition of Q&amp;As and polls on mobile. Currently, you can only blur your background on mobile.</p>

<p>For frontline workers, Google is adding something it calls Google Workspace Frontline, with new features for this group of users, and it is also making it easier for users to build custom AppSheet apps from Google Sheets and Drive, &#8220;so that frontline workers can digitize and streamline their work, whether it&#8217;s collecting data in the field, reporting safety risks, or managing customer requests.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://zetaglobal.com">Zeta Global</a>, the marketing technology company founded by David A. Steinberg and former Apple CEO John Sculley, is announcing an additional $222.5 million in new debt financing.</p>
<p>The company has gone down the debt route before — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/marketing-tech-company-zeta-global-raises-140m-at-a-1-3-billion-valuation/">a Series F raised in 2017</a> combined $115 million funding with $25 million in debt. BofA Securities served as lead arranger and bookrunner for the new financing, with participation from Barclays, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding.</p>
<p>“For this round, we were able to both refinance our debt and add in a large amount of capacity for current operations and future initiatives,” Steinberg (Zeta’s CEO) told me via email. “We were able to work with our syndicate to capture a low interest-rate and take advantage of the strong credit markets.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company emphasizes its data-driven approach to marketing, combining companies’ first-party data with artificial intelligence and what it says are more than 2.4 billion customer identifiers. Steinberg said this approach has only become more crucial, with 2020 delivering “a five-year acceleration” as brands face the challenge of “digitally transforming their business structure to be data-centric.”</p>
<p>“Zeta’s capabilities are helping marketers engage customers across the entire digital ecosystem more intelligently and efficiently, with individualized messages, offers, and content by way of our identity-based data and predictive AI,” Steinberg continued. “Our challenge is to continue to keep up with our customers’ needs and maintain our competitive advantage around data and AI.”</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s funding announcement notes that previous loans have been used to finance acquisitions and integrations, including co<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">mmenting platform Disqus</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/zeta-global-acquires-boomtrain-to-bring-more-machine-learning-to-its-marketing-automation-platform/">machine learning-powered marketing platform Boomtrain</a>. Asked whether this new debt will also be used for acquisitions, Steinberg said the company continues to “organically innovate,” with a focus on its customer data platform and connected TV capabilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wondering how to nail that virtual pitch meeting and raise VC funding? Or how to build a high-octane sales team? What about recruiting early team members that will fuel future growth? Managing the finances of a new company while also wondering about your own personal finances as a founder? Legal? Marketing? PR?

<p>The answer to every single one of these questions, and many more, will be at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=startupbootcamppost">TechCrunch&#8217;s Early Stage events</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's see what we can learn about Coinbase's recent trading volume before looking into Robinhood's. Is Robinhood crypto a possible threat to Coinbase's consumer trading volumes?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The impending <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/coinbase-files-to-go-public-in-a-key-listing-for-the-cryptocurrency-category/">Coinbase direct listing</a> is a fintech debut to watch. The cryptocurrency-focused consumer trading concern is set to become a public company on the back of a strong 2020, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">a particularly strong final quarter</a>.</p>
<p>And it appears that the company is also having a strong kickoff in 2021. What Coinbase is worth is therefore hard to guess, though some are trying, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/if-coinbase-is-worth-100-billion-whats-a-fair-valuation-for-stripe/">as we&#8217;ve noticed</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But Coinbase is hardly the only company enjoying a crypto bounce: Robinhood, another American consumer fintech we&#8217;ve spent too much time discussing in recent weeks, is also riding a wave in its users&#8217; cryptocurrency activity.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Between both companies, we&#8217;re seeing signs of the sort of growing consumer interest and trading volume that has historically come with sustained periods of bitcoin price expansion. But Coinbase charges fees for trading, while Robinhood doesn&#8217;t. And transaction fee-based incomes are the vast majority of Coinbase&#8217;s revenues &#8212; 96% in calendar 2020, for example.</p>
<p>The situation sets up an interesting contrast.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s see what we can learn about Coinbase&#8217;s recent trading volume before looking into Robinhood&#8217;s. And finally, we&#8217;ll remind ourselves of how Coinbase talked about Robinhood in its S-1 filing. Is Robinhood crypto a possible threat to Coinbase&#8217;s consumer trading volumes? Let&#8217;s tinker.</p>
<h2>An argument called forever</h2>
<p>Kicking off with Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/">The Block&#8217;s Frank Chaparro</a> got us thinking this morning <a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/status/1366395196095795206">by tweeting</a> the following chart:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2118962" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png 729w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>You can see why the chart caught our eye. Now, we can&#8217;t reproduce the same chart on <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/">CryptoCompare</a>, as the tool required sits behind a locked door. But we can, however, leverage other services to confirm the gist of the image.</p>
<p>Other data agrees: historical trading information <a href="https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-pro#chart">via Nomics</a> shows a steep rise in 2021 bitcoin trading on Coinbase Pro, a piece of the larger Coinbase empire. And Bitcoinity <a href="https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/2y?c=c&amp;exchange=coinbase&amp;r=week&amp;t=a">shows similar gains for Coinbase</a> trading volumes over the same time period.</p>
<p>Chaparro is correct that the data paints a compelling Q1 2021 revenue story for Coinbase. But it&#8217;s not the only company that is seeing crypto demand spike.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/doubling-up-on-instagram-live-with-live-rooms/">announced</a> it&#8217;s adding a much-requested feature to its app with the launch of &#8220;Live Rooms,&#8221; which allow up to four people to broadcast live together at the same time. Previously, the app only allowed users to live stream with one other person, similar <a href="https://www.facebook.com/formedia/solutions/facebook-live">to Facebook Live</a>. The company says it hopes Live Rooms will open up more creative opportunities in terms of live broadcast formats to allow for things like live talk shows, expanded Q&amp;A&#8217;s or interviews, jam sessions for musicians, live shopping experiences, and more.</p>
<p>In addition to the ability to live stream with more people, Instagram also touts how the new feature can help creators to make more money. Last year, in the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/instagram-to-test-new-revenue-streams-including-badges-and-igtv-ads/">Instagram introduced badges</a> as a way for fans to support their favorite creators during a live video. Once purchased, the badges appear next to a fan&#8217;s name throughout the live video, helping them to stand out in the comments and unlock other special features, like placement on the creator&#8217;s list of badge holders and access to a special heart.</p>
<p>Badges became more broadly available <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/">last fall</a>, at three price points: $0.99, $1.99, or $4.99.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Live Rooms, fans can buy badges to support the hosts (one badge per person) as well as use other interactive features like Shopping and Live Fundraisers. The company says it&#8217;s also now developing other tools, like moderator controls and audio features that will roll out in the months to come.</p>
<p>To start a Live Room, you&#8217;ll swipe left and select the Live camera option, then title the Room and tap the Room icon to add guests. Here, you&#8217;ll see a list of people who&#8217;ve already requested to go live with you and you&#8217;ll be able to search for other guests to add.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118989" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118989" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118989" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118989" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>When you start the Live Room, you&#8217;ll remain at the top of the screen while guests are added. The guests can be added all at once or individually, depending on your preference. This allows for opportunities to add &#8220;surprise guests&#8221; to live streams to keep fans engaged.</p>
<p>The ability to add more guests to a live stream can also help a creator grow their follower base, as all the guests&#8217; followers are notified about the Live Room, in addition to your own.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, any person that&#8217;s been blocked by any of the Live Room participants will not have access to join the live stream. Plus, any guests who have previously had their live access revoked due to violations of Instagram&#8217;s Community Guidelines won&#8217;t be able to join any Live Rooms.</p>
<p>During live broadcasts, the hosts can also report and block comments and use comment filters to maintain a safer experience for all viewers.</p>
<p>Live broadcasts became an increasingly important way for creators, business owners and brands to stay connected with followers during the pandemic, which shut down in-person live events, including concerts, shows, classes, conferences, meetups, and more. Instagram reported a 70% increase in Live views from February to March, for instance, as creators and businesses shifted their work online.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118990" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118990" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118990" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png 2160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-2.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118990" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>As the pandemic wore on throughout 2020 and into 2021, the lack of in-person connection has allowed for other opportunities and even new social networks to grow. Live audio platform Clubhouse, for example, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">seen rapid adoption</a>, particularly by the tech and creative crowds, who today use the app to tune into live shows, chat sessions, and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/">big-name interviews</a>. Twitter is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">building</a> a rival, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html">reportedly</a>, so is Facebook.</p>
<p>But while Clubhouse offers a very different experience, it still operates in the same broader space of allowing fans to connect with high-profile individuals of some sort &#8212; entrepreneurs and founders, celebrities, market experts, thought leaders, influencers, and so on. And because users&#8217; time is limited, seeing this type of activity shift to non-Facebook owned platforms is likely of concern to Instagram and its parent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the live video broadcasting space, Instagram today faces a number of competitors, from those focused on a particular niche &#8212; like game streaming site Twitch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/talkshoplive-seed-funding/">live</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/">shopping</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/dote-shopping-party/">apps</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/newness-raises-3-5-million-for-its-twitch-for-beauty-streamers/">more</a>&#8212; as well as general purpose live platforms offered by YouTube and TikTok. (The latter was <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1360760548212699138">spotted offering</a> a four-up live stream format just last month, in fact.)</p>
<p>Instagram says Live Rooms are rolling out now to both iOS and Android to all global markets. The company expects the rollout to reach 100% of its user base within the week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Commission has said it will present a legislative plan later this month for what it&#8217;s calling a &#8220;digital green pass&#8221; &#8212; aka a digital certificate &#8212; which it says will be aimed at facilitating cross-border travel in the age of coronavirus.</p>
<p>President Ursula von der Leyen said today that the planned digital tool will aim to provide proof that a person has been vaccination &#8212; but not just that; the &#8216;digital green pass&#8217; will also display the results of tests, i.e. for those who have been unable to get a vaccine yet, along with information on &#8220;COVID-19 recovery&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ll present this month a legislative proposal for a Digital Green Pass. The aim is to provide:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>•Proof that a person has been vaccinated <br />•Results of tests for those who couldn’t get a vaccine yet<br />•Info on COVID19 recovery</p>
<p>It will respect data protection, security &amp; privacy</p>
<p>&mdash; Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) <a href="https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1366346729289904128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;It will respect data protection, security and privacy,&#8221; von der Leyen added in a couple of tweets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Digital Green Pass should facilitate Europeans&#8217; lives,&#8221; she also said. &#8220;The aim is to gradually enable them to move safely in the European Union or abroad &#8212; for work or tourism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission will release details of the legislative plan on March 17, per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-von-der-leyen/eu-to-propose-vaccine-certificates-in-time-for-summer-holidays-idUSKCN2AT2DN">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s executive is keen for a pan-EU system to be set up to avoid fragmentation of the bloc&#8217;s single market &#8212; such as if individual Member States strike their own bilateral deals. Or to avoid a third party commercial system gaining ground (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tech-and-health-companies-including-microsoft-and-salesforce-team-up-on-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records/">earlier this year</a> a number of tech companies announced they were working to establish a &#8216;universal&#8217; standard for vaccine status).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8ivYdkecz1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tech-and-health-companies-including-microsoft-and-salesforce-team-up-on-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records/">Tech and health companies including Microsoft and Salesforce team up on digital COVID-19 vaccination records</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech and health companies including Microsoft and Salesforce team up on digital COVID-19 vaccination records&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tech-and-health-companies-including-microsoft-and-salesforce-team-up-on-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records/embed/#?secret=8ivYdkecz1" data-secret="8ivYdkecz1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Commission is being careful to avoid calling the digital pass a &#8216;vaccine passport&#8217; &#8212; as the notion of limiting people&#8217;s freedoms based on (still very) limited access to vaccines raises the ugly spectre of discrimination.</p>
<p>At the same time the EU executive is clearly feeling pressure to help Member States &#8212; such as Greece and Spain &#8212; whose economies rely heavily on cross-border tourism. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/europe-is-working-on-a-common-framework-for-vaccine-passports/">back in January</a> it said a common approach for mutual recognition of vaccine documentation is of the &#8220;utmost importance&#8221;.</p>
<p>A pan-EU digital certification for displaying vaccine and COVID-19 test result status is the solution it&#8217;s settled on. Although it does not appear that use of the digital pass will be mandatory.</p>
<p>The Commission declined to go into further detail when contacted for comment and during a <a href="https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-202456">press briefing today</a> when it was asked for more details about the digital pass plan.</p>
<p>Another question is how quickly the planned digital certificate system could be got up and running. With the prospect of summer vacations now just a few months out the Commission will be under pressure to work quickly. At the same time &#8212; per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-von-der-leyen/eu-to-propose-vaccine-certificates-in-time-for-summer-holidays-idUSKCN2AT2DN">Reuters</a> &#8212; the Commission wants to cooperate with international organization to ensure the system works outside the EU, too.</p>
<p>Last month Apple said it was tightening up the iOS review process around vaccines passes &#8212; saying developers would now be required to work with entities recognized by public health authorities or companies associated with them prior to submitting such an app. The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56099162">BBC</a> reported that Apple had made the change &#8220;to ensure these apps responsibly handle sensitive data and provide reliable functionality&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/eu-privacy-experts-push-a-decentralized-approach-to-covid-19-contacts-tracing/">Last year</a> a number of European privacy experts mobilized to devise a decentralized privacy-safe standard for another coronavirus-related digital tool: Bluetooth-powered contact-tracing apps to estimate COVID-19 exposure risk. Although some Member States (like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/france-rebrands-contact-tracing-app-in-an-effort-to-boost-downloads/">France</a>) opted for a centralized system &#8212; despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/apple-launches-system-level-covid-19-exposure-notification-express-with-ios-13-7-google-to-follow-later-this-month/">Apple and Google</a> choosing to support only decentralized apps for contact-tracing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tonal.com">Tonal</a>, maker of the smart home fitness trainer, announced it is more than tripling the number of physical locations it sells devices in through a new partnership with Nordstrom.</p>
<p>Starting this month, Tonal will have 50-square-foot stations in the women’s activewear departments of at least 40 Nordstrom locations across the U.S., bringing the total number of Tonal physical locations to 60 by the end of 2021. Shoppers will be able to walk in or book appointments to try Tonal devices and purchase them through employees on-hand.</p>
<p>“As we looked to expand our retail footprint and strategy, we looked to the retail landscape, and we really feel like Nordstrom says ‘best-in-class’ — the department store is well-suited to succeed in a COVID and post-COVID world,” explained Christopher Stadler, Tonal’s CMO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tonal, which manufactures a wall-mounted device with a digital weight system that emulates various traditional gym stations, already operates 16 locations across the country with devices shoppers can try and work out to, with plans to open four additional showrooms later this year. But the partnership with Nordstrom, which expects <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstrom-eyes-billions-in-new-sales-in-a-post-covid-19-recovery-203849515.html">overall sales growth of 25%</a> in 2021, marks a first-of-its-kind for at-home fitness makers. Peloton, for instance, operates a larger network of dedicated showrooms in the U.S., Canada, Germany and the UK, but it has yet to partner with an outside retailer to display and demo its bikes and treadmills.</p>

<p>Tonal’s physical expansion arrives amid a boom in demand for at-home equipment during the pandemic. According to Stadler, sales of Tonal equipment surged 800% from December 2019 to December 2020, causing 10-12 week wait times for deliveries. Those delays are somewhat comparable to Peloton, which has also faced significant delivery wait times in recent months and currently reports 6-10 week delays — an issue Peloton CEO John Foley acknowledged and apologized for in a note to users.</p>
<p>Tonal, for its part, is working to address shipment delays. According to Stadler, the startup has significantly ramped up production of devices, increased employee headcount, and in some cases, now air-ships equipment from Taiwan to the U.S. to meet demand.</p>
<p>“We have seen extraordinary demand for Tonal, and we’re working aggressively around the clock to produce, deliver and install Tonals faster and faster,” says Stadler. “We’ve absolutely ramped up production, and all facets of the organization are rallying to deliver our customer orders as quickly as we can.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few things are more personal than a keyboard and yet they are often overlooked by Work From Home guides. Why use the standard issue keyboard when there are so many options available? This is a sampling of some of the keyboards used by TechCrunch’s editorial staff. Some are boring, some are for different languages, and each one is kind of dirty.</p>
<p>Excuse the dust, grim, and general dirtiness of the following. Keyboards are gross and hard to clean and we did the best we could getting our keyboards photo-ready. I used two cans of air on my keyboard and it still looks like a toy in a preschool sandbox.</p>

<p>Working across borders is hard — working across languages is even harder. So getting a foreign language keyboard (mine is Korean) has been a godsend, if only because after two decades of using a computer, I still peck at a keyboard like I don’t know the location of the keys.</p>
<p>Now, should you get a foreign language keyboard? Good god no. Certainly don’t buy it overseas like I originally did when I was a foreign correspondent in Seoul, since apparently warranties don’t transfer globally. Also, the E key finally busted on my last “space white” keyboard (unfortunately, E is about as common in English as ㄷ/ㄸ is in Korean so that key gets a lot of abuse), and let’s just say the world is not designed to special order individual keys in a foreign language in the United States.</p>
<p>So I bought a new space grey keyboard. And then Apple said they couldn’t find a replacement Korean keyboard E key in white, so they gave me a free keyboard because Apple is nice. So now I have two space grey Korean keyboards, one on my desk and one sitting in storage for when I invariably destroy the one I’m typing this on. Don’t buy a foreign language keyboard. Actually, don’t buy a keyboard at all. Certainly don’t be a writer. Just yell in a Clubhouse room and let’s move to the next, post-text century.</p>

<p>I just acquired this <a href="https://en.varmilo.com/keyboardproscenium/">Varmilo</a> V87M tenkeyless with PBT keycaps and Cherry Red switches. It&#8217;s got a great solid feel and is very comfortable to type on, and has a deeper sound than some more clacky keyboards I&#8217;ve used. But I don&#8217;t like the placement of the media keys.</p>
<p>Before this I had an all-black Ducky One with side-printed key labels, which I much prefer. But I ordered it with Cherry Black switches, which it turns out are uncomfortable for me to use &#8211; they take a bit more force and have a sort of &#8220;bump&#8221; in the middle, and my body didn&#8217;t like it. I did, however, like the DIY feel of adjusting the dipswitches and programming the media keys in as well, though I totally get it&#8217;s not for everyone.</p>
<p>I wish that I could combine the feel and build of the Varmilo with the keycaps and customizability of the Ducky and the media controls of the Das Keyboard 4, with its lovely volume wheel. But I&#8217;m tempted by non-Cherry switches now that their patents have expired and the market is wide open. Someone send me one of those little switch samplers!</p>

<p>Here’s my boring Apple keyboard. It’s a French keyboard so it’s going to look all weird if you’ve used QWERTY keyboards your entire life. It works, it’s reliable and I can type for hours and hours… The most important part is that I don’t think about it so I can just focus on what I’m writing.</p>

<p>The fact that Apple charges $149 for its wireless space grey Magic Keyboard when the silver variant goes for $129 might seem like an oddity for a company worth $2.2 trillion, but maybe the fact that they have suckered a rube like myself into paying an extra $20 for a dark grey colorway is the reason they have achieved such ridiculous success.</p>
<p>In recent years, Apple has opted to stay conservative with the entry prices for some of their hardware but they have also begun jacking up the prices of accessories for those devices. My desire to have an external keyboard that matched all of my other tech stuff says more about me than it does Apple, but come on Tim, do you really need that extra $20 from me?</p>

<p>I bought this keyboard when I built my new PC last month. I generally use an Apple keyboard for work and mostly game with a PS4 controller so I hadn’t used it much. But a few weeks ago I spilled coffee on my main keyboard for the first time in my life. I tried to used a Logitech K380 I have as a substitute but even though it’s pretty new a few of its keys squeak which makes me feel crazy.</p>
<p>Now I’ve subbed in my admittedly beautiful rainbow machine the Cooler Master SK622 as my day to day keyboard. It’s my first mechanical keyboard! I went with blue switches because I don’t like the feel of the red ones, but it is a bit hard to get used to the noise. Ideally I’d probably prefer brown switches! It feels pretty good though, even for someone (me) who types pretty fast but in a very wacky way because I never learned to do it the right way.

<p>There&#8217;s not much to say about the tool of my trade &#8211; except that it could do with a good clean. The white is definitely not as crisp as Apple would like at this point. The lettering on the &#8216;S&#8217; key has also worn a bit for some reason. Other than that I&#8217;ve no complaints. I had to stop relying on the MBP laptop keyboard because it&#8217;s so faulty (sticky &#8216;B&#8217; and &#8216;N&#8217; keys which either don&#8217;t type or double type in faulty keyboard roulette). I like the Magic keyboard&#8217;s compact size. The battery also lasts a decent amount of time before you have to go hunting for overpriced Apple dongles in order to juice it back up.</p>
<p>I have one complaint: The Bluetooth connection seems to go a bit funky after a while because hitting CAPS Lock can fire up the MBP&#8217;s spinning wheel &#8216;o death for no good reason. Switching the keyboard&#8217;s Bluetooth off and back on and again seems to restore order.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://www.hhkeyboard.com">Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2</a> with a partial set of custom keycaps. Yes, long name for a small keyboard. It’s not perfect and yet I love it. Don’t worry. It still has a number pad and media controls. These are accessed through a function key (the heart).</p>
<p>The Happy Hacking Keyboard has a longer history than most, originally designed for Unix programmers. For me, the small size is perfect for just typing, and the keys feel lovely thanks to its novel switches. This keyboard uses Topre capacitive key switches, which combine the feel of a mechanical switch with the responsiveness of a membrane-based keyboard. The result are resounding clicks and clacks, and keys that are resistant at the top and easy at the bottom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are several newer versions of this keyboard with wireless connectivity and quieter key switches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Atlanta startups can now add another name to their rolodexes of venture firms operating out of the Big Peach with the close of Silicon Road Ventures new $31 million fund.</p>
<p>Silicon Road invests across the U.S. from its base in Atlanta, the firm said with a focus on e-commerce, retail, and consumer packaged goods.</p>
<p>The firm said it&#8217;s focused on in-store retail and technology for shoppers, the multi-channel commerce world, supply chain and logistics technologies and financial technologies and payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded two years ago, the fund invested in ten startups over the course of 2020 and is targeting another twenty for its first fund.</p>
<p>The firm hopes that entrepreneurs find its &#8220;corporate connect&#8221; program to be a key differentiator, which relies on founder and managing partner Sid Mookerji&#8217;s experience in e-commerce, retail and consumer packaged goods to link corporations to relevant startups and research, according to a statement.</p>
<p>Silicon Road is already working with the upstart retail chain Citizen Supply, which provides a highly curated marketplace to showcase new consumer brands.</p>
<p>Mookerji previously founded Software Paradigms International Group, which was one of the first retail IT companies offering a suite of products designed to optimize omni-channel strategies. The company&#8217;s clients included Macy&#8217;s, Walmart, Carrefour, and NAPA.</p>
<p>Joining Mookerji is managing director and partner, Ross Kimbel, a former co-founder of Be Curious Partners and a global director of innovation and entrepreneurship at The Coca-Cola Company. curated engagements between portfolio companies and major retailers and brands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the members only event series that features tech leaders waxing poetic on how to perfect the pitch deck (and more!) has gotten off to a strong start in 2021. Thus far, we&#8217;ve seen the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/28/justworks-series-b-pitch-deck-may-be-the-most-wonderfully-simple-deck-ive-ever-seen/">most beautifully simple deck in existence with the help of Justworks&#8217; Isaac Oates and Bain&#8217;s Matt Harris</a>, learned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/pitch-decks-pricing-and-how-to-nail-the-narrative-with-lightspeeds-gaurav-gupta-and-grafanas-raj-dutt/">how to nail the narrative with Lightspeed&#8217;s Gaurav Gupta and Grafana&#8217;s Raj Dutt</a>, heard about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/ironclads-jason-boehmig-the-objective-of-pricing-is-to-become-less-wrong-over-time/">perils of pricing with Accel&#8217;s Steve Loughlin and Ironclad&#8217;s Jason Boehmig</a>, and learned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/felicis-aydin-senkut-and-guidelines-kevin-busque-on-the-value-of-simple-pitch-decks/">the value of simple pitch decks with Felicis&#8217; Aydin Senkut and Guideline&#8217;s Kevin Busque</a>.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s only the beginning. We&#8217;ve got a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/check-out-the-incredible-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-march/">packed slate coming your way in March</a>, featuring Cleo Capital&#8217;s Sarah Kunst, PlanetFWD&#8217;s Julia Collins, Flourish Ventures&#8217; Emmalyn Shaw, Steady&#8217;s Adam Roseman, Mayfield&#8217;s Navin Chaddha, and Poshmark&#8217;s Manish Chandra.</p>
<p>One of the beautiful things about Extra Crunch Live is the Pitch Deck Teardown. Our esteemed speakers take a look at pitch decks <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submitted by the audience</a> and give their live feedback. It&#8217;s an invaluable way to understand how VCs and founders alike think about what makes a great deck.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The importance of the pitch deck can’t be underestimated. It is often the first point of contact between a company and venture investors, but how investors consume a pitch deck (and what they <em>really</em> think) is also a bit of a black box.</p>
<p>Are they speed-flipping through the slides or taking their time? Do they prefer more information on the team or context on the industry? More numbers or more words? How many slides is the right number of slides?</p>
<p>There are too many questions to count, and often very few answers. But we’re popping the lid off of that black box with the Pitch Deck Teardown.</p>
<p>If this seems like a good fit for you, you can <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit your pitch deck to be featured on Extra Crunch Live right here</a>. (We prioritize decks submitted by Extra Crunch members, but anyone can send us a deck and we&#8217;ll take a look at as many as possible!)</p>
<p>See you on the next episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S.-based oil major Chevron is doubling down on its investment in geothermal power by investing in a Swedish developer of low-temperature geothermal and heat power projects called Baseload Capital.</p>
<p>Oil companies are under pressure to find new lines of business as the world prepares for a massive shift to renewable energy resources to power all aspects of industry in the face of mounting climate-related disasters caused by greenhouse gas emissions warming the temperature on the planet.</p>
<p>Joining Chevron in the investment was the ubiquitous billionaire-backed clean energy investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures and a Swedish investment group called Gullspang Invest AB.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment into Baseload follows closely on the heels of another commitment that Chevron made to the geothermal technology developer <a href="https://eavor.com/">Eavor</a> and a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/geothermal-home-heating-gets-a-30-million-boost-from-bill-gates-breakthrough-energy-ventures/">Breakthrough Energy Ventures investment in the Google-affiliated company, Dandelion Energy</a> (a spinout from Google&#8217;s parent company&#8217;s moonshot technology development business unit, called X).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lc9BQdjaEj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/geothermal-home-heating-gets-a-30-million-boost-from-bill-gates-breakthrough-energy-ventures/">Geothermal home heating gets a $30 million boost from Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Geothermal home heating gets a $30 million boost from Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/geothermal-home-heating-gets-a-30-million-boost-from-bill-gates-breakthrough-energy-ventures/embed/#?secret=lc9BQdjaEj" data-secret="lc9BQdjaEj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dandelion and Eavor are just two examples of a groundswell of startups working to leverage the knowledge from the oil and gas industry to tap geothermal resources for applications ranging from baseload energy to home heating and cooling.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re joined by businesses like <a href="https://www.fervoenergy.com/">Fervo Energy</a>, <a href="https://www.greenfireenergy.com/">GreenFire Energy</a>, and <a href="https://www.sagegeo.com/">Sage Geosystems</a>, who&#8217;re all leveraging heat to generate power.</p>
<p>As Chevron noted in its press release, heat power is an affordable form of renewable energy that can be harnessed from either geothermal resources or waste heat.</p>
<p>The investments in Baseload and Eavor are financed by CTV’s Core Venture fund which identifies companies with technology that can add efficiencies to Chevron’s core business in operational enhancement, digitalization, and lower-carbon operations, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Together the two businesses are planning pilot projects to test technology and could look to current Baseload operations in Japan, Taiwan, Iceland or the United States to develop projects.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Financial terms of the deal were undisclosed. </span></p>
<p>“In August, we announced that we were looking for a new strategic investor to help us accelerate deployment in our key markets,” said Baseload’s Chief Executive Officer Alexander Helling. “We couldn’t have asked for a better one. Chevron complements our group of owners and adds expertise in drilling, engineering, exploration and more. These assets are expected to accelerate our ability to deploy heat power and strengthen our way of working.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.syniverse.com/">Syniverse Technologies</a>, a company that helps mobile providers move communications across public and private networks, announced an extensive partnership with <a href="http://Twilio.com">Twilio</a> this morning. Under the agreement, Twilio is investing up to $750 million to become a minority owner in the company.</p>
<p>The idea behind the partnership is to combine Twilio&#8217;s API communications expertise with Syniverse&#8217;s mobile carrier contacts to create this end-to-end communications system. Twilio&#8217;s strength has always been its ability to deliver communications like texts without having a carrier relationship. This deal gives them access to that side of the equation.</p>
<p>James Attwood, executive chairman at Syniverse certainly saw the value of the two companies working together. &#8220;The partnership will provide Syniverse access to Twilio’s extensive enterprise and API services expertise, creating opportunities to continue to build on Syniverse’s highly innovative product portfolio that helps mobile network operators and enterprises make communications better for their customers,&#8221; Atwood said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YoTOXQsOy3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilios-3-2b-segment-acquisition-about-helping-developers-build-data-fueled-apps/">Twilio&#8217;s $3.2B Segment acquisition is about helping developers build data-fueled apps</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Today&#8217;s deal comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">the company&#8217;s $3.2 billion acquisition of Segment</a> at the end of last year as it continues to look for ways to expand its markets. Will Townsend, an analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategy who covers the network and carrier markets, sees this deal giving Twilio access to a broader set of technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twilio [gets] access to Syniverse&#8217;s significant capabilities in massive industrial IoT and private 4G LTE and 5G cellular networking. Both are poised to ramp significantly given new found enterprise access to licensed spectrum via recent C-Band and CBRS auctions,&#8221; Townsend told me. He believes this will help Twilio reach parts of the enterprise not connected by WiFI or where the customers are dealing with &#8220;a mishmash of solutions that don&#8217;t scale or propagate well.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it turns out, it&#8217;s not a coincidence the two companies are coming together like this. In fact, Twilio has been a Syniverse customer for some time, according to Chee Chew, chief product officer at Twilio.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a case of an old school company like Syniverse, which was founded in 1987 combining forces with a more modern approach to communications like Twilio, which provides developers with APIs to deliver communications services inside applications with just a couple of lines of code.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twilio-nears-deal-to-invest-up-to-750m-in-syniverse-sources-say-11614554312">which broke the news</a> of this deal, is also reporting the company could go public via SPAC at a value of between $2 and $3 billion some time later this year. That would suggest that it has not gained much value since the 2010 deal.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says the SPAC provides an interesting additional component to the deal. &#8220;The high flying stock market creates all kind of new chickens, one of the, being a SPAC, and that’s the financial opportunity that Twilio is likely pursuing with the investment into Syniverse. The more immediate benefit is for Twilio to use the messaging vendor for its services. Call it a partnership with investment upside,&#8221; Mueller said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An iPhone hacking team has released a new jailbreak tool for almost every iPhone, including the most recent models, by using the same vulnerability that Apple last month said was under active attack by hackers.</p>
<p>The Unc0ver team <a href="https://twitter.com/Pwn20wnd/status/1365833293069975557">released its latest jailbreak</a> this weekend, and says it works on iOS 11 (iPhone 5s and later) to iOS 14.3, which Apple released in December.</p>
<p>Jailbreaking is a cat-and-mouse game between security researchers who want greater control and customizations over their phones, and Apple, which says it locks down iPhones for security. Hackers build jailbreak tools by finding and exploiting vulnerabilities that can lift some of the restrictions that Apple puts in place, like installing apps outside of its app store, which most Android users are already used to.</p>
<p>In a tweet, the jailbreak group said it used its &#8220;own exploit&#8221; for CVE-2021-1782, a kernel vulnerability that Apple said was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/">one of three flaws</a> that &#8220;may have been actively exploited&#8221; by hackers. By targeting the kernel, the hackers are able to get deep hooks into the underlying operating system.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We wrote our own exploit based on CVE-2021-1782 for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unc0ver?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#unc0ver</a> to achieve optimal exploit speed and stability.</p>
<p>&mdash; @Pwn20wnd (@Pwn20wnd) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pwn20wnd/status/1364878565523787777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146">fixed the vulnerability</a> in iOS 14.4, released last month, which also prevents the jailbreak from working on later versions. It was a rare admission that the iPhone was under active attack by hackers, but the company declined to say who the hackers were and who they were targeting. Apple also granted anonymity to the researcher who submitted the bug.</p>
<p>The group&#8217;s last jailbreak, which supported iPhones running iOS 11 to iOS 13.5, was fixed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/hackers-iphone-new-jailbreak/">in a matter of days</a> last year. Apple works quickly to understand and fix the vulnerabilities found by jailbreak groups, since these same vulnerabilities can be exploited maliciously.</p>
<p>Security experts generally advise iPhone users against jailbreaking because it makes the device more vulnerable to attacks. And while keeping your phone up to date may introduce security fixes that remove the jailbreak, it&#8217;s one of the best ways of keeping your device secure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe, and their cities.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey of investors in Zagreb</a> will capture how Croatia is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how the Croatian startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/</p>
<p>For example, here is the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub/">survey of London</a>.</p>
<p>You are not in Croatia, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to your country next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every country on in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email mike@techcrunch.com</p>
<p>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>. </em></p>
<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>In last week&#8217;s newsletter, I described some of the changes coming to TechCrunch&#8217;s transportation coverage, including &#8220;market maps.&#8221; These articles, which run will always run in Extra Crunch, focus on a particular slice of the transportation industry, along with other mobility-related analysis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The first of these took a deep dive into the solid state battery industry. As Mark Harris reported: For the last decade, developers of solid state battery systems have promised products that are vastly safer, lighter and more powerful. Those promises largely evaporated into the ether — leaving behind a vapor stream of disappointing products, failed startups and retreating release dates.</p>
<p>A new wave of companies and technologies are finally maturing and attracting the funding necessary to feed batteries’ biggest market: transportation. Keep reading here: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">Can solid state batteries power up the next generation of EVs?</a></p>
<p>This week look out for our revamped automotive reviews, an interview with Joby Aviation founder JoeBen Birt, Paul Sciarra, the company&#8217;s executive chair and co-founder of Pinterest and Reid Hofffman, whose SPAC merged with Joby as well as a chat with Lucid CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson. Two new reporters, who will be helping to expand and deepen our transportation coverage, are also starting this coming week.</p>
<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>

<p>Micromobbin&#8217; is short and sweet this week. I wanted to flag this upcoming panel.</p>
<p>A free panel called Women on Wheels: Making Micromobility Safer for Female Riders will be held 12 p.m. to 12:45 p.m. ET on March 8. The panel will focus on women and safety. Reservations are required to join. Visit the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/women-on-wheels-tickets-142263214103">Eventbrite link here</a> to register.</p>
<p>Speakers include ScootRoute Founder and CEO Meghan Braley, who is hosting the event, SomEV co-founder and battery engineer Natasha George and Saturday Night Bike Club&#8217;s director of cyclist engagement, Ashley Ndiaye.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>After weeks of speculation, <strong>Lucid Motors</strong> finally announced it would become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">publicly traded company</a> through a merger with special-purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp.</p>
<p>A string of EV automakers and charging infrastructure companies have taken the SPAC merger path to public markets over the past 10 months, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/arrival-becomes-latest-electric-vehicle-startup-to-test-the-public-markets-with-a-spac/">Arrival</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/electric-vehicle-startup-canoo-to-go-public-via-spac/">Canoo</a>, ChargePoint, EVgo, Fisker and Lordstown Motors. But this one is by far the largest.</p>
<p>The combined company, in which Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund will continue to be the largest shareholder, will have a transaction equity value of $11.75 billion. Private investment in the public equity deal is priced at $15 a share, putting the implied pro-forma equity value at $24 billion.</p>
<p>I interviewed CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson after the deal was announced. Watch out for an article based on what he said this coming week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another deal worth noting was <strong>Joby Aviation&#8217;s</strong> announcement that it would become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/joby-aviation-takes-flight-into-the-public-markets-via-a-spac-merger/">public company through a merger</a> with Reinvent Technology Partners, a special purpose acquisition company from well-known investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Zynga founder Mark Pincus. The combined company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will have a pro forma implied valuation of $6.6 billion.</p>
<p>Joby Aviation has spent a more than a decade developing an all-electric, vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft. Joby plans to use the capital to fund the launch of passenger service, which is expected to begin in 2024. The company still must complete certification of its aircraft and develop manufacturing facilities, but it is already on its way to achieving both.</p>

<p>Back in October, the city of New York released its request for interest in its electric scooter pilot, officially kicking off what promised to be a competitive battle among companies vying for a chance to operate their businesses in there.</p>
<p>The city also released a request for expressions of interest, or &#8220;RFEI,&#8221; for companies that provide ancillary services to the electric scooter industry, such as data aggregation and analysis, on-street charging and parking vendors, safe-riding training courses as well as scooter collection and impound services.</p>
<p>New York is one of two large markets — London being the other — that has yet name the companies that will receive these highly coveted permits. My sources are telling me that New York will announce this week which companies landed permits for the pilot. It&#8217;s possible London will make a similar announcement.</p>
<p>Last week, the New York City Department of Transportation announced the geographic boundaries for the e-scooter pilot will be in eastern Bronx neighborhoods from Eastchester and Co-op City to Throggs Neck and Soundview, an 18-square-mile area home to 570,000 residents. The pilot is expected to launch in the late spring, will run for a minimum of one year. The pilot is estimated to bring as many as 2,000 to 3,000 scooters to the East Bronx during Phase 1 with an increase to as many as 4,000 to 6,000 in a potential second phase in 2022.</p>

<p>Remember the ID Buzz, the reimagined microbus that Volkswagen first showed off as a prototype at the 2017 North American International Auto Show in Detroit? The vehicle has been in development since then and on Friday, we received another update on its future.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said it is aiming to have a Level 4 autonomous ID.Buzz in service for commercial use by 2025. Argo AI, the self-driving startup backed by Ford and Volkswagen, is providing the autonomous driving technology that will allow these microbuses to navigate urban environments without a human behind the wheel.</p>
<p>The company is conducting field trials in Germany this year.</p>
<p>The idea is to use these microbuses for a ride-hailing and sharing service similar to what Moia offers today in Germany. VW noted that its commercial vehicle division will develop and build Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV), such as robotaxis and vans.</p>
<p>The announcement suggests that progress is being made. However, it&#8217;s important to note VW&#8217;s previous timelines and intentions.</p>
<p>In 2016, VW Group launched Moia as a separate company focused on providing mobility solutions, including fleet-based commuter shuttles and, eventually, autonomous on-demand transportation.</p>
<p>Ole Harms, who was Moia&#8217;s CEO when it launched, was on the TechCrunch stage in London back in 2016. At the time, he said the first pilots of autonomous driving deployments would come earlier than the 2021 date cited by many competitors for the arrival of self-driving tech.</p>
<p>VW Group tapped self-driving startup Aurora and in January 2018 announced plans to launch commercial fleets of self-driving electric vehicles in two to five cities beginning in 2021. Volks­wagen said at the time that it planned to launch two types of test fleets using Aurora tech, including one for ride-pooling that would use Moia shuttles and another for door-to-door ride-hailing service in the U.S. and Germany.</p>
<p>Aurora and VW&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/vws-partnership-with-self-driving-car-startup-aurora-has-ended/">partnership ended</a> 18 months later.</p>
<p>VW&#8217;s launch date — along with the timelines from virtually every other AV developer — was pushed back. This time around, will VW aided by Argo, meet its deadline?</p>

<p>A few more items to note this week.</p>
<p><strong>Foxconn Technology Group</strong> reached a tentative agreement with electric vehicle startup-turned-SPAC Fisker to develop and eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/apple-supplier-foxconn-reaches-tentative-agreement-to-build-fiskers-next-electric-car/">manufacture an EV</a> that will be sold in North America, Europe, China and India. The deal isn&#8217;t done yet though.</p>
<p>This is just a memorandum of understanding agreement. Discussions between the two companies will continue with the expectation that a formal partnership agreement will be reached during the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Speaking of Fisker, The Verge reported that the electric vehicle startup has<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22279995/fisker-inc-electric-vehicle-interview-solid-state-batteries-ocean-suv-spac"> dropped plans</a> to create a solid-state battery and that last July it quietly settled a previously unreported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/21355123/fisker-quantumscape-lawsuit-trade-secret-solid-state-batteries-fsr-qs">trade secret lawsuit</a> with Volkswagen-backed solid-state battery company QuantumScape.</p>
<p><strong>Flipkart</strong> said it will deploy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/flipkart-to-deploy-over-25000-electric-vehicles-by-2030/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">more than 25,000 electric vehicles</a> in its supply chain by 2030 as the Walmart-owned e-commerce giant looks to achieve a 100% transition to electric mobility in the next 10 years. The Bangalore-headquartered firm said it partnered with leading EV makers including Hero Electric, Mahindra Electric and Piaggio to build vehicles for its first and last-mile delivery fleets across the country.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> said just a day before the Flipkart announcement that it partnered with Mahindra Electric to develop &#8220;close to hundred&#8221; electric three-wheelers in India. The American e-commerce giant last year pledged to deploy 10,000 electric vehicles in the country by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Nikola</strong>, the controversial electric truck maker, is trying to make fresh start, admitting in a recent <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000173128921000006/nkla-20201231.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission filing</a> that nine statements made by founder Trevor Milton were &#8220;inaccurate.&#8221; Milton, you might remember, resigned from Nikola in September, after a report from noted short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the company of fraud.</p>
<p>The company is also narrowing its focus, getting rid of the various side projects that Milton started. The SEC filing showed the company took a $14.4 million impairment expense after discontinuing the Powersports business unit.</p>
<p><strong>Sergey Brin&#8217;s</strong> secretive airship company LTA Research and Exploration is planning to power a huge disaster relief airship with an equally record-breaking hydrogen fuel cell, according to a job listing spotted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/sergey-brins-airship-will-use-worlds-biggest-mobile-hydrogen-fuel-cell/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Mark Harris</a>.</p>
<p><strong>United States Postal Service</strong> awarded a 10-year, $485-million contract to Oshkosh Defense to deliver between 50,000 and 165,000 Next Generation Delivery Vehicles, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/usps-picks-a-new-mail-truck-and-no-they-wont-all-be-electric/">Ars Technica reported</a>. The first trucks are due on the road in 2023. Only 10% of the new delivery trucks will be battery electric, which seems to conflict with the new Biden Administration&#8217;s plans to replace the entire federal fleet with EVs. The news sent shares of <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/workhorse-share-collapse-raises-pressure-on-debt-repayment">Workhorse Group Inc</a>. into a free fall.</p>

<p>Businesses, and the tech platforms that support their operations, had to adapt quickly to the pandemic. Ben Thompson, co-founder and chief executive officer of human resources platform <a href="https://employmenthero.com/">Employment Hero</a> told TechCrunch that &#8220;COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of employment management software by roughly five years,&#8221; as teams adjusted to remote work.</p>
<p>The Sydney, Australia-based company announced today it has raised a $45 million AUD (about $34.8 million) Series D, bringing its valuation to more than $250 million AUD ($193.4 million USD). The capital will be used for expansion and growth in markets including New Zealand, Southeast Asia and the United Kingdom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round was led by <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/">SEEK</a>, which runs job platforms around the world, with participation from OneVentures and AirTreeVentures, all returning investors. Employment Hero also added Salesforce Ventures as a new investor.</p>
<p>Employment Hero is designed for small-to-medium sized businesses, and combines human resources, payroll and benefits features. It currently serves about 6,000 SMEs with a combined total of more than 250,000 employees. Employment Hero doubled the number of its full-time employees to 200 last year, and launched versions in New Zealand, the UK, Malaysia and Singapore. Its Series D will be used to support growth in those markets, and enter new Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Localized versions of Employment Hero include pre-built employment contracts and policies that comply with local laws. In Malaysia and Singapore, the platform provided research on recruitment and employment trends, Thompson said, and in Singapore, it gathered COVID-related government support materials into one factsheet.</p>
<p>Employment Hero also renewed its partnership with SEEK, which means the platform includes SEEK job ads in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, the company launched a new service called Global Teams for remote work. It serves as a professional employer organization (PEO), enabling companies to recruit new remote employees around the world and automating regional compliance paperwork. Global Teams is integrated into the main Employment Hero platform, so remote employees have access to the same resources as their colleagues.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 75% of Employment Hero’s customer base upgraded their subscriptions to include tools for remote work management, compliance and employee wellness services.</p>
<p>For example, during the first week of Australia’s nationwide lockdown, Employment Hero launched a COVID-19 resource hub, including tools for the government&#8217;s JobKeeper payment scheme and employee wellness surveys. It also ran biweekly webinars with industry experts about employees’ rights to leave and pay, mental health and employee assistance programs, cashflow management, employer duty of care for remote work arrangements and live employment law.</p>
<p>As remote work continued, Employment Hero also introduced engagement and productivity features, like one-on-one coaching and other tools to improve communication and feedback.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a company, we knew we had to do whatever it took to help our clients and the wider small and medium-sized business community through COVID-19,&#8221; said Thompson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/clue/">Clue</a>, an early pioneer in the femtech category with a well-regarded <a href="https://helloclue.com">period-tracking app</a> that&#8217;s used by around 13 million people, is getting ready to launch a digital contraceptive which will offer users a statistical prediction of ovulation as a birth control tool.</p>
<p>A US launch of Clue Birth Control is slated for &#8220;this year&#8221;. The team won’t be more specific on the date yet.</p>
<p>Pricing will be &#8220;premium&#8221; — but they’re also keeping the exact cost under wraps for now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Berlin-based company is today announcing that they&#8217;ve gained FDA clearance for the forthcoming product, clearing the way for a US launch in 2021.</p>
<p>Europe is the next region on their launch list but the necessary regulatory clearances mean the roll out will be gradual, going market by market.</p>
<p>The startup has also recently made a number of operational changes &#8212; including to the leadership of the company &#8212; to reflect becoming a medical-device grade regulated entity in the US.</p>
<p>The short version is that founder and CEO, Ida Tin, has moved up to become chairwoman of the board, while Audrey Tsang (who was leading product) and Carrie Walter (formerly general counsel), are now Clue’s co-CEOs.</p>
<p>TechCrunch chatted to all three women &#8212; along with Clue&#8217;s chief medical officer, Lynae Brayboy &#8212; to get the lowdown on its latest news.</p>
<h2>Clue Birth Control</h2>
<p>Clue is not the first to market with an app offering a statistical prediction of fertility but unlike first mover, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/04/natural-cycles-gets-6m-to-convince-more-women-to-ditch-the-pill/?_ga=2.5773872.26562040.1614535676-1757155993.1533833482">Natural Cycles</a> &#8212; which gained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/the-fda-okd-an-app-as-a-form-of-birth-control/">FDA clearance back in 2018</a> &#8212; its product, Clue Birth Control, is being billed as &#8220;all-digital&#8221;; aka it will work without the user needing to take their temperature daily.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also no need to track other bodily changes (such as monitoring cervical fluid). The method is based on women inputting a single data point regularly: The start date of their period.</p>
<p>This means it looks like a major step up in &#8216;ease of use&#8217; vs the earlier-to-market rival &#8212; which Clue has achieved within similar efficacy margins (see below).</p>
<p>Clue&#8217;s algorithmic prediction is based on Bayesian modelling — with the app displaying a high risk window across a number of days of the user’s cycle, during which having unprotected intercourse could result in the woman getting pregnant. It shows a window of low risk when the opposite is true.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2118831,2118832,2118830,2118829,2118828"]</p>
<p>The length of these windows is likely to change as the user inputs more data, with the risk-window starting out longer and typically shrinking as the app becomes more personalized to their individual cycle data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bayesian modelling has been used in medicine for a lot of different applications. What that does is it takes population data and it puts that population data into an algorithm &#8212; which is a mathematical model &#8212; and [that] basically borrows from what has been found in the population in terms of cycling and ovulation,&#8221; explains Brayboy, who was appointed as Clue&#8217;s first ever chief medical officer last summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before we had a fertile window [i.e. displayed in the Clue period-tacking app to illustrate the stages of a cycle] &#8212; which is not a reliable, nor is it a tested, model of contraception. So now we&#8217;re using a bayesian modelling concept,&#8221; she says. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;It personalizes over time. So as the individual puts in their cycle day one then we&#8217;re able to personalize the window of their high risk days vs their low risk days.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;[The high risk window] will start out long&#8230; Usually it&#8217;ll be 16 days within the cycle &#8212; but it&#8217;ll shorten over time. It probably won&#8217;t shorten to more than 11 days.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the product to work as a contraception, users must either abstain from sex on high risk days or use additional protection (such as condoms). That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a more involved method than some established birth control alternatives (especially vs an IUD; intrauterine device). On low risk days Clue users are relying on the app’s statistical prediction of their (low) fertility risk to not get pregnant.</p>
<p>Clue says the product has been shown to be 92% effective at preventing unwanted pregnancy under &#8216;typical use&#8217; and 97% effective under &#8216;perfect use&#8217; &#8212; referencing the standard research terminology for measuring contraception effectiveness (the latter meaning the product is used exactly as instructed every time the woman has sex vs &#8216;typical&#8217; use which accounts for some usage slip-ups).</p>
<p>What those percentages mean in practice is that under typical use, eight couples out of 100 would be predicted to get pregnant over a year of use of Clue&#8217;s digital birth control. While &#8212; in the perfect use scenario &#8212; the failure rate would be three out of 100 over a year&#8217;s use.</p>
<p>(For comparison, Natural Cycles says its product is 93% effective under typical use and 98% effective under perfect use; while &#8212; per the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-effectiveness-united-states">Guttmacher Institute</a>&#8216;s US study &#8212; the pill is 93% effective under typical use and 99% effective under perfect use; and male condoms are 87% effective under typical use vs 98% effective under perfect use.)</p>
<p>Clue isn’t disclosing how many users it’s expecting to sign up — but the length of time it’s taken to bring the product to market suggests it’s confident Clue Birth Control will find a sustainable user base. (It&#8217;s been quietly working on the development since at least 2019 &#8212; but will only say the product has been &#8220;a long time&#8221; in the works when we ask.)</p>
<p>The extra time Clue&#8217;s taken to bring its digital contraceptive to market does look like time well spent. The statistical method underlying Clue Birth Control has, for example, undergone rigorous pre-market clinical testing &#8212; via a prospective effectiveness <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13625187.2019.1581164">trial</a> which reported results back in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been in development for a long time because work like this and proving the efficacy of something like this takes a long time,&#8221; says Tsang. &#8220;From a product perspective as well we want to make sure that these are experiences [that are] easy to understand and that matches the safety and efficacy of this type of product. So that as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes a long time to make sure that we develop something that is also usability validated on that front and that we put that out with confidence and with an exact understanding of how well users will understand that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ovulation prediction algorithm was put through a year-long, full-scale, representative (of the US population), independent clinical trial involving more than 700 women. This was conducted by researchers at the Institute for Reproductive Health (IRH) at Georgetown University in partnership with a third company, called Cycle Technologies &#8212; using a research app, called DOT (Dynamic Optimal Timing), for the purpose of the trial.</p>
<p>Clue says it acquired the assets of DOT — both the algorithm and the app — in summer 2019 and it’s that clinically validated technology which it&#8217;s implementing into its own app now, as Clue Birth Control.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a &#8216;proper&#8217;, full scale clinical trial that was designed to be a clinical trial &#8212; rather than put a product out there, see if it works and collect the data,&#8221; says Walter. &#8220;This was done by academics. We then bought the algorithm and the app and we implemented the features of the app into Clue Birth Control which is a feature of Clue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The clinical trial shows you both what the algorithm does and how the user interacts with the app. Because the algorithm is only part of the story &#8212; the main part is can a woman understand what&#8217;s going on, track and check and then act on the information,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>The FDA clearance process for Clue Birth Control involved scrutiny of the efficacy of the algorithm’s statistical predictions and also how Clue presents the information to users. So the whole package has been examined by the regulator. (To be clear the DOT app was not FDA cleared; rather Clue implemented that clinically tested algorithm in its own app and submitted the package for FDA clearance.)</p>
<p>&#8220;When you get FDA clearance as a medical device that is for a very specific product &#8212; you don&#8217;t then get to just take it away and tinker with it,&#8221; says Walter. &#8220;So I&#8217;m sure that there will be further iterations. This is iteration one of a new kind of birth control &#8212; but as of right now the thing that is going into our app is the thing that FDA saw and cleared. So the only piece&#8230; that we put significant creative work into was making sure that the usability interface is totally user tested and safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Going forward, Clue’s business processes will be subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny — a considerable switch for the startup that Tin describes as a &#8220;huge maturing process&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another big part of the work that happened is to live and be a regulated company,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch. &#8220;That in itself is a very big change and a huge amount of work&#8230; So that&#8217;s another thing that has to happen. So one thing is what you put out in the market that users see but as a company you really have to operate in a completely new way &#8212; it&#8217;s a huge maturing process that we have gone through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like the baby can walk and talk and is actually more like a teenager and now it&#8217;s like leaving home &#8212; and I say you can do this!&#8221; she adds when asked what it feels like to see her femtech startup becoming FDA regulated.</p>
<h2>Suitability</h2>
<p>No method of contraception &#8212; except for abstinence &#8212; is 100% effective, of course. But just comparing the varying efficacy percentages of different contraception methods may not be super helpful given how personal birth control choices are.</p>
<p>A digital contraceptive certainly has a bunch of pros and cons that need to be considered. And Clue is being up front that its product is not suitable for everyone.</p>
<p>Top line: Clue says Clue Birth Control is only suitable for women, aged between 18-45, who have regular periods. (It also says: Users must also be able to track their period; check the app each day they have sex; and be prepared to use a condom or avoid sex that may result in pregnancy on high-risk days.)</p>
<p>Clearly there are various additional considerations beyond having a regular cycle that potential users should weigh up before signing up. Not least being comfortable with the stated degree of pregnancy risk.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s also true of all FABM (fertility awareness based methods) of birth control &#8212; including the old fashioned, non-digital/manual-tracking version (sometimes referred to as the rhythm or calendar method). But app-based products like Natural Cycles and Clue Birth Control are undoubtedly making FABM accessible to more women. Which means that communicating &#8212; and even enforcing &#8212; suitability is a key component of responsible product development in this category.</p>
<p>This is because the level of commitment and attention to detail required to act on changing fertility information makes FABM more complex than some birth control options. An IUD, for example, works without a woman needing to do anything once it’s been inserted. The pill is also more simplistic &#8212; in the sense that it only requires a woman to remember to take a tablet daily.</p>
<p>At the same time, it’s clear that hormonal contraception isn’t for everyone &#8212; or may not be accessible to everyone (Brayboy points to rising difficulty for US women specifically to access contraception as a relevant point here, for instance). And the convenience of an app-based form of personalised contraception has quickly convinced a new generation of women to try an alternative. (Natural Cycles’ reported some 1.5 million users worldwide last year.)</p>
<p>App-based convenience can invite missteps too, though. After its launch in Europe in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/09/natural-cycles-gets-30m-for-its-eu-certified-digital-contraception/">2017</a> Natural Cycles quickly attracted criticism over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/contraception-app-natural-cycles-facebook-ad-banned-for-being-misleading/">misleading</a> and aggressive social media marketing. It was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/clinic-reports-natural-cycles-app-for-37-unwanted-pregnancies-since-september/">investigated in Sweden</a> after a hospital in its home market reported a number of unintended pregnancies from women who had been using the app. Although that probe confirmed the number of pregnancies was within the claimed margin of efficacy Natural Cycles agreed with the regulator to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/natural-cycles-contraception-app-told-to-clarify-pregnancy-risks/">clarify the risk of its product failing</a>.</p>
<p>So how digital birth control is presented is a vital consideration.</p>
<p>Clue doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s taking any risks with how it communicates suitability for Clue Birth Control &#8212; prospective users have to go through an eligibility process which requires them to not just <em>say</em> they&#8217;re eligible but demonstrate eligibility by being able to provide key information, including about their own cycle.</p>
<p>If the user can&#8217;t show eligibility the app will &#8220;boot them out&#8221;, as Tsang puts it. She says they&#8217;ll also then be locked out for a period of time so they can&#8217;t just go back in and try different answers. While users whose cycle becomes too irregular for the product to work properly will similarly be prevented from continued use.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a very detailed assessment process as soon as you try to sign up for Clue Birth Control,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It asks you a series of questions that really even in the questions themselves and how you answer &#8212; it&#8217;s like a question with a drop-down underneath it &#8212; even in how we&#8217;ve set those up it makes it so that users actually have to explicitly say that they are eligible. It&#8217;s not a true/false kind of situation. It&#8217;s &#8216;how are old are you&#8217;?&#8230; We ask these explicit questions so what that does is it actually draws the information out of the user in a way where we can be sure that they are actually eligible to use this feature as it is regulated to be used.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That process itself was scrutinized in detail by FDA,&#8221; adds Walter. &#8220;This is a device that you can use in the privacy of your phone &#8212; nobody else has to be involved in it &#8212; so it&#8217;s really important that that funnel is correct and so that is something that we talked about in a lot of detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;And one thing that you do need to be aware of is that you&#8217;re not going to be able to answer these questions unless you have some awareness of your cycle going in. Because you&#8217;ve got to know is your cycle typically this long or this long. What does your longest cycle look like? What&#8217;s your shortest cycle look like over the last 12 months?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The [FDA] clearance is related to the product as presented. The product &#8212; because it relies purely on one data input and statistical predictions &#8212; there&#8217;s obviously some level of&#8230; &#8216;irregularity&#8217;,&#8221; Walter adds. &#8220;If your periods are wildly unpredictable this isn&#8217;t going to work. What our science team says is&#8230; about 70-80% of currently cycling women fall within the bandwidth that could be covered by it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s 20-40 day cycles and 9 days or less of variation between them. So it&#8217;s not like you have to know to the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that it&#8217;s impossible to be perfect and so we make sure to tell people that typical use is 92% and so we don&#8217;t at all try to oversell ourselves. And that this is better than doing many things which are commonly done by users in the US,&#8221; says Brayboy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pill and the IUD have very very defined risks,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;So we essentially explain that we are not as effective as those methods but our users potentially would have benefits because some of them cannot tolerate those methods for whatever reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately a lot of people do rely on <em>coitus interruptus</em> and a lot of people do rely on condoms which are great but you have to use condoms every single time in order to be effective. And so those individuals might really benefit from having some idea of where they are in their cycle and it&#8217;s not only some idea &#8212; it&#8217;s a rigorously looked at algorithm that they can use in the privacy of their home,&#8221; Brayboy goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really getting difficult&#8230; for a lot of American women to actually access birth control. One because of job loss; two because of a recent supreme court ruling in 2020 about opting out of contraceptive coverage. And so this is something they can do in collaboration with their healthcare providers but they don&#8217;t have to go out to a pharmacy and hopefully people will see that it&#8217;s easy to use. It really is easy to use. You never [don&#8217;t] leave your phone at home so you can&#8217;t lose this contraception.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another major consideration for users of digital contraception is that unprotected sex offers no protection against STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) &#8212; rates of which have been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2019/2018-STD-surveillance-report-press-release.html">increasing in the US in recent years</a>.</p>
<p>Clue therefore recommends its product for women who are in stable relationships &#8212; and/or are getting regularly screened, along with their partner/s &#8212; i.e. rather than for those who don&#8217;t know the sexual history of the people they&#8217;re sleeping with.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was sort of a premise from the beginning that we only want people to use this product for whom it&#8217;s really truly a good product,&#8221; says Tin. &#8220;It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re building this product because we think many people will benefit from it and we&#8217;ve seen many people needing it and so that&#8217;s the core. We want to be helpful. We don&#8217;t want people to use it for whom it&#8217;s not a good solution. And that&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve built it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked who the &#8216;perfect/ideal&#8217; user for Clue Birth Control, Brayboy puts it like this: &#8220;This is someone who &#8212; as I envisage as a physician &#8212; potentially wants to get pregnant in the next couple of years but is not ready and does not want to use hormonal birth control for whatever reason and is already using condoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is someone who wants to not get pregnant just now but is preparing, is planning &#8212; and they don&#8217;t want something that&#8217;s long acting.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also points out that many of the most effective methods of contraception (&#8220;like the levonorgestrel IUD or the Mirena&#8221;, which are ~99.9%) have draw-backs too &#8212; in that they have to be placed and removed from the woman&#8217;s uterus. They may also, she suggests, have a long term effect on the endometrium.</p>
<p>&#8220;So [Clue Birth Control] is something where if you decide okay in the next few years you want to get pregnant you absolutely can stop [following the regime] and you can get pregnant. And you also have a better idea of your cycles at the same time &#8212; so it gives you that added benefit,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;Again, our indication&#8217;s 18-45 but a lot of people who are in their late 20s and 30s would be ideal candidates for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tin also points to the &#8220;staggering amount of unwanted pregnancies&#8221; in the US and around the world &#8212; noting that many women currently still don&#8217;t use any birth control, for whatever reason. So an app-based fertility prediction might be an alternative that works for them.</p>
<p>Brayboy notes that unintended pregnancy in the US is about 45% but can be as high as 69% in some ethnic groups, per figures from the <a href="https://www.acog.org">American College of OBGYN</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unintended pregnancy is also hard to study because people don&#8217;t typically plan to become pregnant &#8212; and so it makes it difficult. But this [app-based FABM] is a way &#8212; also people could really think about how do I want to plan my family in the next couple of years? And so it really is a lovely way for people to start really thinking about becoming parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The marketing for Clue Birth Control will reflect that it&#8217;s a &#8220;serious choice&#8221; people are making to opt for a digital birth control, per Tsang.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We make sure that people understand that no form of birth control is 100% effective. And that this is a choice &#8212; and this is a serious choice that they make,&#8221; she says. &#8220;In our marketing we plan to help people make that choice &#8212; make a choice that&#8217;s right for them. And be transparent about the risks and how it works and what it means.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that we don&#8217;t have huge plans to do social media and influencer marketing,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;But again we do have these standard operating procedures that make sure that we both speak about the labelling, we speak about our product in a way that reflects exactly what it is.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Retooling to be regulated</h2>
<p>The aforementioned changes to Clue&#8217;s leadership team are coupled with a wider retooling of its internal processes &#8212; reflective of its new status as a regulated company.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Something that a lot of people aren&#8217;t aware of is that to be allowed to have a medical device on the market you have to operate a quality management system that covers your entire company. And as you know if you cover tech startups that&#8217;s not how tech startups tend to work!&#8221; says Walter. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Which is why it&#8217;s incredibly important if you&#8217;re going to use an app to make important life decisions about your health you want to make sure they&#8217;re building their product in a quality controlled way. And of course any app that you find out there on the market that is not a regulated medical device pretty much 100% will not be working in this way. And so one of the things that we had to do &#8212; and that we will be audited for once we have the product in the market &#8212; is to show that all of our processes, from design over software development, testing, user testing, all of these things are quality controlled every step of the way. So that&#8217;s the big change that we&#8217;ve gone through in the last two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a really big change,&#8221; adds Tin. &#8220;And for us it&#8217;s been important to get the team along in a really good way &#8212; not lose who we are. We think of it as acquiring a new ninja skill &#8212; something new that we&#8217;re learning to do that we&#8217;re adding to who we are &#8212; so that we can still be user focused and maintain all the qualities that we care about and always have cared about but now doing it sort of at a higher level under this quality management system.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s very well aligned with who we are because essentially a quality management system&#8217;s about quality and risk and care, essentially, for users &#8212; and we feel a lot of responsibility putting out a product that help people navigate really big, important things, like getting pregnant, not getting pregnant, so we feel good about making sure that our processes match that level of responsibility. So in that way it&#8217;s been easy to get the team along but I will say it&#8217;s been a huge amount of work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how many thousands of pages of technical documentation that we have submitted etc. It&#8217;s really like a huge rehaul. So the fact that we can maintain still feeling like Clue while operating in a very new way I&#8217;m pretty happy about. Because we could also become very boring &#8212; big, corporate-ish &#8212; but that isn&#8217;t who we are and that&#8217;s important because of course we want to keep caring about users.&#8221;</p>
<p>For all the extra paperwork, Tsang says Clue&#8217;s mission as a company hasn&#8217;t &#8212; and isn&#8217;t &#8212; changing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just very value-aligned. We&#8217;re here to put something out that&#8217;s high quality and where we have a clear procedure and clear processes for evaluating risk and mitigating risk. And that&#8217;s all completely values aligned with being a femtech company that empowers women to make healthy choices,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody is going to go out there and say well we play fast and loose with people&#8217;s health. Nobody wants to do that but it helps to have a third party watch you &#8212; and that&#8217;s what it means to be a regulated company. It means that there are democratically accountable government institutions looking over your shoulder and checking,&#8221; adds Walter.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think if you&#8217;re looking at some of the criticism that femtech has come into recently &#8212; legitimately &#8212; because there are all kinds of apps out there that are completely unregulated, no one knows where they&#8217;re coming from, no one knows what their business models are, no one knows what they&#8217;re really doing. And this is a strong move in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We take the constraints that flow from that seriously&#8230; As Ida says we&#8217;re going to try not to lose our fun in the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team does also see wider opportunities flowing from being a regulated entity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this broadens our mission too,&#8221; says Brayboy. &#8220;Period tracking is really important in overall health but I think this allows individuals to use FABM in a modern way &#8212; and FABM itself can help individuals take in things in their cycles that might actually affect their fertility long term and also some diagnosis that might be important to speak with their physician about early, so they present to care early. So we hope to have that partnership with users and their healthcare providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have plans to do [comparative studies with other types of contraception] but what I&#8217;d like to say is that we have a post-market surveillance plan and we&#8217;ll be doing studies with collaborators &#8212; we&#8217;ve already started to collaborate with academia before Clue Birth Control came out so it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ll continue to do,&#8221; she also says. &#8220;W<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">hat we&#8217;ll be doing in future is we&#8217;ll be going to clinical meetings, and presenting and allowing people to collaborate with us. And I think that&#8217;s really important that our doors are open for physician scientists and scientists and contraceptive researchers to continue to look at us. And we want to do that because we&#8217;re all about science &#8212; we&#8217;re based on science. And I came to Clue because of that mission.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;For us it&#8217;s also an ability to keep doing more and more advanced things with the data, if you like,&#8221; adds Tin. &#8220;Which of course is important because people have many needs that if you are to answer them it has to be regulated. It&#8217;s right that they&#8217;re regulated. Now we learn how to operate as a regulated company &#8212; we </span><em style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">are</em><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> operating as a regulated company &#8212; that gives us an ability to keep meeting these needs that are deeper.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Walter also emphasizes the competitive advantage of being a consumer app that&#8217;s subject to regulatory surveillance as a medical device &#8212; in a sea of unregulated apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;A really important thing is that if you look at your average health and fitness app or whatever, their main KPI is let&#8217;s get a tonne of users through the door and make money off them. And I&#8217;m not going to say we don&#8217;t want a tonne of users through the door and to be profitable &#8212; we do want that. But because we are regulated we also have this post-market surveillance obligation that we will be audited on. That&#8217;s a KPI now. That&#8217;s not a nice to have. And I think that&#8217;s a big difference. And that&#8217;s something that consumers should think about when they&#8217;re using an app &#8212; like what KPIs are those people working to.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you might want to ask yourself what other apps is that developer putting out? Do they have 15 gaming apps and one period tracker? And what&#8217;s their business model?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who&#8217;s leading the company,&#8221; Brayboy chips in. &#8220;Look around this Zoom room you can see that we have all potentially had periods and continue to have them and so have had to make these decisions and so I think it puts us in a very unique position because we have a level of empathy and understanding that really comes from a personal space.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I wanted to say on the global health [potential] &#8212; I&#8217;m really excited about that. And that&#8217;s another of the reasons why I joined the company because I started my career in the Republic of Mali in West Africa and I saw how difficult it was for individuals to get contraception and a lot of things that are culturally pushed to people in those areas. And so this to me really represents an exciting prospect&#8230; I think there&#8217;s just limitless possibilities in other countries &#8212; we haven&#8217;t really thought about the cultural practices and the tendencies that people want to use something that is hormone free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about the new co-CEO structure, Tin says it&#8217;s a natural continuation of the collaborative leadership style she encouraged at Clue.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The big two things that Clue is going to care about is being a regulated company and building a sustainable business and I could&#8217;t think of two better people than Carrie and Audrey to mind these two parts of the business&#8230; We have had a very collaborative leadership style at Clue, always, because that&#8217;s how I like doing things &#8212; and it feels again also like an upgrade. Now two people get to do this in a pair and I think that&#8217;s a really great reflection of what I think is the future of leadership. </span>So on that level it&#8217;s also an expression of who we are to choose to have co-CEOs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re new at this but it&#8217;s been really fun the last couple of weeks but at the heart of it are these values of being disciplined about being transparent,&#8221; adds Tsang. &#8220;Being collaborative and being equal. And it allows us to hold each other accountable for all of those things which are at at the heart of Clue&#8217;s values. So I completely agree with Ida &#8212; I&#8217;d love to see more leadership look like this moving forward and I personally have been enjoying it quite a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;W</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ho needs another &#8216;hero CEO&#8217;,&#8221; adds Walter. &#8220;My starting point was that every conversation I have is actually better when Audrey&#8217;s in it &#8212; so let&#8217;s make my head conversations that way. Let&#8217;s upgrade the thinking process to a dialogue. And I think once you accept that most decisions are better made in some form of collaboration &#8212; let&#8217;s get real, right; we&#8217;re not that much of a genius that all of us don&#8217;t ever need to talk to other people &#8212; so once we accept that then the only question is how do you collaborate?</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As Ida said, we&#8217;ve always had a pretty collaborative management team but actually we found that &#8212; it&#8217;s like in the arts. Where are the most productive, most creative collaborations &#8212; they&#8217;re in really tight micro teams. And so let&#8217;s put that at the heart. And of course there&#8217;s a management team and of course there are other expertise and having Lynae in the company is wonderful and having the science component, and data science component, and all of this expertise, but I really like this generative heart of two. This dialogue as being the decision making process. There&#8217;s no reason to me why that wouldn&#8217;t make us more bold and more thoughtful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to second this and maybe it&#8217;s also worth saying that I founded Clue together with a bunch of great guys &#8212; one of them my life partner, and in a way we have, for many years, also been a very closed pair,&#8221; adds Tin. &#8220;And working on understanding equality and living from that place and now it&#8217;s, in a way, just an even more clear part of the structure. It&#8217;s like a good next step on something we&#8217;ve been learning about &#8212; basically since the beginning of Clue.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>This report was updated with a correction after Clue initially told us the high risk window &#8220;probably wouldn&#8217;t shorten to more than nine days&#8221;; they subsequently confirmed that this should be 11 days</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monday brings with it not one, but two space SPACS – there&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/">Rocket Lab</a>, and there&#8217;s Spire Global, a satellite operator that bills itself primarily as a SaaS company focused on delivering data and analytics made possible by its 100-plus spacecraft constellation. SPACs have essentially proven a pressure-release valve for the space startup market, which has been waiting on high-profile exits to basically prove out the math of its venture-backability.</p>
<p>Spire Global debuted in 2012, and has raised over $220 million to date. It will merge with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) called NavSight Holdings, in order to make a debut on the NYSE under the ticker &#8216;SPIR.&#8217; The combined company will have a pro forma enterprise value of $1.6 billion upon transaction close, which is targeted for this summer.</p>
<p>The deal will provide $475 in funds for the company, including via a PIPE that includes Tiger Global, BlackRock and Hedosophia. Existing Spire stockholders will wind up with around 67% of the company after the businesses combine.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spire&#8217;s network of satellites is designed to provide customers with a &#8216;space-as-a-service&#8217; model, allowing them to operate their own payloads, and access data collected via an API their developers can integrate into their own software. The model is subscription-based, and is designed to get customers up and running with their own space-based data feed in less than a year from deal designs and commitment.</p>

<p>Existing investors in Spire Global include RRE Ventures, Promus Ventures, Seraphim Capital, Mitsui Global Investment and more, with its most recent round being a raised of debt financing. The company has launched satellites via Rocket Lab, its companion in the Monday SPAC news rush. The satellites it operates are small cube satellites, and it has launches on a wide range of launch vehicles, including SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9, the Russian Soyuz, ISRO&#8217;s PSLV, Japan&#8217;s H-2B, ULA rockets, Northrop Grumman&#8217;s Antares and even the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Spire got its start from very humble origins indeed – tracing all the way back to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space">Kickstarter campaign that was successful with just over $100,000 raised from backers</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Because news of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/"> its SPAC-fueled public market debut wasn&#8217;t enough</a>, Rocket Lab also unveiled a new class of rocket it has in development on Monday. The launch vehicle, called Neutron, will be able to carry 8 metric tons (around 18,000 lbs) to orbit, far exceeding the cargo capacity of Rocket Lab&#8217;s current Electron vehicle, which can host only around 660 lbs. Neutron will also have a fully reusable first-stage, designed to launch on an ocean landing platform, not unlike SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9 booster.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab says that Neutron will be designed to service increased demand from customers launching large multi-satellite constellations. The heavier lift will mean that it can take more small satellites up at one time to get those constellations in orbit more quickly. Its cargo rating also means it should be able to deliver up to 98% of all currently-forecasted spacecraft launching through 2029, according to Rocket Lab, and provide resupply services to the International Space Station. Rocket Lab also says it&#8217;ll be capable of human spaceflight missions, indicating an ambition to make it the company&#8217;s first human-rated spacecraft.</p>

<p>Neutron could significantly expand Rocket Lab&#8217;s customer base, and it&#8217;ll also improve costs and economics vs. what Electron can do now, thanks to a design focus don efficiency and reusability. The rocket will launch from Rocket Lab&#8217;s Wallops, Virginia facility, and since there&#8217;s already a launch pad in place for it, the company expects it&#8217;ll be able to fly Neutron for the first time by 2024. In addition to its LA-based HQ and the Wallops launch site, Rocket Lab anticipates it&#8217;ll be building a new Neutron production facility somewhere in the U.S. to build the new rocket at scale.</p>
<p>While it won&#8217;t have the launch capacity of SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9, it&#8217;s still intended to be a rocket that can also carry smaller payloads to the Moon and even deep space beyond. The medium-lift category in general is generating a lot of interest right now, given the projections in the amount and variety of constellations that both private and public organization are expected to put into orbit over the next decade. Constellations are offering advantages in terms of cost and coverage for everything from communications to Earth observation. Another rocket startup, Relativity Space, just unveiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/relativity-space-unveils-plans-for-a-new-much-larger-and-fully-reusable-rocket/">similar plans for a larger launch vehicle to complement its first small rocket</a>.</p>
