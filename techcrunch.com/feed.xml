						<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models/">Subscription-based pricing is dead: Smart SaaS companies are shifting to usage-based models</a></li>
					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The usage-based pricing model almost feels like a cheat code — it enables SaaS companies to more efficiently acquire new customers, grow with those customers as they’re successful and keep those customers on the platform.</p>
<p>Compared to their peers, companies with usage-based pricing trade at a 50% revenue multiple premium and see 10pp better net dollar retention rates.</p>
<p>But the shift from pure subscription to usage-based pricing is nearly as complex as going from on-premise to SaaS. It opens up the addressable market by lowering the purchase barrier, which then necessitates finding new ways to scalably acquire users. It more closely aligns payment with a customer’s consumption, thereby impacting cash flow and revenue recognition. And it creates less revenue predictability, which can generate pushback from procurement and legal.</p>
<p>SaaS companies exploring a usage-based model need to plan for both go-to-market and operational challenges spanning from pricing to sales compensation to billing.</p>
<h2>Selecting the right usage metric</h2>
<p>There are numerous potential usage metrics that SaaS companies could use in their pricing. Datadog charges based on hosts, HubSpot uses marketing contacts, Zapier prices by tasks and Snowflake has compute resources. Picking the wrong usage metric could have disastrous consequences for long-term growth.</p>
<p>The best usage metric meets five key criteria: value-based, flexible, scalable, predictable and feasible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value-based:</strong> It should align with how customers derive value from the product and how they see success. For example, Stripe charges a 2.9% transaction fee and so directly grows as customers grow their business.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible:</strong> Customers should be able to choose and pay for their exact scope of usage, starting small and scaling as they mature.</li>
<li><strong>Scalable: </strong>It should grow steadily over time for the average customer once they’ve adopted the product. There’s a reason why cell phone providers now charge based on GB of data rather than talk minutes — data volumes keep going up.</li>
<li><strong>Predictable:</strong> Customers should be able to reasonably predict their usage so they have budget predictability. (Some assistance may be required during the sales process.)</li>
<li><strong>Feasible:</strong> It should be possible to monitor, administer and police usage. The metric needs to track with the cost of delivering the service so that customers don’t become unprofitable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Navigating enterprise legal and procurement teams</h2>
<p>Enterprise customers often crave price predictability for annual budgetary purposes. It can be tough for traditional legal and procurement teams to wrap their heads around a purchase with an unspecified cost. SaaS vendors must get creative with different usage-based pricing structures to give enterprise customers greater peace of mind.</p>

<p>Customer engagement software Twilio offers deeper discounts when a customer commits to usage for an extended period. AWS takes this a step further by allowing a customer to commit in advance, but still pay for their usage as it happens. Data analytics company Snowflake lets customers roll over their unused usage credits as long as their next year’s commitment is at least as large as the prior one.</p>
<h2>Handling overages</h2>
<p>Nobody wants to see a shock expense when they’ve unknowingly exceeded their usage limit. It’s important to design thoughtful overage policies that give customers the feeling of control over how much they’re spending.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building a front-end for business applications is often a matter of reinventing the wheel, but because every business&#8217; needs are slightly different, it&#8217;s also hard to automate. <a href="https://kleeen.software/#home">Kleeen</a> is the latest startup to attempt this, with a focus on building the user interface and experience for today&#8217;s data-centric applications. The service, which was founded by a team that previously ran a UI/UX studio in the Bay Area, uses a wizard-like interface to build the routine elements of the app and frees a company&#8217;s designers and developers to focus on the more custom elements of an application.</p>
<p>The company today announced that it has raised a $3.8 million seed round led by First Ray Venture Partners. Leslie Ventures, Silicon Valley Data Capital, WestWave Capital, Neotribe Ventures, AI Fund and a group of angel investors also participated in the round. Neotribe also led Kleeen&#8217;s $1.6 million pre-seed round, bringing the company&#8217;s total funding to $5.3 million.</p>

<p>After the startup he worked at sold, Kleeen co-founder, CPO and President Joshua Hailpern told me, he started his own B2B design studio, which focused on front-end design and engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we ended up seeing was the same pattern that would happen over and over again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We would go into a client, and they would be like: &#8216;we have the greatest idea ever. We want to do this, this, this and this.&#8217; And they would tell us all these really cool things and we were: &#8216;hey, we want to be part of that.&#8217; But then what we would end up doing was not that. Because when building products &#8212; there&#8217;s the showcase of the product and there&#8217;s all these parts that support that product that are necessary but you&#8217;re not going to win a deal because someone loved that config screen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea behind Kleeen is that you can essentially tell the system what you are trying to do and what the users need to be able to accomplish &#8212; because at the end of the day, there are some variations in what companies need from these basic building blocks, but not a ton. Kleeen can then generate this user interface and workflow for you &#8212; and generate the sample data to make this mock-up come to life.</p>
<p>Once that work is done, likely after a few iterations, Kleeen can generate React code, which development teams can then take and work with directly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116599" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/output01.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116599" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116599" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/output01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/output01.png 1754w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/output01.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/output01.png?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/output01.png?resize=768,396 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/output01.png?resize=680,351 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/output01.png?resize=1536,793 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/output01.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2116599" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kleeen</p></div></p>
<p>As Kleeen co-founder and CEO Matt Fox noted, the platform explicitly doesn&#8217;t want to be everything to everybody.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the no-code space, to say that you can build any app probably means that you&#8217;re not building any app very well if you&#8217;re just going to cover every use case. If someone wants to build a Bumble-style phone app where they swipe right and swipe left and find their next mate, we&#8217;re not the application platform for you. We&#8217;re focused on really data-intensive workflows.&#8221; He noted that Kleeen is at its best when developers use it to build applications that help a company analyze and monitor information and, crucially, take action on that information within the app. It&#8217;s this last part that also clearly sets it apart from a standard business intelligence platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hundreds of millions of users, especially in developing markets, don’t own high-end smartphones and can’t afford fast data plans to enjoy much of anything on the web.</p>
<p>Google has been exploring multiple ways to better serve this segment of the user base. It has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">tried partnerships</a> to make the internet <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-alphabet-is-shutting-down-loon-internet/">more affordable to tens of millions of users</a>. It has worked with smartphone makers to bring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/googles-lightweight-search-app-google-go-launches-to-android-users-worldwide/">reliable Android experience to cheap smartphones</a>. In fact, it’s currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">working on a project with telecom operator Jio Platforms</a> in India to further lower the price point for decent Android experience.</p>
<p>For mobile games, however, Google has a slightly different idea to reach users. Area 120, Google’s in-house incubator for experimental projects, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/gamesnacks-from-googles-area-120-brings-fast-casual-online-games-to-developing-markets/">last year launched GameSnacks</a>. It’s an HTML5 gaming platform, where titles are bite-sized and they load much faster and consume far less resources because of the way they have been designed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And that idea appears to be working.</p>
<p>Google said on Tuesday that over the past year it has made inroads with GameSnacks, and is now ready to scale the platform and test monetization models to make it worthwhile for game developers.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Ani Mohan, General Manager of GameSnacks, said the platform has amassed over 100 titles and millions of users.</p>
<p>“HTML5 gaming has been growing, especially outside of the United States. HTML5 is a great way to get games to users who have just come online and probably haven’t played games online before. These games are cross-device, work on low-bandwidth connection, and are instantly playable as they don’t require users to install any files,” he said.</p>
<p>These single-player games, that work on any device with as low RAM as 1GB and 2G to 3G data connection, are available to users through <a href="https://gamesnacks.com/embed/">GameSnacks website</a>. They can be played on desktop as well as Chrome on an iPhone or iPad (if you wanted to give it a whirl.)</p>
<p>Now the company is using its scale to expand the reach and discoverability of GameSnacks. Mohan said in recent weeks GameSnacks games have been made available from the New Tab page in Chrome for users in India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Kenya.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2116606" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="556" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=1536,833 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gamesnacks.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In India, Google’s biggest market by users, GameSnacks games are also arriving to Google Pay. The company is also experimenting with bringing GameSnacks games to Discover feed.</p>
<p>Mohan said the company is starting these integrations is select countries because that’s where many users face the challenges the platform is trying to address. “We view this as an early stage of experimentation. If it goes well, we will love to expand it,” he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mohan said the company is experimenting with bringing GameSnacks games to the Google Assistant.</p>
<p>“Now that few of these integrations are live, one of things we are hoping to do is talk to developers, and tell them that there is an easy way to get on Google,” he said.</p>
<p>Developers on GameSnacks currently monetize their games via a licensing or a contracting model where they sell some or all of their game rights to the company. Mohan said the team, which comprises six people (though more people from Google contribute to it), is working on helping these developers monetize their games using next-generation AdSense for Games ad formats.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to help them build viable businesses over time so we&#8217;re going to start experimenting with advertising on the platform,&#8221; he said. However, this will be for a select number of GameSnacks games for now.</p>
<p>Emerging markets such as Africa and Asia are not new to the world of HTML games. In India, for instance, a gaming platform called Gamezop raised $4.2 million last year to expand its HTML5 games to reach more developers and embed them into over 1,000 apps.</p>
<p>In 2018, South African telco, MTN Group, launched the Bonus Bucks HTML5 game portal for its subscribers in the Southern African country. Facebook operated HTML5 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/messenger-instant-games/">Instant Games on Messenger for years</a> until taking it off the messaging service. A quick search on our own archive <a href="https://search.techcrunch.com/search;_ylc=X3IDMgRncHJpZAN2X09YMEhvR1FKV1ljT2JEQlJLdVNBBG5fc3VnZwM0BHBvcwMwBHBxc3RyAwRwcXN0cmwDMARxc3RybAMxMQRxdWVyeQNIVE1MNSUyMGdhbWVzBHRfc3RtcAMxNjE0MDk4NjUz?p=HTML5+games&amp;fr=techcrunch">returns scores of firms</a> that work on HTML5 games in the past, though we have seen fewer examples in recent years.</p>
<p>Mohan remains bullish that there is a big opportunity for HTML games and this extends beyond Africa and Asia. &#8220;We don&#8217;t see these markets as our only option. These are just the markets we&#8217;re starting with because the need for HTML5 games&#8230; is especially compelling. We think the market size for this is much broader because HTML has users all around the world,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced the next set of features coming to Android, including a new password checkup tool, a way to schedule your texts, along with other improvements to products like its screen reader TalkBack, Maps, Assistant and Android Auto. This spring 2021 release is latest in a series of smaller update bundles, similar to iOS &#8220;point releases,&#8221; that add new functionality and features to Android outside of the larger update cycle.</p>
<p>One the security front, this update will integrate a feature called <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/password-checkup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/password-checkup/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614117062233000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqozQV40KSjRi_9v1DRGAGtxo3LA">Password Checkup</a> into devices running <span class="il">Android</span> 9 and above to alert you to passwords you&#8217;re using that have been previously exposed.</p>
<p>The feature works with Autofill with Google, which lets you quickly sign in to apps and other services on Android. Now, when you use Autofill, Password Checkup will check your credentials against a list of known compromised passwords, then notify you if your credentials appear on that list and what to do about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2116576" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116576" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116576" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.05.36-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.05.36-AM.jpg 1946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.05.36-AM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.05.36-AM.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.05.36-AM.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.05.36-AM.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.05.36-AM.jpg?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.05.36-AM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116576" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The prompt can also direct you to your <a href="https://passwords.google.com/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://passwords.google.com/?hl%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614117062234000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFDERw_ADCG9o_lUy540e_i7aTcA">Password Manager page</a> on Google, where you can review all your other saved Autofill passwords for similar issues.</p>
<p>To use this feature, you&#8217;ll need to have Autofill enabled. (Settings &gt; System &gt; Languages &amp; Input &gt; Advanced, the tap Autofill. Tap Google to ensure the setting is enabled.)</p>
<p>The new Messages feature rolling out this update could see prolific texters considering a switch to Android, as it&#8217;s one of the most in-demand features since SMS was invented: the ability to schedule your texts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116570" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116570" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ScheduleSend.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Android&#8217;s new scheduled send feature will allow you to compose a message ahead of time, whenever it&#8217;s convenient for you, then schedule it to be sent later when it&#8217;s a more appropriate time. This can be particularly helpful if you have friends, family or coworkers and colleagues in other timezones, and are hesitant to bother them when they could be sleeping or enjoying family time after work. It can also help those who often remember something they meant to text when it&#8217;s late at night and too late to send the message.</p>
<p>To use this feature, you&#8217;ll just write the text as usual, then press and hold the send button to select a date and time to deliver the message. You&#8217;ll need the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging">latest version of the Android Messages app</a> for this feature to work.</p>
<p>Another flagship feature arriving in this Android release is aimed at making Android&#8217;s screen reader, known as TalkBack, easier to use for those users who are blind or have low vision. TalkBack today allows users to navigate their device with their voice and gestures in order to read, write, send emails, share social media, order delivery and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116569" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116569" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116569" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Talkback.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116569" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The updated version (TalkBack 9.1) will now include a dozen new multifinger gestures to interact with apps and perform common actions, like selecting and editing text, controlling media or getting help. This will work on Pixel and Samsung Galaxy devices from One UI 3 onwards, Google says.</p>
<p>Google is also responding to user feedback over TalkBack&#8217;s confusing multiple menu system and has returned to the single menu system users wanted. This single menu will adapt to context while also providing consistent access to the most common functions.</p>
<p>Other TalkBack improvements includes new gestures &#8212; like an up and right swipe to access over 25 voice commands &#8212; and new reading controls that let users either skim a page, read only headlines, listen word-by-word or even character-by-character.</p>
<p>Users can also now add or remove options from the TalkBack menu or the reading controls to further customize the interface to their needs. Plus, TalkBack&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/braille-keyboard/">braille keyboard</a> added support for Arabic and Spanish.</p>
<p>The spring update also adds more minor improvements to Maps, Assistant and Android Auto.</p>
<p>Maps is getting a dark mode that you can enable as the default under Settings &gt; Theme and then selecting &#8220;Always in Dark Theme.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116571" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116571" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116571" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GoogleMaps_NightMode.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GoogleMaps_NightMode.png 1001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GoogleMaps_NightMode.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GoogleMaps_NightMode.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GoogleMaps_NightMode.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GoogleMaps_NightMode.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GoogleMaps_NightMode.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116571" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google Assistant&#8217;s update will let you use the feature when the phone is locked or further away from you, by turning on Lock Screen Personal Results in Assistant&#8217;s Settings then saying &#8220;Hey Google,&#8221; as needed.</p>
<p>The new cards that appear when the phone is locked are meant to be easier to read with just a glance, Google says.</p>
<p>And finally, Android Auto will now include custom wallpapers and voice-activated games like trivia and &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221; that you can ask for via the &#8220;Hey Google&#8221; command.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116579" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116579" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2116579 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.07.50-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="406" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.07.50-AM.jpg 1932w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.07.50-AM.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.07.50-AM.jpg?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.07.50-AM.jpg?resize=768,459 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.07.50-AM.jpg?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.07.50-AM.jpg?resize=1536,917 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-23-at-11.07.50-AM.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116579" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>There are also now shortcuts on the launch screen for accessing your contacts, or using Assistant to complete tasks like checking the weather or adjusting the thermostat, for example. Cars with wider screens will gain access to a split screen view with Google Maps on one side and media controls on the other.</p>
<p>Android Auto&#8217;s features will roll out in the &#8220;coming days&#8221; on phones running Android 6.0 and higher and work with <a href="https://www.android.com/auto/compatibility/">compatible cars,</a> Google notes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zenhub.com/">ZenHub</a>, the GitHub-centric project management service for development teams, today announced that it has raised a $4.7 million seed funding round from Canada&#8217;s BDC Capital and Ripple Ventures. This marks the first fundraise for the Vancouver, Canada-based startup after the team bootstrapped the service, which first launched back in 2014. Additional angel investors in this round include Adam Gross (former CEO of Heroku), Jiaona Zhang (VP Product at Webflow) and Oji Udezue (VP Product at Calendly).</p>
<p>In addition to announcing this funding round, the team also today launched its newest automation feature, which makes it easier for teams to plan the development sprints, something that is core to the Agile development process but often takes a lot of time and energy &#8212; something teams are better off spending on the actual development process.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a really exciting kind of pivot point for us as a business and gives us a lot of ammunition, I think, to really go after our vision and mission a little bit more aggressively than we have even in the past,&#8221; ZenHub co-founder and CEO Aaron Upright told me. The team, he explained, used the beginning of the pandemic to spend a lot of time with customers to better understand how they were reacting to what was happening. In the process, customers repeatedly noted that development resources were getting increasingly expensive and that teams were being stretched even farther and under a lot of pressure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>ZenHub&#8217;s answer to this was to look into how it could automate more of the processes that constitute the most complex parts of Agile. Earlier this year, the company launched its first efforts in this area, with new tools for improving developer handoffs in GitHub and now, with the help of this new funding, it is putting the next pieces in place by helping teams automate their sprint planning.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116249" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sprints-clip_calendarview_800px.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116249" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116249" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sprints-clip_calendarview_800px.gif" alt="" width="800" height="400" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2116249" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ZenHub</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We thought about automation as an answer to [the problems development teams were facing] and that we could take an approach to automation and to help guide teams through some of the most complex and time-consuming parts of the Agile process,&#8221; Upright said. &#8220;We raised money so that we can really accelerate toward that vision. As a self-funded company, we could have gone down that path, albeit a little bit slower. But the opportunity that we saw in the market &#8212; really brought about by the pandemic, and teams working more remotely and this pressure to produce &#8212; we wanted to provide a solution much, much faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spring planning feature itself is actually pretty straightforward and allows project managers to allocate a certain number of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation">story points</a> (a core Agile metric to estimate the complexity of a given action item) to each sprint. ZenHub&#8217;s tool can then use that to automatically generate a list of the most highly prioritized items for the next sprint. Optionally, teams can also decide to roll over items that they didn&#8217;t finish during a given sprint into the next one.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116250" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sprints-clip_autoaddsprinttoggle.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116250" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116250" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sprints-clip_autoaddsprinttoggle.gif" alt="" width="800" height="400" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2116250" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ZenHub</p></div></p>
<p>With that, ZenHub Sprints can automate a lot of the standard sprint meetings and lets teams focus on thinking about the overall process. Of course, teams can always overrule the automated systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more that developers hate than sitting around the table for eight hours, planning sprints, when really they all just want to be working on stuff,&#8221; Upright said.</p>
<p>With this new feature, sprints become a core feature of the ZenHub experience. Typically, project managers worked around this by assigning milestones in GitHub, but having a dedicated tool and these new automation features will make this quite a bit easier.</p>
<p>Coming soon, ZenHub will also build a new feature that will automate some parts of the software estimation process, too, by launching a new tool that will help teams more easily allocate story points to routing action items so that their discussions can focus on the more contentious ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Archer Aviation, the electric aircraft startup that recently announced a deal to go public via a merger with a blank-check company, plans to launch a network of its urban air taxis in Los Angeles by 2024.</p>
<p>The announcement comes two months after the formation of the Urban Air Mobility Partnership, a one-year initiative between Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti&#8217;s office, the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and Urban Movement Labs to develop a plan for how to integrate urban aircraft into existing transportation networks and land use policies. Urban Movement Labs, launched in November 2019, is a public-private partnership involving local government and companies to develop, test and deploy transportation technologies. Urban Movement Labs and the city of Los Angeles are working on the design and access of &#8220;vertiports,&#8221; where people can go to fly on an &#8220;urban air mobility&#8221; aircraft. Urban air mobility, or UAM, is industry-speak for a highly automated aircraft that can operate and transport passengers or cargo at lower altitudes within urban and suburban areas.</p>
<p>Archer Aviation&#8217;s announcement comes two weeks since it landed United Airlines as a customer and an investor in its bid to become a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/archer-lands-1-1b-order-from-united-airlines-and-a-spac-deal/">publicly traded company via a merger</a> with a special purpose acquisition company. Archer Aviation reached an agreement in early February to merge with special purpose acquisition company Atlas Crest Investment Corp., an increasingly common financial path that allows the startup to eschew the once traditional IPO process. The combined company, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange with ticker symbol “ACHR,” will have an equity valuation of $3.8 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>United Airlines, which has a major hub in Los Angeles, was one of the investors in the deal. Under the terms of its agreement, United placed an order for $1 billion of Archer’s aircraft. United has the option to buy an additional $500 million of aircraft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Archer&#8217;s commitment to launch their first eVTOL aircraft in one of United&#8217;s hubs means our customers are another step closer to reducing their carbon footprint at every stage of their journey, before they even take their seat,&#8221; Michael Leskinen, vice president of corporate development and investor relations at United Airlines, said in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re confident that Los Angeles is only the beginning for Archer and we look forward to helping them extend their reach across all of our Hubs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Archer has a ways to go before it&#8217;s ready to shuttle passengers. The company has yet to mass produce its electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, which is designed to travel up to 60 miles on a single charge at speeds of 150 miles per hour. The company previously said it plans to unveil its full-scale eVTOL later this year and is aiming to begin volume manufacturing in 2023.</p>
<p>Designing and building a hub of vertiports is among the numerous tasks that must be completed in the next three years. Brett Adcock and Adam Goldstein, the company&#8217;s co-founders and co-CEOs, have said they&#8217;re open to using existing infrastructure such as helipads and parking garages in the short term. Their eVTOL, known as &#8220;Maker,&#8221; is built to fit within the size of the existing infrastructure, according to the company. That flexibility, assuming the Urban Air Mobility Partnership agrees with the strategy, could help Archer meet its 2024 deadline.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is working in the office going to look like in a post-COVID-19 world?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s something one startup hopes to help companies figure out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.saltmine.com/">Saltmine</a>, which has developed a web-based workplace design platform, has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Jungle Ventures and Xplorer Capital led the financing, which also included participation from JLL Spark, the strategic investment arm of commercial real estate brokerage JLL. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, JLL is not only investing in Saltmine, but is also partnering with the San Francisco-based startup to sell its service directly to its clients &#8212; opening up a whole new revenue stream for the four-year-old company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmine claims its cloud-based technology does for corporate real estate heads what Salesforce did for CROs in digitizing and streamlining the office design process. It saw an 80% spike in ARR (annual recurring revenue) last year while doubling the number of companies it works with, according to CEO and founder </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shagufta-anurag-524970a3/">Shagufta Anurag</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its more than 35 customers include PG&amp;E, Snowflake, Fidelity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Workday, among others. Its mission, put simply, is to help companies “create the best possible workplaces for their employees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmine claims to have a 95% customer retention rate and in 2020 saw 350% year over year growth in monthly active users of its SaaS platform. So far, the square footage of all the office real estate properties designed and analyzed by customers on Saltmine totals 50 million square feet across 1,500 projects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmine says it offers companies tools to do things like establish social distancing measures in the office. Its platform, the company says, houses all workplace data &#8212; including strategy, design, pricing and portfolio analytics &#8212; in one place. It combines and analyzes floor plans with project requirements with real-time behavioral data (aggregated through a combination of utilization sensors and employee feedback) to identify companies’ design needs. Besides aiming to improve the workplace design process, Saltmine claims to be able to help companies “optimize their real estate portfolios.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has dramatically increased the need for a digital transformation of how workplaces are designed and reimagined, according to Anurag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the need for social distancing capabilities and a greater emphasis on work-life balance in many office settings, few workers expect a complete &#8216;return to normal,&#8217; ” she said. “There is now enormous pressure on corporate heads of real estate to adapt and modify their workplaces.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once companies identify their new needs, Saltmine uses “immersive” digital 3D renderings to help them visualize the necessary changes to their real estate properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore-based Anurag has previous experience in the design world, having founded </span><a href="https://www.spacematrix.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space Matrix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a large interior design firm in Asia, as well as </span><a href="https://www.livspace.com/in"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Livspace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital home interior design company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I saw the same pain points and unmet needs in office real estate that I did in the residential market,” she said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Real estate is the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> second-largest cost for companies and has a direct impact on their largest cost &#8212; their people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmine plans to use its new capital to (naturally) do some hiring and continue to acquire customers &#8212; in particular, seeking to expand its portfolio of Global 2000 companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has about 125 employees in five offices across Asia, Europe and North America.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It expects to have 170 employees by year’s end and to be profitable by the end of fiscal year 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s initial focus has been in North America, but it is now beginning to expand into APAC and Australia. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLL Technologies&#8217; co-CEO Yishai Lerner said JLL Spark was drawn to Saltmine’s approach of making data and analytics accessible in one place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having a single source of truth for data also facilitates collaboration across teams, which is important, for example, in workspace planning,” he told TechCrunch. “This reduces inefficiencies and improves workflows in today’s fragmented design, build and fit-out market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLL Spark invests in companies that it believes can benefit from its distribution and network &#8212; hence the firm&#8217;s agreement to sell Saltmine’s software directly to its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As JLL tenants and clients continue to embrace the future of work, they are seeking technology solutions that keep their buildings running efficiently and effectively,” Lerner said. “Saltmine’s platform checks all of the boxes by streamlining stakeholder collaboration, increasing transparency and simplifying data management.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Whether you’re <em>working on something new</em> according to your Twitter bio, or <em>self-employed, </em>according to your LinkedIn bio, founder <a href="https://twitter.com/_BenHQ">Ben Huffman</a> thinks his platform, Contra, will be the best way for independent workers to explain and monetize what they are working on.</p>
<p><a href="https://contra.com/">Contra</a> is a platform that wants professionals to create profiles that show project-based identities, versus a role-based identity that one would show on LinkedIn. It’s been built for what Huffman thinks is the future: digital knowledge workers, a term he uses to describe independent tech workers who freelance for different companies or gigs.</p>
<p>The early adopters are independent workers who want to work or advise for a product team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“So you can think about any type of modern-day product team consisting of like a designer, an engineer, a PM, maybe a writer, or maybe someone else distributing content. There&#8217;s a high degree of referability amongst these user types,” he said.</p>
<p>Users would showcase the tools they use, projects they’ve led and initiatives they’ve pushed instead of simply writing “Former Stripe Engineer” and calling it a day.</p>
<p>“What you don’t know is what problems they solved at Stripe,” Huffman explained, and Contra wants to give users space to explain that.</p>
<p>A Contra profile looks like a storefront for an independent creators’ business. The first thing you will see is project experience, with the option to toggle between services currently available for sale, recommendations from the referral network and, finally, the About page.</p>
<p>A goal of Contra’s, per Huffman, is to help independent workers create high-signal referral networks so they can land new opportunities and gigs. Whenever a user posts a new project experience to their resume, they can add who they worked with as a collaborator.</p>
<p>It’s different from LinkedIn, where you can add anyone you meet and they become a “connection.” Contra requires you to have work experience with your network, making the referral network high-signal. Contra positions referrals high-up on profiles, reminiscent of the MySpace Top 10.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 creator economy VCs see startup opportunities in monetization, discovery and much more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/4-creator-economy-vcs-see-startup-opportunities-in-monetization-discovery-and-much-more/embed/#?secret=uiZX6vxeQs" data-secret="uiZX6vxeQs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Referrals as a core mechanism to get jobs could disproportionately hurt Black and brown founders, who have been left out of networks. But Huffman says that Contra doesn’t only rely on referrals, it also helps position someone as more than their resume.</p>
<p>“Most resumes are filtered out by AI today and have historically disadvantaged BPOC candidates,” he said. “With a project focus instead of roles and education credential-focus on the identity, we help undiscovered talent get ahead.”</p>
<p>Huffman, who experienced resume bias first-hand as a college dropout with no-credentials from a rural area, thinks that his tool can combat bias in an effective way. The best-case scenario would be if Contra could help a talented designer based in Minneapolis get an opportunity in a city like San Francisco or New York by showcasing their work.</p>
<p>But Contra has ambition to be more than just the latest startup to aim at LinkedIn, Huffman tells TechCrunch. Beyond being a professional network, it wants to also be a place where independent workers can make money for their services and get inbound customers. He describes Contra as a LinkedIn meets Shopify for independent workers.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2116099" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Contra_2.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>In other words, Contra is a profile that independent workers can build and then monetize off of, as well as track engagement on how certain services of theirs might be in more demand than others.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to enable people to monetize the value they create, versus the time they spend in places,” says Huffman. The goal here is to “enable people to build these identities, and give them infrastructure to be successful as an independent worker. Contra integrates with Stripe to bring on payments infrastructure, letting workers actually sell their services on the platform.</p>
<p>From an independent worker’s perspective, the internal view offers analytics to understand what the public is looking at on their profile, from what services are most in demand to what projects get the most attention. The analytics, which are private to everyone except the user, also helps workers understand what the conversion rate is once people come to their platform.</p>
<p>It is free to make money and a profile on Contra, which differentiates it from freelance marketplaces like UpWork and Fiverr, which take a percent cut of earnings. Since Contra doesn’t charge a commission on earnings, it monetizes through a SaaS subscription, $29 a month, that includes benefits such as same-day payouts and higher visibility in the platform to eventually get better opportunities.</p>
<p>A potentially large new competitor might be from LinkedIn itself, which is developing a new service called Marketplaces <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-new-gig-a-linkedin-freelancer-market-rivaling-upwork-fiverr">to help freelancers find and book work. </a>Facebook is also working on a tool related to freelancers. Huffman sees Contra’s focus on professional identity as a competitive advantage, and the fact that the tool might be taking commissions.</p>
<p>“It makes what we are doing that much more relevant,” he said.</p>
<p>Luckily, the startup has raised a $14.5 million Series A round to meet its competition head on. The financing event was led by Unusual Ventures, with participation from Cowboy Ventures and Li Jin’s recently announced Atelier Ventures.</p>
<p>Contra wouldn’t disclose the number of users it currently has but did confirm that the total is “in the six-figure range.”</p>
<p>The cash will be used to increase the speed in which it can ship features, as well as build out an ambassador program, in which it will pay users $1,000 a month to test out the product and support the shift to independent work.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The clear takeaway from the first Oscar Health IPO pricing interval is that public investors have lost their minds. Go public now.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amidst all the hype that Lemonade (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/high-flying-ipos-for-lemonade-and-accolade-may-encourage-other-unicorns-to-go-public/">IPO</a>), Root (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/inside-roots-ipo-filing/">IPO</a>), Metromile (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/insurtechs-big-year-gets-bigger-as-metromile-looks-to-go-public/">SPAC-led debut</a>) and other insurtech players have generated in the last year, it&#8217;s been easy to forget about <a href="https://www.hioscar.com/">Oscar Health</a>. But now that the company founded in 2012 is approaching the public markets, one of the early tech-themed insurance companies is catching up on the attention front.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>There is some naughty language in The Exchange today. It is necessary. We&#8217;ll get back to PG-ifying this column tomorrow. &#8212; Alex</em></p>
<p>So this morning we&#8217;re digging into Oscar Health&#8217;s first IPO pricing interval, hoping to understand how the market is valuing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/how-will-investors-value-metromile-and-oscar-health/">unprofitable health-insurance enterprise</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Recall that Oscar Health was valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/oscar-health-raises-165-million-at-reported-3b-valuation/">around $3.2 billion in March of 2018</a>. That datapoint, via <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook</a>, is dated. Oscar Health raised hundreds of millions since (per several venture-capital tracking databases, including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/">Crunchbase</a>) but we lack a final private valuation for the company.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Oscar Health now targeting <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568651/000119312521049832/d28906ds1a.htm#toc28906_3">a $32 to $34 per-share IPO range</a>, we can get our hands dirty.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get some valuation numbers and then decide if Oscar Health feels cheap or expensive at that price.</p>
<h2>Billion-dollar IPO</h2>
<p>Oscar Health is looking to reap as much as $1.21 billion in its IPO, a huge sum. The company is selling 30,350,920 shares, with 4,650,000 additional shares reserved for its underwriters. Existing shareholders are selling another 649,080 shares.</p>
<p>This means that after the IPO, Oscar Health will have 197,037,445 Class A and B shares in circulation, or 201,687,445 after counting shares reserved for its underwriters.</p>
<p>Using the company&#8217;s $32 to $34 per-share range, we can calculate a valuation minimum of $6.31 billion for the company (lower share count, low-end of price range) and $6.86 billion (higher share count, high-end of price range). That&#8217;s the company&#8217;s <em>simple</em> IPO valuation.</p>
<p>Oscar Health may also sell up to $375 million of its shares at its IPO price to three different funds. The company advises that the &#8220;indication of interest is not a binding agreement or commitment to purchase,&#8221; so we can ignore it for now.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is off 2.34% after falling yesterday. Shares of Tesla are off more than 6% today, now mired in <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-tumbles-toward-2nd-bear-market-in-less-than-6-months-2021-02-23">a bear-market correction</a> after reaching new all-time highs earlier this year. Apple stock is worth $122.02 per share, down from over its recent highs of more than $145.</p>
<p>After a long period of time when it felt like tech stocks only went up, the recent correction is starting to feel material.</p>
<p>There are other ways to measure the selloff. <a href="https://www.bvp.com/bvp-nasdaq-emerging-cloud-index">Bessemer&#8217;s cloud index</a> is off 4.5% today, after falling over 5% yesterday. And the now-infamous $ARKK, or <a href="https://ark-funds.com/arkk">ARK Innovation ETF</a> that many investors have used as a proxy for growthy-tech stocks, is off 6.6% today after falling 5.9% yesterday.</p>
<p>Hell, even bitcoin has taken a pounding in the last few days, after its recent, relentless rise.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s driving the rapid turn-around in the value of tech companies, tech-focused indices, and tech-adjacents, like cryptocurrencies? Not merely one thing, of course, in an environment as complex as the world&#8217;s capital markets. But there <em>is</em> a rising narrative that you should consider.</p>
<p>Namely that the <em>money-is-cheap-and-bond-yield-is-garbage-so-everyone-is-putting-money-into-stocks</em> trade is losing steam. As some yields rise, bonds are become more attractive bets. And as COVID-19 vaccines roll out, some investors are pushing their stock-market bets into categories other than tech.</p>
<p>The result is that the landscape of value is shifting; the winds that were at the back of every tech company are receding, at least for now. If the changed weather persists until the very investment climate that tech stocks exist in reaches a new equilibrium, we could see the appetite for tech IPOs lessen, late-stage <em>private</em> valuations for startup shares dip, and more.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/22/stock-market-open-to-close-news.html">CNBC from earlier today on what&#8217;s changing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Stocks dropped again on Tuesday as tech shares continued to tumble in the face of higher interest rates and a rotation into stocks more linked to the economic comeback.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-selloff-prompts-rethink-bystock-investors-11613919600">the Wall Street Journal on the same theme</a>, from yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The lift in yields largely reflects investor expectations of a strong economic recovery. However, the collateral damage could include higher borrowing costs for businesses, more options for investors who had seen few alternatives to stocks and less favorable valuation models for some hot technology shares, investors and analysts said.</p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tech-stocks-outside-u-s-also-hammered-as-interest-rates-rise-51614078392">here&#8217;s Barrons from this morning</a>, noting that what we&#8217;re seeing at home is not merely a US-issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>While members of the NYSE FANG+ index including Tesla, Facebook and Apple have dropped sharply as the yield on the 10-year Treasury has climbed, the sector also is on the retreat overseas.</p></blockquote>
<div class="paywall">The market could snap back. Or not. It&#8217;s worth watching stocks for the next few days.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is running a new test that will ask users to pause and think before they tweet. According to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1363956974824550400">announcement</a>, when Twitter detects what appears to be a potentially harmful or offensive reply to someone else&#8217;s tweet, it will prompt you to consider revising your text instead of tweeting.</p>
<p>Users whose tweets are flagged in this way will see a pop-up message appear on their screen, which asks, &#8220;Want to review this before Tweeting?&#8221; There are three buttons to then choose from: one to tweet the reply anyway, an Edit button (this is as close as we&#8217;ll get, apparently), and a delete button to discard the tweet entirely. There is also a small link to report if the system got things wrong.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Twitter has run a test like this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/twitter-harmful-replies-prompt-harassment-test-feature/">May 2020</a> and again in <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1292883957164281861">August 2020</a>, Twitter ran variations on this same experiment. In those cases, the text on the pop-up screen was largely the same, but the layout of the three buttons looked different and were less colorful.</p>
<p>The earlier tests ran on Android, iOS and web, but this current iteration is only on iOS in English, for the time being.</p>
<p>At the time of the initial test, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/twitter-harmful-replies-prompt-harassment-test-feature/">explained</a> its systems were able to detect harmful language based on the kind of language that had been used in other tweets that had been reported in the past.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say something in the moment you might regret? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> We&#39;ve relaunched this experiment on iOS that asks you to review a reply that&#39;s potentially harmful or offensive. </p>
<p>Think you&#39;ve received a prompt by mistake? Share your feedback with us so we can improve. <a href="https://t.co/t68az8vlYN">pic.twitter.com/t68az8vlYN</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1363956974824550400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s been shown that these sorts of built-in small nudges can have an impact.</p>
<p>For example, when Twitter began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/">prompting users to read the article</a> linked in a tweet before retweeting it, the company found that users would open the articles 40% more often than without the nudge. Twitter has also built similar experiments to try to slow down the pace of online conversation on its platform, by doing things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/">discouraging retweets without commentary</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/twitter-may-slow-down-users-ability-to-like-tweets-containing-misinformation/">slow down &#8220;Likes&#8221;</a> on tweets containing misinformation.</p>
<p>Other social networks use small nudges like this, too, to influence their users&#8217; behavior. Instagram back in 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/instagram-anti-bullying-features/">launched</a> a feature that would flag potentially offensive comments before they were posted, and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/instagram-to-now-flag-potentially-offensive-captions-in-addition-to-comments/">expanded</a> this to captions. TikTok more recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/tiktok-to-flag-and-downrank-unsubstantiated-claims-fact-checkers-cant-verify/">launched a banner</a> that would ask users if they were sure they wanted to share a video that contains &#8220;unverified content.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear why Twitter hasn&#8217;t simply rolled out the pop-up to combat online abuse &#8212; still a serious issue on its platform &#8212; and then iterated on the design and style of the message box, as needed.</p>
<p>Compared with the much larger engineering and design efforts the company has had underway &#8212; including its newer Stories feature known as Fleets and a Clubhouse rival called Spaces &#8212; a box asking users to pause and think seems like something that could have graduated to a full product by now.</p>
<p>Twitter, however, says it chose to pause the earlier experiment because it needed to make improvements.</p>
<p>&#8220;We paused the experiment once we realized the prompt was inconsistent and that we needed to be more mindful of how we prompted potentially harmful Tweets. This led to more work being done around our health model while making it easier for people to share feedback if we get it wrong,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also made some changes to this reply prompt to improve how we evaluate potentially offensive language &#8211; like insults, strong language, or hateful remarks &#8211; and are offering more context for why someone may have been prompted. As we were testing last summer, we also began looking at relationships between Tweet authors and people who reply to avoid prompting replies that were jokes or banter between friends,&#8221; they added.</p>

<p>The test is designed to tell you if your story is memorable (will it “stick to your ribs?”) so you can turn it into a compelling message. It looks something like this:</p>

<p>Marc Benioff could have launched Salesforce by describing it as an online way for companies to manage relationships with their customers. It’s true and it would have been interesting, at least to some people. But instead, Marc went bigger: He ran a campaign that described Salesforce as the “end of software.”</p>
<p>At the time, software was everywhere and it was creating all kinds of problems: It was massively expensive, time consuming and prone to failure. By taking on those issues, Marc made the company instantly more relevant to a bigger market and audience. The conversation went from a discussion of feature checklists, contacts and leads, to how an entire industry would change. Marc looked like a visionary — and Salesforce seemed revolutionary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://goshippo.com/">Shippo</a>, a software company that provides <a href="https://goshippo.com/products/shipping/">shipping-related services</a> to ecommerce companies, announced a new $45 million investment. The new capital values the startup at $495 million. TechCrunch is calling the new funding a Series D as it is a priced round that followed its Series C; the company did not award the round a moniker.</p>
<p>Shippo&#8217;s 2020 Series C, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/shippo-raises-a-30m-series-c-after-posting-rapid-2019-growth/">$30 million transaction</a> that was announced last April, valued the company at around $220 million. D1 Capital led both Shippo&#8217;s Series C and D rounds, implying that it was content to pay around twice as much for the company&#8217;s equity in 2021 than it was in 2020. (Recall that investors doubling-down on previous bets as lead investor in successive rounds is no longer considered to be a negative signal concerning startup quality, but a <em>positive</em> indicator.)</p>
<p>Why raise more money so soon after its last round? According to Shippo CEO and founder <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraBehrensWu">Laura Behrens Wu</a>, her company made material progress on customer acquisition and partnerships last year. That led to a decision around the time of Shippo&#8217;s Q4 board meeting with her investors that it was a good time to put more capital into the company.</p>
<p>In a sense the timing is reasonable. As Shippo scales its customer base, it can negotiate better shipping deals with various providers, which, in turn, help it continue to attract new customers. Behrens Wu noted in an interview with TechCrunch that when her company was helping its early customers ship just a few packages, shipping companies it supports on its platform didn&#8217;t want to meet with the startup. Now armed with more volume, Shippo can recycle customer demand into partner leverage, improving its total customer offering.</p>
<p>Behrens Wu said that Shippo had secured such a partnership with UPS before it raised its new round.</p>
<p>Turning to growth, Shippo doubled its platform spend, or &#8220;GPV&#8221; last year. GPV is the company&#8217;s acronym for <em>gross postage volume</em>. It roughly tracks with revenue, TechCrunch confirmed. So Shippo likely doubled its top-line last year. That&#8217;s good. Shippo wants to do that again this year, Behrens Wu told TechCrunch. The startup will also double its headcount this year, adding around 150 people.</p>
<p>Now flush with more capital, what&#8217;s next for Shippo? Per its CEO, the startup wants to invest more in platforms (where Shippo is baked into a marketplace, for example), international expansion (Shippo only does a &#8220;little bit&#8221; of international shipping, per Behrens Wu), and double-down on what it considers its core customer base.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious about how broad Shippo might take its product from its original home in shipping labels. The startup said that there&#8217;s lots of room in the journey of a packaged, from pre-purchase on, where her company might expand into. However, Behrens Wu cautioned that such a broadening of product work is not an immediate focus at her company.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how long the current ecommerce boom lasts and how far this new capital can take Shippo. If it doubles in size again this year we&#8217;ll have to start its IPO countdown sometime in mid-2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.wisetack.com/">Wisetack</a>, a startup that provides buy-now-pay-later services to in-person business transactions, announced that is has closed a total of $19 million across two rounds, a seed investment and a Series A.</p>
<p><a href="https://greylock.com/">Greylock</a> led both rounds, with the seed round clocking in at $4 million and the Series A at $15 million. <a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/">Bain Capital Ventures</a> also took part in the company&#8217;s fundraising.</p>
<p>Notably both rounds were closed in 2019, making these amongst the more aged rounds that we&#8217;ve heard of in recent quarters. However, as much venture reporting was delayed last year due to the pandemic and political unsettlement, I am still willing to cover the occasional antique deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wisetack caught our eye not only due to its fundraising activity, but also thanks the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) space becoming all the more interesting in the wake of Affirm&#8217;s direct listing. Affirm is perhaps the best-known service of its type, making its liquidity moment &#8212; and post-IPO performance &#8212; impactful for its broader business category.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Z4qDjRXNLo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/">Wall Street hugs Affirm as it starts life as a public company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wall Street hugs Affirm as it starts life as a public company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/embed/#?secret=Z4qDjRXNLo" data-secret="Z4qDjRXNLo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But while Affirm wants to offer point-of-sale BNPL services to online merchants, Wisetack is taking a different approach. It focuses on the in-person business world, helping finance consumer transactions involving things like home improvement and car repair; the sort of big transactions that your average family might not have the cash to cover but also doesn&#8217;t want to put on a credit card.</p>
<p>Wisetack partners with vertical SaaS players in different areas. Say, plumbing. This allows users of those vertical SaaS applications &#8212; the plumbers, sticking to the same example &#8212; to offer Wisetack&#8217;s BNPL service to their customers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well known that vertical SaaS has wide application. A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/atlantas-singleops-raises-6m-for-its-outdoor-care-focused-software-business/">favorite recent example is SingleOps</a>, which provides software for the so-called &#8220;green industry,&#8221; the world of lawns and landscaping. There&#8217;s SaaS for all sorts of IRL work, which could mean that Wisetack has a good number of software providers to sell into.</p>
<p>The model appears to be working, at least thus far. Wisetack shared with TechCrunch that its loan volume rose 20x between January of 2020 and January of 2021. As the company generates revenues from merchants (loan processing costs), and consumer interest, it&#8217;s likely that its revenue scales with loan volume. If the relationship is even closer to direct, Wisetack grew quite a lot last year.</p>
<p>The startup also said that the number of businesses using Wisetack grew 25-fold last year to a number in the &#8220;thousands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wisetack fits neatly into a number of recent trends. The first is its work with vertical SaaS, a notable slice of the software market. The second is that Wisetack is another example of an API-led business, offering its service as a tech-powered add-on to other bits of code. And, third, that Wisetack had the same lead investor twice in sequential rounds. This sort of doubling-down from the venture community has become common in recent quarters as the signaling risk of having the lead twice in a row has been zeroed out by general investor enthusiasm for more equity in what appear to be winning startups.</p>
<p>Finally, the Wisetack round is interesting as it is nearly a sort of vertical BNPL, or at least a vertically focused BNPL. The company was reticent to share notes on how it comes to credit decisions, but we presume that all BNPL players that do focus on a particular niche or segment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rode Microphones has a new and improved version of its much-loved Go portable mic, the Wireless Go II, which uses the same form factor as the original but adds a list of new and improved features. Most notably, the Go II offers two transmitter packs that can simultaneously talk to a single receiver, letting you record two individual speakers to the same camera or connected device.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.rode.com/wirelessgoii​">Rode Wireless Go II</a> ($299) ships with everything you need to begin recording high-quality audio to a camera or anything else that can connect to a 3.5mm jack. The transmitter packs – there are two of them in the box – have built-in microphones that offer great sound on their own, or you can use them with any 3.5mm-equipped lavalier mic depending on your needs.</p>
<p>The receiver pack can output to 3.5mm TRS, but it can also transmit using USB Type-C (which is also for charging). This is new for this generation, and Rode also sells USB-C to USB-C and USB-C to Lightning cables so that you can use them with modern Android devices, iPhones, iPads, Macs and PCs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2116238" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116238" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116238" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-2.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116238" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rode</p></div></p>
<p>Each of the three packs has a built-in rechargeable battery that can provide up to 7 hours of operating time on a single charge. You can independently adjust the gain on each of the transmitters, and mute each individually or both from the receiver pack. You can also swap between mono recording with each transmitter as a channel, and stereo recording modes.</p>
<p>The transmitters can operate at a range of 200 meters (roughly 650 feet) from the receiver, provided they have line-of-sight, and the receiver has a display to show you input levels, battery status, connectivity and more. The transmitters each have two LEDs that provide visual feedback for connectivity and gain. Each also automatically records locally, with the ability to store more than 24 hours of audio on built-in storage in case of dropouts in connectivity.</p>
<h2>Design and performance</h2>
<p>With this update, it really feels like Rode has thought of everything. You can get started immediately, for one, since the transmitter packs and receiver come pre-paired and assigned to left and right channels by default. They&#8217;re incredibly user-friendly, and while Rode has introduced a new Windows and Mac app for centralized control of them called Rode Central, you don&#8217;t actually need any additional software to get started recording with them.</p>
<p>This updated version also uses a new RF transmission tech that has 128-bit encryption built in, with a much farther line-of-site range for their use. This is designed to make them much more reliable in areas where there&#8217;s a lot of RF traffic happening already – like a busy shopping mall (once COVID times are behind us), conference halls, or other public areas with lots of people and smartphones around.</p>

<p>The onboard memory is also new, and means you&#8217;ll never have to worry about any potential dropped connections since you&#8217;ll always have a local file to rely on on the transmitter packs themselves. A similar peace-of-mind feature is a safety channel that records a back-up track at -20db, so that if you encounter any overloud sounds that cause peaking in your primary recording, you&#8217;ll have another option. Both of these features have to be turned on proactively in the Rode Central app, which Rode will also use to deliver future firmware updates for the Go II, but they&#8217;re very welcome additions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116240" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116240" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2116240" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-DSC00089.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-DSC00089.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-DSC00089.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-DSC00089.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-DSC00089.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-DSC00089.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-DSC00089.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rode-Wireless-Go-II-DSC00089.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116240" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Darrell Etherington</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the best new feature might be that you get all these improvements in the same great package. Rode&#8217;s original Go was remarkable in large part because it came in such a small, portable package, with transmitters that featured built-in mics as well as being great body packs. The size here is exactly the same, and these use the same integrated clips that make them compatible with all of Rode&#8217;s existing Go accessories.</p>
<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a concept of &#8216;lapping&#8217; in racing, where you&#8217;re so far ahead of a competitor that you overtake them again. That&#8217;s basically what Rode has done with the Go II, which pads the lead for the best mobile video/field podcasting mic on the market, with smart features that address the few downsides of the original.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The robotics revolution in farming is set to continue as the autonomous crop cultivation company <a href="https://farmwise.io/">FarmWise</a> looks to add new capabilities to its autonomous farming equipment.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company is currently testing the application of fungicides and insecticides to row crops as an additional capability for its weed-killing robots, according to company chief executive Sébastien Boyer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latest advancement in robotics for the farm &#8212; a market that&#8217;s becoming increasingly crowded with the launch of new companies like <a href="https://www.futureacres.co/">Future Acres</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/future-acres-launches-with-the-arrival-of-crop-transporting-robot-carry/">which launched its support robot Carry today</a>, and Mineral, the spinout from Alphabet (Google&#8217;s parent company)<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/alphabets-latest-moonshot-is-a-field-roving-plant-inspecting-robo-buggy/"> that provides crop analysis</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SaIPRfsA6M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/alphabets-latest-moonshot-is-a-field-roving-plant-inspecting-robo-buggy/">Alphabet&#8217;s latest moonshot is a field-roving, plant-inspecting robo-buggy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alphabet&#8217;s latest moonshot is a field-roving, plant-inspecting robo-buggy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/alphabets-latest-moonshot-is-a-field-roving-plant-inspecting-robo-buggy/embed/#?secret=SaIPRfsA6M" data-secret="SaIPRfsA6M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rather than sell robots directly to farmers, FarmWise sells its robotics services to farms, and charges farms roughly $200 per acre inspected and weeded. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We show up on farmers’ fields with our own operators and our own equipment,&#8221; Boyer said.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a business model that has attracted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/farmwise-and-its-weed-pulling-agribot-harvest-14-5m-in-funding/">$24 million in outside funding</a> from firm&#8217;s including <a href="https://playground.global/portfolio">Playground Global</a> and the company is likely going to raise another round, targeted at $20 million, later this year, according to Boyer.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0D9HKeVEw0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/farmwise-and-its-weed-pulling-agribot-harvest-14-5m-in-funding/">FarmWise and its weed-pulling agribot harvest $14.5M in funding</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Boyer says the company already counts half of the largest growers in Salinas, Calif. among the company&#8217;s customers. These are farms for big consumer vegetable companies like Dole.</p>
<p>What FarmWise hopes to do is fill gaps of missing labor, according to Boyer. Along with co-founder Thomas Palomares, Boyer said he identified a need for farms to keep up with their output while dealing with a shrinking workforce. &#8220;It&#8217;s about helping farmers keep up with work while the pool of people willing to do these jobs is shrinking,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Using the robots isn&#8217;t just good for farms&#8217; bottom lines, Boyer said. It also helps reduce the amount of fertilizer and chemicals used on the farm, which is good for the environment and creates a more sustainable food chain, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was attracted by working on a large-scale sustainability problem,&#8221; Boyer said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As money floods into the electric vehicle market a number of small companies are trying to stake their claim as the go-to provider of charging infrastructure. These companies are developing proprietary ecosystems that work for their own equipment but don&#8217;t interoperate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chargelab.co/">ChargeLab</a>, which has raised $4.3 million in seed financing led by Construct Capital and Root Ventures, is looking to be the software provider providing the chargers built by everyone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find everyone in every niche and corner,&#8221; says ChargeLab chief executive Zachary Lefevre. Lefevre likens Tesla to Apple with its closed ecosystem and compares Chargepoint and Blink, two other electric vehicle charging companies to Blackberry &#8212; the once dominant smartphone maker. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do is be android,&#8221; Lefevre said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That means being the software provider for manufacturers like ABB, Schneider Electric and Siemens. &#8220;These guys are hardware makers up and down the value stack,&#8221; Lefevre said.</p>
<p>ChargeLab already has an agreement with ABB to be their default software provider as they go to market. The big industrial manufacturer is getting ready to launch their next charging product in North America.</p>
<p>As companies like REEF and Metropolis revamp garages and parking lots to service the next generation of vehicles, ChargeLab&#8217;s chief executive thinks that his software can power their EV charging services as they begin to roll that functionality out across the lots they own.</p>
<p>Lefevre got to know the electric vehicle charging market first as a reseller of everyone else&#8217;s equipment, he said. The company had raised a pre-seed round of $1.1 million from investors including Urban.us and Notation Capital and has now added to that bank account with another capital infusion from Construct Capital, the new fund led by Dayna Grayson and Rachel Holt, and Root Ventures, Lefevre said.</p>
<p>Eventually the company wants to integrate with the back end of companies like Chargepoint and Electrify America to make the charging process as efficient for everyone, according to ChargeLab&#8217;s chief executive.</p>
<p>As more service providers get into the market, Lefevre sees the opportunity set for his business expanding exponentially. &#8220;Super open platforms are not going to be building an EV charging system any more than they would be building their own hardware,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">3D model provider <a href="https://www.cgtrader.com/">CGTrader</a>, has raised $9.5M in a Series B funding led by Finnish VC fund Evli Growth Partners, alongside previous investors Karma Ventures and LVV Group. Ex-Rovio CEO Mikael Hed also invested and joins as Board Chairman. We first covered the Vilnius-based company when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/21/cgtrader-an-online-marketplace-for-3d-models-raises-185k-euro-from-practica/">raised</a> 200,000 euro from Practica Capital.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011 by 3D designer Marius Kalytis (now COO), CGTrader has become a signifiant 3D content provider &#8211; it even claims to be the world’s largest. In its marketplace are 1.1M 3D models and 3.5M 3D designers, service 370,000 businesses including Nike, Microsoft, Made.com, Crate &amp; Barrel, and Staples.</p>
<p>Unlike photos, 3D models can also be used to create both static images as well as AR experiences, so that users can see how a product might fit in their home. The company is also looking to invest in automating 3D modeling, QA, and asset management processes with AI. </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dalia Lasaite, CEO and co-founder of CGTrader said in a statement: “3D models are not only widely used in professional 3D industries, but have become a more convenient and cost-effective way of generating amazing product visuals for e-commerce as well. With our ARsenal enterprise platform, it is up to ten times cheaper to produce photorealistic 3D visuals that are indistinguishable from photographs.”</p>
<p>CGTrader now plans to consolidate its position and further develop its platform.</p>
<p>The company competes with TurboSquid (which was recently <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90597548/shutterstock-makes-a-75-million-bet-that-the-future-of-photography-doesnt-involve-cameras">acquired</a> for $75 million by Shutterstock) and Threekit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It would be an understatement to say that enterprise-focused startups have fared well during the pandemic. As organizations look to go remote, and the way we work has been flipped on its head, quickly-growing tech companies that simplify this transition are in high demand.</p>
<p>One such startup has, in fact, raised $61.5 million in the last 12 months alone. <a href="https://www.electric.ai/">Electric</a>, a company looking to put IT departments in the cloud, just announced the close of a $40 million Series C round. This comes after an extension of its Series B in March of 2020, when it raised $14.5 million, and then an additional $7 million from 01 Advisors in May of 2020.</p>
<p>This Series C round was led by Greenspring Associates, with participation from existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, GGV Capital, 01 Advisors, Primary Venture Partners as well as new investors including Atreides Management and Vintage Investment Partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Rather than bringing on a dedicated IT department, or contracting out high-priced local service providers, Electric&#8217;s software allows one admin to manage devices, software subscriptions, permissions and more.</p>
<p>According to founder Ryan Denehy, the vast majority of IT&#8217;s work is administration, distribution, and maintenance of the broad variety of software programs at any given company. Electric does most of that job on behalf of IT, meaning that a smaller business only needs to worry about desk-side troubleshooting when it comes up, rather than the whole kit and caboodle.</p>
<p>Electric charges a flat price per seat per month, and Denehy says the company more than doubled its customer base in the last year. It now supports around 25,000 users across more than 400 individual customer organizations, which puts Electric just shy of $20 million ARR.</p>
<p>This is the first time Denehy has come anywhere close to sharing revenue numbers publicly, but it&#8217;s a good time to flex. The company has recently introduced a new lighter-weight offering that includes all of the same functionality as its more expensive product, but without access to chat functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;The name of the game is just simplicity, simplicity, simplicity,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;Part of this is in response to the fact that people are realizing the permanence of hybrid work. During the pandemic, people stopped paying their landlords but they didn&#8217;t stop paying us. So in the summer, we started to focus on how we can create more offerings that we can get in the hands of more businesses and let them start their journey with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Denehy says that a little less than half of Electric&#8217;s client base are tech startups, which makes sense considering the company launched in New York in a tech and media-centric ecosystem. As a way to expand into other verticals, Electric acquired Sinu, an IT service provider who happened to have an impressive roster of clients outside of Electric&#8217;s comfort zone, such as legal, accounting and non-profit.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Denehy said at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Organic market entry, even in adjacent markets can be extremely time consuming and expensive. Sinu&#8217;s team has done an excellent job winning and pleasing customers in a lot of industries where we currently don&#8217;t play but probably should. The combination of our two companies is a massive shot in the arm to our national expansion strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alongside growth, both of the Electric team and its customer base, the company is also investing in expanding its diversity programs and philanthropic efforts.</p>
<p>The Electric team is currently made up of just under 250 full-time employees, with 32.5 percent women and around 30 percent of employees being non-white. Specifically, nearly 12 percent of employees are Black and 10 percent are Latinx.</p>
<p>Denehy explained that he thinks of the company&#8217;s payroll, which is in the tens of millions of dollars, as one of the biggest ways he can make a change in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will wait longer to fill a role to make sure that we have the most diverse pipeline of candidates possible,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;A lot of founders will say that nobody applied. Well, the reality is you didn&#8217;t look hard enough. We&#8217;ve just accepted that like it may take us longer to fill certain roles.&#8221;</p>
<p>This latest round brings Electric&#8217;s total funding to more than $100 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Flurostat and Dagan, two startups that both are tackling the monitoring and management of agricultural inputs and outputs for a better understanding of the role sustainable agriculture can play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, have merged and are launching a package of services under a new brand,<a href="https://www.regrow.ag/"> Regrow</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The merge, announced yesterday, will create a company that combines Flurostat&#8217;s data driven agriculture management services with Dagan&#8217;s soil biogeochemical modeling technology, the companies said in a joint statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combined companies will have the ability to provide satellite collected data to optimize crop management and adoption of conservation practices along with site-specific analysis and custom interventions for different crops, fields, farms, and regions. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dagan co-founder Dr. William Salas said that the combined companies will be able to have a better handle on the market for carbon emissions &#8212; thanks in no small part to Dagan&#8217;s work on soil carbon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Soil carbon sequestration is finally emerging as a globally relevant strategy for drawing down excess </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">atmospheric carbon dioxide. Shortcuts, misconceptions and over-hyping have the potential to stunt the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tremendous potential of soil carbon,” Salas said in a statement. “But the merger of FluroSat and Dagan will give the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">industry the confidence and integrity it needs with best-in-class soil health data that can prescribe site-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specific strategies and provide accuracy and transparency that will help companies succeed in carbon markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Terms of the merger were not disclosed, but FluroSat had previously raised roughly $8.6 million in equity and grant funding led by Microsoft&#8217;s M12 venture fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flurosat/company_financials">according to data from Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the next decade, we need to grow and produce enough food to nourish 10 billion people around </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the world in a way that protects our land and stems climate change,” says Ranveer Chandra, Chief </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientist, Azure Global at Microsoft. “Regrow’s computational agriculture, using machine learning and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientific modeling, will help improve the accuracy of accounting for soil carbon, and bring farmers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closer to benefitting from carbon markets.”</span></p>
