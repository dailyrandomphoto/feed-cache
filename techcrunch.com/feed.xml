	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As Facebook confronts outrage among its employees and the public for mishandling multiple decisions about its role in shaping public discourse, it is becoming clear that it cannot solve its conundrums without a major change in its business model. And a new model is readily available: for-benefit status.</p>
<p>For decades, a misguided ideology has warped companies, economies and societies: that the sole purpose of corporations is to maximize short-term returns to one set of stakeholders &#8212; those who have bought shares. Neither law nor history requires this to be true.</p>
<p>But shareholder value-maximization ideology has become cemented in far too much corporate practice at the expense of societal well-being. This is manifested in many ways: a slavish adherence to the judgment of the &#8220;market,&#8221; even when other social signals are more powerful; executives enriched by stock options; companies fearful of “activist investors” who attack whenever stock prices fail to meet quarterly “expectations” and often-frivolous shareholder lawsuits pushing for stock gains at all costs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pandemic, however, has accelerated an already-spreading recognition that shareholder value maximization is often a harmful choice &#8212; not by any means a moral imperative or even a fiduciary responsibility.</p>
<p>Major institutions of capitalism are converging on a new vision for it. The 2019 <a href="https://opportunity.businessroundtable.org/ourcommitment/">Business Roundtable CEO statement</a> said that corporate strategy should benefit <i>all</i> stakeholders – including shareholders, yes, but equally customers, employees, suppliers, and the communities in which companies operate. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s recent annual letters assert new views of how that investment company, the world’s largest, should invest the trillions it oversees.</p>
<p>Fink’s 2019 letter spelled out a <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/2019-larry-fink-ceo-letter">new vision for corporate purpose</a>; the subsequent 2020 and 2021 letters focused on business’ responsibility around climate change, particularly in light of the pandemic. The <a href="https://bcorporation.net/">B Corporation</a> and conscious capitalism movements are growing. The World Economic Forum is championing a “<a href="https://www.fourthsector.org/fsdi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fourth Sector</a>,” combining purpose with profit. Business schools, facing student rebellions against a purely profit-maximizing curriculum, are rapidly changing what they teach.</p>
<p>And with society under siege, many more businesses, including social media, are scrambling to seem like good corporate citizens. They have no choice.</p>
<p>Facebook, for example, has doubled down on philanthropy and new efforts to combat misinformation, even as usage and share price soar. Platforms like WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) have become essential services to connect people whose physical ties have been abruptly severed during the global pandemic. Shelter-in-place has become, in many ways, shelter-in-Facebook-properties.</p>
<p>But Facebook and its brethren remain fragile. Since the 2016 presidential election in the U.S., Facebook has faced governmental hearings and regulation, public uproar (#deleteFacebook), and huge fines for invading privacy and undermining democracy. These calls were amplified in the weeks following the January 6 Capitol riot. Separately, it faces allegations of bias, largely (though not entirely) from the political right. These have led to calls for the revocation or reform of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants it immunity from the actions of its users.</p>
<p>A giant company that is simultaneously essential and pilloried is vulnerable. Just ask the ghosts of John D. Rockefeller and his fellow robber barons, whose huge monopolies industrialized America more than 100 years ago. Journalistic muckrakers and public outrage targeted them for their abusive practices until the government finally broke up their companies via antitrust legislation.</p>
<p>Because Mark Zuckerberg maintains complete majority control of Facebook, he could unilaterally quell public opprobrium and fend off heavy-handed regulation singlehandedly by transforming Facebook into a new kind of business: a for-benefit corporation.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="&quot;https://benefitcorp.net/businesses?">Public Benefit Corporation</a> legal model, firms bind themselves to a public benefit mission statement and carry out required ongoing reporting on both the standard financials <i>and</i> on how the company is living up to its mission. That status protects the company against profit-demanding shareholder lawsuits, and also attracts employees and investors who want to combine profit with purpose.</p>
<p><a href="http://data.world/">Data.world</a> is one of the thousands of certified B Corporations that have seen good returns on financial metrics. <a href="https://www.allbirds.com/">Allbirds</a>, for example, launched in a few sustainable materials using a pro-sustainability process to manufacture comfortable shoes, quickly reaching revenues of $100 million and valuation of $1.7 billion in an industry fraught with sustainability and human rights concerns. Other household names that are B Corps include <a href="https://www.thebodyshop.com/en-us/">The Body Shop</a>, <a href="&quot;https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.danone.com/">Danone</a>, the <a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/">Jamie Oliver Group</a>, <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/">King Arthur Flour</a>, <a href="https://numitea.com/">Numi Tea</a> and <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/home/">Patagonia</a>.</p>
<p>Many companies that have not undergone formal B Certification from B Labs have nonetheless done well while transforming their business practices, such as the carpet and flooring company <a href="https://www.interface.com/">Interface</a>. Some firms incorporate ESG principles into their management systems – the $24 billion (market cap) Dutch life sciences company <a href="https://www.dsm.com/corporate/home.html">DSM</a> has for years had meaningful sustainability targets for its senior management that account for fully 50 percent of their annual bonuses. Both Interface and DSM attribute much of their commercial success to their attention to non-financial considerations.</p>
<p>A for-benefit Facebook could similarly relate to the world differently, avoiding many of the reputational shocks and regulatory responses that have led to huge stock dips and enormous fines. Its operations would align with Zuckerberg’s proclaimed purpose to enable the potential abundance that results from connecting everyone in the world.</p>
<p>Imagine a Facebook town hall as a true public square, not just another way to gather and sell people’s data without their explicit consent. Imagine a Facebook that put its users first and its advertisers second; that revealed where ads came from; that <i>earned</i> your attention in a way that you controlled rather than through machine-driven algorithms maximizing your attention for good or ill. Such a for-benefit Facebook could create true buy-in and transparency with its massive community around the world.</p>
<p>Of course, such steps as Facebook’s new <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcoming-the-oversight-board/">Oversight Board</a>, which may provide some meaningful review, don’t require a legal change. But if shareholders and employees continue to be rewarded primarily by the success of the problematic ad revenue model, a continuing conflict between private gain and public benefit makes it impossible to have confidence about what is happening behind the scenes. A shift to for-benefit incorporation and appropriate certification brings with it different performance metrics and accountability systems with <a href="https://bcorporation.net/directory/dataworld-inc">public scores</a>.</p>
<p>In changing Facebook into a for-benefit corporation, Zuckerberg could insulate himself against presidential rage while rehabilitating his reputation — and his company&#8217;s. It would likely create vast ripples both in Silicon Valley and beyond — and it might help transform capitalism itself.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has forced organizations across the globe to shutter the office environment, and take up a remote-first strategy. Through necessity, professionals have adapted to remote working. But the systems they use are still playing catch up.</p>
<p>One area less readily accommodating to the remote environment is the onboarding process. Given that it is the first sustained contact that a new starter has with a company,  a remote-first strategy is dependent on its success. When looking to onboard new employees, the luxuries of first-day meet and greets, in-person hardware setup, and a team lunch are no longer available. From interview to offer-letter and beyond, any new hire’s early journey is critical to their life at the company, their job satisfaction and ultimately their productivity. The remote induction must be a smooth process, and so needs a thorough rethink.</p>
<p>A cultural shift in the company may be necessary. Organizations need to embrace knowledge-sharing and collaboration, by turning to a “handbook first” approach. A few simple steps can lead them there. Companies also need to analyze their workflow. Are the right systems in place to ensure the seamless flow of both tacit and explicit knowledge?</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, artificial intelligence can help transform a clunky old onboarding process into a sophisticated, smooth journey. Naturally the best AI models to use will depend on the business, and department in question. However, with a few pointers business leaders can carve out a path to AI integration.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into the specifics that can transform the remote onboarding process, for the benefit of both the company and the new starter in question.</p>
<h2>How to handbook</h2>
<p>This is arguably the most important piece of the puzzle when it comes to ensuring newcomers are able to access the right information at the right time; it’s also the most difficult to get right. It is for workers at all levels of an organization to think about how knowledge is shared between teams, and the processes which surround that interchange of ideas.</p>
<p>What is most important is that everyone in an organization prioritizes documentation; exactly how they do it is secondary. You can spin up plenty of free and paid softwares to start creating a handbook. Anything cloud based is suitable, with more sophisticated paid options recommended to keep things easily searchable with documentation sorted into well defined hierarchies, rather than losing those nuggets of information in a sea of folders.</p>
<p>However, this systemic challenge is best addressed from top down. The process should include some checks and balances, with permissioning crucial for parts of the handbook which should remain static, like policies and SLPs. Other parts of the documentation should be kept flexible, like processes and team level knowledge. The majority of the handbook must be democratized as far as possible.</p>
<p>Gitlab, an all-remote company, first coined the term “<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614737496741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFhlfE0KHZppGd_ViK-6D4WllGrg">handbook-first</a>.” The DevOps software provider acts as a great example of a company that lives and breathes through documenting and codifying internal knowledge. Everyone within the organization buys into the mantra of documenting what they know, with subject matter experts assigned to manage knowledge base content. Keeping company documentation up to date is a collaborative task, considered paramount to the company&#8217;s livelihood. Softwares give a helping hand, nudging contributors to keep information up to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yusaku Maezawa, the first paying passenger to book a trip aboard SpaceX&#8217;s (still in development) Starship spacecraft around the Moon, has provided a promised update about his mission. It&#8217;s still aiming for 2023 for a flight date, and the plan is still to fly a week-long trip around the Moon and back. Now, however, Maezawa is <a href="https://dearmoon.earth">looking for crewmates</a>. The full passenger list will include 10 to 12 crew members, Maezawa said in a video about the announcement, but eight will be selected rom the general public.</p>
<p>Back when the mission was first announced in 2018, Maezawa said that he wan†´d to bring between six and eight artists with him as co-astronauts, in order to inspire them to create art based on the experience. That approach has changed somewhat, since he says that he realized anyone who expresses any kind of creativity could be considered an artist. There&#8217;s now two criteria for the selection: First, that you can excel at what you do by going to space, and second, that you can support the rest of the crew on the trip.</p>
<p>Maezawa, a billionaire, serial entrepreneur and an artist himself, has paid for the entire trip himself, including the eight passenger seats that he announced today he&#8217;d be giving away for free.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_L3wLmrMuA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Maezawa also detailed the process for selecting the crew members in a new site. It includes pre-registration, which closes on March 14, and then moves into a screening process that ends on March 21. There&#8217;s an assignment of some kind that applicants need to complete by March 21, and then there&#8217;s an online interview component, followed by final interviews and medical screening to take place late in May.</p>
<p>All of the above timeline is subject to change, according to the application microsite. But once the team is selected, 2022 and 2023 will be focused on training in preparation for the flight. There&#8217;s also now a rough flight plan for the mission, which you can see in the graphic below. It&#8217;s not too detailed, but does include timestamps and a visual that shows the intended course will indeed loop around the Moon and then return.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2120024" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2120024" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2120024" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png" alt="" width="1024" height="664" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png 2460w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=768,498 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=1536,997 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=2048,1329 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2120024" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> dearMoon</p></div></p>
<p>One thing that&#8217;s notably absent from this call for passenger applications is the ill-advised and definitely creepy call for applicants to be Maezawa&#8217;s &#8216;life partner.&#8217; He made the ask in 2020, seeking single women older than 20 to apply to a &#8216;match-making&#8217; from which he would choose one romantic potential to join him on the trip, and star in a documentary about the process. Maezawa <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51306366">reversed course on that tactic</a> before the end of the month in which he announced the scheme.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the only trip to space with an open application process aiming to give away free seats, oddly enough. There&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/second-crew-member-of-first-all-civilian-spacex-mission-revealed/">Inspiration4, an orbital mission that will use SpaceX&#8217;s Dragon</a> (which is already certified for human flight) and which aims to take off as early as late 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital collectibles are having a very large moment. Just last month, a piece of digital art by Beeple sold for $6.6 million on online art marketplace <a href="https://niftygateway.com/">Nifty Gateway.</a> Meanwhile, Linkin Park&#8217;s Mike Shinoda recently sold clips of a song <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/linkin-park-mike-shinoda-happy-endings-nft-interview">via online marketplace Zora</a>. Over on Dapper Labs&#8217; NBA Top Shot, more than 200,000 people recently waited hours for the chance to buy one of just 10,631 packs of digital NBA moments.</p>
<p>Those marketplaces, along with others, are where people go to buy digital assets, or, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that live on the blockchain. This whole world of NFTs is super new to me (I&#8217;ve only been using Top Shot for a couple of weeks now) so I caught up with a couple of NFT creators to break it down for me, as well as share some insights on where they think the space is going, and it&#8217;s overall potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I like to explain NFTs, they are digital assets with true ownership and provenance,&#8221; <a href="https://makersplace.com/richardrivera/">Ronin the Collector </a>told TechCrunch. &#8220;You can track their origin and they can only be owned by one person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many people, myself included, at some point wonder why someone would pay for a short video clip of, for example, <a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/moment/mrd+ee07ddae-7658-4c39-93ca-b01643e0e814?">Stephen Curry making a three-pointer</a> when you download it to your computer for free.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humans inherently, whether we will like to admit it or not, want to own things,&#8221; Ronin said. &#8220;And I think that that&#8217;s part of the human experience is owning things. When you own things, it&#8217;s a connection, and it&#8217;s like you have reason for being and there&#8217;s something unique about ownership. And I think that at the end of the day, yeah, you can you can watch it all you want. But can you sell it?&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; Big Italy (@BigItaly42) <a href="https://twitter.com/BigItaly42/status/1365357499105357831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>With that clip as an NFT, you can. As an example, one user bought a LeBron James dunk for $208,000 a couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://cryptoslam.io/nba-top-shot/sales">according to CryptoSlam</a>. <a href="https://blog.nbatopshot.com/posts/state-of-nba-topshot?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=stateofnbatopshot_blog">Last month</a>, Top Shot reached nearly $50 million in marketplace transactions. Then, over a 24-hour period last week, Top Shot saw more than $37 million in sales, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/nba-top-shot">according to Cryptoslam</a>.</p>
<p>As to why they&#8217;re blowing up right now, Ronin attributes it to a couple of things: the pandemic that&#8217;s forced everyone behind a computer screen and an easy entry point. Top Shot, for example, makes it super easy for plebeians like me to sign up and you don&#8217;t need to have a crypto wallet. You can just use your credit card. The same goes for Nifty Gateway.</p>
<p>But Top Shot and Nifty are outliers, Ronin said. For the majority of NFT platforms, you need to have an Ethereum wallet. As Cooper Turley, crypto strategy lead at Audius, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start/">wrote on TC</a>, &#8220;this means collectors need to purchase ETH from an exchange like Coinbase and send it to a non-custodial address that consists of a long string of numbers and letters to get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>That sounds like a whole thing that I, for one, am not ready to dive into. In general, barriers to access continue to be a problem in the NFTs space, Ronin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Projects are just now starting to pay attention to the user experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And just barely in time. One of the best rooms I&#8217;ve been on Clubhouse was one that talked about how basically, with the whole world watching, how do we not mess this up. So I think when you have a product like Top Shot, which is easy to get into, easy to sign up for, and easy to purchase. You have to use a credit card, you don&#8217;t need crypto and throw in the mix that everyone&#8217;s online and then <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/arts/design/christies-beeple-auction-blockchain-art.html">Beeple sells $3 million worth of digital art</a>, and all of a sudden, people want to pay attention. So I think that was the catalyst.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>But an even more expansive and interesting arena for NFTs than Top Shot is the world of NFT art. <a href="https://twitter.com/sirsuhayb">Ameer Carter</a>, <a href="https://iamsirsu.com/cryptomedia">an artist</a> that is also known as Sirsu, got into NFTs last summer thanks to a friend, he told TechCrunch. Pretty much immediately, he said, he realized the transformative nature of the technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We literally have creative immortality,&#8221; he told me he realized at the time.</p>
<p>But the art world has historically been inhospitable to Black folks and people of color, and especially in the world of NFTs, Carter said. The traditional art scene, Carter said, is elitist. And while Carter himself is a classically trained artist, he hasn&#8217;t been able to make his way into the traditional art world, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not because of lack of trying,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Carter said he&#8217;s had a number of conversations with art curators who all love his work, but they&#8217;ve told him it&#8217;s not &#8220;something that they could build a whole curriculum around and intellectualize,&#8221; he said. What NFTs do is enable artists like Carter to create and share their art in a way that hadn&#8217;t previously been afforded to them.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;And this is a much more open and accessible platform, and environment for them to do so,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And so my goal is to help really give them that type of visibility and empower them to be creatives. My mission is to remove the starving artists stigma. I don&#8217;t believe that creativity is cheap. I believe that it is rich. And it enriches and it gives us the reasons why we live in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Carter said he&#8217;s begun to notice white folks taking credit for things Black artists have already done.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this push and pull between folks who are really about the provenance of the blockchain versus folks who are wanting to predispose themselves as first because they have more visibility,&#8221; Carter said.</p>
<p>He pointed to Black artists like <a href="https://danky.art/portfolio">Connie Digital</a>, <a href="https://app.rarible.com/harrisonfirst">Harrison First</a> and others who were some of the first people to institute social tokens for their fans on the blockchain.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were some of the first to deploy and sell albums as NFTs, EPs as NFTs, singular songs,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And now we have <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/17/2177446/0/en/Acclaimed-Musician-3LAU-Launches-First-NFT-Album-on-Origin-s-Dshop.html">Blau</a> that came out and people were saying he&#8217;s the first to sell an album. And it&#8217;s like, well, that&#8217;s not true, technically. But what works and has continued to work is because there&#8217;s a lot of hoopla and a lot of money around that sale, that becomes the formative thing as being first because it&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s made the most noise. And I find it interesting because of the fact that we can literally go back tangibly, and there&#8217;s verifiable hash proof that it wasn&#8217;t the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are the types of phenomena pushing Carter to become an NFT archivist of sorts, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not necessarily a historian, but I think the more and more I get involved in this space, the more and more I feel that pressing role of being an archivist,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So that culturally, we aren&#8217;t erased, even in a space that&#8217;s supposed to be decentralized and supposed to be something that works for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s partly why Carter is building The Well to archive the work of Black artists, like <a href="https://linktr.ee/blacksneakers">Blacksneakers</a>, for example. The Well will also be a platform for Black artists to mint their NFTs in a place that feels safe, supportive and not exploitative, he said.</p>

<p>On current platforms, Carter said it feels like white artists generally get more promotions on the site, as well as on social media, than Black artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;They deserve to have that kind of artists&#8217; growth and development,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;Yet it is afforded to a lot of other artists that don&#8217;t look like them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carter said he recognizes it&#8217;s not the responsibility of platforms like Nifty Gateway, SuperRare and others to provide opportunities to Black artists, but that they do have the ability to put Black artists in a better position to receive opportunities.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s partly what Carter hopes to achieve with <a href="https://ownthewell.com/">The Well Protocol.</a> The Well, which Carter plans to launch on Juneteenth, aims to create an inclusive platform and ecosystem for NFT artists, collectors and curators. Carter said he wants artists to not have to feel like they have to constantly leverage Twitter to showcase their work. Instead, they&#8217;ll have the full backing of an ecosystem pumping up their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everywhere else, you look at other artists and they have write-ups, and they have news coverage and things of that nature,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And [Black artists] don&#8217;t have a lot of those avenues to compete. You know, I&#8217;m in the business of building true equity for us, so part and parcel to that is developing the tools and the ecosystem for us to thrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>No longer should art just be for the rich, Carter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the ability to completely dismantle that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we have to be very, very, very careful about that and make a concerted effort to make that thing work, but we can&#8217;t do it when we have folks entering the space with money erasing folks who were already here. We can&#8217;t have that where platforms are not allowing the positioning of artists to grow. You know, we can&#8217;t have that when we have folks by and large, fear mongering and trying to get other artists to not be a part of this system.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important, he said, for NFTs to not solely be seen as collectible, investable objects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s getting into the game like it&#8217;s a money grab,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s playing with artists lives and careers here.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p>For those who aren&#8217;t yet in on NFTs, there&#8217;s still time, Ronin said. Even with the increased attention on NFTs, Ronin says it&#8217;s still early days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t even think we&#8217;ve got a full foot into early adoption yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you come out of early adoption until we&#8217;ve got a solid experience across the board. I think we&#8217;re still in alpha.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s partly because Ronin believes the things people will be able to do in five or ten years with this technology will pale in comparison to what&#8217;s happening today. For example, Ronin said he spoke with an artist who is experimenting with an NFT experience that will transcend VR, AR and XR.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m so excited that she chose to work with me and bring me in on this, and use me as kind of an advisor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And she can change the world with this technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s really what&#8217;s so exciting about NFTs for Ronin &#8212; the notion that the technology can change your life, and the world, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it is a space in which you should feel free to come into and dream big and then figure out how to make those dreams happen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can use AR, VR, mobile, you know, the internet &#8212; you can use all these aspects and create an NFT experience that transcends space, transcends time, transcends our life. So it&#8217;s a super powerful technology. And I think that people should really pay attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Down the road, Ronin also envisions having connected blockchains &#8220;where you can take an NFT from, you know, Bitcoin to Ethereum to <a href="https://on.wax.io/wax-io/">WAX</a> to <a href="https://www.onflow.org/">Flow,</a>&#8221; he said. &#8220;I really think that it&#8217;s why this this is that important.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Carter, he hopes his work at The Well will help to set a precedent for inclusivity and access in the NFT space. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that Carter is also working on the <a href="https://mint.af/">Mint Fund</a> to help minimize the barriers to entry for artists looking to mint their first NFTs. Minting an NFT can be expensive to the tune of $50-$250 depending on how busy the Ethereum network is, and Mint Fund will pay those fees for new artists, making the on-ramp into the world smoother.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t do this the right way with the right type of community-driven thinking, then we will lose,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not going to look good, it&#8217;s going to be ugly. And it&#8217;s going to again perpetuate the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer&#8230;We have to find the best ways to redistribute wealth at any given point in time within this economy, within this system. If we do not know how to do that, we are fucked. At least in my opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are also conversations in the space around the <a href="https://www.loop-news.com/p/the-big-problem-with-nfts-energy">ecological impact of minting NFTs</a>, which requires a good amount of energy to do. Carter described the existence of two camps: the camp arguing minting NFTs are very ecologically damaging and the ones saying it&#8217;s not the fault of minters and you can&#8217;t blame them &#8220;for minting on a system that is already going to process these transactions, whether they mint or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Carter, he thinks the first camp could be right, but says there&#8217;s just a lot of yelling at this point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that collectively, us as minters should not feel so fucked up that we can&#8217;t do anything anymore,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Carter also pointed to the energy required to print and ship a bunch of his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;To sell one piece of art that I&#8217;ve minted versus the energy expenditure and the emissions it takes for me to sell, let&#8217;s say 1,000 prints at $20,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To now shop those to 1,000 different places and for those things to then be transported to 1,000 different homes. Like, maybe they&#8217;re comparable, maybe they&#8217;re not. I&#8217;m not too interested in doing the math at this point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, Carter thinks there needs to be better access to renewable energy sources and more innovative hardware in the space.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the production of creating that innovative hardware also has to be coming from renewable energy sources, like the entire framework should be working to be carbon negative,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As carbon neutral to carbon negative as possible. And not just the minting side but the mining side. And, you know, the manufacturing side. It&#8217;s a cyclical issue.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s not yet fire season thankfully, which affords some breathing room for firefighters and emergency responders to begin planning out how to confront the increasingly complex and unwieldy task of preventing and responding to fires in the American West. Wildfires in the region have been particularly acute in recent years in states like California, mostly due to hotter conditions driven by climate change, decaying grid infrastructure that can lead to sparks, and a tinderbox of trees and foliage ripe for conflagration.</p>
<p>After years of bruising firefighting, some startups are exploring how to improve fire response. One of them is <a href="https://cornea.is">Cornea</a>, a sort of spin-up by public sector-focused venture studio <a href="https://www.hangar.is/">Hangar</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/hangar-raises-15-million-for-its-venture-studio-for-government-technology-startups/">which raised $15 million last year</a> to build new startups targeting the government.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hangar raises $15 million for its venture studio for government technology startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/hangar-raises-15-million-for-its-venture-studio-for-government-technology-startups/embed/#?secret=0D5r5StFqE" data-secret="0D5r5StFqE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One of Hangar’s first companies was Cornea back a couple of years ago, and it remains one of the most interesting for its potential. The idea is to meld geographical, weather and historical fire data into a machine learning model that can augment frontline firefighters with better guidance on where to push forward and when to retreat in the midst of a blaze.</p>
<p>The startup has two main products it is looking to launch this year. The first is focused around delivering better situational awareness around a subject known among firefighters as the “Suppression Difficulty Index.” These are essentially maps that inform firefighters of the dangers of fighting fire in a very specific geographical location. For instance, a particular location could have wind or water conditions that might accelerate a fire and endanger responders if they are not careful.</p>
<p>The other product is focused on “Potential Control Lines” — locations where a fire break or other action could potentially push back a fire. Using typography, vegetation and a myriad of other data, Cornea can locate positions with a higher likelihood of success in battling a fire.</p>
<p>Cornea’s Chief Fire Officer is Tom Harbour, who formerly served a decade as head of fire response for the U.S. Forest Service. He said that “50 years ago, I was raised in a culture where you never knew ‘why’ — you just obeyed orders” when it came to firefighting decisions out in the field. “Your head was on the proverbial swivel.” With Cornea and the products the company is creating, we are “Getting aligned on the ‘why’ and beginning to have [firefighters] sense the information that they are looking at.”</p>
<p>Harbour noted that the most common tools in the field today remain paper maps and markers, simply because “you know it doesn’t break right at the time when you can’t have things break.” Cornea’s products may help firefighters in the field, but they are far more likely to have an impact in the fire operations centers where strategic decisions get made about where to invest firefighting resources.</p>
<p>Josh Mendelsohn, the founder and managing partner of Hangar, said that the company is straight down the center of the studio’s investment thesis. “Cornea is focused on taking these large datasets, processing them effectively … and then giving [firefighters] as much analytical impact in an output as simple as possible,” he said, noting that “it turns out that in this market the best user experience is a PDF.”</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the major challenges for building in this market is simply the unique dynamic of disaster response compared to, say, enterprise SaaS. “Cornea has had to go through a customer-discovery process,” Mendelsohn said. “It all feels necessary, but what are the right things that require the least amount of behavior change to have impact immediately?” One challenge particularly around firefighting is simply the feedback loop from the field to the team. “Fire is seasonal so we have had to be a bit incremental,” Mendelsohn said.</p>
<p>The team is currently three full-time people plus consultants with Hangar augmenting them with its own studio staff. The company built out its product partially using federal research grants to deepen the science of firefighting, and this year, hopes to work with the Forest Service and state firefighting agencies to get its models out to the frontlines. “There is a human bandwidth problem,” Mendelsohn said. “How do you take limited resources to help [firefighters] go further by using them effectively?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In another key moment for the growing tech labor movement, Glitch employees today announced that they have signed a collective bargaining agreement with the company. The move comes a year after the site’s workforce voted to join the Communications Workers of America Local 1101.</p>
<p>“We’re excited that Glitch workers have signed their first-ever contract, a milestone in this industry,” CWA Local 1101 President Keith Purce said in a release tied to the announcement. “CWA has decades of experience helping workers improve conditions at some of this country’s largest, most powerful corporations. We know we’re stronger when we fight together, and we hope this victory inspires other software engineers to organize their workplaces.”</p>
<p>Glitch says the agreement has been in the works for around five months before being, “ratified overwhelmingly” by employees. The union calls the move, “the first collective bargaining agreement signed by software engineers in the tech industry,” citing industry moves designed from preventing labor movements from solidifying in tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In spite of this, however, the movement has been growing, particularly over the past year, among blue-collar and white-collar workers alike. Recent examples include Kickstarter and the Alphabet Workers Union.</p>

<p>Attempts to unionize among Amazon warehouse employees have been decidedly more rocky, as the company has purchased advertising and sent mailers attempting to dissuade workers. Still, the pro-union wing has seemingly found an ally in Joe Biden, who recently commented, “The choice to join a union is up to the workers, full stop.”</p>
<p>In May, Glitch laid off 18 &#8212; amounting to around a third of the staff. CEO Anil Dash noted at the time, “we are a small company in a fiercely competitive space in a tough economy. But these good people have done immensely valuable work that our entire team and community are grateful for.”</p>
<p>The agreement, which holds for 11 months, focuses &#8212; in part &#8212; on the rights of those impacted workers, detailing severance and rehiring those former employees if their former positions are re-instated.</p>
<p>“This is an absolutely historic win for us,” said software engineer Katie Lundsgaard. “We love our jobs, we love working at Glitch, which is why we wanted to ensure we have a lasting voice at this company and lasting protections. This contract does that, and I hope tech workers across the industry can see that unions and startups are not incompatible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Organizers add:</p>
<blockquote><p>The contract also does not focus on wages and benefits, which are already generous at Glitch, opting instead to ensure basic union protections for workers and a continued voice in the workplace.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate tech startup Doma, formerly known as </span><a href="https://www.statestitle.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">States Title</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced Tuesday it will go public through a merger with SPAC </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitol Investment Corp. V</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a deal valued at $3 billion, including debt.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/go-spac-yourself/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPACs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, often called blank-check companies, are increasingly common. They exist as publicly traded entities in search of a private company to combine with, taking the private entity public without the hassle of an IPO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it floats later this year, Doma will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DOMA. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transaction is expected to provide up to $645 million in cash proceeds, including a fully committed PIPE of $300 million and up to $345 million of cash held in the trust account of Capitol Investment Corp. V. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Max Simkoff founded San Francisco-based Doma in September 2016 with the aim of creating </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a technology-driven solution for “closing mortgages instantly.” While it initially was founded to instantly underwrite title insurance, the company has expanded that same approach to handle “every aspect” of closing and escrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doma has developed patented machine learning technology that it says reduces title processing time from five days to “as little as one minute” and cuts down the entire mortgage closing process “from a 50+ day ordeal to less than a week.” The startup has facilitated over 800,000 real estate closings for lenders such as Chase, Homepoint, Sierra Pacific Mortgage and others.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name change is designed to more accurately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reflect its intention to expand &#8220;well beyond&#8221; title into areas such as appraisals and home warranties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its goal with going public is to be able to “continue to invest in growth, market expansion and new products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anchoring the PIPE include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, SB Management (a subsidiary of SoftBank Group), Gores, Hedosophia, and Wells Capital. Existing Doma shareholder Lennar has also committed to the PIPE and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder and former CEO of Zillow Group, has committed a personal investment to the PIPE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to approximately $510 million of cash proceeds are expected to be retained by Doma, and existing Doma shareholders will own no less than approximately 80 percent of the equity of the new combined company, subject to redemptions by the public stockholders of Capitol and payment of transaction expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mid-February, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doma announced it had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/heres-why-these-startups-chose-to-raise-debt-instead-of-equity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed on $150 million in debt financing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from</span><a href="https://hudsonstructured.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HSCM Bermuda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which had previously invested in the company. And last May, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced a massive </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/states-title-closes-on-123m-series-c-for-faster-mortgage-closings/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$123 million Series C round of funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a valuation of $623 million.</span></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The company posted modest growth from 2019 to 2020, seeing its GAAP revenues rise from $358.1 million to $409.8 million. After removing premiums paid to agents, its revenues (&#8220;retained premiums and fees&#8221;) decreased to $179.8 million in 2019 and $189.7 million in 2020. (For this section we&#8217;re leaning on the reported 2020 numbers that are caveated with an &#8220;estimated&#8221; tag. As it is March, we expect the final 2020 numbers to come in close enough to what was reported as to make us comfortable citing them.)</p>
<p>In 2021 the company also anticipates modest growth, with GAAP revenues estimated at $416.4 million, and its retained revenue figure landing at $226.4 million. More expansive growth is anticipated and sketched out for 2022 and 2023, though as those figures are far in the future we can discount them for now.</p>
<p>Doma also expects its economics to worsen in 2021, with its adjusted gross profit as a percentage of its retained premiums and fees falling from 48.3% last year to 39.5% this year. Of course we&#8217;re so far off the GAAP ranch with that metric as to be lost, but it&#8217;s worth noting what the company is telling the street about its impending financial performance.</p>
<p>Other metrics are also pointed in a negative direction, with Doma expecting its adjusted EBITDA to fall from -$19.0 million to -$66.6 million in 2021. The company does predict a rosy 2023 adjusted EBITDA number, for whatever stock you want to put in that.</p>
<p>Without discounting costs, Doma&#8217;s 2020 net loss of $35.1 million is expected to expand to $103.1 million this year. Still, as with many entities pursuing a public debut via a SPAC, Doma is debuting while it is still sorting out elements of its business as the pandemic starts to diminish in light of increasingly readily available vaccines. It certainly has high hopes for its future.</p>
<h2>The SPAC parade</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doma joins the growing number of proptech companies going the public route. On Monday, </span><a href="https://www.compass.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the real-estate brokerage startup backed by </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/compassinc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roughly $1.6 billion in venture funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/compass-files-for-ipo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed its S-1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Social Capital Hedosophia II, the blank-check company associated with investor </span><a href="https://twitter.com/chamath"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chamath Palihapitiya</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, announced that it would merge with Opendoor, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/opendoor-to-go-public-by-way-of-chamath-palihapitiya-spac/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking the private real estate startup public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porch.com also went public in</span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/porch-com-makes-nasdaq-debut-eyes-acquisitions/"> a SPAC deal</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December. And, SoftBank-backed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">View</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Silicon Valley-based smart window company, will complete a </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://t.yesware.com/tt/eafaef2c0b34a0fcbb08aecab07d7140c092215b/343a34c0dd51cd0f4de565f00a976650/bc6202efda86f0c0ff1a7637ca3af9b9/www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/view-the-leader-in-smart-windows-to-merge-with-cf-finance-acquisition-corp-ii-301181897.html">recent SPAC merger</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be publicly listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange on March 9.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluid Truck has built an app-based platform that aims to take away the pain and cost of owning or leasing commercial vehicles, all </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while grabbing market share from established companies like Penske, Ryder and U-Haul. </span></p>
<p>Now, it has the capital to help it get there. The Denver-based company said Tuesday it raised <span style="font-weight: 400;">$63 million in a Series A funding round to expand its truck-sharing platform, which helps mid-mile and last-mile delivery companies remotely manage an on-demand rental fleet via web or mobile app. Private equity firm Bison Capital led the round, with participation from Ingka Investments (part of Ingka Group, the main Ikea retailer), Sumitomo Corporation of Americas and Fluid Vehicle Owners.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment, its first external round, comes after rapid growth at the four-year-old company. Founder and CEO James Eberhard told TechCrunch that revenue increased 100x in the last two years. That type of growth sounds promising, but the company did not provide a baseline, so it’s hard to judge scale. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With e-commerce expected to continue to rise at a global 9.5% compound annual growth rate from 2020 to 2025, the demand for accessible trucks for hire might see correlative growth. It&#8217;s no surprise that e-commerce is one of the industries Fluid Truck has targeted. </span></p>

<p>Fluid Truck, which operates in 25 U.S. markets, operates like the car-sharing company Zipcar, with a commercial bent. B<span style="font-weight: 400;">usinesses such as moving and e-commerce delivery companies can use the platform to rent trucks. Fluid Truck&#8217;s pitch to businesses extends beyond the &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to buy or lease&#8221; argument. The platform also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows delivery companies to dispense with having a manager on staff who would manage, maintain and eventually sell the fleet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses eager to outsource the purchasing and managing of their trucks can find fleets for hire in industrial parks and retail areas within Fluid’s service network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can hop on our platform, rent a truck and be in it in a matter of minutes, which really allows businesses to scale up and scale down,” said Eberhard. “We’re watching our user behavior go from a place where they used to own every vehicle they needed at a time to a place where they’re now grabbing spare capacity off Fluid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eberhard hopes to see that type of supplementary use morph into an end state where companies don’t own a single truck and run solely on Fluid Truck’s platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluid Truck argues that its tech stack, which is designed to smooth out the booking and renting process, gives it a competitive edge in a market dominated by the likes of U-Haul, Ryder and or other small depots. Eberhard said the process of going to a depot and waiting in line is slow and sloppy, whereas Fluid Truck’s app makes renting a van as easy as calling an Uber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We take all those complexities away and allow people to have a virtual fleet,” Eberhard told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluid Truck’s fleet is made up of thousands — and soon to be tens of thousands — of cargo vans, pickup trucks, large box trucks and various other vehicles. The company also claims to have the largest medium-duty EV rental fleet in the United States, which it continues to expand as it works with OEMs to increase fleet capacity. Electric vehicles still make up less than 1% of its total portfolio due </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to the slower adoption of EVs on the commercial side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eberhard wants Fluid to be a dominant force in the trucking industry. But Fluid Truck is not the only truck sharing app on the streets. Competitors GoShare and Bungii have similar offerings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sizable round could provide an advantage as it tries to become the household name in digital truck sharing. Perhaps, as importantly, the company has the attention and investment of Ikea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is another step in enabling Ikea retail to provide last mile delivery services to our customers, continue to improve on our customer promise, while also reducing our environmental footprint,&#8221; Krister Mattsson, managing director of Ingka Investments said in a statement, a comment that suggests a future partnership with Fluid Truck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this latest capital round, Fluid’s goal is to (you guessed it) scale outwards, with a focus on expanding the team, adding dozens more markets in the U.S. and preparing to take Fluid into the EU and Canada. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluid Truck will also be investing back into its own tech stack, which includes an internal proprietary telematics platform to predict and automate servicing and maintenance of the company’s fleet. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1366767412117458946">announced</a> today it&#8217;s opening up its live audio chat rooms, known as Twitter Spaces, to users on Android. Previously, the experience was only open to select users on iOS following the product&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">private beta launch</a> in late December 2020. The company says that Android users will only be able to join and talk in Spaces for the time being, but won&#8217;t yet be able to start their own.</p>
<p>That added functionality is expected to ship &#8220;soon,&#8221; Twitter says, without offering an exact timeframe.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company has been working quickly to iterate on Twitter Spaces in the months since its beta debut, and has been fairly transparent about its roadmap.</p>
<p>Last month, the team developing Twitter Spaces hosted a Space where users were invited to offer feedback, ask questions, and learn about what Twitter had in the works for the product in both the near-term and further down the road. During this live chat, Twitter confirmed that Spaces would arrive on Android in March.</p>
<p>It also <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1365114929565597705">promised a fix to how it displays listeners</a>, which has since rolled out.</p>
<p>Other Spaces features are being shared in public as they&#8217;re designed and prototyped, including things like <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagpatterson/status/1364647741641527296">titles and descriptions</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagpatterson/status/1365443249389793282">scheduling options</a>, support for <a href="https://twitter.com/c_at_work/status/1365431726550343680">co-hosts and moderators</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagpatterson/status/1365836725751148545">guest lists</a>, and more. Twitter has also <a href="https://twitter.com/spideymang/status/1366843063004446720">updated</a> the preview card that appears in the timeline and <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1362892762719395840">relabeled</a> its &#8220;captions&#8221; feature to be more accurate, from an accessibility standpoint.</p>
<p>The time frame of some of its new developments  &#8212; like Android and scheduling options &#8212; were being promised in a matter of weeks, not months.</p>
<p>This fast pace has now led Twitter to beat its rival Clubhouse &#8212; the app currently leading the &#8220;social audio&#8221; market &#8212; to offer support for Android. Today, Clubhouse remains iOS-only in addition to being invite-only.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also indicative of the resources Twitter is putting into this new product, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">first announced publicly</a> just in November. Clearly, Twitter believes social audio is a market it needs to win.</p>
<p>The company also sees the broader potential for Spaces as being a key part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/this-week-in-apps-twitter-targets-creators-clubhouse-security-spotifys-plans-for-paid-podcasts/">a larger creator platform</a> now in the works. During its Investor Day last week, Twitter spoke of tying together its new products like Spaces, Newsletters along with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">&#8220;Super Follow&#8221; paid subscription</a>, for example.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1366723485557473283">also testing a Twitter &#8220;Shopping Card&#8221;</a> that would allow users to tweets posts that link directly to product pages via a &#8220;Shop&#8221; button &#8212; a feature that would seem to fall under this new creator focus, as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpineZone is a startup that creates personalized exercise programs and treatment for neck and back pain. The company uses an online platform and in-person clinics to deliver a curriculum that, ideally, helps patients avoid the need for prescription drugs, injections and surgeries, and providers then avoid the cost of all of the above. Co-founded by brothers Kian Raiszadeh and Kamshad Raiszadeh, the company tells TechCrunch that it has raised $12 million in a Series A round led by Polaris Partners and Providence Ventures, with participation from Martin Ventures.</p>
<p>At its core, SpineZone is a virtual physical therapy platform augmented by in-person clinics. The latter bit is important because it takes a video repository, which has health outcomes baked into it, and helps get those same users some real-life support.</p>
<p>Patients can log onto the site, either through smartphone or laptop, and then answer a series of questions around pain and risk factors. Then, patients can go through a series of exercises. These exercises are created in tandem with professionals, and are based on peer-reviewed and evidence-based articles on musculoskeletal health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beyond this digital archive of videos, SpineZone offers an in-person clinic option to help patients practice these exercises. Off of this strategy, the startup claims that it has “1 million lives under management.”</p>
<p>SpineZone’s value proposition is that it helps payers and providers, whether that be employers, clinics or health plans such as Cigna or Aetna, avoid placing their patients in surgeries, which are expensive. By taking care of pain issues before they bubble up, SpineZone says that its current partners have been able to have a 50% reduction in surgery rate (it’s worth noting that COVID-19 could also play a role in this because it is high-risk to enter a medical facility).</p>
<p>Partners are happy because footing the bill of a non-operative procedure is remarkably cheaper than a non-operative procedure.</p>
<p>The cost saving that a medical center could endure can be in the millions. For example, the Sharp Community Medical Group saved $3.4 million in cost savings after working with SpineZone for two years.</p>
<p>SpineZone’s business model is a smidge more complicated than your classic SaaS fee. For example, it charges a clinic based on the number of members it serves per month, and also shares in the downside. For example, if SpineZone promises to get a clinic to $12 million in spend from $15 million, and the cost ends up being $17 million, the company will pay the clinic a portion of the difference. Alternatively, if SpineZone got the clinic to $10 million, even below estimates, it shares in the upside.</p>
<p>SpineZone joins a cohort of health tech startups that focus on musculoskeletal conditions. Venture-backed competitors include Peerwell, Force Therapeutics and Hinge Health, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">was most recently valued at $3 billion, with plans to go public.</a></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ECjZ5wHyTY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">Sources: Hinge Health has raised $300M Series D at a $3B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sources: Hinge Health has raised $300M Series D at a $3B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/embed/#?secret=ECjZ5wHyTY" data-secret="ECjZ5wHyTY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In order to win, many startups, SpineZone including, need value-based care to replace fee-for-service care. Value-based care is the idea that doctors are paid for outcomes instead of the number of times you enter a doctor’s office. The end goal is that this format creates monetary incentives around getting to an outcome faster: If a doctor is going to make $30,000 on fixing a knee, regardless of whether it takes two appointments or 20 appointments, they might as well do a more thorough job upon check-up instead of elongating the process. The flipside of this, of course, is that doctors might optimize for outcome volume and speed rather than the quality of the result itself.</p>
<p>While SpineZone’s early traction is promising, the healthcare ecosystem still has a ways to go before value-based models take precedence. Right now, Kian Raiszadeh estimates that 10 to 20% of revenue in a medical center comes from value-based care. SpineZone is projecting that it will get to 50% of revenue in the near future.</p>
<p>“And that’s the biggest evolution and tallest lift that we’re expecting,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft is warning customers that a new China state-sponsored threat actor is exploiting four previously undisclosed security flaws in Exchange Server, an enterprise email product built by the software giant.</p>
<p>The technology company said Tuesday that it believes the hacking group, which it calls Hafnium, tries to steal information from a broad range of U.S.-based organizations, including law firms and defense contractors, but also infectious disease researchers and policy think tanks.</p>
<p>Microsoft said Hafnium used the four newly discovered security vulnerabilities to break into Exchange email servers running on company networks, granting the attackers to steal data from a victim&#8217;s organization — such as email accounts and address books — and the ability to plant malware. When used together, the four vulnerabilities create an attack chain that can compromise vulnerable on-premise servers running Exchange 2013 and later.</p>
<p>Hafnium operates out of China, but uses servers located in the U.S. to launch its attacks, the company said. Microsoft said that Hafnium was the primary threat group it detected using these four new vulnerabilities. <em>(An earlier version of Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/">blog post</a> incorrectly said Hafnium was the &#8220;only&#8221; group to exploit the vulnerabilities.)</em></p>
<p>Microsoft declined to say how many successful attacks it had seen, but described the number as &#8220;limited.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patches to fix those four security vulnerabilities are now out, a week earlier than the company&#8217;s typical patching schedule, usually reserved for the second Tuesday in each month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though we’ve worked quickly to deploy an update for the Hafnium exploits, we know that many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any unpatched systems,&#8221; said Tom Burt, Microsoft’s vice president for customer security.</p>
<p>The company said it has also briefed U.S. government agencies on its findings, but that the Hafnium attacks are not related to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">the SolarWinds-related espionage campaign</a> against U.S. federal agencies. In the last days of the Trump administration, the National Security Agency and the FBI said that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">the SolarWinds campaign</a> was &#8220;likely Russian in origin.&#8221;</p>

		Aytekin Tank is the founder of <a href="https://www.jotform.com/">JotForm</a>, an online form builder. Established in 2006, JotForm allows customizable data collection for enhanced lead generation, survey distribution, payment collections and more.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the past decade, venture capital has become synonymous with entrepreneurship. Founders from around the world arrive in Silicon Valley with visions of record-setting A rounds and billion-dollar valuations. But what if you don’t have unicorn dreams – or you don’t want to pursue VC money?</p>
<p>Bootstrapping a SaaS company is not only possible – I believe it’s a saner, more sustainable way to build and scale a business. To be clear, bootstrapping isn’t always easy. It requires patience and focus, but the freedom to create a meaningful product, on your terms, is worth more than even the biggest VC check.</p>
<p>I started my company,<a href="https://www.jotform.com/"> JotForm</a>, in 2006. We’ve grown steadily from a simple web tool into a product that serves more than 8 million users – without taking a dime in outside funding. We’re profitable in an industry with big-name competitors like Google.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I still love this company and its mission, and I want the same for my fellow entrepreneurs. If you’re a SaaS founder who’s wary of VC funding, here are my best bootstrapping tips.</p>
<h2>Keep your day job</h2>
<p>Success stories from founders who leap blindly into business without resources or relevant experience are compelling, but they’re the exception, not the rule. Working inside another organization can build your skills, your network, and even inspire great product ideas.</p>
<p>After finishing college with a computer science degree, I worked as a developer for a New York media company. The editors always needed custom web forms, which were tedious and time-consuming to build. I kept thinking, “There has to be a better way.”</p>
<p>That daily frustration led me to start JotForm – but I didn’t leave my job right away. I stayed with the media firm for five years and worked on my product on the side. By the time I was ready to go all-in, I had the confidence, experience and savings I needed.</p>
<p>Many of the world’s biggest companies began as side projects, including Twitter, Craigslist, Slack, Instagram, Trello, and a little venture called Apple. If your day job doesn’t pay enough to fund the early stages of your business, consider a side gig or consulting work. There are so many ways to set yourself up for success without the pressure of VC cash or selling a chunk of your business.</p>
<h2>Know you’re not alone</h2>
<p>The exact numbers shift every year, but data compiled by<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/230011"> Fundable</a> show that only 0.05 percent of U.S. startups are backed by VCs. Another 0.91 percent are funded by angel investors. The vast majority, at 57 percent, are funded by credit and personal loans, while 38 percent get funding from friends and family.</p>
<p>It may feel like most founders raise multi-million-dollar rounds, but that’s simply not the case. It’s also good to remember that securing VC money is complicated and time-consuming. You can spend months taking meetings and presenting the perfect deck – and still leave empty-handed. Be patient and stick to your own path.</p>
<h2>Measure profits, not popularity</h2>
<p>SaaS founders often emphasize vanity metrics, like user acquisitions and total downloads. These numbers can measure short-term popularity, but they don’t reveal how users and customers feel about your product – or your long-term potential.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When I first wrote about <a href="https://www.retailzipline.com">Retail Zipline</a> in 2019, the startup was focused on building a communication platform that would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/retail-zipline-series-a/">help corporate decision-makers in retail communicate with individual stores</a>. As you’d probably guess, the startup saw some changes in 2020.</p>
<p>“When COVID first hit, you might think a company that’s primarily focused on retail would be in trouble,” said co-founder and CTO Jeremy Baker. “But it turns out that a product that helps retailers communicate critical information when everything is changing is no longer a nice to have.”</p>
<p>In other words, where Retail Zipline might previously have been used for coordinating sales and promotions, it suddenly became a channel for managing things like health and safety protocols and communicating about furloughs and closures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Melissa Wong said the platform supports both engagement (a company executives sending a message to retail associates) and execution (translating a broader corporate strategy into an in-store experience). While you might think that execution was the only thing that mattered in the middle of a pandemic, Wong argued that the engagement side was also essential, particularly when employees felt they were putting themselves at risk.</p>
<p>“The engagement part means that we can explain to a retail employee what we’re doing to protect you during this crisis, and your role as part of this company and this brand,” she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1828959" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1828959" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1828959" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?w=680" alt="Retail Zipline screenshot" width="680" height="491" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg 2886w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=768,554 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=680,491 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=1536,1108 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=2048,1477 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1828959" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Retail Zipline</p></div></p>
<p>She added that the company has doubled its customer baes during the pandemic and seen revenue increase 2.5x. Retailers using the platform include Sephora, AEO, L.L.Bean, Gap, Hy-Vee, Lush Cosmetics, BevMo, LL Flooring, Cole Haan, The LEGO Group, TOMS and Torrid.</p>
<p>The pandemic also spurred dramatic growth in e-commerce, but Wong (who previously worked on the corporate side of Gap and Old Navy) suggested that this won’t eliminate the need for physical stores. Instead, it just means they’ll have to live up to the long-standing “omni-channel promise,&#8221; where they serve as both a store and a distribution center for online orders.</p>
<p>“Retail will become more complex,” she said. “We will enable them to meet those complexities.”</p>
<p>Today, Retail Zipline is announcing that it has raised $30 million in Series B funding. The round was led by real estate-focused firm Fifth Wall, with partner Dan Wenhold joining the board of directors. Emergence Capital, Ridge Ventures, Hillsven Capital, Veeva co-founder Matt Wallach and the Fisher Family Fund also participated.</p>
<p>The company has now raised more than $39 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/retail-zipline">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>In a blog post, Fifth Wall wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fifth Wall network is rich with opportunities for Zipline to explore potential partnerships among our retail-focused partners and portfolio companies. However, we believe retail to be just the beginning for Zipline as we envision the product appealing to many Built World industries. The opportunity for Zipline within real estate could lie with organizations whose HQ office must communicate daily with field operations workers, such as more traditional brokers with a geographic focus (e.g., CBRE, Cushman &amp; Wakefield), leasing agents within multifamily and SFR (e.g., Equity Residential, Greystar), or construction site workers.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile gaming hasn&#8217;t seen the same demand for streaming content in the past as desktop has, but Amazon sees a market there to extend Twitch&#8217;s dominance. After launching on Android back in November, the company&#8217;s mobile streaming centric app has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1457912496">just launched</a> on Apple&#8217;s App Store.</p>
<p>The app lets users record short clips (anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes of content) of gameplay from a variety of titles that support screen recording capture. Users can screen record these clips directly into the GameOn library at which point they can add commentary or additional edits before publishing to the GameOn platform or sharing links to the platform on other sites.</p>
<p>The GameOn platform is interestingly fully disconnected from Twitch with separate branding and different channels. Amazon has been partnering with streamers to wholly focus on mobile gaming while promoting challenges unique to the app.The company says the service is compatible with over 1,000 mobile games.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Developers have been increasingly vigilant about brining more full-featured ports of desktop titles to mobile though the lack of sophisticated controls has made this a challenge. As gaming platforms aim to bring cloud streaming networks to iOS there could end up being more demand for shot-on-mobile content and titles that users control with a gamepad, but this will depend on whether the App Store grows more amenable to these platforms over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new digital marketplace called <a href="https://www.westtenth.com/">West Tenth</a>, now backed by $1.5 million in seed funding, wants to give women a platform to start and grow their home-based businesses. Through its mobile app, women can promote their business to others in the local community, then field inquiries and requests through the app&#8217;s integrated messaging platform, as well as finalize transactions through in-app payments.</p>
<p>The startup was co-founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lwjohnson/">Lyn Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lwjohnson/">Sara Sparhawk</a>, who met when they both worked in finance. Johnson remained in finance, but Sparhawk later moved on to work at Amazon.</p>
<p>Johnson explains that her experience led her to better understand the economic inequality of women in the U.S., where they only own 32 cents to every dollar in financial assets than men own. A large driver of this is that women leave the workforce, often to raise children, which results in years where they don&#8217;t have earnings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really good as a society at supporting women on the way of out of the workforce to care for their kids, but really terrible at supporting them on the way back in,&#8221; Johnson says. &#8220;Women know this, and as an alternative to employment that just seems to fail them, they&#8217;re starting businesses in droves.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119836" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119836" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2119836" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119836" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> West Tenth</p></div></p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.westtenth.com/">West Tenth</a>, the goal is to encourage this sort of entrepreneurship &#8212; and more broadly, to help women understand that the many of the talents they&#8217;ve developed at home are, in fact, potential businesses.</p>
<p>This includes opportunities like home-based bakers and cooks, photographers, home organizers or designers, home florists, baby sleep consultants, party planning and event services, crafting classes, fitness training, homemade goods, and more.</p>
<p>The company notes that the app isn&#8217;t necessarily closed to men, but the current market for U.S. home businesses favors women as they&#8217;re more often the partner who chooses to leave work to raise children. However, there are some men on its platform.</p>
<p>Though today many of these entrepreneurs market their home businesses on Facebook, they&#8217;re missing opportunities to reach customers if they&#8217;re not heavily involved in local groups and responding to requests for recommendations. West Tenth instead centralizes local businesses in one place to make discovery easier.</p>

<p>In the app, customers can browse and shop local businesses, filtering by category via buttons at the top of the screen. The results are sorted by distance and offer photos, description, and the starting price for the goods or services offered.

<p>This system of combining education and networking with business ownership could potentially help more women become home-based business entrepreneurs instead of joining multi-level marketing (MLM) companies, as is common.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started this, we recognized that MLMs are one of the few kind of industries that&#8217;s focused on this demographic of women who&#8217;ve left the workforce &#8212; which is a huge, untapped talent pool in the U.S.,&#8221; notes Johnson. &#8220;But they&#8217;re really predatory. Only the top 1% of sellers distributors really make money and the rest lose money. And they lose their social capital, as well. What we&#8217;re really interested in doing is becoming an alternative to MLMs in many respects,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, MLMs aren&#8217;t allowed on the West Tenth platform.</p>

<p>The startup, which completed Kansas City TechStars last summer, has now raised $1.5 million in seed funding to get its platform off the ground. The round was led by Better Ventures along with Stand Together Ventures Lab, Kapital Partners,The Community Fund, Backstage Capital, Wedbush Ventures, and Gaingels.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to develop the product and grow its user base. In time, West Tenth aims to build out product features to better highlight local businesses. This includes shopping elements that will let you see what friends are buying and video demonstrations, among other things.</p>
<p>Since 2019, West Tenth has grown its footprint from just 20 businesses on the app to now over 600, largely in suburban L.A. and Salt Lake City. It&#8217;s now aiming to target growth in Phoenix, Boise, and Northern California.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119833" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119833" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2119833" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119833" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> West Tenth</p></div></p>
<p>The timing for West Tenth&#8217;s expansion is coming on the tail end of the COVID-19 crisis, where things have only gotten worse for women&#8217;s traditional employment.</p>
<p>School and daycare closures combined with job losses that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/unemployment-coronavirus-women.html">greatly impacted women&#8217;s roles</a> have <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/10/30/492582/covid-19-sent-womens-workforce-progress-backward/">now driven more women out of the workforce</a> compared with men. And according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/achieving-an-inclusive-us-economic-recovery#">McKinsey</a>, women accounted for nearly 56% of workforce exits since the start of the pandemic, despite making up just 48% of the workforce. This COVID-driven &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/unemployment-coronavirus-women.html">shecession</a>,&#8221; as some have dubbed it, is also disproportionately impacting women of color, studies have found.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen 5 million women exit the workforce &#8212; some because they were laid off or furloughed, and a huge chunk because they&#8217;re opting out because the caregiving responsibilities just became overwhelming,&#8221; says Johnson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing is when women leave the workforce for caregiving reasons &#8212; for some reason we really discount that and we make it even harder for them to return to work. So I think over the next 18 to 24 months, we&#8217;ll see a big surge in economic activity in the home with women trying to bring in additional sources of income by running a business from the home,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The West Tenth app is available on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/west-tenth/id1478134804#?platform=iphone">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wtenth.w10">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon on Tuesday issued a rare apology to users in India for an original political drama series over allegations that a few scenes in the nine-part mini series hurt religious sentiments of some people in the key overseas market.</p>
<p>The series, called “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11117570/">Tandav</a>,” has faced criticism from some people in India &#8212; including a few members of the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party &#8212; over its depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>In a message titled, “Amazon Prime Video Apologizes,” the American e-commerce group said it “deeply regrets that viewers considered certain scenes to be objectionable” and that it had either edited those scenes or removed them altogether from the show after hearing concerns from viewers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We respect our viewers’ diverse beliefs and apologize unconditionally to anyone who felt hurt by these scenes. Our teams follow company content evaluation processes, which we acknowledge need to be constantly updated to better serve our audiences. We will continue to develop entertaining content with partners, while complying with the laws of India and respecting the diversity of culture and beliefs of our audiences.”</p>
<p>The show, which stars several top Bollywood actors including Saif Ali Khan, premiered in mid-January and immediately prompted <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">controversy and criminal complaints. Things have escalated in recent weeks as several high-profile executives of Amazon Prime Video have been questioned by the authority.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amazon Prime Video has been made to apologise. Sickening. <br />If you’re offended by something, stop watching. Don’t demand that it be scrubbed from existence. <a href="https://t.co/hakPc1xqZ4">pic.twitter.com/hakPc1xqZ4</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Raja Sen (@RajaSen) <a href="https://twitter.com/RajaSen/status/1366762099863547904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Prime Video has amassed millions of subscribers in India, where it competes with Disney&#8217;s Hotstar, Netflix, Times Internet&#8217;s MX Player, and dozens more streaming services. Amazon has grown more aggressive with Prime Video in India in recent months. It recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/amazon-launches-mobile-only-prime-video-subscription-in-india/">introduced an even cheaper subscription tier</a> and <a href="https://scroll.in/field/978130/cricket-amazon-prime-video-acquires-indian-territory-rights-for-all-matches-in-new-zealand">secured rights</a> for streaming some cricket matches.</p>
<p>Amazon’s rare apology today comes days after New Delhi announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new rules for on-demand video streaming services and social media firms</a>.</p>
<p>Until now Amazon Prime Video and other streaming services have operated in India without having to worry too much about the nature of their content. But that’s changing, according to the new rules.</p>
<p>“The category classification of a content will take into account the potentially offensive impact of a film on matters such as caste, race, gender, religion, disability or sexuality that may arise in a wide range of works, and the classification decision will take account of the strength or impact of their inclusion,” the new rules state.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/india-plays-hardball-with-amazon/">wrote recently</a>, the controversy surrounding the political drama and the new rules from India for streaming services are only few of the challenges that Amazon is facing in India, where it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">committed to deploy over $6.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, an influential India trader group that represents tens of millions of brick-and-mortar retailers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/indian-trader-group-calls-for-ban-on-amazon-following-dodging-regulations-claims/">called New Delhi to ban Amazon in the country</a> after an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation/">investigation by Reuters</a> claimed that the American e-commerce group had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers in India, publicly misrepresented its ties with those sellers and used them to circumvent foreign investment rules in the country.</p>

<p>“It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the metaverse and Tonic Games shares this goal,” Epic founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said in a release tied to the news. “As Epic works to build this virtual future, we need great creative talent who know how to build powerful games, content and experiences.”</p>
<p>Epic notes in its announcement post that gameplay for the popular title won&#8217;t change under the new ownership. As with Fornite, the company says it&#8217;s investing in cross platform play for the title, which is currently available on the PlayStation and PC with Nintendo Switch and Xbox arriving later this year.</p>
<p>Mediatonic was founded in the U.K. in 2005. Tonic Games Group was developed as a parent company last year. Based in London, the group now employs roughly 300 people, globally. Released last August, Fall Guys has proven a major hit for audiences and critics, alike. The brightly-colored title allows for up to 60 players to compete in battle royale-style matches.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Epic, we feel like we have found a home that was made for us,&#8221; Tonic cofounder and CEO Dave Bailey said in the release. &#8220;They share our mission to build and support games that have a positive impact, empower others and stand the test of time and we couldn’t be more excited to be joining forces with their team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Epic, of course, has money to burn. In addition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/epic-fortnite-3-billion-profit/">massive revenue</a> generated from Fortnite, the company has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/epic-games-2">raised $3.4 billion to date</a>, including a $1.78 billion round in August of last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are many jobs in the construction industry that fall under the &#8220;dull, dirty, and dangerous&#8221; category said to be ripe for automation — but only a few can actually be taken on with today&#8217;s technology. One such job is the crucial but repetitive task of rebar tying, which<a href="https://skymul.com/"> a startup called SkyMul is aiming to completely automate</a> using fleets of drones.</p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;ve put together reinforced concrete at some point in your life, you may not know what rebar tying is. The steel rebar that provides strength to concrete floors, walls, and other structures is held in place during the pouring process by tying it to the other rebar where the rods cross. For a good-size building or bridge this can easily be thousands of ties — and the process is generally done manually.</p>
<p>Rodbusters (as rebar tying specialists are called, or so I&#8217;m told) are masters of the art of looping a short length of plastic or wire around an intersection between two pieces of rebar, then twisting and tying it tightly so that the rods are secured in multiple directions. It must be done precisely and efficiently, and so it is — but it&#8217;s backbreaking, repetitive work. Though any professional must feel pride in what they do, I doubt anyone cherishes the chronic pain they get from doing that task thousands of times in an hour. As you might expect, rodbusters have high injury rates and develop chronic issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Automation of rebar tying is tricky because it happens in so many different circumstances. A prominent semi-robotic solution is the <a href="https://www.constructionrobots.com/tybot">TyBot</a>, which is a sort of rail-mounted gantry that suspends itself over the surface — but while this makes sense for a bridge, it makes far less for the 20th floor of an office building.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119802" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skyty-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119802" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119802" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skyty-1.gif" alt="Animated image of a drone floating over rebar and tying it together at intersections." width="700" height="394" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119802" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SkyMul</p></div></p>
<p>Enter SkyMul, a startup still in the very early stages but with a compelling pitch: rebar tying done by a fleet of drones. When you consider that the tying process doesn&#8217;t involve too much force, and that computer vision has gotten more than good enough to locate the spots that need work&#8230; it starts sounding kind of obvious.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Eohan George said that they evaluated a number of different robotic solutions but that drones are the only ones that make sense. The only legged robots with the dexterity to pick their way through the rebar are too expensive, and treads and wheels are too likely to move the unsecured rebar. The SkyTy system was developed after early research into the area done at Georgia Tech&#8217;s robotics lab.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119789" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119789" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119789" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg" alt="Diagram showing how SkyMul's drones map an area of rebar then divide it up for tying." width="1024" height="714" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg?resize=768,536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119789" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SkyMul</p></div></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works. First, a mapper drone flies over the site to mark the boundaries and then, in an automated closer flyover, to build a map of the rebar itself and where the ties will need to go. This map is then double-checked by the rodbuster technician running the show, which George said only takes about a minute per thousand square feet of rebar (though that adds up quickly).</p>
<p>Then the tying drones are released, as many as needed or wanted. Each one moves from spot to spot, hovering and descending until its tying tool (much like those used by human rodbusters) spans the rebar intersection; the tie is wrapped, twisted, and the drone is off to the next spot. They need their batteries swapped every 25 minutes, which means they generally have time to put down 70-80 ties; right now each drone does one tie every 20 seconds, which is in line with humans, who can do it faster but generally go at about that speed or slower, according to numbers George cited.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Drone-focused construction startup TraceAir raises $3.5M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/drone-focused-construction-startup-traceair-raises-3-5m/embed/#?secret=r4ScGhNmvW" data-secret="r4ScGhNmvW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to estimate the cost savings and value of the work SkyTy does, because the value of the labor varies widely. In some places rodbusters cost more than $80/hour, meaning the draw of automation is in cost savings. But in other markets the pay is less than a third of that, which compounded with the injury risk makes rodbusters a scarce quantity — so the value is in availability and reliability. Drone-based tying seems to offer value one way or the other, but that means the business model is somewhat in flux as SkyMul figures out what makes the most sense. Generally contractors at one level or another would lease and eventually own their own drones, though other methods are being looked into.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119803" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skyty-2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119803" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119803" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skyty-2.gif" alt="Animated image of a computer-generated grid overlaid on images of rebar." width="700" height="394" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119803" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SkyMul</p></div></p>
<p>The system offers value-add services as well, for instance the precise map of the rebar generated at the beginning, which can be archived and used later for maintenance, quality assurance, comparison with plans, and other purposes. Once a contractor is convinced it&#8217;s as good or better than the manually-produced ones currently used, this could save hours, turning a 3-day job into a 2-day job or otherwise simplifying logistics.</p>
<p>The plan at the company is to first offer SkyTy as an option for bridge construction, which is a simpler environment than a multi-story building for the drones. The market there is on the order of $30-40 million per year in the U.S. alone for rebar tying services, providing an easier path to the more complex deployments and expansion to the larger global markets.</p>
<p>SkyMul is looking for funding, having emerged from work done at Georgia Tech through Comcast-NBC accelerator The Farm and then being granted a National Science Foundation SBIR Phase I award (with hopes for a Phase II). They have demonstrated the system but have yet to begin their pilot program with a partner; the construction business isn&#8217;t known for its nimbleness and a drone-based solution isn&#8217;t trivial to swap in for human rodbusters on short notice, but George is confident that there are early adopters ready to jump on board. Once a few projects are under its belt the company seems likely to find serious traction among forward-thinking contractors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, at a special AR/VR focused event held inside its virtual reality community platform Altspace, Microsoft showcased a new product aiming to provide their AR HoloLens platform and VR Windows Mixed Reality platform with a shared platform for meetings.</p>
<p>The app is called Microsoft Mesh and it gives users a cross AR/VR meeting space to interact with other users and 3D content, handling all of technical hard parts of sharing spatial multi-player experiences over the web. Like Microsoft&#8217;s other AR/VR apps, the sell seems to be less in the software than it is in enabling developers to tap into one more specialization of Azure, building their own software that builds on the capabilities. The company announced that AltspaceVR will now be Mesh-enabled.</p>
<p>In the company&#8217;s presentation, they swung for the fences in showcasing potential use cases, bringing in James Cameron, the co-founder of Cirque du Soleil and <em>Pokémon Go</em> developer Niantic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s HoloLens platform has always been at its most impressive when it comes to viewers in a shared space looking at the same digital content in the same room that&#8217;s invisible to everyone else. Inside Mesh, other users are represented as cartoonish avatars, a design break that has plagued countless other AR/VR apps and platforms. Microsoft says the hope is to one day beam a user&#8217;s 3D photo-realistic presence into the app but that will assuredly require the commoditization of some complex camera hardware.</p>
<p>The company showcased a concept video of Mesh, which seems to be a few years further ahead in several places than the current software is.</p>

<p>Mesh isn&#8217;t offering any capabilities that are terribly unique to the spatial computing world &#8212; it&#8217;s all pretty standard faire in terms of bells and whistles &#8212; the distinguishing factor is the breadth of access, something once the unique distinguishing feature of the AltspaceVR platform back in the day. Mesh can be accessed on the HoloLens 2, many VR headsets, phones, tablets, and PCs, providing a window into the futuristic platform for even desktop users.</p>
<p>The software is available in preview now on HoloLens 2 alongside its AltspaceVR integration.</p>
