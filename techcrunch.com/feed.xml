										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dapper Labs, the NFT startup behind NBA Top Shot which was recently valued above $7.5 billion, made an interesting acquisition this morning, telling <a href="https://decrypt.co/82517/dapper-labs-nfts-daos-collectives-brud">Decrypt</a> that they have purchased virtual influencer startup Brud and will be bringing the entire 32-person team aboard.</p>
<p>Brud is best known for its digitally rendered social media influencer characters, specifically one named Lil Miquela. The startup spawned several other players in the space when it caught investor attention back in 2018 but the virtual influencer space hasn&#8217;t seen any explosions in interest and has stayed a pretty niche space over the years. The company&#8217;s cache of characters have lived fictionalized lives on Instagram, racking up followers as the startup earned a $125 million valuation. Dapper didn&#8217;t disclose what it paid for Brud.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Twitter friends, I am very excited to announce today that Brud has been acquired by <a href="https://twitter.com/dapperlabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dapperlabs</a>!</p>
<p>Together we will be building the decentralized, collectively owned future of media and social with DAOs on <a href="https://twitter.com/flow_blockchain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@flow_blockchain</a>!<a href="https://t.co/H6z0DipZ5l">https://t.co/H6z0DipZ5l</a></p>

DM Me (@whatdotcd) <a href="https://twitter.com/whatdotcd/status/1445054831106924545?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The most pertinent question here is what does an NFT startup like Dapper want with Lil Miquela (now, just Miquela)?</p>
<p>Well, it seem that the short of it is &#8212; not that much? Brud&#8217;s founder Trevor McFedries has been getting deeper into the crypto world and moving his startup&#8217;s focus towards collective decision-making through decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) which is where Dapper&#8217;s central interest seems to lie. McFedries is already the co-founder of one of the more popular DAOs called &#8220;Friends With Benefits&#8221;. DAOs can help users team up to make investment decisions as a collective and they&#8217;ve grown more popular in the past year as developers in the crypto space have started crafting bolder projects in the space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While McFedries says the company will continue to develop Miquela, he will now lead a division inside Dapper Labs called Dapper Collectives focused on making DAOs more user-friendly and accessible to a new generation of crypto web users while leveraging the company&#8217;s Flow blockchain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founders seeking to raise their first round of capital may feel overwhelmed by the prospect. There is definitely plenty of capital out there, but there are also a lot of startups clamoring for it.</p>
<p>To help new entrepreneurs figure out this dilemma, we invited three investors to speak at a panel titled, &#8220;How to Raise Your First Dollars,&#8221; during TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 so they could share their best tips on what you should do as you attempt to raise that money, as well as strategies for who to pitch to, when to pitch and how to pitch.</p>
<p>Index Ventures partner <a href="https://www.indexventures.com/team/nina-achadjian/">Nina Achadijan</a> started out by urging founders to first consider whether they actually really need to raise venture capital. &#8220;It’s a phenomenal time to be an early-stage entrepreneur. There&#8217;s more capital than ever before and there&#8217;s a willingness to accept technology from consumers and businesses,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And quite frankly, there&#8217;s a lot of platform shifts that are very exciting for early-stage entrepreneurs. But the first thing you need to do is ask yourself: Do you really need to raise venture capital? There are so many incredible businesses that can be built that actually don&#8217;t need VC funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Achadijan said founders should first get clarity on what they would be using the money for. Secondly, she said, they should consider whether they want to eventually exit the company via an IPO or a sale. Once a founder decides to raise capital, the next step would be to make a list of companies that are either similar to theirs either in business model or by industry. Then using Crunchbase or PitchBook, she then recommends making a list of VCs that backed those companies, including angel investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what you can start to do is go down that list and say, ‘It seems like this person focuses 100% on what I&#8217;m doing; I&#8217;m definitely going to talk to them,&#8217; or &#8216;This person has backed similar business models and I&#8217;m really excited to hear their perspective on my space or my industry!&#8217; And then once you have your target list … you can start to get introductions and basically start the process of fundraising,” she said.</p>
<p>Canvas Ventures’ co-founder and general partner <a href="https://www.canvas.vc/team-member/rebecca-lynn">Rebecca Lynn</a> agreed with the exercise. In particular, she recommended listing what’s &#8220;non-negotiable&#8221; in terms of the investor and amount of money raised, and what would be a &#8220;nice to have.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament&#8217;s lead and shadow rapporteur for a major reboot of the bloc&#8217;s digital rulebook have called for an investigation following the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">Facebook whistleblower leaks</a>.</p>
<p>One of the MEPs has also called for incoming EU rules to directly tackle business models that favor &#8220;disinformation and violence over factual content&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://en.alexandrageese.eu/joint-statement-alexandra-geese-christel-schaldemose-on-the-relevance-of-the-facebook-leaks-to-the-dsa-legislative-process/">joint statement</a>, the lead rapporteur for the EU&#8217;s Digital Services Act (DSA), Christel Schaldemose (S&amp;D), and Alexandra Geese (shadow rapporteur for the Greens/EFA), said they are in touch with the former Facebook employee turned whistleblower, Frances Haugen.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/">60 Minutes</a></em> today, Haugen revealed herself as the source of a raft of recent leaks to the Wall Street Journal which has reported on the internal documents for a number of stories &#8212; including that Facebook&#8217;s internal research suggested Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">made teenage girls&#8217; anxiety and body image issues worse</a> and that the tech giant operated policy carve outs for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=article_inline">whitelisting celebritie</a>.</p>
<p>The two MEPs said the leaks make it clear that Big Tech must not be allowed to continue to regulate itself.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s executive moved forward in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/"> December</a> last year with a major reboot to the digital rule book &#8212; introducing the DSA and another piece of regulation that&#8217;s specifically targeted at tech giants&#8217; market power (aka the Digital Markets Act), kicking off a process of (ongoing) negotiations between EU institutions to amend and adopt legislation to extend platforms&#8217; accountability.</p>
<p>The support of the European Parliament is required to pass the digital policy packages. And Geese is unlikely to be alone in calling for stronger measures than were contained in the Commission&#8217;s original DSA proposal in light of the latest ugly Facebook revelations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Kb67b2i9hQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">Facebook whistleblower reveals identity, says company &#8216;chooses profits over safety&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook whistleblower reveals identity, says company &#8216;chooses profits over safety&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/embed/#?secret=Kb67b2i9hQ" data-secret="Kb67b2i9hQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the joint statement, Schaldemose said that large tech companies have shown they are &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">simply not capable&#8221; of responsible self regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The governing of our shared spaces on social media must be done through democratically controlled institutions just as we have done in the parts of our society that do not lie in the digital realm. We must demand transparency from the tech companies and we must allow civil society, law makers and scholarly experts to have insight into the building blocks of the algorithms. This is the only way that we can have a public debate about the effects of these algorithms,&#8221; she also said. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we know this from the files, there are arbitrary protections of celebrities and a huge focus on negative, wrong and conflict-ridden content that threaten to undermine the very democratic conversation that we once hoped, the social media platforms could strengthen. To keep that hope alive and to allow all voices the ability to join in on the conversation, we must put firm demands to the companies governing these spaces.”</p>
<p>Geese went further &#8212; calling for the DSA to be strengthened in light of Haugen&#8217;s whistleblowing &#8212; arguing that the exposures are game-changing and make the case for regulating whole business models when they benefit from the amplification of disinformation at the expense of truthful content.</p>
<p>“I am extremely grateful for the courage of the whistleblower that finally gives us insights we need to effectively legislate. The revelations couldn’t be more timely for the work on the DSA,&#8221; said Geese. &#8220;The huge volume of documents and the person’s deep expertise are impressive. Until now, neither the public nor legislators have been able to gain such a deep insight into the mechanisms that have become far too powerful. The documents finally put all the facts on the table to allow us to adopt a stronger Digital Services Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conversation confirms my view that we need strong rules for content moderation and far-reaching transparency obligations in Europe. In a democracy we cannot tolerate an internet where some people have the right to promote violence and hatred in spite of the rules and others see perfectly legal content taken down by automated filters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to regulate the whole system and the business model that favours disinformation and violence over factual content – and enables its rapid dissemination. We also need consistent enforcement in Europe. It is naïve to appeal to corporate self-regulation and responsibility. We as elected politicians have the responsibility for democratic discourse and must exercise it in the legislative process.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lx5VmAdZSI">her interview with <em>60 Minutes</em></a>, Haugen was quizzed about a complaint made to Facebook in 2019 by major political parties across Europe &#8212; which were said to have raised concerns with the tech giant that its algorithmic preferences was forcing them to &#8220;skew negative&#8221; in their communications on its platforms and that was leading them to adopt more extreme policy positions.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are forcing us to take positions that we don&#8217;t like, that we know are bad for society, we know if we don&#8217;t take those positions we won&#8217;t win in the marketplace of social media,&#8221; said Haugen, summarizing the parties&#8217; concern in the interview.</p>
<p>Facebook was contacted for a response to the MEPs&#8217; joint statement.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-politicians-call-facebook-investigation-after-whistleblower-revelation-2021-10-04/">Reuters</a>, the tech giant reiterated its customary claim that it has &#8220;been advocating for updated regulations where democratic governments set industry standards to which we can all adhere&#8221;.</p>
<p>Haugen has said that she made the decision to turn whistleblower after becoming frustrated that Facebook was not responding to such concerns and that executives at the company were instead prioritizing its financial performance over making changes to its content-sorting algorithms that could reduce the platform&#8217;s negatively polarizing effects on society.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook has thousands of [content] options it could show you. And one of the consequences of how Facebook is picking out that content today is it optimizing for content that gets engagement or reaction. But its own research is showing that content that is hateful, that is divisive, that is polarizing &#8212; it&#8217;s easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,&#8221; Haugen also told <em>60 Minutes</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">A year ago</a> the European Parliament voted to back a call for tighter regulations on behavioral ads &#8212; such as those which power Facebook&#8217;s content-sorting social media business &#8212; advocating for less intrusive, contextual forms of advertising and urging EU lawmakers to consider further regulatory options, including asking the Commission to look at a phase-out leading to a full ban.</p>
<p>With ever more ugly revelations coming out of Facebook &#8212; seemingly on a weekly basis &#8212; momentum could well build in the European Parliament for taking a far tougher line on engagement-based business models.</p>
<p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg got a frosty reception from MEPs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/zuckerberg-didnt-make-any-friends-in-europe-today/">back in 2018</a> &#8212; the last time he took an in-person, publicly streamed meeting with a part of the institution, in that case in the wake of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/14/facebook-suspends-200-suspicious-apps-out-of-thousands-reviewed-so-far/">Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal</a>.</p>
<p>Asked about the MEPs&#8217; statement today, a Commission spokesperson told the Reuters news agency that its position in favor of regulation is &#8220;clear&#8221;, adding: &#8220;The power of major platforms over public debate and social life must be subject to democratically validated rules, in particular on transparency and accountability.&#8221;</p>

Based in Sydney, Australia, Lawpath serves small businesses with services like legal documents, customized legal workflows, e-signatures, business registration, and on-demand lawyers. The company announced today it has raised $7.5 million AUD (about $5.5 million USD) to expand into new markets, including upcoming launches in New Zealand and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Lawpath currently has about 230,000 users, and says it is used to help form 5% of new companies in Australia.</p>
<p>Participants in this round, which brings Lawpath’s total raised to $14 million AUD, include the Gonski family; Adore Beauty chair Justin Ryan; Sandbar Investments; Ooh! Media and Readytech chair Tony Faure; LegalZoom director Khai Ha; and Bryant Stibel founding partner Gonzalo Troncoso. Existing investors Adcock Private Equity and LegalZoom also returned for this raise.</p>
<p>In addition to international expansion, the funding will also be used to double Lawpath’s current team of 40 people, especially for its product and software departments.</p>

<p>Dominic Wollrych, co-founder and chief executive officer of Lawpath, said he decided to create Lawpath while working for a large law firm, where he realized that many legal services are inaccessible to small businesses. About 98% of businesses in the world are SMEs, he told TechCrunch in an email, and 87% of them don’t seek legal help because of cost and access issues.</p>
<p>“There are million of legal transactions that happen every day that small businesses don’t seek legal advice on simply because they can’t afford to and it’s leaving them unprotected,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lawpath’s customers are typically businesses that make under $5 million in revenue and have up to 20 employees. About 40% of them work in online sectors, like e-commerce or the gig economy, and there has recently been an increase in professional service providers, like financial planners, accountants and other lawyers, signing up for the platform.</p>
<p>The company’s plans start at $29 AUD a month, and its most popular tier is the $89 per month “Legal Advice” plan, which includes unlimited 30-minute phone calls with a lawyer. Other services include <a href="https://lawpath.com.au/business-registrations">business registration plans </a>that automatically sets up a company, completes government and tax registration, and manages ongoing legal and compliance tasks, and a <a href="https://lawpath.com.au/quick-quotes">lawyer marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Wollrych said Lawpath has seen an uptick in use during the pandemic as more companies rely on its team accounts, legal document collaboration features and e-signature tool to perform remote work. Demand for its business registration and legal plan subscriptions have also increased as people launch side hustles during lockdowns.</p>
<p>In terms of localization as it expands geographically, Lawpath’s SaaS platform acts as the underlying infrastructure for legal documents, APIs and lawyers, so it can move into new markets quickly, Wollrych said.</p>
<p>“We saw Lawpath following a similar path to accounting platform Xero,” he added. “Xero is an accounting infrastructure that small businesses use to complete their accounting. Xero has moved into many new markets by injecting local accounting methods into its platform. Lawpath can do the same for legal and become the ‘Xero of Law.’”</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>. I <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">also tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry that the show is so delayed today, it&#8217;s utterly my fault. Regular service returns Wednesday, and we&#8217;ll make to not be late on a Monday again this year! Here&#8217;s what we got into on the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tech shares are falling in America in a larger domestic selloff &#8212; but once again we&#8217;re seeing high-valued technology stocks lose the most ground. Software companies are having a particularly rough morning.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">Facebook whistleblower situation</a> remains the biggest news item in the technology world this morning, dominating aggregators and conversation. Precisely what comes next isn&#8217;t clear, I reckon, but Facebook shares haven&#8217;t lost enough ground yet to be a worry for the firm; that could change with another few days&#8217; declines, however.</li>
<li>What else was on our mind? <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-doesnt-make-videogames-but-its-the-hottest-player-in-gaming-11633147211">Apple&#8217;s epic gaming profits</a>, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/03/what-we-can-learn-from-chinas-proposed-ai-regulations/">new AI guidelines from China</a>, and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/mergers-money-investments-in-chips-hit-record-level-as-tech-giants-look-to-design-their-own/">data concerning just how much money semiconductor startups are raising</a>. It&#8217;s more, but is it <em>enough</em>?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-valued-at-18-billion-in-new-funding/">Byju&#8217;s raised $300 million</a>, this time at an $18 billion valuation. Its upcoming IPO will help set the tone for global edtech valuations.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/ladder-raises-100m-on-a-900m-valuation-for-a-platform-selling-flexible-term-life-insurance/">Ladder raised $100 million</a>, proving that the insurtech market is still active. Sure, shares of public insurtech startups have taken a pounding in recent quarters, but there&#8217;s still plenty of private capital ready to make bets on the market.</li>
<li>And the Vision Fund 2 is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-03/softbank-is-cutting-more-deals-with-fewer-staff-than-ever-before">even more Vision Fund-y than we anticipated</a>!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What&#8217;s the opposite of stonks?</p>
<p>Shares of technology companies are sharply lower in the United States today, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite falling 2.4% in early-afternoon trading.</p>
<p>Inside of the larger tech industry, things are even worse. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund, essentially a way to trade <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">the Bessemer Cloud Index</a> as an aggregate, is off some 5%. The Bessemer Cloud Index tracks a basket of public software companies, which provide their services largely through hosted (SaaS) or on-demand (API) methods.</p>
<p>TechCrunch doesn&#8217;t bring you intraday trading updates much, but because these come on the heels of larger declines, the damage is starting to pile up.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq is off 7.7% from its recent highs. That&#8217;s not <em>that</em> bad. It&#8217;s not even a technical correction, a movement that requires a 10% decline from recent highs. A bear market, as a reminder, is a <em>20%</em> correction from recent highs.</p>
<p>The SaaS and cloud market is in the worst shape, falling nearly 13% as of today&#8217;s declines. Public software companies are in a correction and are on their way toward a bear market if any more days like today crop up.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more afoot, of course. Shares of social giant Facebook are off a little more than 5% after the company endured &#8212; even for it &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">punishing news cycle in recent weeks</a>. A whistleblower who leaked internal Facebook material <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">came forward over the weekend</a>, leading to another round of coverage that Facebook would like to forget.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Then, today, Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">entire suite of services</a> &#8212; Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp &#8212; went down due to an issue with its servers.</p>
<p>Shares of Facebook are off about 15.5% from recent highs, putting Zuckerberg&#8217;s empire in even worse shape than SaaS. This is despite a bullish advertising market.</p>
<p>All told, this is not the way that the stock market would have wanted to kick off its first full trading week of Q4. And because we&#8217;re expecting a few more IPOs before the end of 2021, it&#8217;s an ominous kickoff to the final public-offering push of the year.</p>

As part of iOS 15, the latest App Store update lets you &#8220;report a scam or fraud&#8221; for both free, in-app purchase (IAP) and paid apps, provided you&#8217;ve installed the app in question.</p>
<p>The feature, detailed by <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1444814469184425988" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Kosta Eleftheriou</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mazkewich/status/1444780501949194256" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Richard Mazkewich</a> on Twitter, goes even farther than the previous &#8220;Report a Problem&#8221; feature. You can now signal a scam or a fraud and not just “Report suspicious activity,” “Report a quality issue,&#8221; “Request a refund” or “Find my content” as before. Previously, you would have also needed to make an in-app purchase before you could highlight a scam or fraud, but that&#8217;s no longer the case.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Report a problem&#8221; feature itself returned to individual app listings for the first time in years, as <em>The Verge</em> pointed out. Prior to that, it was located at the bottom of the Apps or Games tabs and would send you to a separate website.</p>
<p>Apple essentially foreshadowed the changes when it released new App Store Review Guidelines in June. Several sections included changes that saw Apple taking a tougher stance on fraud, scams and developer misconduct, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> noted at the time.</p>
<p>Bad apps found on the Store included VPNs that duped customers into buying unneeded software, bad dating apps, QR readers and apps fraudulently claiming to be from major brands, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/06/apple-app-store-scams-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em>Washington Post</em></a> revealed earlier this year. The apps may have defrauded users out of an estimated $48 million, according to the <em>Post</em>&#8216;s estimates.</p>
<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s note:</strong> <em>This article originally appeared on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/following-criticism-apple-now-allows-users-to-report-app-store-scams-094849581.html">Engadget</a>.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pioneered by Snapchat and cloned by Instagram, the &#8220;Stories&#8221; feature has become a <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/stories-takeover-social-media-apps/">staple</a> for modern-day mobile apps from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/google-adds-stories-to-its-search-app-for-ios-and-android/">Google search</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/pinterest-story-pins/">Pinterest</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/spotify-test-lets-influencers-post-stories-to-introduce-their-own-playlists/">streaming apps</a> and more. And while the addition doesn&#8217;t work for everyone &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/linkedin-is-scrapping-its-stories-feature-to-work-on-short-form-video/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">Twitter</a> recently shuttered their Stories features, for example &#8212; there&#8217;s enough demand for Stories out there on the market that a company called Storyteller has managed to create a revenue-generating business that provides &#8220;Stories as a Service.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s service allows anyone to add Stories to their app, or even their website, with little coding and setup required. Instead, Storyteller&#8217;s clients can integrate SDKs to add Stories to their app, then leverage a content management system (CMS) to author and publish their Stories, and track their performance.</p>
<p>The idea for Storyteller spun out of the Edinburgh, Scotland-based specialist entertainment agency <a href="https://stormideas.com/">Storm Ideas</a>, founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/movingforwards?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3BdDYTtaQIS%2BaHm2qvLAfhGw%3D%3D">Bob Thomson</a>, which provides a range of services to media companies along with various social products. The agency was founded in 2009 after Thomson created an early way to customize online profile images called Twibbon, which took off rapidly. Over the past decade or so, Storm Ideas has matured into a 70-person company that now offers strategy, design, development, and content for its clients across the sports and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>Along the way, Storm Ideas also came up with other concepts based on its clients&#8217; needs &#8212; like <a href="https://hailto.com/">HailTo</a>, a platform for distributing social assets to talent, which helped the agency grow its customer base.</p>

<p>Storyteller emerged from that same process. Thomson says companies &#8212; and particularly U.S.-based media companies &#8212; would identify the idea to add a Stories feature, but would struggle to actually implement it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to build the [user interface] for it, and then they need to rebuild it for Android, iOS, and web. And they need to build a whole backend for it to interact with. And then &#8212; often the kind of thing that gets forgotten &#8212; is that you also need tools to manage all that,&#8221; Thomson explains. &#8220;We felt there was an opportunity to look at a product that did all that for you.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Storyteller, the goal is to do for Stories what companies like Braze did for push notifications. That is, instead of building their own product from scratch, businesses can choose to implement an SDK for adding Stories to their own apps.</p>
<p>The first client for Storyteller was Hallmark &#8212; a company Storm Ideas already had a relationship with &#8212; which runs the Hallmark Movie Checklist app where users can track the movies they&#8217;ve watched. The company wanted a way to deliver updates about new releases, featured selections, and other timely content to its hundreds of thousands of monthly users. Storyteller launched with Hallmark Movie Checklist in 2019, then steadily began offering the same toolset to its other agency clients in the months that followed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211911" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211911" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211911" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png 4608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hallmark-Movie-Checklist-App.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211911" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Storyteller</p></div></p>
<p>Now, Storyteller &#8212; which is spinning out to become its own, separate business &#8212; is serving millions of users across a number of apps in sports and entertainment, though the company doesn&#8217;t have permission to identify its enterprise clients by name.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re into the double figures in terms of those big enterprise-type implementations,&#8221; says Thomson.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a great basis to go from. We&#8217;ve taken on some of the hardest challenges first. We&#8217;ve worked with these large companies doing integrations. Lots of stakeholders. Lots of internal politics, sometimes,&#8221; he says. &#8220;[We&#8217;ve done] a huge amount of work&#8230;But obviously, we want to also open this up to more and more medium-sized clients &#8212; those who maybe want to self-serve a little more or have more of a hands-off approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, the focus is on clients in sports and media, as those are the markets Storm Ideas already served &#8212; not companies looking to add a consumer-facing product with user-generated content.</p>
<p>Through Storyteller, the clients gain access to a backend where they can create Stories by uploading and previewing images, videos, and polls. They can categorize the content, build out publication schedules, and publish the data into the SDK, then track analytics. In the works is a new studio component that will offer easy-to-use content creation tools for smaller companies that may not have an in-house team producing content professionally using tools like Photoshop or Adobe After Effects, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211916" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211916" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211916" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Overview-PNG.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Overview-PNG.png 4608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Overview-PNG.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Overview-PNG.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Overview-PNG.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Overview-PNG.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Overview-PNG.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Overview-PNG.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Overview-PNG.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211916" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Storyteller</p></div></p>
<p>This feature, expected before year-end, will allow clients to select templates and customize them with their own content. This could also make Storyteller more compelling for non-enterprise clients.</p>
<p>Today, the company is catering to these smaller customers with a range of plans starting at free plans for apps with just 25,000 monthly active users up to $849-per-month plans for larger apps with up to a million monthly users. Beyond that, enterprise pricing will come into play.</p>
<p>So far, Storyteller has been bootstrapped using agency profits, Thomson&#8217;s own money, and early client revenue.</p>
<p>Storyteller&#8217;s team includes a core group of around 30 people joining from Storm Ideas who had already been dedicated to the project. It will continue to hire separately. And as Storyteller is sold to clients, if the customer needs help with the content production side of things, they&#8217;re referred back to the agency which provides this service.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211914" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211914" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211914" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png 4608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-CMS-Analytics-2-PNG.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211914" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Storyteller</p></div></p>
<p>Storyteller isn&#8217;t actively raising funding, but has not decided against it, given its long-term focus actually extends beyond the &#8220;Stories&#8221; product itself to include other ways brands and businesses may want to tell their stories.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I see it is that what we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve built a platform that has these key components &#8212; SDKs across the major platforms &#8212; iOS, Android, and web; APIs for them to communicate with a backend that is good at hosting, processing, and manipulating text, images, and video; and a CMS &#8212; a tool that&#8217;s good at authoring and scheduling&#8221; says Thomson.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211936" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211936" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211936" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg 11451w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Storyteller-Team-Building.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211936" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Storyteller</p></div></p>
<p>Now that Storyteller has figured out &#8220;all the hard stuff,&#8221; as Thomson puts. it, like security, privacy, and analytics, it makes sense to add support for other formats, like vertical video.</p>
<p>A number of apps have begun adopting vertical video outside of those trying to simply clone TikTok. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">Netflix added vertical video in its app</a>, for instance. And others in the sports and media entertainment space have large libraries of content and clips that would make sense for an in-app video feed, too. Support for vertical video is now on the product roadmap, Thomson says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Storyteller may be a new product, but the leadership team behind it is anything but,&#8221; says Thomson. &#8220;We have gathered together an exceptional team of experienced and driven people to make this product the best that it can be. With a strong background in providing products and services to the world’s largest in the sports and entertainment industry, the Storyteller team is perfectly placed to bring Stories as a service to the world’s biggest businesses &#8211; and the small ones as well,&#8221; he adds.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Too much bullshit that is bad for the planet gets shrugged off under the protective armor of preserving shareholder value.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taking a small detour today from traditional Exchange topics &#8212; we&#8217;ll get to some IPO news later on &#8212; to talk briefly about climate, climate tech and pessimism.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/here-for-influencer-branded-mac-and-cheese/">on the podcast</a>, the Equity crew spent a bit of time digging into the planetwide impacts that our warming world will endure in the coming years &#8212; and the role that startups can play in combating climate change. There are some encouraging companies in the mix, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/droneseeds-36m-a-round-makes-it-a-one-stop-shop-for-post-wildfire-reforestation/">including DroneSeed</a>, which we all rather liked.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>Then again, who doesn&#8217;t like the idea of shooting seed pucks from drones to reseed forests? If you have ever taken part in a tree-planting day, using a drone instead of your hands sounds like a superbrilliant idea. I have done the work by hand and can&#8217;t really recommend it.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">own Kirsten Korosec</a> wrote a long and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech/">rather good dig into the climate tech space</a>, which I recommend reading if you want to get a bit deeper on the subject.</p>
<p>All this is to say: Some startups are working on building companies that can profit while helping combat the rising tides, more frequent fires and more powerful storms that appear set to come our way in the coming decades. Which is to say that kids are going to have a tougher go of life than what you or I have enjoyed. Especially if you are older than I am.</p>
<p>It was in that particular mindset that I ran across a bit of commentary from former Y Combinator boss Sam Altman over the weekend that dug into the climate change issue from the lens of conversations with some younger folks.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1444690487110082565">the set of tweets</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2211882" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-04-at-11.21.01-AM.png?w=589" alt="" width="589" height="658" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-04-at-11.21.01-AM.png 589w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-04-at-11.21.01-AM.png?resize=134,150 134w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-04-at-11.21.01-AM.png?resize=269,300 269w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-04-at-11.21.01-AM.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px" /></p>
<p>There are a few threads in there worth tugging, but we&#8217;re focusing our attention on the youth-pessimism element for now.</p>
<p>Per Altman&#8217;s notes, smart college students are worried about climate change, which they view as both unstoppable and pressing. Per the OpenAI boss, college students are taking personal action &#8212; not having kids &#8212; over pushing for the sort of change that might arrest or reverse climate change. Structural change, I would say.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global users are experiencing outages on Facebook, including all social networks the company owns, which include Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. When navigating to these websites, a server error will appear &#8212; Instagram shows a &#8220;5xx server error,&#8221; which indicates that this is an issue with Facebook&#8217;s servers. Users are also unable to send messages or load new content on the mobile apps for these platforms. Even Oculus, Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebooks-entry-into-vr-advertising-isnt-going-too-well/">virtual reality platform</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/WorkplacefromFB/status/1445059866326933507">Workplace</a>, its business communication tool, are down.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not only are Facebook&#39;s services and apps down for the public, its internal tools and communications platforms, including Workplace, are out as well. No one can do any work. Several people I&#39;ve talked to said this is the equivalent of a &quot;snow day&quot; at the company.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It appears that the outage is caused by a DNS (domain name server) fail &#8212; this is the naming structure that forms the web&#8217;s infrastructure. So, if you try to navigate to facebook.com right now, the internet won&#8217;t know where to find facebook.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based climate tech startup, &#8216;<a href="https://www.madeofair.com">Made of Air</a>&#8216;, has closed a €5 million (~$5.8M) seed funding round, led by Norwegian sustainability-focused family fund, TD Veen.</p>
<p>Also participating are Patrick Pichette (former CFO of Google &amp; chairman of the Board of Twitter), EQT Group, Thomas Von Koch (CEO &amp; cofounder of EQT Group), Tuesday Capital, the co-founders of Pexip, and Olympic gold medalist skier, Aksel Lund Svindal.</p>
<p>As the name (kind of) implies, Made of Air (MoA) is producing durable materials for a variety of use-cases that make use of (pyrolyzed) wood waste in order to lock up carbon for long periods in the resulting, hardened carbon-negative thermoplastic compound. (Which is literally made from biochar and bioplastics).</p>
<p>MoA is intending this carbon sequestration product to offer an alternative to fossil-based thermoplastics for use cases where the material has a long life, and it has some early experimental partnerships with car maker Audi (producing facade panels for an installation on its marquee dealership) and with the fashion chain H&amp;M (creating biomass-based sunglasses, among other experimental projects).</p>
<p>It also has a partnership with an unnamed US-based furniture maker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our feedstock is a biomass waste stream from forestry. So the waste stream that we&#8217;re looking at is from sawdust and small chip sizes from the forestry industry and what&#8217;s happening is in the cut of the trees for timber products &#8212; usually for construction &#8212; you have a lot of products going down stream from that process and we are at the very end of that process,&#8221; explains founder and CEO Allison Dring.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is waste that otherwise is going to be landfilled or gasified or burned, and in all three of those cases you have the loss of the CO2 storage in the material.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the pyrolysis step &#8212; so in the process of making it into biochar &#8212; we&#8217;re actually taking the CO2 that&#8217;s in the material and we&#8217;re converting it into pretty close to an elemental carbon. So in that stuff you actually the lock into a material. It doesn&#8217;t retain in a gas form &#8212; which is a lot of indirect air capture, I think you hear about that &#8212; you have a gas sometimes then you have an issue about what to do with the gas &#8212; here we&#8217;re locked into elemental carbon which doesn&#8217;t go back to CO2.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 2016-founded materials startup has shipped over 10 tons of materials to date to more than four different customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are more strategic partners looking to decarbonize their supply chain with our carbon-negative materials,&#8221; says Dring. &#8220;Industries with the highest emission reduction needs are the built environment, automotive/mobility, and consumer goods.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there can be environmental and other concerns attached to the biomass industry &#8212; such as if trees that wouldn&#8217;t otherwise be cut down are chopped down just to burn for energy or that crops which could be used for food are instead burnt for fuel &#8212; Dring says they are not using biomass from non-forestry trees that could would otherwise not be cut down and could be left to continue capturing carbon as they grow.</p>
<p>She also notes that the material they produce can be created from other types of biomass.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re looking at is that waste stream right now. Obviously we can do this with other biomass waste streams. We&#8217;re looking at how we can regionalize it,&#8221; she tells TechCrunch. &#8220;So it&#8217;s not about relying on one type &#8212; we can do this process with any plant material that has photosynthesized. What we don&#8217;t want to do is interrupt or cause any fluctuation in the food supply, so we don&#8217;t want to &#8212; by our demand for our product &#8212; create a monocrop on the other side for agriculture.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we are looking at non-food supplies or some kind of feedstock that comes from food waste that&#8217;s plentiful. So we look at the bush around coffee beans, for example &#8212; the woody, biomass waste from that is one potential waste stream. Or it could be like rice hulls or it could be the tomato stems. These kind of very good, high carbon content waste streams that we can hybridize so that we don&#8217;t cause a run on tomatoes for example.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We essentially try to look at it as there&#8217;s a natural process in the CO2 going back into the air as the biomass starts to decompose and what we&#8217;re doing is interrupting that cycle &#8212; to save the CO2 from going back in the air,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;And we can do that with these waste streams especially from wood really because the wood industry is an industry and the idea that carbon is stored in wood, and these products can be useful for example in building applications where you have a lifetime of sometimes 30, 50 years &#8212; we see that&#8217;s an industry that deserves to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making use of more timber in construction is one potential way to replace high CO2 materials like steel, she suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is an industry that we&#8217;re okay with taking up the waste &#8212; and as we scale up our model we think about what happens if the wood industry scales up and this is actually a good thing in terms of carbon storage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dring says MoA is aiming for its biomass-based thermoplastic to have the &#8220;typical fire resistant properties&#8221; expected from paneling materials in the building environment (both interior and exterior).</p>
<p>&#8220;This applies to mechanical properties as well,&#8221; she also notes. &#8220;In the built environment, we also look to replace other non-structural materials in addition to thermoplastics. In general, our materials target equal or superior performance to their fossil thermoplastic counterparts depending on use cases and aim to be drop-in ready for existing forming processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup is not aiming for the biomass-derived material to be used in fast moving consumer goods or single use consumer products (like water bottles, coffee cup lids etc); rather the material is designed for &#8220;durability&#8221; and intended as a replacement for &#8220;high emissions thermoplastics&#8221;.</p>
<p>So the types of potential products it could be used for are things like furniture, interior/exterior panelling, car dashboards and &#8216;closed-loop-products&#8217; used by businesses within their own supply chains, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210590" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210590" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210590" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unnamed-11.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unnamed-11.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unnamed-11.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unnamed-11.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unnamed-11.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unnamed-11.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unnamed-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/unnamed-11.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210590" class="wp-caption-text">Exterior panelling using Made of Air&#8217;s material on Audi&#8217;s flagship showroom (Image credits: Made of Air)</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is carbon removal rather than just reduced emissions&#8221;, says Dring. &#8220;The compounds that we&#8217;re making are not biodegradable so these are durable thermoplastics that we&#8217;re making.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way that we&#8217;re seeing it is they&#8217;re a method for storing carbon in products but what we want are products with very long lifetimes &#8212; as long as we can&#8230; It&#8217;s about 50% of the plastic market is here and if you have biodegradables on one side, handling disposable products, there&#8217;s a lot of tech going on there; it&#8217;s very interesting. On the durable side manufacturers don&#8217;t have a lot of alternatives that are sustainable so this is the area that we&#8217;re looking at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In our business model we are buying the feedstock and we&#8217;re just setting the precedent for how biomass streams are treated. We&#8217;re anticipating that a lot of our resources are moving from below ground to above ground and there is going to be an inherent value in these biomass streams and we&#8217;re just starting with what&#8217;s there,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>The cost to MoA&#8217;s customers of buying the material varies per use-case, according to Dring.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are differentiating according to product application,&#8221; she says, noting that the startup is only now heading into its first pilot production line (&#8220;so our prices are still a bit higher than where they will be when we&#8217;re at scale&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, just to give you a range in terms of thermoplastics, we&#8217;re between a fossil-plastic and a bioplastic in price. And obviously in scale we&#8217;re heading towards the fossil plastic to be competitive there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The end of life scenario for MoA&#8217;s material is also potentially a novel one. So where fossil-based thermoplastics can cause lasting environmental pollution, as they do not biodegrade and the economics around recycling can be challenging, Dring says its biomass-based material could be ground down and returned to the earth at the end of life.</p>
<p>Although of course it&#8217;s industry practice and consumer habit, not what&#8217;s theoretically possible, that will dictate what really happens to its pyrolyzed wood waste at the end of a product&#8217;s lifespan.</p>
<p>Dring says the startup&#8217;s product &#8220;is an entirely circular material&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a thermoplastic so basically at the end of life the products can be collected, they be ground down and reformed &#8212; so it really behaves like other plastics in that way. What&#8217;s special about our material vs those plastics is what we have is a pathway to the ground at the true end of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;So these products, after use cycles, can be ground down and actually put back in the ground and this is very significant for us, it&#8217;s significant for our partners &#8212; because what that essentially means is we&#8217;ve taken the carbon out of the ground 150 years ago we&#8217;ve pumped it up into the air, we&#8217;ve captured it through biomass, we&#8217;ve put it to work in a product and essentially we&#8217;re returning it to the ground. So this is the end of the carbon loop&#8230; and we think there aren&#8217;t many technologies that can do that permanently &#8212; and this is one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have products with these lifetimes &#8212; ten to fifty years &#8212; we have more of a chance to actually put the carbon to work,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;So we can take it out of the air and we can actually embed it in those products and then we have, yes, questions about what happens at the end of life but we have more time to work that out and we will have averted, for many years, more harmful products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course true circularity is still &#8220;a long way off&#8221; &#8212; and will require a whole village, not just a single startup with a novel material.</p>
<p>&#8220;We still have a lot of work to do with industry, to figure out how take-back works, and how we can collect waste at the end of a lifetime of a product and how we can safely do this thing &#8212; putting it back in the ground &#8212; but the potential is there, the pathway is there&#8230; There are lots of challenges &#8212; the biggest thing is we&#8217;re one company and the parallel I like to use is that you don&#8217;t want one company cleaning the plastics out of the ocean. You really need a joined up effort. And that&#8217;s very much how we see it,&#8221; says Dring.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a technology that&#8217;s capable of doing this &#8212; but we need support from partners, we need policy, we need waste collection, we also need consumer behavior &#8212; all of these things to join together to start to reformulate how we think about the end of a product&#8217;s life. And I think we&#8217;re kind of getting there with circularity [and the circular economy] and I think that&#8217;s an amazing step in thinking &#8212; and a lot in waste collection is changing because of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re asking is the next version beyond that &#8212; how do we de-cycle materials out of our system that can very rightly go in the ground? I can&#8217;t name how many challenges there are in there but I think there&#8217;s real momentum to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed funding round in a statement, Kjell Skappel, CEO of TD Veen, said: “We are really impressed by what Allison, Daniel and the rest of the <span class="il">Made</span> of <span class="il">Air</span> team has accomplished to date and are proud to have led the round. We are convinced that the demand for carbon negative materials will grow substantially in the foreseeable future as industries look to lower their carbon footprint and future proof their supply chains.”</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Pichette added: “With my personal experience in the forestry industry, it is clear that <span class="il">Made</span> of <span class="il">Air</span>’s potential for impact at scale is immense given the volume of feedstock materials available.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredspa/">Jared Spataro</a> has been with Microsoft for more than 15 years now, and he has been part of the transition from an on-prem software company to a SaaS business. Today his official title is corporate vp in charge of the company&#8217;s biggest SaaS product, Office 365. Spataro is going to join us on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=microsoftpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=microsoftpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 27th at TC Sessions: SaaS</a> to talk about how his company made that grand transition successfully.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365">Microsoft Office 365</a> encompasses a variety of tooling including Teams, the company&#8217;s collaboration platform, Outlook email and OneDrive storage along with the Microsoft Office suite of productivity tools &#8212; Word, PowerPoint and Excel. There&#8217;s so much more too including PowerBI, Yammer and SharePoint to name but a few.</p>
<p>The division, which encompasses Office 365 and other online products, Productivity and Business,  accounted for more than $14 billion <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2021-q4/press-release-webcast">in revenue in Q4 2021</a>. While not all of that came from Office 365, and Microsoft doesn&#8217;t really break it down much further, it did account for a good chunk of income for the software giant.</p>
<p>When Spataro joined the company back in 2006, he worked on the company&#8217;s content management product, SharePoint. He was Senior Director of that product in 2011 when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/25/its-official-microsoft-confirms-it-has-acquired-yammer-for-1-2-billion-in-cash/">the company bought Yammer for $1.2 billion</a>, a move that really helped the company begin that transition and Spataro was at the center of that.</p>
<p>In those days, Microsoft would release new versions of SharePoint every three years, an immense new version with all the new bells and whistles, but most customers wouldn&#8217;t upgrade because they had a previous version that they had customized and weren&#8217;t about to do anything to put that at risk.</p>
<p>Microsoft was spending years on product development and many existing customers weren&#8217;t getting the benefits of the latest and greatest version. When the company bought Yammer, they acquired a company with a continuous delivery methodology and the Yammer team brought an entirely new modern development approach to Microsoft.</p>
<p>When Satya Nadella<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/04/microsofts-new-ceo-is-officially-satya-nadella/"> took over as CEO in 2014</a>, the company went all-in on the cloud just as Spartaro was moving to the Office side of the house as General Manager. There he oversaw the company&#8217;s transition from boxed software to Office 365 SaaS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re going to talk to him about that transition and what it meant to the way software was produced and sold and his role in helping Microsoft make that massive transformation.</p>
<p>In addition to our discussion with Spataro, the conference will also include Google’s Javier Soltero, Monte Carlo&#8217;s Barr Moses, as well as investors Sarah Guo and Kobie Fuller, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a thought-provoking lineup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Qualcomm scored the purchase of Swedish automotive tech company Veoneer, nudging out Magna International with a higher bid.</p>
<p>Qualcomm and investment group SSW Partners said Monday they would acquire Veoneer for $37 per share in an all-cash transaction. At closing, SSW said it would sell Veoneer’s Arriver tech – an advanced driver assistance system stack that includes sensors and software – to Qualcomm and retain the Swedish company’s other Tier 1 supplier businesses.</p>
<p>Veoneer had previous agreed to sell itself to Magna. It looked like that deal would move forward, until Qualcomm submitted its bid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/qualcomm-wants-to-buy-veoneer-for-4-6b-beating-magnas-offer/">for $800 million, or 18%, more</a>. Magna, which has a market capitalization of $25.3 billion compared to Qualcomm’s $164.8 billion, did not submit a counterbid.</p>
<p>This is not Qualcomm’s first major acquisition this year. The company, which is chiefly known for designing and manufacturing semiconductors and telecommunications equipment, is branching out. In January, Qualcomm agreed to acquire high-performance computing startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/two-year-old-nuvia-sells-to-qualcomm-for-1-4-billion/">Nuvia for $1.4 billion</a>, as it sought out markets beyond telecoms. This latest purchase is especially bullish news for ADAS technology, which automakers are starting to roll out in new vehicles as a matter of course.</p>
<p>When Qualcomm submitted its bid to acquire Veoneer &#8212; nearly a month after Magna&#8217;s &#8212; it was not entirely a surprise. The two companies signed a collaborative agreement at the beginning of this year to develop software and chips for driver-assistance systems.</p>
<p>Veoneer will pay Magna a “breakup fee” of $110 million. The deal is expected to close next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://stableprice.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an insurtech aiming to help minimize a businesses’ risk due to volatile commodity prices, today announced it has raised $46.5 million in a Series A round of funding led by Greycroft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notion Capital, Anthemis, Continental Grain and existing backers Syngenta and Ascot also participated in the financing, which brings the Chicago-based startup’s total raised to about $50 million since its 2016 inception. Anthemis led its $3.5 million seed round in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder Richard Counsell is the son of a farmer and a former trader. When growing up, he saw firsthand how the volatility of commodity prices could have devastating impacts. His goal with Stable is to help “millions of businesses that are exposed to volatile commodity prices to manage the risk in a simple and effective way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Stable wants to give businesses &#8212; particularly those in the $8 trillion food and farming industry &#8212; a way to purchase insurance to protect themselves from potential volatility in commodity prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup is on track to reach $500 million of annual premium within three years of launch, which, according to Greycroft Partner Ian Sigalow, could make it “the fastest growing insurtech ever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counsell said he wanted to found Stable after he realized how little innovation the industry has seen since 1848 when the Chicago Board of Trade opened its doors with a mission to provide buyers and sellers of crops financial certainty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I set about creating a platform that combines modern tools like machine learning (AI), great UX and a clear and client-focused purpose to get back to our industry’s grassroots and become relevant again for businesses with a real risk to manage,” he said. “When trading shares on platforms like Robinhood has never been easier, why should it feel like you need a PhD to hedge your commodity risk?”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s parametric platform hosts more than 5,000 third-party indexes from 70 countries that can be used to purchase a policy to protect against an unexpected price rise or fall. Clients can select an index to customize a contract. Payouts are automated and reference the local or highly correlated index to minimize basis risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable uses an index to simplify the risk transfer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Instead of having to work out the exact loss the company has faced we use an index as a proxy,” Counsell said. “So if you use an index the more the index is correlated to your actual risk the better. That’s why we have 5,000+ indexes &#8212; so we can create an index-based contract that is super precise and accurately reflects the client’s real risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other big advantage of using an index, he said, is that claims can be completely automated and no claims process is needed as it’s all agreed in advance &#8212; referencing the index they have chosen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So if the index is currently $100 and the client is a food buyer &#8212; they might know they lose money if the index reaches $120,” Counsell explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable charges a premium and then provides a “payout” if the index goes higher than $120 in that case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our payment replaces the client’s lost income and provides the financial stability they are looking for,” Counsell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agricultural commodities are perishable and come in all shapes, grades and sizes, which makes them “very hard” to standardize and trade on an exchange, noted Counsell. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The result is that only 8% of commodities are available to trade on the likes of the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), which makes purchasing risk management products such as futures or options contracts difficult without enormous basis risk,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the agrifood industry alone, more than $5 trillion of untraded commodity exposures are currently self insured, according to Counsell. Businesses that want to just protect their risk rather than trade or speculate might find hedging to be complex, risky or intimidating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve used a pretty sophisticated kind of machine learning to find the price of that risk, or the index rising or falling, and that took us three and a half years to do,” Counsell told TechCrunch. “We run like 62 trillion simulations every day to manage this and look for a price that is fair for the clients but also fair for the capital providers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major disruptions to the food chain, which has made manufacturers and producers even more aware of potential risks, Counsell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a smoothie maker typically sells its product to a grocery store chain for a fixed price of $1 a can and the price of mangoes (which can be up to 50% of the cost) fluctuates a lot &#8212; Stable will pay the difference of anything that goes over 20%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just gives more certainty over the future,” Counsell said. “Whether they’re on the producer side, or buying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable has operations in Chicago, Austin, New York City and London. It plans to use its new capital to build out its North American sales and marketing teams and hire data scientists, particularly in New York and London. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable won regulatory approval earlier this year and as such is now starting to work with many large food businesses in the U.S., as well as farming organizations wishing to protect against future price falls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, Stable plans to expand into other sectors such as packaging, construction/timber and energy and geographically to Central and South America. Because the company is able to serve both producers and consumers of commodities, it “looks set to be popular in tractors as well as treasury departments in the months and years to come,” according to Counsell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50-person company is a regulated insurance business that works with “A-rated” re-insurers to take on the risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re just a technology platform. Our job is to find as many businesses as we can that need help, price the risk, manage their portfolio, reinsure all of that risk and pass on all that risk,” Counsell told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes money as if it were a broker, by charging a fixed commission for the business it brings back to its re-insurers.</span></p>
<p>Stable&#8217;s insurers are bullish about the company&#8217;s potential.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthemis’ Ruth Foxe Blader said she was drawn to Stable since it is so rare to have the opportunity to invest in “a truly new product.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stable is not just a better mousetrap,” she wrote via email. “It is a completely innovative way to conceive of protection against price movements in untraded commodities. Bespoke commodity price insurance did not exist before Stable launched this year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stable harnesses an “enormous” amount of index data to create “simple” protection products for clients with exposure to commodity price volatility,” Blader added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the models are, individually, fairly straightforward, and therefore insurable, the sheer data science and machine learning horsepower within each Stable product was inconceivable even a few years ago,” she said. “The result is a simple, perfectly adapted commodity price insurance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Greycroft’s Sigalow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was impressed by Counsell’s “unique perspective” on the crop insurance market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He assembled an amazing team of data scientists and subject matter experts, and we felt that this market could be hundreds of billions in premium annually,” he said. It also fit in well alongside Greycroft&#8217;s other insurance investments &#8212; such as Bright Health, Branch Insurance and Pie Insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked how Stable compares to other similar offerings, Sigalow said he knew of none.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I haven’t seen this before in my career,” he told TechCrunch, “but when we called customers they would tell us that there were no substitutes and it was a total blue ocean.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Measuring growth is complex and challenging — and it’s only getting tougher. Changes to attribution in iOS 14 have forced growth marketers to rethink how they define their growth analytics engines.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s said that you should measure what you value, and for founders, nothing is more valuable than growth. Growth provides revenues, venture capital, prestige and scale — ultimately driving the success of every business. Yet, measuring growth is complex and challenging — and it’s only getting tougher. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Changes to attribution in iOS 14</a> and further refinements in iOS 15, plus other privacy-preserving initiatives in the industry, have forced growth marketers to rethink how they define their growth analytics engines.</p>
<p>On the Extra Crunch stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a>, we convened a distinguished panel of growth experts: Jenifer Ho, vice president of marketing at Elation Health; Shoji Ueki, head of marketing and analytics at Point; and Nik Sharma, the owner of Sharma Brands, a notable DTC growth marketing consultancy and investment shop.</p>
<p>We talked about the crisis around attribution and how startups should define their models, how to acquire the first customers in a business and when growth marketing should really start, and finally, how companies should select the right metrics for their business.</p>
<h2 id="The fundamentals of growth marketing: building the attribution model">The fundamentals of growth marketing: Building the attribution model</h2>
<p>Our conversation started with a deep dive into the world of attribution, which is a hot topic for growth marketers these days. Attribution is all about connecting marketing spend on channels like Facebook and Google to actual purchase actions made by a customer. If you display an Instagram ad for shovels, and that user then buys a shovel two days later, attribution models are designed to capture that activity.</p>
<p>Purchasing decisions can be quite involved for businesses and consumers, which is why defining attribution is so important for a startup’s success. When it comes to how to model it, Ueki emphasized one word to describe all aspects of attribution: Simplicity.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think one of the main things I&#8217;ve learned from experiences with attribution is that it&#8217;s really important to start basic and simple and then try to evolve from there. I’ve definitely been in companies where we&#8217;ve made that mistake before.</p>
<p>The example I like to give is, if you think about attribution, it’s a vehicle. It&#8217;s really enticing to try to build that Ferrari of attribution systems, but a lot of times when you&#8217;re just starting out, all you really need is a skateboard, right? It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s simple, and it gets the job done.</p>
<p>One example from a few years ago at SeatGeek: We tried to build a media-mix model before we had something much more basic in place. We invested a lot of time and effort into that with our data science team, but after all of that, it was actually never used and never adopted.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the ultimate goal of attribution is to measure incrementality, or how much incremental revenue is being generated by your marketing efforts. A complex media-mix model or multitouch attribution model is intended to do that, but it&#8217;s hard to do it right. For us, we had built one that actually didn&#8217;t serve that need of measuring your incrementality as much as possible. <em><b>(Timestamp: 2:48)<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volvo Cars, the Swedish carmaker owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding, said Monday it would file for an initial public offering and list on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, in a transaction that&#8217;s expected to raise up to $2.9 billion (25 billion Swedish kroner).</p>
<p>The deal could value the automaker at up to $25 billion, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/volvo-cars-unveils-plan-to-list-in-stockholm-11633346350">The Wall Street Journal reported</a>, citing sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>While Geely will sell a certain number of its shares, according to a press release, Volvo said the Chinese company will remain its largest shareholder following the deal; its Swedish institutional shareholders, Folksam and AMF, will also remain. In a statement, the Swedish automaker added that its relationship with Geely &#8212; and other companies in Geely’s ecosystem &#8212; “allows it to benefit from sharing existing and future technology, coordination of procurement and economies of scale to achieve synergies, competitiveness and deliver long-term value.”</p>
<p>Volvo made a voluntary commitment to shift its entire lineup to electric by 2030, with 50% of its sales volume to be electric by the middle of the decade. The proceeds from the IPO will go toward accelerating its transition to full electric “even in case of a weakening market environment,” the automaker said.</p>
<p>The news reinforces just how far Volvo has come over the past 11 years, after Ford Motor sold it at a major loss to Geely for $1.8 billion in 2010. (Ford had purchased the Swedish automaker for $6.5 billion in 1999.) Since its purchase by Geely, Volvo has undergone a major expansion, building two vehicle assembly facilities in China and a factory in South Carolina. In June, Volvo said it would invest another $118 million into its South Carolina plant.</p>
<p>The turnaround is reflected in its sales. On Friday, Volvo reported a 17.6% increase in sales for the first nine months of this year, compared to the same period in 2020.</p>
<p>Volvo’s intention to go public comes on the heels of news from EV maker Polestar that it would merge with a special purpose acquisition company in a deal valued at $20 billion. Polestar, an arm of Volvo Car’s electric brands, is also owned by Geely. It seems likely that the timing is not a coincidence; according to WSJ reporting, the Polestar SPAC assigned a value of around $10 billion to Volvo’s stake in the company, paving the way for Volvo’s IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix is today officially launching a new feature for its Android users that will make it easier to find something to watch when you can&#8217;t make a decision. The feature, called &#8220;Play Something,&#8221; is a shuffle mode option that will play another movie or show Netflix believes you may like, based on your interests and your prior viewing behavior.</p>
<p>These selections may include a movie or show you&#8217;re already watching but haven&#8217;t completed, a movie or show on your watch list or a brand-new series or film that Netflix&#8217;s personalization algorithms suggest, among other things.</p>
<p>The feature had been in development for some time before its public release. Last year, for example, Netflix was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/netflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen/">testing</a> it as &#8220;Shuffle Play.&#8221; And in its Q4 2020 earnings, Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflixs-shuffle-play-feature-will-roll-out-to-all-users-worldwide-this-year/">said</a> it would roll out its shuffle mode to users worldwide during the first half of 2021, describing it as a way to &#8220;instantly watch a title&#8221; that was chosen just for the user.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211814" style="width: 456px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211814" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2211814 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?w=446" alt="" width="446" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png 5829w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=768,1171 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=446,680 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=1008,1536 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=1343,2048 1343w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Play-Something-Home-Screen.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211814" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>That rollout schedule was partially realized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Play Something,&#8221; as the feature was rebranded to, officially<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/netflix-launches-its-shuffle-feature-now-called-play-something-to-users-worldwide/"> launched to worldwide users on Netflix&#8217;s TV app</a> back in April. Here, the option can be found in several places, including on the profile selection screen underneath your profile name, on the navigation menu to the left of your screen and on the tenth row on your Netflix homepage &#8212; a location that&#8217;s meant to appear right at the point where you&#8217;re beginning to get frustrated with browsing and may have otherwise exited the app. In addition, Netflix users with screen-readers could also use Text-to-Speech (TTS) to use &#8220;Play Something.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company said at the time it would soon start testing the feature on mobile devices, starting with Android. It then began those tests in late May.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, you may very well have had the feature on your own Android device long before this &#8220;official&#8221; debut &#8212; but not all Netflix users globally have been able to try it yet.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s now changing, as Netflix is officially bringing &#8220;Play Something&#8221; to all Android mobile devices worldwide, with the rollout that starts today. The company says it will test the feature on iOS in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p>
<p>On mobile, the &#8220;Play Something&#8221; button hovers over the content at the bottom of the phone&#8217;s screen as you scroll and also has its own dedicated tab in the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211815" style="width: 456px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211815" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2211815" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?w=446" alt="" width="446" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png 5829w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=768,1171 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=446,680 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=1008,1536 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=1343,2048 1343w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/US-English-Home-Screen-Kids-2.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211815" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix</p></div></p>
<p>User response to the addition, so far, has been positive, Netflix noted &#8212; even pointing to a few tweets where <a href="https://twitter.com/jengolbeck/status/1370218863741304840?s=20">people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/xxcarinaxx_/status/1379630999932387328?s=20">praised</a> the feature.</p>
<p>But for Netflix, the shuffle mode feature isn&#8217;t only about giving users another, easier way to watch &#8212; it&#8217;s a means of retaining users in the app before they jump to another entertainment option, whether that&#8217;s a rival streamer or even a social media app for video, like TikTok.</p>
<p>In fact, the threat from short-form video is serious enough that Netflix recently built its own TikTok-like feature for its mobile app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">called &#8220;Fast Laughs</a>,&#8221; which shows a feed of comedy videos meant to drive users to its content. Putting harder numbers to this potential threat, TikTok, at an event last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/merryh/status/1443037796613058566">noted</a> that 35% of its users were watching less TV due to TikTok, citing <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/business/en-US/blog/time-well-spent">data from its own research.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Play Something&#8221; joins other newer additions as well, including a smart downloads feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/netflix-launches-downloads-for-you-a-new-feature-that-automatically-downloads-content-youll-like/">&#8220;Downloads for You</a>&#8221; and support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-partial-downloads-launch-android-130054347.html">partial play downloads</a>, as well as last year&#8217;s addition of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/new-netflix-feature-reveals-the-top-10-most-popular-programs-on-its-service/"> Top 10 list</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that a lot of startups are trying to help developers reduce the complexity involved in coding an app. Last week we covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/runx-announces-4-1m-seed-to-simplify-cloud-infrastructure-deployment-for-developers/">the seed round for RunX</a>, a company that helps developers code back-end cloud resources more quickly. Today, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/wasp">Y Combinator Winter 2021</a> graduate <a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/">Wasp</a> announced a $1.5 million seed round to help programmers code the business logic side of the application faster.</p>
<p>Lunar Ventures and HV Capital co-led the round with help from 468 Capital, Tokyo Black, Acequia Capital, Abstraction Capital and a slew of individual angels.</p>
<p>Wasp CEO Matija Sosic said that he started the company in Croatia in 2019 with his twin brother Martin because they wanted to make it easier for developers to stitch together a group of services into a full stack web application. They ease this process by providing a configuration layer on top of whatever coding language developers are already using, such as React or Node.js.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a very high level Wasp is a simple language for building full stack applications with less code and with the best practices [built in],&#8221; Sosic told me. &#8220;We want to provide a unified experience for developers, and we think that is one of the biggest values [of our solution] because they don&#8217;t have to assemble everything and [piece] different solutions together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like RunX, Wasp is an open source tool that&#8217;s available for free to any developer who wants to use it, and so far quite a few have, with Sosic reporting around 300 apps that have been built using Wasp. For now they want to concentrate on the open source side of things and get the tooling right before they consider how they will generate revenue, but that is the eventual goal.</p>
<p>Sosic and his brother launched the company a couple of years ago with their own money. After releasing an early version of Wasp on Product Hunt at the beginning of this year, they started getting some initial interest, eventually getting into Y Combinator and scoring their seed round to continue developing the product.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product is in alpha at the moment, and available for <a href="https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp">download at GitHub</a>. The plan is to use this money to add features, get to beta and eventually release version 1.0 of the product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Life insurance has had a new lease on life in the era of insuretech, and today one of the companies building a business out of rethinking everything &#8212; from target customers through to how to provision and pay for insurance, and how much coverage to give &#8212; is announcing some funding on the back of strong growth. <a href="https://www.ladderlife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ladder</a>, which providers flexible term life insurance policies providing coverage ranging from $100,000 to $8 million, has raised $100 million in equity funding, a Series D that values the company at $900 million.</p>
<p>At a time when mortality is perhaps more present than usual to the average person &#8212; thanks, COVID-19 &#8212; Ladder has had a really strong year, with revenues growing four-fold (exact amount undisclosed). The Palo Alto-based startup, which operates in the U.S. only, is on track to issue $30 billion in coverage by the end of this year.</p>
<p>(The company&#8217;s valuation is also a measure of that 4x growth: <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/120964-60/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook estimates</a> that in its last fundraise, in 2020, it was valued at around $238 million.)</p>
<p>Thomvest Ventures and OMERS Growth Equity co-led the Series D, and the company is not disclosing who else is in the round. Previous backers include strategics like the venture arms of Allianz Life and Northwestern Mutual, along with RRE, Canaan Partners, Lightspeed and others.</p>
<p>A wave of startups have emerged in the last several years with a mission to rethink the insurance model. Tapping into some of the same trends we are seeing in fintech, companies are leaning on technology built by others and embedding functionality by way of APIs to provide tools to people to find and get pricing for insurance policies.</p>
<p>Their unique selling points become easier-to-use interfaces on the web and via apps; a wider range of options in terms of pricing and coverage; and using algorithms and other new technology to produce quotes, close deals and initiate coverage much faster.</p>
<p>They are also targeting new demographics &#8212; for example <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/hedvig-banks-45m-to-expand-its-millennial-focused-insurance-service-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hedvig in Europe</a>, which is focused on providing insurance services primarily to people under the age of 30. Others include the likes of Lemonade; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/marshmallow-insurance-85-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marshmallow</a> in the U.K. rethinking inclusive car insurance; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/yulife-nabs-70m-at-a-346m-valuation-for-its-gamified-wellness-oriented-approach-to-life-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YuLife</a> presenting life insurance as a gamified, wellness-focused offering; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/bima-nabs-30m-more-for-micro-health-and-life-insurance-aimed-at-emerging-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bima</a> targeting emerging markets; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/ethos-picks-up-100m-at-a-2-7b-valuation-for-a-big-data-platform-to-improve-life-insurance-accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethos</a> lowering the barrier to entry for getting life insurance products; and so on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By providing flexible term policies that can be searched for and purchased online, Ladder&#8217;s approach is in the same realm as many of these, with the added critical detail that it is vertically integrated, building not just user-friendly and modern interfaces and the risk-based algorithms that determine pricing, but also the underwriting, instant issue and policy administration.</p>
<p>As with other vertically integrated approaches, this may give Ladder more operational overhead, but also potentially provides it with significantly more control around how it designs policies, how it can implement updates and changes, and of course in the long term, the margins it makes on sales, or conversely the savings it can pass to users. Ladder today claims to provide 40% savings to users compared to others on the market.</p>
<p>“I know first hand how life insurance can change a life,” said Jamie Hale, CEO and co-founder at Ladder, in a statement. “With our carrier in operation and this new round of funding, we are in the position to greatly accelerate innovation in service of families and communities. I am so excited to see our original vision continue to materialize.”</p>
<p>“The world is only becoming more digital, not less, and the life insurance industry to-date has been slow to modernize,” said Don Butler, MD, Thomvest Ventures, in a statement. “We are excited to invest in Ladder’s vision to build the digital life insurance company of tomorrow, and their announcement today that they are the first in operation shows that they are outpacing the industry.”</p>
<p>“Jamie Hale and his visionary management team are building Ladder into an innovative, market-leading digital life insurance company,” added Saar Pikar, MD and fintech lead, OMERS Growth Equity. “We are very pleased to count Ladder as OMERS Growth Equity’s first direct fintech investment – as well as our entry in the insurtech space, expanding on the insurtech presence established by our OMERS Ventures colleagues. We believe that the company offers a truly transformative approach, including through its efficient adjudication of risk and enhanced user experience.&#8221;</p>

Contrary to rumors, the overall battery life hasn’t improved (rated at 18 hours), but charging is now 33% faster.</p>

<p>Apple continues to <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/smartwatch-market-grows-27-yoy-q2-2021-apple-watch-user-base-crosses-100-million/">dominate global smartwatch market share</a>, leading chief competitors like Google and Samsung to combine forces on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-a-well-rounded-smartwatch/">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, which leverages both Wear OS and Tizen.
