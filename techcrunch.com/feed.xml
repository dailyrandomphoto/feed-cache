										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African automotive company <a href="https://autochek.africa/">Autochek</a> has secured a $13.1 million seed round almost a year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/">after raising $3.4 million pre-seed</a> in November 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, led by CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/etop-ikpe-38aa8853/">Etop Ikpe</a>, has seen astonishing growth in demand since launching in August last year, not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a consumer perspective but also from its business and banking partners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And who else to lead the seed round other than pan-African VC firms TLcom Capital and 4DX Ventures &#8212; the same investors that had the conviction to lead the startup’s pre-seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other existing investors, such as Golden Palm Investments, Enza Capital and Lateral Capital, invested as well. First-time </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investors ASK Capital and Mobility 54 Investment SAS, the venture capital arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group, also participated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In total, Autochek has raised $16.5 million in two financing rounds.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223720" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Ikpe spoke to TechCrunch last month, the company had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/nigerias-autochek-acquires-cheki-kenya-and-uganda-from-roam-africa/"> finalized the acquisition</a> of Cheki’s businesses in Kenya and Uganda from Ringier One Africa Media (ROAM). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal closed almost a year after Autochek bought Cheki Ghana and Cheki Nigeria to start its business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although acquisitions have made up all the company’s expansion strategy to this point, it did not take that route into the Ivory Coast &#8212; it partnered with CFAO Group to bring its marketplace to the Francophone region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion takes the number of African markets in which Autochek is present to five. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa’s used car market is a $45 billion industry, where the vehicle penetration rate stands at a meager 5%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And because the market lacks transparency, lenders (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banks) have found it challenging to offer loans to individuals, commercial or ride-hailing drivers.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria&#8217;s Autochek acquires Cheki Kenya and Uganda from ROAM Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/nigerias-autochek-acquires-cheki-kenya-and-uganda-from-roam-africa/embed/#?secret=QENppnlKjb" data-secret="QENppnlKjb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autochek’s platform operates a marketplace-driven model with a focus on financing and after-sales. Its primary customers? Dealerships, banks and the end consumers (those who buy cars on the platform).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a dealership signs up on the platform, Autochek assigns a workshop to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">commence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> inspections on the vehicles owned by the dealership</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The assessments and some algorithmic checks on Autochek’s system help to give a sense of the status and condition of the car, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">determining whether it is in a state to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be financed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the big risk for the banks because they do not want a situation where they finance a car and the next day, the engine knocks,” said Ikpe explaining why Autochek goes through these processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After inspection, Autochek alerts all the banks on its platform that the vehicle is ready to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be financed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and moves it to the marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Following an extensive review, the banks respond with their offers. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he end-user then has a pool of financing rates from the banks to choose from and can apply to buy the car after Autochek develops a credit profile</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The loan application process takes about 48 hours, down from an industry standard of 40-45 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sorted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Autochek supports the banks in disbursement and ensuring that the vehicle </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is registered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, insured and tracked. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the car gets fed into Autochek’s after-sales network, where it gets maintained for free whenever mechanical issues come up</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autochek makes money by charging customers and banks a fee after a successful disbursement and commissions from dealerships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there for the banks and customers at the point of disbursal; we stay with them throughout the lifecycle of the loan,” said Ikpe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We’ve built that ecosystem using technology to stitch all these various verticals together so that at the end of the day, we can create more value with financing being our core driver within the platform.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria’s Autochek raises $3.4M for car sales and service platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/nigerias-autochek-raises-3-4m-for-car-sales-and-service-platform/embed/#?secret=BNsKVUyMZT" data-secret="BNsKVUyMZT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year when Autochek announced its pre-seed round, it had 12 bank partnerships. That number has increased to about 70 banks, such as Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa and NCBA Bank. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These banks have processed more than 46,000 loan applications to date; this number was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 10 last November, the company said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Autochek worked with only used cars. But the company has since launched a financing product for trucks and new cars. More than 1,200 dealerships use Autochek’s network and over 15,000 financeable vehicles are on the marketplace across all markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ikpe asserts that introducing these new verticals came from the demand from its partner banks, who have been integral to where the company sets up shop on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in some cases, despite seeming demand and the presence of a partner bank, Ikpe says Autochek has declined to move into new markets where it did not perceive potential at that moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> settled in West and East Africa, Autochek has its sights set northward and southward on the continent &#8212; Egypt and South Africa to be precise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are speaking to a few partners around </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">potentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how we can make entry and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between now and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">probably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Q2 next year, we would have kind of identified the best kind of product-market fit for those markets. But we expect that by Q3, we should have a presence in those markets,” said Ikpe, who was the co-founder and chief executive at Jiji subsidiary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/jiji-acquires-cars45-as-it-looks-to-build-a-future-outside-classifieds/">Cars45</a> before <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/12/etop-ikpe-ceo-at-autochek/">starting Autochek</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ikpe’s drive and experience and Autochek’s blitzscaling growth are top of the list on why TLcom Capital re-invested in the one-year-old company, according to partner Andreata Muforo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Walter Baddoo, managing partner at 4DX Ventures, it’s that the team has demonstrated “the talent, ambition, and domain expertise needed to build a complete end-to-end car ownership experience for customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, Uber and Bolt dominate the ride-hailing space, leading most mobility startups to tackle vehicle financing and logistics problems instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autochek and other vehicle financing startups like Moove and FlexClub have raised large sums of money, signifying rising investor interests in the space and a maturing competitive landscape.</span></p>
<p>In Autochek’s case, investors’ interest was such that Autochek closed at twice what it initially intended to raise. Frankly, for a business that deals with automotive tech in Africa, that speaks volumes. But then again, Autochek has a fintech element with its financing model. So, its large seed round does not come as a big surprise, considering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/how-fintech-and-serial-founders-drove-african-pre-seed-investing-to-new-heights-in-2020/">how fintech dominates the African VC landscape</a> and holds the record for the highest seed-stage investments from PalmPay, Kuda and PawaPay.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like any startup, Autochek wants to be a market leader. It plans to inject the new capital into bolstering its auto loan processing platform, deepen its footprint in West Africa and, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leverage Toyota Tsusho’s vast retail network across 54 African countries to deepen its expansion further.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chalo, a startup that is digitizing bus commutes in India and which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/chalo-raises-40-million-to-digitize-bus-commutes-in-india/">recently raised $40 million in a financing round</a>, has acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/shuttl-india-bus-aggregator/">Amazon-backed app-based office commute bus aggregator Shuttl</a> in an all-cash deal, the two said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chalo founder and chief executive Mohit Dubey said the acquisition of Shuttl, which operates thousands of buses aimed at working professionals, will help his startup gain presence in many parts of the country including metro cities, broaden the technology and product offerings, and also supercharge the the firm&#8217;s overseas expansion efforts.</p>
<p>“Shuttl and Chalo, these are the firms that are positioned to become the largest mobility firms in the world. I wish the pandemic had not happened, but it has allowed the two companies with a similar focus to come together,” he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223980" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dubey declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal, but said Shuttl co-founder and chief executive Amit Singh has agreed to continue his journey. Chalo will continue to use Shuttl&#8217;s branding, he said.</p>
<p>“We started out to take the pain away from daily commuters. In the process we ended up building a category, and inspiring others from different parts of the world to do the same. It’s a bittersweet moment for us. We believe the team and legacy of Shuttl will thrive equally well in the new set-up,” said Singh in a statement.</p>
<p>For investors of Shuttl, too, it&#8217;s a bittersweet moment. The startup had been struggling to raise a new financing round and had cut its workforce to address the pandemic. For months, murmurs around Shuttl shutting shops were floating.</p>
<p>Shuttl had raised over $97 million in a series of financing rounds, according to data intelligence platform Tracxn. The startup counts Amazon, Times Internet, Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Toyota among its backers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chalo said that the entire current team of Shuttl, including several key executives who have been part of the startup from the beginning, will continue in their roles.</p>
<p>Dubey said he has been engaging with Shuttl&#8217;s Singh for several years, but the two began acquisition talks only two months ago.</p>
<p>At stake is India&#8217;s $20 billion bus market, which is almost twice the size of cabs. Bus commutes are more accessible to the broader masses of the country, but currently there are very few buses in India: about three for every 10,000 people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might have previously thought that <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/?c=en">Ecosia</a> was a nice-to-have search engine that planted trees when you punched-in a search term. Lovely. How nice. But no. Ecosia’s founders and the network around it are far more serious about climate change than that superficial assessment might suggest. Last year in March 2020, just before the world started to close down amid the Pandemic, that network got together and decided enough was enough: a new VC fund was needed to tackle the Climate Crisis in a different way.</p>
<p>So today, <a href="http://worldfund.vc">World Fund</a>, a new Climate Tech VC is launching with a €350 million fund targeting startups building technology that can help decarbonize the planet. World Fund claims its Europe’s largest <em>dedicated</em> climate tech VC.</p>
<p>How did they build that size of a fund that fast? Well, it contains over 60 investors including current and former European tech founders, but also very few institutional LPs, hence why it could raise in such a relatively short time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223532" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Incubated by Ecosia, the fund will focus on energy, transport, food and agriculture, manufacturing, and buildings. As we&#8217;ve seen, the built environment is a huge contributor to CO2. Cities <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/2150-launches-with-281m-fund-to-reduce-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-worlds-growing-cities/">consume</a> over two-thirds of the world’s energy and account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>World Fund’s says its mission will be to save 2 gigatons of emissions by 2040 &#8211; the equivalent to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%20collectively%20emit%20around,were%20around%2035%20billion%20tonnes">4% of all global emissions</a>. This is pretty good for one single firm, although the scale of the issue is enormous, with the world&#8217;s emissions needing to be laved by 2030 for the planet to have a chance of escaping 1.5 degrees warming.</p>
<p>Key to this is using what it calls the Climate Performance Potential (CPP) as a key leading indicator for funding. Each company World Fund backs will need to be able to demonstrate it has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 100 megatonnes CO2e every year, said the firm, as “only companies enabling a decarbonized world can become the most valuable companies of the next decade.”</p>
<p>Danijel Višević, General partner, World Fund said: “Europe urgently needs to stop continuing business as usual, relying on the continued use of fossil fuels. This continent has the research, innovation, and political awareness to lead the world in the fight against climate change. However, until now, there hasn’t been the venture support to ensure these solutions go from idea to success. This is why we’re launching the World Fund, to be the ultimate partner to back the tech entrepreneurs of Europe that will create the most valuable companies of the next decade while tackling the climate crisis.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Doubling down on Europe as a place to make climate tech investors would seem to make sense.</p>
<p>50% more climate tech patents have come from Europe than the US and China <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-028-eib-investment-report-20202021-european-union-is-leading-the-way-in-green-technology-investment">between</a> 2019 and 2020,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/sustainability/publications/state-of-climate-tech-2020.htm">But only €6bn</a> of VC funding went into European companies up to 2013 compared to €25bn and €17bn invested in the US and China respectively.</p>
<p>Plus, according to World Fund’s research, there are 41 funds in North America with more than $100 million assets under management, compared to only six in Europe, and the majority of specific European climate tech VC funds have less than $40m to back disruptive technology. </p>
<p>Furthermore, World Fund says there were more climate tech companies founded in Europe (102) between 2019 and 2021, than the US and China combined (80). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 fund is <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/1f107d76-acbe-11eb-9767-01aa75ed71a1">contributing</a> €33bn to climate-relevant R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Making up the fund will be Tim Schumacher, co-founder of domain marketplace Sedo (and investor in Ecosia, Zolar, gridX, Pachama and CarbonCloud); Danijel Visevic, a former journalist who covered climate tech, startups and venture capital; Daria Saharova, worked at SevenVentures and Holtzbrinck. The team also also includes Craig Douglas, formerly with SET Ventures; and Christian Kroll as a venture partner, the founder and CEO of Ecosia. </p>
<p>World Fund has revealed that it has invested in three companies so far: a meat-replacement startup, one in waste reduction, and <a href="https://qoacompany.com/">Qoa Company</a>.</p>
<p>Which replaces Cocoa, a large source of CO2 emissions in agriculture.</p>
<p>Global &#8216;competitors&#8217; to World Fund include <a href="https://astanor.com/">Astanor</a>, Pale Blue Dot and 2150 VC which this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/2150-vc-hits-312m-for-fund-to-build-and-run-cities-greener-and-emit-vastly-less-co2/">raised</a> a $312m fund.</p>
<p>The investment team also includes experts such as mechanical and chemical engineers, physicists, and a mathematician. LPs include Trivago co-founder Rolf Schrömgens; Econos, a sustainable investment platform founded by Alexander Samwer; serial female entrepreneur and author Verena Pausder and her husband Philipp Pausder, the founder of Thermondo.</p>
<p>In addition, a leading scientific and advisory board including Max Planck Institute of Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship Professor director Dietmar Harhoff (who is also advising the German government and is a recipient of the Bundesverdienstkreuz &#8211; Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany); academic director and Scientists for Future founder Dr Gregor Hagedorn; and Deputy Head of Responsible Research at Fraunhofer Institute Simone Kaiser help advise World Fund.</p>
<p>Tim Schumacher, General Partner at World Fund, added: “I’ve been investing in technology for over ten years now, both in regular software and in climate tech, and during that time my climate investments outperformed my other investments. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons for this is the caliber of people attracted to working on the largest problem humanity faces. At World Fund, we recognize that to tackle climate change, investing in new technology needs to be profitable and scalable.” </p>
<p>Daria Saharova, General Partner at World Fund, said: “There’s a huge opportunity to back the startups helping to roll back the clock on the climate crisis and transform the way whole sectors operate. From farming startups to battery technology, startups addressing climate change need more funds with deep pockets and a commitment to support dynamic companies, to ensure they can fulfill their potential.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marcyvp.com/">Marcy Venture Partners</a>, the venture firm cofounded in 2018 by Shawn Carter (Jay-Z), former Roc Nation CEO Jay Brown, and former Walden VC general partner Larry Marcus, says it has closed its second fund with $325 million in capital commitments. The team, which closed its debut fund with $85 million, is now managing $600 million in assets altogether, says cofounder Marcus.</p>
<p>The firm describes itself as having a &#8220;consumer, culture and positive impact&#8221; investment strategy, and it says the majority of its existing portfolio companies are founded or run by people who identify as women or people of color.</p>
<p>To date, the trio has written checks to at least 21 companies, including in fashion, skin care, and food companies. Among those many bets includes Rihanna&#8217;s lingerie company Savage X Fenty; the sneaker marketplace StockX; Therabody, which makes percussion therapy tools; Simulate, which makes plant-based, chicken-flavored nuggets; and an allergen-free cookie maker called Partake Foods.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223951" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Carter and company have also begun investing in crypto projects, supporting Bitski, a San Francisco-based startup NFT marketplace, earlier this year, and investing more recently in spatial LABS (sLABS), a tech incubator that focuses on the metaverse and blockchain-based products.</p>
<p>The San Francisco- and L.A.-based firm, named after the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn where Carter grew up, was initially targeting $200 million for the newest fund, per an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849285/000184928521000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a> from April.</p>
<p>The firm is just one of many business interests for Carter. For example, he owns half of the champagne brand Armand de Brignac, known familiarly as Ace of Spades. He acquired the label for an undisclosed sum in 2014; in February of this year, Moet Hennessy bought half the company for terms that were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Carter also owned Tidal, a streaming music service that he&#8217;d bought in 2015 and renamed (and reshaped), before selling a &#8220;significant majority&#8221; of the company to the financial services giant Square for $297 million in cash and stock back in March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He launched Monogram, a cannabis brand, last December.</p>
<p>And, of course, he most famously founded Roc Nation, a now 13-year-old, sprawling entertainment company that has its tentacles in everything from artist and athlete management, to labels, publishing, touring, film, and television, among other ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rhinoceros beetles are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263163270_Oryctes_rhinoceros_Beetles_an_Oil_Palm_Pest_in_Malaysia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the greatest threats to oil palm crops</a>, attacking plants while they are young and potentially lowering a farm’s yield for years. They also affect workers’ health, since pesticides need to be sprayed frequently. Based in Kuala Lumpur, <a href="https://www.poladrone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poladrone</a> wants to change the way farms use pesticides with a combination of drones and automation and analytics software.</p>
<p>The company announced today it has raised a $4.29 million seed round led by Wavemaker Partners, which it says is the largest seed round ever raised in Malaysia, based on data from <a href="http://crunchbase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase</a>. Other participants include the Malaysian Technology Development Corporation (MTDC), which is wholly-owned by Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the Malaysian government’s sovereign wealth fund; ZB Capital Limited; and angel investors.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Cheong Jin Xi, Poladrone now operates in Malaysia and Thailand and plans to expand into Indonesia, the world’s largest oil palm producer. Cheong told TechCrunch that Poladrone is profitable, but decided to seek funding after the COVID-19 pandemic hit and “highlighted the positive impact our technology has on agriculture communities by creating jobs and upskilling opportunities.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223937" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indonesian agritech platform TaniHub Group harvests a $65.5M Series B round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/indonesian-agritech-platform-tanihub-group-harvests-a-65-5m-series-b-round/embed/#?secret=J7XU3wcvkG" data-secret="J7XU3wcvkG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Adoption of Poladrone’s drones also increased during labor shortages caused by the pandemic, and the startup grew its team from 20 people to over 80 in less than a year to meet demand. Its seed round will be used for more hiring and to scale operations and build more Service Centers in agricultural areas, where clients can buy equipment and spare parts.</p>
<p>Cheong first became interested in drones when he was a high school student in Melbourne, Australia, and it led to him pursuing an aerospace engineering degree at university.</p>
<p>After Cheong returned to Malaysia, he began looking at potential applications for drone technology and realized “the agriculture industry made perfect sense,” because drones can fly over large terrains to perform repetitive tasks autonomously, and their cameras also capture a large amount of data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cheong’s interest in agritech was also inspired by growing up in Kuala Lipis, an agricultural town in the state of Pahang. Many of his family members and relatives are involved in farming, and his early insights went into the development of Poladrone’s products.</p>
<p>Rhinoceros beetles are a serious problem during the first three years of an oil palm’s 25 year lifecycle, he said, because attacks hurt trees’ growth, delaying them from reaching maturity and sometimes killing plants.</p>
<p>“The issue is that once the surrounding oil palms matures, replanting is no longer possible which means that any space wasted on a dead palm would be wasted for the next 22 years,” Cheong said. As a result, oil palm farms usually need to perform preventative pesticide spraying every two weeks for the first two years after oil palms are planted, then every month until they mature. This is often done by workers with knapsack sprayers or on tractors.</p>

<p>In 2020, the company <a href="https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/digital-economy/poladrone-unleashes-oryctes-agricultural-spot-precision-drone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched Oryctes</a>, developed with support from Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, for precision spot spraying of rhinoceros beetles and other pests. It also recently launched Mist Drone, which blanket sprays open field crops, like paddies, corn and bananas.</p>
<p>Most of the oil palm farms Poladrone works with are mid-to-large size, or about 5,000 hectares and above. “Data analytics and automation becomes extremely important for farms once they reach this scale,” Cheong said. He added that oil palm farms cover 18.7 million hectares around the world, and Poladrone sees a serviceable addressable market of 4.2 million hectares in Malaysia alone, worth over $1.3 billion per year. The company is also planning to expand its reach to other types of crops, like rice, corn and sugarcane.</p>
<p>In addition to selling its products, Poladrone’s Service Centers also provide repairs, training and workshops, with the goal of increasing drone adoption. Cheong said it typically takes one week of training before workers start using Poladrone’s equipment, which can be operated from smartphones.</p>
<p>In statement about investment, Wavemaker Partners general partner Gavin Lee said, “Poladrone now works with eight out of 10 of the biggest palm oil farms in Malaysia—an impressive feat that gives us confidence to back the team and their vision of propelling Southeast Asia’s agriculture industry.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every CISO must face a cold, hard fact: You might not have a seat at the boardroom table or the executive leadership team meeting.</p>
<p>At some organizations, this relatively new role doesn’t get C-level attention yet, and at others, the organizational structure can prevent you from ever getting a permanent seat at the table. Other complexities arise if you report to a CIO or CTO and feel muted by the hierarchy. Or, perhaps your message is diluted by the time it gets up the chain of command.</p>
<p>While lack of access to the highest levels of your organization can be disheartening, remember that you can still have a significant influence on your organization and its security. You may just have to hustle.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Be a translator: When you engage in executive or board communication, speak like a business person and keep your messages brief and engaging.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As an executive, I’d happily meet with a team member (at any level) who wants to run ideas by me. If these ideas are interesting, I’d likely let them marinate for a few weeks before reaching back out to the employee with feedback. Now we’ve started an open dialogue and begun building a rapport. In the course of our conversations, maybe this person continues to present thought-provoking ideas. I might take their suggestions to the board or invite them to present them.</p>
<p>Of course, having a permanent seat at the table is ideal. But, if that’s not realistic, work to get yourself — or at least your ideas — into the boardroom. Just because you don’t have a standing invite doesn’t mean that you can’t have an impact.</p>
<h2>Create relatable and relevant messaging</h2>
<p>To get your message across to time-strapped executives (or just about anyone for that matter), you need to meet them where they are. You already know why cybersecurity investment is essential to your role. Now step into your leadership’s shoes to explain why it’s crucial to theirs.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

Kirsten, in case you aren&#8217;t familiar with her, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/kirsten-korosec/">TechCrunch&#8217;s transportation editor</a> &#8212; her crew handles everything that moves under its own power for the team. She&#8217;s tremendous.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223647" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Aside from the obvious market cap point, we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>What news drove Tesla higher today, leading to its new valuation record?</li>
<li>How is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-charges-forward-with-a-third-quarter-profit-of-1-6-billion/">Tesla&#8217;s overall financial performance looking</a>?</li>
<li>Has the model mix at the company changed over time?</li>
<li>And, because Alex was curious, why Telsa cars all look the same when will the Cybertruck will come to market?</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, it was a very fun Twitter shot. Cheers, and Equity is back Wednesday with our regular programming.</p>

<h2>The next chapter of the new space economy: Destinations</h2>
<p>I spoke with Voyager Space Holdings CEO Dylan Taylor, Nanoracks CEO Jeffrey Manber and Lisa Callahan, Lockheed Martin’s VP of commercial civil space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">to discuss the companies&#8217; plans to launch a commercial space station in 2027.</a></p>
<p>“NASA as a customer has unleashed this extraordinary revolution in space transportation,” Manber said. “Building on the success that NASA had with cargo, building on the success of commercial crew, one can anticipate that with the markets interested in space, we&#8217;re going to see the same thing with smaller private space stations.”</p>

<h2>Starship fires up as SpaceX awaits regulatory approval</h2>
<p>For the first time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/elon-musk-says-starship-should-be-ready-for-first-orbital-launch-next-month-pending-regulatory-approval/">SpaceX completed two test firings</a> of its Raptor vacuum engines while they were attached to a Starship rocket. CEO Elon Musk later said the next-gen, heavy-lift rocket will be ready for its first orbital launch attempt next month, pending approval from regulators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">First firing of a Raptor vacuum engine integrated onto a Starship <a href="https://t.co/uCNAt8Kwzo">pic.twitter.com/uCNAt8Kwzo</a></p>
<p>— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1451350259729420288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>SpaceX still needs approval from the Federal Aviation Administration before it can attempt to send a fully stacked version of its Starship and Super Heavy booster to orbit. This past week, the regulator heard public comment in two separate sessions on its draft environmental assessment of the proposed launch site, a normal part of the licensing process. It&#8217;s unclear when the FAA is likely to release a final decision on the license. The public comment period on the draft EA is open until November 1.</p>
<h2>NASA and Boeing: Starliner grounded until first half of 2022</h2>
<p>The beleaguered Starliner spacecraft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/nasa-and-boeing-confirm-starliner-wont-fly-until-first-half-of-2022-as-valve-investigation-continues/">will not fly until sometime during the first half of next year at the earliest, NASA and Boeing executives confirmed</a>. While Boeing is still unable to identify the root cause of why 13 of the 24 valves in the propulsion system remained stuck in the closed position during routine pre-mission activities, the company is suspecting Florida humidity and corrosion as the main culprit.</p>
<p>Boeing emphasized during a media briefing that it had conducted multiple tests on these valves prior to Starliner making it to the launch pad, and yet it still didn&#8217;t catch the issue. Nevertheless, NASA&#8217;s manager of the Commercial Crew program Steve Stich said the agency maintains “every confidence that Boeing will be flying crew soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ll get this problem solved and then we’ll have two space transportation systems like we want, with Boeing and SpaceX both flying [ … ] I have no reason to believe Boeing won’t be successful.”</p>

<h2>Senate committee to NASA: Pick two developers for lunar lander program</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/senate-budget-committee-tells-nasa-to-select-two-developers-for-lunar-lander-program/">Senators have directed NASA to select two teams</a> to develop lunar landers under the Human Landing System program, according to a draft appropriations bill for the agency&#8217;s fiscal year 2022 budget. The catch? They&#8217;re only giving the agency an additional $100 million to do so.</p>
<p>NASA has maintained that it selected SpaceX &#8212; and only SpaceX &#8212; to develop a lander because it submitted the lowest-cost bid: only $2.9 billion, compared to the price tags of Blue Origin’s proposal ($5.9 billion) and Dynetics ($9 billion). Given the significant difference in cost between the three proposals, it’s unclear how the Senate’s increase to the HLS program &#8212; which is only $100 million &#8212; will enable NASA to select an additional team.</p>

<h2>News from around the web</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://spacenews.com/leolabs-western-australia-radar/">LeoLabs</a>, a startup developing a global tracking network for objects in orbit, has announced the sixth site for its next two ground phased-array radars: Western Australia. The site will help the company track launches from Asia, as well as orbital objects traveling over the southern hemisphere.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/spacex-to-become-more-valuable-than-tesla-morgan-stanley-survey.html">Morgan Stanley Research</a> released a survey showing that institutional investors and industry experts expect SpaceX to hit a higher valuation than Tesla.

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 25, 2021. What a <em>day</em>. We kicked off with news that a major, multibillion-dollar tech deal was kaput and closed out the trading day on news that another tech firm had reached the trillion-dollar market cap threshold. Facebook also reported earnings right after the bell, and TechCrunch dropped a host of hardware reviews. Tired yet? It’s <em>Monday</em>. – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p><em>P.S. Our </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/announcing-the-final-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-saas-2021/"><em>SaaS event is in two days</em></a><em>; get hype.</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223756" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/equity-monday-paypal-punts-on-pinterest-as-facebooks-hell-month-continues/"><strong>PayPal calls off Pinterest deal:</strong></a> So much for the fintech-social media tie-up of the decade. U.S. fintech giant PayPal has killed off its potential buy of Pinterest. Shares of PayPal rose. Shares of Pinterest cratered. I suppose our general skepticism of the deal wasn’t <em>too </em>far off the market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/tesla-hertz-shares-rise-electric-vehicle-order/"><strong>Tesla reaches $1T market cap:</strong></a> You may have missed it, but Tesla is now worth more than Facebook these days, cresting the $1 billion market cap market today during regular trading, while the social network closed the day worth a few dozen billion less. What drove Tesla’s gains? Hertz, amazingly enough.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-reports-revenue-miss-plans-to-break-out-ar-vr-top-lines/"><strong>Facebook misses revenue expectations, promises reporting changes:</strong></a> After the bell today, Facebook reported its Q3 2021 earnings, including a revenue miss, a per-share profit beat, and news that it intends to break out its AR and VR revenues into a separate category from here on out. The latter is good news, though we’d appreciate more granular financial reporting from across the Empire of Zuck now that we know the company is capable of it. Shares of Facebook are up slightly, if still underwater from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">their Friday declines that came in the wake of Snap’s Q3 report</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get truly underway with all of our startup coverage, we have a new item from Unicorn Land: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/braze-set-to-put-points-on-the-board-for-new-yorks-startup-scene-in-impending-ipo/">New York tech company Braze is going public</a>. While it was not a unicorn when it last raised capital, the company will nearly certainly crash through the $1 billion valuation mark when it debuts on the public markets.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/blue-origin-boeing-and-others-join-sierra-space-to-build-commercial-space-station/"><strong>All hail our commercial space future:</strong></a> A consortium of firms are coming together to build a commercial space station. Given how rapidly the ISS is showing its age, this is a good thing. Sierra Space announced that “Blue Origin and Boeing would be joining the team to send the [private space station] to orbit in the second half of the decade.” We are closer and closer to our Bond-villain future that we’ve all long awaited.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/selfbook-raises-25m-at-a-125m-valuation2222709/">Selfbook raises capital, pivots to business focus:</a> </strong>The pandemic shook up quite a lot. Where we work. How we socialize. For hotel-booking company Selfbook, it shook up its business model. Now working for other companies, Selfbook “claims that its software gives hotels a way to accept ‘one-click’ payments directly on their websites while eliminating fraud and reducing chargebacks.” The startup is now worth $125 million.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/cameo-represent-acquisition/">Cameo books acquisition:</a> </strong>The celebrity-booking service Cameo has proven to have a popular model. You can pay a fee and have a celebrity or other notable figure record a message for you. I once got one from an Eagles player that a friend commissioned for me. Fun times. Anyhoo, the company has made its first acquisition, picking up Represent, which TechCrunch describes as “a marketing and merch company that helps celebrities and brands set up individualized online storefronts.” You can see the synergies, obviously.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/data-platform-y42-raises-31m/"><strong>Are all the startup names taken?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Here at TechCrunch, we joke that there are too many venture capital firms, so much so that they are starting to double-up on names. For Example, <a href="http://shinecap.com/index.html">Shine Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.shine.vc/">Shine Capital</a>. Regardless, a startup called Y42 has raised funds, showing the world how to avoid using someone else’s name. The Berlin-based startup has built a low-code data platform and just raised a $31 million Series A.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/"><strong>Even more money to roll-up e-commerce brands:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The race to buy e-commerce sellers continues this week with Boston-based Thrasio raising $1 billion more for its efforts. The company is now worth $10 billion. That’s a <em>lot</em> of money. Per TechCrunch, the company is buying more than a brand each week, and has 200 in its portfolio. Wild.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/routine-is-a-new-productivity-app-that-combines-task-management-and-notes/"><strong>New task app aims to tell you what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing right now:</strong></a> Meet <a href="https://www.routine.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Routine</a>, a new startup working on a productivity tool that should help you manage your work day more efficiently. It’s a brand new take on to-do lists as it combines both tasks, non-actionable notes and a daily planner.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fintech’s growing role in the healthcare revolution</h2>
<p>Health care spending accounts for almost 18% of U.S. GDP, so it&#8217;s no surprise that digital health is attracting record levels of investment. This year, VCs have flowed $14.7 billion to health tech startups, compared to $14.6 billion in all of 2020.</p>
<p>Given the high cost of care in the United States compared to other nations, pairing fintech with health tech is just good business.</p>
<p>Simon Wu, an investment director with Cathay Innovation, says he&#8217;s paying close attention to these areas of convergence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data and the transition to value-based care.</li>
<li>Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses.</li>
<li>Fintech for affordability and reducing friction.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chicago-based Promus Ventures has closed a €120 million ($139 million) space fund, dubbed Orbital Ventures, focused on early-stage space companies.</p>
<p>The new fund, which will be based in Luxembourg, grew out of a mix of public and private investment. The European Investment Fund, the financing arm of the European Union’s European Investment Bank Group, committed €40 million, with additional participation by Luxembourg’s Ministry of the Economy and the National Credit and Investment Institution.</p>
<p>While Promus Ventures’ invests across a range of industries, its track history in the space sector includes investments in Rocket Lab, Spire and Swift Navigation. Orbital Ventures, which made its first close in January 2020, has also made several investments, including in satellite terminal developer Isotropic Systems, geospatial data company Ellipsis Drive, and Denmark’s Fernride.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223803" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We continue to witness terrific growth and developments in the New Space industry, and we are excited to deploy this new sector-specific space fund,” Promus Ventures partner Pierre Festal said in a statement. “We are thankful to our investors for their trust and support in this endeavor. […] It’s a pivotal time for global space players and the outlook is strong.”</p>
<p>The new fund is just the latest sector-specific space fund to emerge in recent years, as investor interest in the burgeoning orbital market continues to rise. Last week, Space Capital reported that investors – including VCs, angel investors, corporate investors, private equity and others – poured $8.7 billion into the industry in the third quarter of 2021 alone, positioning this year to beat 2020’s investing record.</p>
<p>Much of the capital raised went to space companies that went public via mergers with blank-check firms. These deals accounted for $1.2 billion of the $3.9 billion of venture funding during the third quarter of this year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[U.S. social networking giant Facebook reported its Q3 financial results today after the bell. It reported $29.0 billion in total revenue and earnings per share of $3.22, calculated on a diluted basis.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. social networking giant Facebook <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/facebook-reports-third-quarter-2021-results-301407881.html">reported its Q3 financial results</a> today after the bell. It reported $29.0 billion in total revenue and earnings per share of $3.22, calculated on a diluted basis. Investors had expected the company to report revenues of $29.58 billion, per data <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/analysis?p=FB">collected by Yahoo Finance</a>, and earnings per share of $3.19.</p>
<p>Shares of Facebook are up modestly in after-hours trading, indicating that the street is not shocked that it came in slightly light on top-line.</p>
<p>That lack of surprise may be due to the fact that Facebook&#8217;s report comes in the wake of Snap&#8217;s digest, which dropped last week. Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">shares fell after the company indicated</a> that it anticipated a far more modest Q4 than the market had, blaming Apple and supply-chain woes for its revenue growth troubles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223723" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In its letter to investors, Facebook provided guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021, including revenues that will land between $31.5 billion and $34 billion. The market expects $34.89 billion, above what Facebook signaled.</p>
<p>The gap between Facebook forecasts and market expectations appears to come from expected sources. The social giant wrote the following in its earnings note regarding its Q4 guidance:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our outlook reflects the significant uncertainty we face in the fourth quarter in light of continued headwinds from Apple&#8217;s iOS 14 changes, and macroeconomic and COVID-related factors. In addition, we expect non-ads revenue to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we lap the strong launch of Quest 2 during last year&#8217;s holiday shopping season.</p></blockquote>
<p>Changes to how Apple&#8217;s mobile operating handles privacy and the related downstream effects, along with issues stemming from COVID, were anticipated.</p>
<p>Facebook also reported in its investor digest that it will &#8220;break out Facebook Reality Labs, or FRL, as a separate reporting segment.&#8221; Citing that it expended &#8220;significant resources toward our augmented and virtual reality products and services,&#8221; the company thinks that it is time to have a second revenue category.</p>
<p>Starting next quarter, Facebook will have two segments. The first, its &#8220;Family of Apps&#8221; grouping, will feature results from &#8220;Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other services.&#8221; In contrast, FRL will include &#8220;augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software and content.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is fine. Perhaps even good. But my <em>god,</em> Facebook, why not break out reporting on your social apps into more granular buckets as well? That would have been shareholder-friendly.</p>
<p><em>More to come; we&#8217;re still reading.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seems like the goal of every startup is to exit via IPO, and if you can&#8217;t do that, by way of acquisition. In many cases, a sale gives a founder the opportunity to pay back investors and reward long-time employees, but what happens after the ink dries on the contract, and the reality of being owned by a larger company settles in?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to get the inside scoop from three founders who sold their companies, on a panel called &#8216;What Happens After Your Startup is Acquired&#8217; this Wednesday, October 27th, at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=startupaquisitionpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=startupaquisitionpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS</a>.</p>
<p>Panelists include Monica Sarbu, who founded a startup called Packetbeat in 2013, which she <a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-acquires-packetbeat">sold to Elastic in 2015</a>. She stuck around and ran the Beats team for almost three years. She is currently founder and CEO at <a href="http://xata.io">Xata</a>, and also runs <a href="http://tupo.io">Tupo.io</a>, a startup she launched last year to offer underrepresented folks in tech free mentorship</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223338" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We also have Jyoti Bansal, who sold his company, <a href="http://appdynamics.com">AppDynamics</a> to Cisco <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/">the week it was going to IPO</a> in 2017 for $3.7 billion. Bansal actually didn&#8217;t hang around, leaving the company upon the sale. Today, he runs two startup, <a href="http://harness.io">Harness</a> and <a href="https://www.traceable.ai/">Traceable</a>, and also founded the venture capital firm, <a href="https://www.unusual.vc/">Unusual Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we will talk to current <a href="https://www.gainsight.com/">Gainsight</a> founder and CEO Nick Mehta, who sold his former company LiveOffice to Symantec <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/16/symantec-buys-cloud-based-email-archiving-company-liveoffice-for-115m/">in 2012 for $115 million</a>. He stayed around for a brief period of time, but wasn&#8217;t really involved with the company after the sale closed.</p>
<p>One thing is clear from these three founders: Each acquisition experience is going to be different, and selling your company is definitely not the end of the story. We are going to discuss what goes into selling your company, how and why founders decide to do it, and if you join another team, what it&#8217;s like to go from being in charge to being an employee.</p>
<p>Further we are going to talk about the emotional side of selling and what it&#8217;s like to walk away from something you put so much time and energy into building. Finally, we will cover what each founder learned from that experience of selling the company, how it helped them grow as business people, and what you can learn as founders looking at your company&#8217;s startup journey.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The panel is part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=startupaquisitionpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=startupaquisitionpost&amp;display=true">a full agenda</a> for the day-long session looking at the impact of SaaS. In addition to this panel, we&#8217;ll have panels on open source, the value of data and the role of automation. Other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#ab40f8e4-b236-4c11-8767-8fd7d75a618c">speakers</a> include Microsoft&#8217;s Jared Spataro, Puppet&#8217;s Abby Kearns and Google&#8217;s Javier Soltero. We hope you&#8217;ll join us. It&#8217;s going to be a full day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube is rolling out a designated <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/132416851/new-to-you-discover-more-content-on-the-youtube-homepage?hl=en">&#8220;New to you&#8221; tab</a> on its platform after testing the feature earlier this year. The new tab is now available on the YouTube homepage across mobile, desktop and TV devices. YouTube says the feature will help users discover new creators and content beyond the recommended videos they usually see.</p>
<p>The new tab surfaces content that aligns with your viewing preferences from channels that you haven’t previously encountered. It&#8217;s meant to go a step further than YouTube’s Explore listings, which help users find content in specific topics, such as gaming or beauty, but doesn’t take users’ specific interests into account.</p>
<p>YouTube notes that &#8220;New to you&#8221; is personalized to the viewer, as it’s trying to strike a balance between content it thinks users might be interested in, along with content that is a bit different than what they&#8217;d typically watch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223616" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“You&#8217;ve told us that you want to see new creators and new videos after you&#8217;ve caught up on your recommendations, so we hope this new option keeps things fresh, while also helping creators connect with new audiences,” YouTube outlined in a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/132416851/new-to-you-discover-more-content-on-the-youtube-homepage?hl=en">blog post.</a></p>
<p>On mobile, you&#8217;ll see the tab when you refresh the YouTube homepage. The company says you may also see the tab as you scroll through your feed. It’s worth noting that since the feature is personalized, it may not always be available. Additionally, you’ll need to be signed in to YouTube to see the tab.</p>
<p>The new feature could help creators reach new audiences by targeting those who would be most interested in their content but would not have discovered it otherwise. It could also help viewers find new content and discover new interests.</p>
<p>It appears that this latest feature is YouTube&#8217;s take on TikTok&#8217;s popular &#8220;For You&#8221; page, which uses a recommendation system to display suggested videos personalized for each user. The feature has largely contributed to TikTok&#8217;s success, as it helps users find more content while also helping creators get discovered. It seems that YouTube&#8217;s &#8220;New to you&#8221; feed aims to do the same thing for its users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The launch of the new feature comes as lawmakers on the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/snap-tiktok-youtube-senate-hearing-congress/">question YouTube, Snap and Instagram</a> on how their platforms affect vulnerable young users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After dragging in the same companies and their reticent, overtrained executives time and time again, Congress is turning its attention to two of the tech industry’s fresh but important faces: TikTok and Snap.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security will question policy leads from those two companies and YouTube on how their platforms affect vulnerable young users. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before the same committee on parallel issues in early October, shortly after revealing her identity.</p>
<p>The hearing will air on Tuesday at 7AM PT, featuring testimony from Snap VP of Global Public Policy Jennifer Stout, TikTok’s VP and Head of Public Policy Michael Beckerman and Leslie Miller, who leads government affairs and public policy at YouTube.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223677" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies before the Senate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/embed/#?secret=oRNmctY6kx" data-secret="oRNmctY6kx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Subcommittee chair Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) will lead the hearing, which will focus on social media’s detrimental effects on children and teens. “The bombshell reports about Facebook and Instagram—their toxic impacts on young users and lack of truth or transparency—raise serious concerns about Big Tech’s approach toward kids across the board,” Blumenthal said, connecting reports about Instagram’s dangers for teens to social media more broadly. The subcommittee’s ranking Republican Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) has signaled that she’s particularly interested in privacy concerns around TikTok.</p>
<p>We’d expect topics like eating disorders, harassment, bullying, online safety and data privacy to come up as members of the subcommittee take turns pressing the three policy leads for answers. The group of lawmakers also plans to discuss legislation that could help protect kids and teens online, though how solutions-oriented the hearing will be remains to be seen. Some of those potential solutions include <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-rep-castor-reintroduce-legislation-to-protect-children-and-teens-from-online-manipulation-and-harm">the KIDS Act</a> (Kids Internet Design and Safety), which would create new online protections for people under the age of 16. Blumenthal and fellow Democratic Senator Ed Markey reintroduced the bill last month.</p>
<p>The mental health of kids and teens isn’t the only pressing societal crisis that social platforms are implicated in at the moment, but it’s one Republicans and Democrats are both rallying around. For one, it’s a rare arena of criticism with plenty of political overlap for both sides. Both parties do seem to agree that tech’s biggest companies need to be controlled in some way, though they generally play up different parts of the why: for conservatives it’s that these companies have too much decision making power when it comes to what content gets wiped from their platforms. On the opposite side of the aisle, Democrats are generally much more worried about the kind of content that gets left up, like extremism and misinformation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Tuesday&#8217;s hearing will also likely dive into how algorithms amplify harmful content. Because social media companies play their cards close to the chest when it comes to how their algorithms work, hearings are a rare opportunity for the public to learn more about how these companies serve their users personalized content. Ideally we’d be learning a lot about that kind of thing in the often lengthy, repetitive tech hearings Congress has held in the last couple of years, but between lawmakers pushing uninformed or irrelevant lines of questioning and evasive tech executives with hours of media training under their belts, the best we can usually hope for is a few new tidbits of information.</p>
<p>While Facebook won’t appear at this particular hearing, expect recent revelations around that company and Instagram to inform what happens on Tuesday. All three social media companies set to testify have had an eye on the public response to leaked Facebook documents and more reporting on that data<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/technology/facebook-files.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-facebook&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc"> just landed on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Just after the initial reports that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">Instagram is aware of the risks it poses to teen users</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/tiktok-expands-mental-health-resources-as-negative-reports-of-instagrams-effect-on-teens-leak/">TikTok introduced a new set of safety measures</a> including a well-being guide, better search interventions and opt-in popups for sensitive search terms. Last week, Snap announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/snapchat-to-introduce-family-safety-tools-to-protect-minors-using-its-app/">new set of family-focused safety tools</a> to give parents more visibility into what their kids are up to using the platform. Both social networks skew heavily toward younger users compared to platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, making robust safety tools even more of a necessity. Leading into the hearing, YouTube announced some changes of its own around what kind of kids content will be <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/132408074/creators-update-regarding-quality-principles-for-made-for-kids-content?hl=en">eligible for monetization</a> while also highlighting its other kid-centric safety measures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Frances Haugen, one of (now) multiple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/leaked-memo-excoriates-facebooks-slapdash-and-haphazard-response-to-global-political-manipulation/">Facebook whistleblowers</a> who have come forward in recent years with damning testimony related to product safety, gave testimony in front of the <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/cddf75b6-4279-43db-9ac9-9146ef5fe03f">UK parliament today</a> &#8212; where, in one key moment, she was invited to clarify her views on end-to-end encryption following a report in the British newspaper the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/10/24/facebook-whistleblower-warns-dangerous-encryption-will-aid-espionage/">Telegraph</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>The report couched Facebook&#8217;s plan to extend its use of e2e encryption as &#8220;controversial&#8221; &#8212; aligning the newspaper&#8217;s choice of editorial spin with long-running UK government pressure on tech giants not to expand their use of strong encryption in order that platforms can be ordered to decrypt and hand over message content data on request.</p>
<p>In its interview with Haugen, the Telegraph sought to link her very public concerns about Facebook&#8217;s overall lack of accountability to this UK government anti-e2ee agenda &#8212; claiming she had suggested Facebook&#8217;s use of e2e encryption could disrupt efforts to protect Uighur dissidents from Chinese state efforts to inject their devices with malware.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223415" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The reported remarks were<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> quickly seized upon by certain corners of the Internet (and at least <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/1452309142257950723">one other ex-Facebook staffer</a> who actually worked on adding e2e encryption to Messenger and is now self-styling as a &#8216;whistleblower&#8217;) &#8212; with concerns flying that her comments could be used to undermine e2e encryption generally and, therefore, the safety of scores of Internet users. </span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sounding unimpressed with the Telegraph&#8217;s spin, Haugen told UK lawmakers that her views on e2e encryption had been &#8220;misrepresented&#8221; &#8212; saying she fully supports &#8220;e2e open source encryption software&#8221;; and, indeed, that she uses it herself on a daily basis.</p>
<p>What she said she had <em>actually</em> been querying was whether Facebook&#8217;s <em>claim</em> to be implementing e2e encryption can be trusted, given the tech giant does not allow for full external inspection of its code as is the case with fully open source e2ee alternatives.</p>
<p>This is another reason why public oversight of the tech giant is essential, Haugen told the joint committee of the UK parliament which is scrutinizing (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/ex-minister-predicts-huge-battleground-over-uks-plan-to-set-internet-content-rules/">controversial</a>) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">draft online safety legislation</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I want to be very, very clear. I was mischaracterised in the Telegraph yesterday on my opinions around end-to-end encryption,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am a strong supporter of access to open source end to end encryption software.</p>
<p>&#8220;I support access to end-to-end encryption and I use open source end-to-end encryption every day. My social support network is currently on an open source end-to-end encryption service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of why I am such an advocate for <em>open source</em> software in this case is that if you&#8217;re an activist, if you&#8217;re someone who has a sensitive need, a journalist, a whistleblower &#8212; my primary form of social software is an open source, end-to-end encryption chat platform,&#8221; she also said, without naming exactly which platform she uses for her own e2ee messaging (Signal seems likely &#8212; a not-for-profit rival to Facebook-owned WhatsApp which has benefited from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/signal-expands-into-the-signal-foundation-with-50m-from-whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton/">millions of dollars of investment from WhatsApp founder Brian Action</a>, another former Fb staffer turned critic; so maybe &#8216;meta&#8217; would in fact be a perfect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/facebook-reportedly-plans-to-change-its-name-to-focus-on-the-metaverse/">new brand name for Facebook</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;But part of why that open source part is so important is you can see the code, anyone can go and look at it &#8212; and for the top open source end-to-end encryption platform those are some of the only ways you&#8217;re allowed to do chat in say the defence department in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s plan for end-to-end encryption &#8212; <em>I</em> think &#8212; is concerning because we have no idea what they&#8217;re doing to do. We don&#8217;t know what it means, we don&#8217;t if people&#8217;s privacy is actually protected. It&#8217;s super nuanced and it&#8217;s also a different context. On the open source end-to-end encryption product that I like to use there is no directory where you can find 14 year olds, there is no directory where you can go and find the Uighur community in Bangkok. On Facebook it is <em>trivially easy</em> to access vulnerable populations and there are national state actors that are doing this.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I want to be clear, I am not against end-to-end encryption in Messenger but I do believe the public has a right to know what does that even mean? Are they really going to produce end-to-end encryption? Because if they say they&#8217;re doing end-to-end encryption and they don&#8217;t really do that people&#8217;s lives are in danger. And I personally don&#8217;t trust Facebook currently to tell the truth&#8230; I am concerned about them misconstruing the product that they&#8217;ve built &#8212; and they need regulatory oversight for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In additional remarks to the committee she further summarized her position by saying: &#8220;I am concerned on one side that the constellation of factors related to Facebook makes it even more necessary for public oversight of <em>how</em> they do encryption there &#8212; that&#8217;s things like access to the directory, those amplification settings. But the second one is just about security. If people <em>think</em> they&#8217;re using an end-to-end encryption product and Facebook&#8217;s interpretation of that is different than what, say, an open source product would do &#8212; because an open source product we can all look at it and make sure that what is says on the label is in the can.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if Facebook claims they&#8217;ve built an end-to-end encryption thing and there&#8217;s <em>really</em> vulnerabilities people&#8217;s lives are on the line &#8212; and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m concerned about. We need public oversight of anything Facebook does around end-to-end encryption because they are making people feel safe when they might be in danger.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Haugen, a former Facebook staffer from the civic integrity team, is the source for a tsunami of recent stories about Facebook&#8217;s business after she leaked thousands of pages of internal documents and research reports to the media, initially providing information to the Wall Street Journal, which published a slew of stories last month, including about the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">toxicity of Instagram for teens</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (aka the &#8216;</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">Facebook Files</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8216;), and subsequently releasing the data to a number of media outlets which have followed up with reports today on what they&#8217;re calling </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/internal-facebook-documents-highlight-its-moderation-and-misinformation-issues/">the Facebook Papers</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.   </span></p>
<p>The tl;dr of all these stories is Facebook prioritizes growth of its business over product safety &#8212; leading to a slew of harms that can affect individuals, other businesses and the public/society more generally whether as a result of inadequate AI systems that cannot properly identify and remove hate speech (leading to situations where its platform can whip up ethnic violence), or which allow engagement based ranking systems to routinely amplify extreme, radicalizing content without proper mind to risks (such as forming conspiracy-theory touting echo chambers forming around vulnerable individuals, isolating them from wider society), or overestimation of its ad reach leading to advertisers being systematically overcharged for its adtech.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Internal Facebook documents highlight its moderation and misinformation issues&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/internal-facebook-documents-highlight-its-moderation-and-misinformation-issues/embed/#?secret=2oxyJl1KkT" data-secret="2oxyJl1KkT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>During her testimony today, Haugen suggested Facebook&#8217;s AIs were unlikely to even be able to properly distinguish dialectal distinctions and nuances of meaning between UK English and US English &#8212; let alone the scores of languages in countries where it directs far less resource.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians probed her on myriad harms during around 2.5 hours of testimony &#8212; and some of her answers repeated earlier testimony she gave <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">to lawmakers in the US</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the UK committee&#8217;s questions asked for her view on what might be effective regulatory measures to close the accountability gap &#8212; both on Facebook and social media more generally &#8212; as MPs sought to identify profitable avenues for amending draft online safety legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The danger with Facebook is not individuals saying bad things, it is about the systems of amplification that disproportionately give people saying extreme polarising things the largest megaphone in the room,&#8221; argued Haugen.</p>
<p>Her list of suggestions for fixing a system of what she couched as broken incentives under Facebook&#8217;s current leadership included mandatory risk assessments &#8212; which she warned need to cover both product safety and organisational structure since she said much of the blame for Facebook&#8217;s problems lies with its &#8220;flat&#8221; organizational structure and a leadership team that rewards (and thus incentivizes) growth above all else, leaving no one internally who&#8217;s accountable for improving safety metrics.</p>
<p>Such risk assessments would need to be carefully overseen by regulators to avoid Facebook using its customary tactic in the face of critical scrutiny of just marking its own homework &#8212; or &#8220;dancing with data&#8221; as she put it.</p>
<p>Risk assessments should also involve the regulator &#8220;gathering from the community and saying are there other things that we should be concerned about&#8221;, she said, not just letting tech giants like Facebook define blinkered parameters for uselessly partial oversight &#8212; suggesting &#8220;a tandem approach like that that requires companies to articulate their solutions&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s a flexible approach; I think that might work for quite a long time. But it has to be mandatory and there have to be certain quality bars because if Facebook can phone in it I guarantee you they&#8217;ll phone it in,&#8221; she also told the committee.</p>
<p>Another recommendation Haugen had was for mandatory moderation of Facebook Groups when they exceed a certain number of users.</p>
<p>Whereas &#8212; left unmoderated &#8212; she said groups can be easily misappropriated and/or misused (using techniques like &#8216;virality-hacking&#8217;) to act as an &#8220;amplification point&#8221; for spreading discord or disseminate disinformation, including by foreign information operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I strongly recommend that above a certain sized group they should be required to provide their own moderators and moderate every post,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This would naturally &#8212; in a content-agnostic way &#8212; regulate the impact of those large groups. Because if that group is actually valuable enough they will have no trouble recruiting volunteers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haugen also suggested that Facebook should be forced to make a firehose of information available to external researchers (as Twitter, for example, already does) &#8212; in a <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancesHaugen/status/1452727344855146497">privacy-safe way</a> &#8212; which would allow outside academics and experts to drive accountability from the outside by investigating potential issues and identifying concerns freed from Facebook&#8217;s internal growth-focused lens.</p>
<p>Another of her recommendations was for regulators to demand segmented analysis from Facebook &#8212; so that oversight bodies get full transparency into populations that disproportionately experience harms on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience &#8212; the real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,&#8221; she suggested.</p>
<p>She went on to argue that many of Facebook&#8217;s problems result from the sub-set of users who she said get &#8220;hyper exposed&#8221; to toxicity or to abuse &#8212; as a consequence of an engagement-driven design and growth-focused mindset that rejects even small tweaks to inject friction/reduce virality (and which she suggested would only mean Facebook giving up &#8220;small slivers&#8221; of growth in the short term and yield a much more pleasant and probably more profitable product over the longer term).</p>
<p>&#8220;As we look at the harms of Facebook we need to think about these things as system problems &#8212; like the idea that these systems are designed products, these are intentional choices and that it&#8217;s often difficult to see the forest for the trees. That Facebook is a system of incentives, it&#8217;s full of good, kind, conscientious people who are working with bad incentives. And that there are lack of incentives inside the company to raise issues about flaws in the system and there&#8217;s lots of rewards for amplifying and making things grow more,&#8221; she told the committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I think there is a big challenge of Facebook&#8217;s management philosophy is that they can just pick good metrics and then let people run free. And so they have found themselves in a trap where in a world like that how do you propose changing the metric? It&#8217;s very very hard because 1,000 people might have directed their labor for six months trying to move that metric and changing the metric will disrupt all of that work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any of it was intentional &#8212; I don&#8217;t think they set out to go down this path. And that&#8217;s why we need regulation &#8212; mandatory regulation, mandatory actions &#8212; to help pull them away from that spiral that they&#8217;re caught in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Legislation that seeks to rein in online harms by applying regulations to platform giants like Facebook must also not focus only on individual harms &#8212; but needs to respond to societal harms, she also emphasized.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is a grave danger to democracy and societies around the world to omit societal harm. A core part of why I came forward was I looked at the consequences of choices Facebook was making and I looked at things like the global south and I believe situations like Ethiopia are just part of the opening chapters of a novel that&#8217;s going to be horrific to read. We have to care about societal harm &#8212; not just for the global south but for our own societies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When an oil spill happens it doesn&#8217;t make it harder for us to regulate oil companies. But right now Facebook is closing the door on us being able to act &#8212; we have a slight window of time to regain people-control over AI; we have to take advantage of this moment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital lenders that share personal data of loan defaulters, with third parties, risk license withdrawal in Kenya after lawmakers added a <a href="http://www.parliament.go.ke/sites/default/files/2021-10/SUPPLEMENTARY%20ORDER%20PAPER%20THURSDAY%20OCT%2014-10-2021%20AFTERNOON.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clause</a> &#8212; granting the banking regulator the mandate to revoke permits of operators who breach customer confidentiality &#8212; to the new law passed by the country&#8217;s National Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, loan apps collect borrowers&#8217; phone data, including contacts, and demand access to messages to check the history of mobile money transactions &#8212; for credit scoring and as conditions for disbursing loans. Rogue lenders then use some of the contact information collected to recover the loans disbursed in cases where borrowers default.</span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57985667" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicate that digital lenders resort to debt-shaming tactics, like calling friends and family, to compel their borrowers to repay the loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change adds to a raft of measures taken by Kenyan lawmakers to protect citizens from rogue digital lenders who offer high-priced collateral-free loans. It grants the regulator, Central Bank of Kenya, power to oversee the operations of standalone digital lenders (not affiliated with banks) after a period of self-regulation. Digital lenders will, going forward, be required to obtain licenses to operate in Kenya, unlike previously, when they just had to register &#8212; which led to the proliferation of rogue apps. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221359" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Central Bank of Kenya amendment 2021 bill also gives the regulator the power to cap interest rates and to suspend or revoke the licenses of digital lenders that breach “the conditions of the Data Protection Act or the Consumer Protection Act.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya’s Data Protection Act requires firms to disclose to customers the reasons for collecting their data. It also ensures that borrowers&#8217; confidential information is safe from infringement by unauthorized parties. This comes as consumer lobbies accuse loan apps of sharing customer information with data and marketing companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital lenders will also be required to reveal all the information concerning their products, and this includes details on pricing, penalties for defaulters and means of debt recovery. This is in line with the country’s Consumer Protection Act which requires sellers to disclose to consumers all the terms and conditions pertaining to the purchase of goods or services. Almost all lending apps were found to use debt-shaming tactics to recover debt in Kenya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya is home to about 100 mobile lending apps, including Okash and Opesa, both owned by the Chinese-owned browsing giant Opera, and which have</span><a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/opera-phantom-of-the-turnaround/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">faced claims of using predatory lending tactics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Kenya. Okash and Opesa are some of tens other loan apps that were found to charge exorbitant interest rates and to have exploitative terms &#8212; like issuing 30-day loans instead of the 60 days stipulated by Google Play Store policies. The interest rates of the two Chinese loan apps were exorbitant, reaching up to 876% annualized, rates yet banks&#8217; yearly rates rarely exceed 20%. Other apps, including the San Francisco-based Branch International Ltd., and PayPal-backed</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/tala-grabs-145m-to-offer-more-financial-services-in-emerging-markets/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tala</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, were found to charge extortionist rates, with annualized interest rates of 156-348% and 84-152.4%, respectively. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lenders’ lobby, which represents 25 digital lenders disbursing about $40 million a month, told TechCrunch that members expressed their concern over capping of the interest rate but said they were happy with the new law especially because their feedback was taken. The association lobbied for the removal of minimum capital requirements, deposit rations and for the regulator to cede control of innovation or new products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are happy that the space is regulated now and that we are able to access the Central Bank (regulator) and mechanisms for dispute regulations have also been put in place. But price control is what concerns us and we are not happy with that &#8212; the moment you put an interest rate cap then there won’t be any lending. We are nervous about that but it is fair,” said the Digital Lenders Association of Kenya chairman, Kevin Mutiso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But having regulations in place, Mutiso said, is going to help grow the lending space in the country as the lenders collaborate with partners including the regulator to make it more robust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lack of regulation was making the market unpredictable, now we know what we can do and not do. And also, we are going to have better debt collection practices,” said Mutiso. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The law, we believe, is going to make Kenya to be the number one fintech market in the world because everything is clear now &#8212; from what is expected from the lenders and the borrowers. We are also going to see better products for our customers especially the MSMEs (micro and small medium enterprises),” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apps offer collateral-free loans making them attractive to borrowers looking for quick cash, and who are often locked out by banks due to prerequisites such as account history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While digital credit is easily accessible, its short tenure makes it expensive, while ease of access has led to borrowing from multiple apps resulting in debt distress and the reduction of credit scores &#8212; affecting the borrowers’ ability to obtain credit from banks in future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://www.kba.co.ke/downloads/WPS-08-2019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Kenya Bankers Association shows that convenience and ease of access are the predominant reasons that customers take into account when making decisions on the platforms to access credit from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It found that self-employed people prefer digital to conventional credit attributable to liquidity changes that they encounter while in their line of business, pointing to how loan apps are preferred during emergencies too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new law gives the regulator powers to determine the pricing parameters that will be followed by the digital lenders when setting the cost of credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exorbitant interest rates are not unique to Kenya; in India, loan apps were found to charge interest rates as high as</span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/1/11/loan-apps-remain-on-india-google-play-despite-violations-deaths" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 60% per week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There were reports of people committing suicide after harassment by loan-recovery agents in the south Asian country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West African countries have also witnessed the proliferation of loan apps, with Nigeria among the largest markets in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), a research and advocacy organization, also found digital loan default rates and delinquency high among 20 million borrowers in Tanzania. It reported that most borrowers used the loans for daily needs instead of emergencies or for investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the most important things regulators can do to reduce these numbers is to improve transparency on loan terms and conditions, making it easier for customers to make informed decisions,”</span><a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/how-regulators-can-foster-more-responsible-digital-credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said CGAP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization recommended more stringent rules to govern loan apps and called for transparency on loan terms among lenders.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Radio has long been described as the most intimate of media. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGy5SGTuAGI&amp;list=RDBzAdXyPYKQo&amp;t=157s">Quips about putting radio on the internet</a> aside, the persistent popularity of podcasting and the cockamamie climb of Clubhouse shows that audio-based platforms will continue to echo around the upper echelons of the ecosystem for a while yet. Joining the fray is <a href="https://www.hearttoheartapp.com/">Heart to Heart</a>, an audio-first dating app aiming to bring back some intimacy to the process of finding the right person for your next foray, whether that&#8217;s a saucy encounter or a mate for life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to act, and from my time in acting, I saw how much voice, and audio experiences drive intimacy between people,&#8221; explains Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart. &#8220;When it came down to the dating apps, it was never something I could get into. I felt like you needed to come up with a textual one-liner. That was never my way of approaching romantic conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heart to Heart is pushing back against the endless swiping and messaging of many of its competitors, offering a contrasting experience to sending the same opening line to dozens of people or typing with your thumbs until deep into the night.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221317" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I believe that the best consumer investments come from people who have unique insights on consumer behavior and ways that new tech products can allow new forms of social interaction,&#8221; said Charles Hudson from <a href="https://precursorvc.com/">Precursor Ventures</a>, who led the pre-seed investment round. &#8220;I have been a big fan of Josh&#8217;s TikTok videos for some time and his ability to poke at the tech industry with timely, relevant videos really showcased his creativity and ability to communicate via short-form video. I think the idea around confirming photos, storytelling, and audio will yield a product that really speaks to people&#8217;s unmet needs around communication and will create a whole new way for people to connect.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Precursor doesn&#8217;t particularly focus on audio-first startups, the team has seen a number of opportunities in that space. It was an early investor in Howard Akumiah&#8217;s company, Betty Labs (acquired by Spotify), as well as Isa Watson&#8217;s company (Squad), Falon Fatemi&#8217;s company (Fireside) and several others that are still in stealth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that there is a major wave of interesting activity happening around non-music audio and I believe that we are still in the early innings of non-music, audio-driven social experiences,&#8221; says Hudson. &#8220;The last two companies that I feel really innovated in this category were Tinder and Bumble. I think Josh and his team have a new mechanic that feels differentiated and unique and I think it has the potential to be the foundation for a new way for people to meet and get to know each other in ways that aren&#8217;t easily accomplished today.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222242" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222242" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2222242 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?w=680" alt="Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg 1869w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222242" class="wp-caption-text">Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart (Photo provided by Heart to Heart)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company raised the pre-seed round of $750,000. The round was led by Precursor Ventures, and Bryce Roberts of OATV &amp; Angelica Nwandu of The Shade Room partnered on the investment, as well as Marie Rocha at Realist Ventures. In addition, a number of angel investors joined the round, including Chris Bennett (Wonderschool), Andy Weissman (USV) and Gregory Levey (Robinson Huntly).</p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing we are trying to accomplish with the $750K, is to focus on building our iOS app, and making LA our first launch market,&#8221; says Ogundu. &#8220;Dating is such a local experience, and it makes sense to us to build and improve locally, then scaling it up from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Voice is so intentional and intimate, and that is exactly what we&#8217;re building here at Heart to Heart,&#8221; says Ogundu, suggesting that the voice mechanic is helpful in a dating context because it helps slow people down. &#8220;I think that because it takes more energy to send that voice snippet to someone, you&#8217;ll be more intentional with who you even look to strike up conversations with.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founding team consists of Joshua Ogundu, who wears the CEO hat. He is joined by Arihant Jain and Komal Shrivastava, who have been heading up the engineering and design efforts. The company hopes to get its product to market by the end of the year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital. To put this into perspective, consider this: In 2019, digital health saw $7.7 billion in VC investment, and that number rose to $14.6 billion in 2020. However, the<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-cash-in-as-venture-funding-for-digital-health-rises-11626346800"> first half of 2021 alone saw $14.7 billion</a> in VC investment.</p>
<p>Its marriage with fintech is the catalyst for the transformation of the healthcare industry. Similar to the <a href="https://medium.com/cathay-innovation/where-east-meets-west-consumer-fintech-at-a-crossroads-a-south-east-asia-story-4e2468ffac20">unbundling of financial services</a> and how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/from-startups-to-starbucks-the-embedded-api-opportunity/">fintech is scaling vertical SaaS</a>, the pandemic-fueled disaggregation of healthcare has created new players that are taking a page out of the fintech revolution book — all starting with payments.</p>
<p>A growing number of startups are now leveraging the <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/08/04/fintech-scales-vertical-saas/">fintech playbook</a> to solve a key part of the healthcare problem — the shifting dynamics between patients, payers and providers, and how payments and related electronic health records (EHRs) flow between them. Not only is the onus of payments and data flow moving from payers to patients, but providers are now facing a monumental shift to new billing and engagement models, requiring new technologies and platforms to help with the change.</p>
<p>Through the lens of fintech, here are three key areas to watch in healthcare.</p>
<h2>Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses</h2>
<p>One of the largest trends impacting the population today is the steady rise of chronic illnesses. It is estimated that <a href="https://www.fightchronicdisease.org/sites/default/files/docs/GrowingCrisisofChronicDiseaseintheUSfactsheet_81009.pdf">nearly half the U.S. population</a> will have a chronic illness by 2025. People are getting sicker for longer periods of time, which leads to a constant spending streak. Patients not adhering to medical guidance is a major factor and is responsible for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045499/#b1-18-033">$100 billion of healthcare spending and over 100,000 deaths annually</a>. With around <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/poll-nearly-1-in-4-americans-taking-prescription-drugs-say-its-difficult-to-afford-medicines-including-larger-shares-with-low-incomes/">a fifth of patients</a> never filling their prescriptions, it has become a priority to educate and incentivize patients to complete care and avoid readmissions or ER visits.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>To curb the rise of chronic illnesses and the associated recurring costs, many startups are using behavioral economics and gamification to incentivize patients and build healthy habits. For example, companies like <a href="https://paceline.fit/">Paceline</a> in the U.S., <a href="https://sweatco.in/">Sweatcoin</a> in Europe and <a href="https://gobetterfly.com/en/">Betterfly</a> in Latin America gamify wellness by combining fitness and financial rewards.</p>
<p>On the other hand, startups like <a href="https://www.semprehealth.com/">Sempre Health</a> and <a href="https://www.wellthapp.com/">Wellth</a> are tackling medical non-adherence with behavioral economics. For example, Wellth financially rewards actions like on-time prescription intake or regular A1c tests for diabetic patients.</p>
<h2>Fintech for affordability and reducing friction</h2>
<p>Looking at payers, there’s a major shift stemming from the rise of high-deductible healthcare plans (HDHP) — enrollment has risen <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/enrollment-changes-to-high-definition-health-insurance-plans">43% in the last five years</a> — emphasizing an increase in premiums and patient financial responsibility. Out-of-pocket expenses threaten the financial stability for many, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/20/heres-why-so-many-americans-cant-handle-a-400-unexpected-expense.html">40% of Americans</a> unable to pay an unexpected bill of $400.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-responsibility-approach-protecting-kids-and-families-youtube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> it will soon begin to demonetize some of the channels on its platform that market themselves as &#8220;made for kids&#8221; if the content they produce is low-quality, encourages negative behavior or attitudes, or is heavily commercial. The company had previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">warned</a> this sort of content would no longer be eligible for inclusion in its dedicated YouTube Kids app, but starting next month YouTube <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/132408074/creators-update-regarding-quality-principles-for-made-for-kids-content?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also begin to enforce</a> new monetization <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies</a> as well, which may impact the creators&#8217; eligibility for or possible removal from the YouTube Partner Program.</p>
<p>YouTube first announced its plans to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/"> increase its protections for minors</a> in August, saying that some of the updates would directly address upcoming regulations, while others were going beyond what would be required by law. At the time, YouTube said it would shift the default settings on videos for users ages 13 to 17 to private, would enable &#8220;take a break&#8221; and bedtime reminders for minors, would stop leveraging &#8220;interests&#8221; data for targeting teens and kids with ads, and more.</p>
<p>Among the changes was a warning to those creators specifically making content aimed at kids, noting the company planned to remove &#8220;overly commercial content&#8221; from its standalone YouTube Kids app aimed at younger children.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223476" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ahead of this move, a number of consumer advocacy groups <a href="https://www.democraticmedia.org/article/ftc-complaints-filed-campaign-commercial-free-childhood-and-center-digital-democracy-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been pressuring</a> YouTube and regulators alike to put an end to these types of videos, saying they blurred the lines between content and advertising. Plus, they argued, some creators weren&#8217;t disclosing that they had brand relationships behind the scenes that were fueling this sort of content production.</p>
<p>But without enforcement and guidelines around what&#8217;s appropriate for kids, some of YouTube&#8217;s largest creators were channels like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/24/949926198/9-year-old-boy-is-named-highest-earning-youtube-star-of-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multimillionaire</a> Ryan Kaji of Ryan ToysReview (now Ryan&#8217;s World), which focused heavily on consumerism and toy unboxings.</p>
<p>YouTube in August said that it would remove content from YouTube Kids that incited viewers to buy a product and &#8220;content focused on the excessive accumulation or consumption of products.&#8221; Now, YouTube is warning that any channel targeting younger audiences or those that are classified as &#8220;made for kids&#8221; could be at risk of demonization if they put out other sorts of low-quality content.</p>
<p>This includes content that <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#kids-quality&amp;zippy=%2Cquality-principles-for-kids-and-family-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encourages negative behavior and attitudes</a> (like bullying, dishonestly, disrespect to others, dangerous pranks, unhealthy eating habits and more); content that&#8217;s deceptively educational; content that hinders comprehension; content that&#8217;s sensational or misleading; and content that includes strange use of children&#8217;s characters. (The latter had been a particular problem in recent years, such as videos featuring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/22/youtube-tightens-rules-on-kid-related-content/">characters like Peppa Pig</a> in situations that were not kid-friendly).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Starting in November, YouTube says it will begin to enforce <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">additional monetization policies</a> with these quality principles in mind for channels designated &#8220;made for kids&#8221; or that frequently create content that&#8217;s made for kids.</p>
<p>If the creators are making low-quality content, according to these principles, they may be removed or blocked from joining the YouTube Partner Program. Other videos that fall under the low-quality principles may receive limited or no advertising. Initially, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/132408074/creators-update-regarding-quality-principles-for-made-for-kids-content?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube says</a> it will start with videos that encourage negative behavior. Others that have a strong focus on low-quality &#8220;made for kids&#8221; content will also go under review, the company added.</p>
<p>These negative principles were already factors that determined if the content is appropriate for YouTube Kids and informed the larger YouTube algorithm. But monetization changes are a much more powerful tool to shape what sort of content creators actually produce.</p>
<p>YouTube says creators whose channels could be impacted by the monetization changes will receive an email before the changes go into effect. In addition, even those channels that aren&#8217;t immediately impacted but produce low-quality kids&#8217; content may receive a yellow icon in a warning to advertisers. The company didn&#8217;t say how many channels may be impacted as a result of its new policy.</p>
<p>On the flip side, content that adheres to high-quality <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">principles</a> will be recommended more by the YouTube algorithm going forward, in addition to being included in the YouTube Kids app.</p>
<p>The high-quality principles include things like content that encourages kids to be a good person; content that encourages learning and curiosity; content focused on creativity, play and a sense of imagination; content that focuses on interaction with real-world issues; and content that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
<p>The announcement arrives on the heels of an increased examination of the role tech companies are playing when it comes to the well-being of minors using their services. Already, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">Google and YouTube</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">TikTok</a> have announced updates that place more emphasis on the safety and privacy of their younger users. YouTube also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/youtube-to-launch-parental-control-features-for-families-with-tweens-and-teens/">launched</a> new parental controls. This week, Snap and TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/snap-tiktok-youtube-senate-hearing-congress/">will face </a>their own Congressional hearing, too.</p>
<p>YouTube says it will continue to reevaluate and update its principles going forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year and a half has been a major eye opener for countless industries. As many white-collar employees have moved from offices to remote work, it has drawn into sharp focus just how ill-equipped many home setups are for hour after hour of Zoom calls.</p>
<p>Even as sales of PCs and tablets saw a major spike in 2020, consumer electronics companies weren’t particularly swift to react &#8212; not especially surprising, as the timeline to bring products to market is long, with many unannounced products still in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Arriving today, as a free update on compatible systems, macOS 12 Monterey (in part) introduces some key features introduced in an era of remote work &#8212; and life. And it’s likely not a coincidence that the new operating system arrives as Apple hardware, like the MacBook Pro and M1-powered iMac, is finally getting long-overdue upgrades to their camera and microphone setups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223463" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For Apple, that means FaceTime. The company is in a bit of peculiar position on the teleconferencing front, in that &#8212; unlike, say Microsoft or Google &#8212; it doesn’t have a business teleconferencing platform. Last year, Apple added the ability to host up to 32 people on a call, which certainly opens things up, but as it stands, there’s no “FaceTime for Business.” This is a friends and family deal.</p>
<p>Apple’s video calling app gets some key upgrades this time around. The top of the list addition is SharePlay, which unfortunately has been delayed on desktop and is currently set for a release at some point later this fall. It’s also largely expected to arrive on the soon-to-drop iOS 15.1. The feature is effectively a built-in version of the watch-together features that rolled out last year for streaming services at the height of the pandemic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223465" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2223465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg 2176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1158 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The feature is custom made to support Apple’s own services TV+ and Apple Music, and will work with a handful of launch partners, including Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, the NBA app, Twitch, TikTok, MasterClass, Zillow, Paramount+ and ESPN+. It’s a healthy cross section of services, but there are some bigger names that are notably absent, including Netflix, Amazon and Spotify.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature effectively syncs up video and audio content, allowing users in the group to react to what they’re seeing/hearing in real time. Volume adjusts around speakers’ audio and playback is synced when a user plays/pauses/fast forwards/rewinds. Users will also be able to extend the feature onto a set with an Apple TV.</p>
<p>Also new is a share screen feature, similar to what you’ll find on a service like Zoom, letting you present windows to other viewers on the call. Spatial Audio comes to FaceTime, as well. I recently tried it out while testing the latest AirPods and dug the feature, which uses the position of a speaker’s window to place their audio in that approximate location. It’s a little gimmick for now, but it’s a neat one.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting additions this time out is the ability to join a FaceTime call outside of the Apple ecosystem. Functionality is still limited, but users can create a link, which others can join on Android or Windows devices, through the Chrome or Edge browser. Users don’t need an account to join the call, but someone needs to let them in after clicking the link.</p>

<p>Also new is Portrait Mode &#8212; which, again, works similarly to the blur background function we’ve seen on the leading teleconferencing services. Apple says the addition uses the Neural Engine found on the M1. Both this feature and Spatial Audio are only available on systems with the M1 chip, though the blurring of the line the new chips represent for developers seems to point to an acceleration in the adoption of iOS features on macOS. This is a nice change from the days of waiting a couple of updates to see mobile features hit the desktop.</p>

<p>Once again, Safari receives some of the biggest updates here, along with its rethink on mobile. The biggest aesthetic change is a fairly radical move away from the universal search bar.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223473" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png" alt="" width="840" height="350" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png 840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png?resize=768,320 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png?resize=680,283 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>The new “compact tab bar” moves tabs into small, discrete windows as a space saver. Given how much of a pain such a change can be, Apple is smartly leaving this something you can enable or disable in settings.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223472" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="259" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png?resize=300,76 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png?resize=768,194 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png?resize=680,172 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Understanding that this is currently a browser tab world and we’re just living in it, Tab Groups lets users share them in bunches, so you can, say, have a “work” or “home” collection. Depending on how you work, that’s either a boon to creativity or another opportunity to cram a bunch of bookmarks away.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223474" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="458" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png 1844w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=768,343 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=680,304 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=1536,686 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Highlighting and right clicking text on a page now lets you add a “Quick Note,” collating all of that information into a single place. It’s a nice addition for those who do a lot of online research.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223475" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="845" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png 2028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=768,634 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=680,561 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=1536,1268 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Focus, which was announced as part of iOS 15, let’s you mediate distractions based on activities or times of day. You can, say, limit notifications when you’re meditating, reading, working, etc. These settings are automatically synced across Apple devices. Silenced notifications will also be noted in your messenger app, so people know when you don’t want to be disturbed.</p>
<p>AirPlay to Mac is a long-awaited new feature that, well, does what it says on the tin, effectively letting you cast music, movies and the like to a Mac using AirPlay 2. Makes sense, particularly if you’ve got an iMac and a perfectly good screen and speakers.</p>
<p>Universal Control &#8212; one of the more eagerly awaited additions here &#8212; is also coming later in the fall. The feature will further blur the line between iPadOS and Mac, letting users drag and drop items between the two for a more seamless AirDrop experience. The two devices can also be controlled by the same peripheral simultaneously, including a keyboard, trackpad or mouse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223477" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="741" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png 1496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=768,555 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The other big addition here is Shortcuts, the latest feature to be ported over from iOS. The app is effectively replacing long-time favorite Automator, which will be going away at some point in the future. As it stands, shortcut is simpler but may ultimately lack the sophistication of Automator, so Apple is cushioning the blow by letting users convert Automator sequences into Short Cuts. It will keep Automator around for a while, however, as it solicits feedback from users.</p>
<p>MacOS Monterey is available now for iMacs from 2015 and older, iMac Pro 2017 and later, MacBook Air/Pro early-2015 and later, Mac Pro 2013 and later, Mac mini 2014 and later and MacBook early-2016 and later.</p>
