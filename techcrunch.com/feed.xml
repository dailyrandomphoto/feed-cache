					<description><![CDATA[Countable is taking a cue from the positives of social media to build technology that nurtures more authentic communication and facilitates business and social outcomes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise engagement company <a href="https://www.countable.com/">Countable</a> raised $12 million in Series A funding so that brands can more easily engage with customers, even in a way that shows a brand’s values and stance on issues.</p>
<p>Existing investor Canaan Partners led the round and was joined by Ulysses Management and Global Catalyst Partners. In total, the company has raised about $16 million since the company was founded in 2014, Bart Myers, CEO of Countable, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In fact, the San Francisco-based company started out in solutions-based journalism, providing content around communities and people who wanted to drive outcomes. When Countable pivoted in 2017, Canaan Partners invested in the seed round and assisted the company’s transition into an enterprise SaaS organization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220609" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“A lot of things are changing quickly with social media, which has become more toxic in some ways and less trustful about safety and security of its users, as well as taking away some of the controls that brands had to engage with their audience on their terms,” Myers said. “It used to be that you had free viral reach and traffic, but that has gone away, and it is now pay-for-play, which is not so good for reaching people organically.”</p>
<p>Instead, Countable is taking a cue from the positives of social media to build technology that nurtures more authentic communication and facilitates business and social outcomes. Myers considered it “like what Shopify did with the shopping cart, we are doing for community engagement.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RyhaQI4KMb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/how-engaged-are-your-employees/">How engaged are your employees?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How engaged are your employees?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/how-engaged-are-your-employees/embed/#?secret=RyhaQI4KMb" data-secret="RyhaQI4KMb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Here’s how it works: The company works with brands to establish the look of their site, including goals, timelines and feedback processes. After the site launches, brands can manage their audience of employees, consumers and partners. It can promote action items beyond a “like” button and leverage Countable’s “Causes” network of more than 190 million people.</p>
<p>The company then provides analytics to the brand on how the community is growing and insights on driving revenue, retention and innovation. On the community side, members can engage with the brand, even record video testimonials and attend events around the cause.</p>
<p>Countable has made over 120 “implementations” for brands like Starbucks, which uses it for employee engagement, Uber, Patagonia, Levi’s and PG&amp;E, which Myers said uses its site to provide tips and resources to homeowners and businesses on how to prepare for emergencies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We give brands a lot of power to drive engagement and measure efficacy,” he added. “They can ask for feedback or encourage their audience members to share content with friends and tie it to incentives for deployment.”</p>
<p>In the past year, the company grew its revenue by nearly 300%; annual recurring revenue increased 277%, and it has more than doubled its customer acquisition and site usage.</p>
<p>To continue to meet that growth and scale its business operations, Myers expects to deploy the new funding into product development, go-to-market, expanding internationally and third-party integrations. It is also serving as a launchpad for social token community exchange.</p>
<p>“Brands increasingly want to have conversations with customers, and doing more of that bears fruit everywhere,” he added. “If you have your own community, it opens doors in terms of incentivization, is a way to quantify value and give customers ways to invest more in this experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest has been trying to reposition its business as a home to creators, not just a shopping inspiration site. Today, the company revealed its latest efforts on this front, which include more Snapchat and TikTok-inspired features, including a vertical video feed and plans to invest $20 million in &#8220;Creator Rewards.&#8221; It&#8217;s also announcing a series of expanded creator tools, like the ability to respond to videos with &#8220;Takes,&#8221; support for Amazon Affiliates, and more, as well as the launch of original content.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators/">earlier this year introduced Idea Pins</a>, a video-first feature aimed at creators which is something like a mix of both TikTok and Stories. These Pins allow Pinterest users to record and edit creative videos using tools similar to those you would find on other short-form video platforms &#8212; like background music, transitions, and interactive elements. The Idea Pins can be up to 60 seconds in length, but unlike traditional short-form video, video can be just one part of what the Pin offers &#8212; it can also include up to 20 pages of content per Pin which you tap through like in Stories. This could allow a creator to explain the various steps involved in recreating their recipe or DIY project, for example.</p>
<p>Now, Pinterest is giving its home page a redesign to better highlight these Pins in a more TikTok-like format. Users can choose to either &#8220;browse&#8221; or &#8220;watch&#8221; the Pins when looking for inspiration by selecting the associated tab on the home feed. The new Watch tab will launch users into a full-screen feed of Idea Pins which you scroll through vertically and can engage with, by leaving likes and comments, or by saving the Pin for later access. Though the experience of watching these video-enabled Pins feels a lot like browsing TikTok or Instagram Reels, you can still tap through to see more of the Pins&#8217; pages, as you would with Stories, when available.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220913" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>(You&#8217;ll know if the Pin has more pages as the bottom progress bar will be dashed, instead of showing you the video&#8217;s progress.)</p>
<p>Overall, the design of this Watch feed is very much TikTok-inspired, as it showcases full-screen videos and interaction buttons stacked vertically on the right. While Pinterest is varying the format a bit by offering support for additional pages, the resulting content feels very much like a Pinterest-fied TikTok feed.</p>
<p>However, one area where Pinterest could have an advantage is that it lets viewers save the Pin and organize it into your Pinterest Boards. TikTok, meanwhile, is very lacking in terms of saving and organizing the content you liked and want to refer back to, leading many users to download videos to their phone instead. This oversight on TikTok&#8217;s part could become a competitive advantage if not addressed, as many users want to save things like beauty tutorials, recipes, cleaning tips, decorating ideas, and other content which overlaps with Pinterest.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220944" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220944" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png 1431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/takes-idea-pin-flow-1_pink-en-US-sm-2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220944" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest (Takes)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In another nod to TikTok &#8212; which allows creators to interact with each others&#8217; content through features like Duets and Stitches &#8212; Pinterest is also today introducing its own creator response feature called &#8220;Takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Takes, creators will be able to respond to someone else&#8217;s Idea Pin with one of their own, where the response is linked back to the original. Think: a creator could try someone&#8217;s recipe but then offer their own variation; they could attempt to replicate the project another creator suggested, and show their results. They could show off their Halloween costume ideas and invite responses. And so on.</p>
<p>To kick off &#8220;Takes,&#8221; Pinterest is pulling in celebs to participate, including Jennifer Lopez, Megan Thee Stallion, and Storm Reid. (The company has before used celebs to promote its other creator-focused efforts, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/pinterest-announces-500k-creator-fund-creator-code-content-policy-moderation-tools-and-more/">including</a> Queer Eye&#8217;s Jonathan Van Ness, during a virtual creator event this year.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220940" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220940" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220940" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png 2550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/PR-Asset-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220940" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, creators can add a new &#8220;Try On&#8221; sticker to their Idea Pins which allows viewers to virtually try on lip products using augmented reality. This is a fairly common use of AR these days, as even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-now-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-using-ar-shop-from-influencer-videos/">Google</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/youtubes-new-ar-feature-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-while-watching-videos/">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.perfectcorp.com/business/services/virtual-makeup-snapchat">Snap</a>, and other beauty apps and retailers have adopted the tech. Pinterest, which has offered lipstick try-on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/pinterest-launches-an-ar-powered-try-on-experience-for-eyeshadow/">since last year</a>, expanded to include eyeshadow try-on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/pinterest-launches-an-ar-powered-try-on-experience-for-eyeshadow/">in early 2021</a>.  The new sticker will support over 10,000 try-on enabled products, Pinterest says.</p>
<p>The company is also launching its own original content series, Creator Originals, featuring over 100 creators across 10 countries which runs now through Jan. 2022. The creators will teach Pinterest users new skills in areas like beauty, home décor, wellness, fashion, cooking and more. Participants include <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/priscillaono/_created/">Priscilla Ono</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/kellywearstler/_created/">Kelly Wearstler</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/allymisslove/_created/">Ally Love</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/ZerinaAkers/_created/">Zerina Akers</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/kahhspence/_saved/">Kahh Spence</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/joshuaweissman/_created/">Joshua Weissman</a>, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/kiadamon/_created/">Kia Cooks</a>,<a href="https://www.pinterest.com/thematfinish/_created/"> Mat Sanders</a>, and others.</p>
<p>Beyond the new product announcements, the bigger news is that Pinterest will now try to seed its network with more creator content by paying creators directly.</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s launching a $20 million Creator Rewards fund in the U.S. &#8212; its first-ever in-product creator monetization program &#8212; initiate that will pay creators for participating in its challenges issued by Pinterest. This is an expansion on Pinterest&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/pinterest-announces-500k-creator-fund-creator-code-content-policy-moderation-tools-and-more/"> April announcement of its $500,000 Creator Fund,</a> which offered U.S. creators compensation with funds for content creation and advertising credits.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220943" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220943" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220943" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png 1431w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/creator-hub-rewards_pink-en-US-sm-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220943" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pinterest (creator rewards)</p></div></p>
<p>Access to Creator Rewards is available through the new &#8220;Creator Hub&#8221; on Pinterest, where creators can manage their Pinterest presence. The company says it will also offer &#8220;micro-grants&#8221; to fund various projects. This could include things like a community garden, a wellness program, or a new beauty look, the company suggests.</p>
<p>Creators will have other ways to make money, too. U.S. creators will now be able to tag their Pins using the existing product tagging tool with links from their Amazon Associates program. (The program already offered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/pinterest-rolls-out-new-features-that-let-creators-make-money-from-pins/">support for affiliate programs</a> like Rakuten and ShopStyle as of this summer.)</p>
<p>And creators can now enable shopping recommendations powered by Pinterest&#8217;s visual search (its &#8220;shop similar&#8221; feature), which is being enabled for video for the first time &#8212; another attempt at catching up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">TikTok and its e-commerce feature set. </a></p>
<p>Combined, the products indicate a Pinterest that&#8217;s very much trying to reinvent itself for the TikTok era, largely by copying TikTok features then adding its own twists. It would not be alone in doing so. TikTok, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58155103">most downloaded app worldwide</a>, has been fueling clones across top social media platforms including Instagram, YouTube, Snap, Reddit, and others. But for Pinterest, it&#8217;s a particular threat as many of TikTok&#8217;s best videos are those that are instructive or inspirational and then lead directly to purchases &#8212; basically, Pinterest&#8217;s entire business model. The company&#8217;s hope is to recapture creators&#8217; interest with these new tools, while also providing them with ways to actually monetize their following beyond virtual tipping or brand engagements.</p>
<p>Pinterest says its new features will roll out starting today on iOS, Android, and the web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sure, Facebook is apparently rebranding as a metaverse company &#8212; because <em>that</em> will fix its trust deficit &#8212; but this morning we&#8217;re jumping right back into the IPO game instead of making rude jokes at the social giant&#8217;s expense.</p>
<p>This time our target <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">is Backblaze</a>, which you may not be familiar with. Frankly, given how limited my knowledge of the storage-focused software company was before reading its IPO filing, I was almost ready to stick it in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> for the weekend.</p>
<p>But!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>It turns out that there are a few twists to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001462056/000119312521301141/d62601ds1.htm#toc">the company&#8217;s filing</a> that make it really worth our time. So, we&#8217;re digging in.</p>
<p>Backblaze, based in San Mateo, California, has a very limited venture capital history. That&#8217;s because it has a track record of not losing money. Indeed, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/backblaze/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>, it only raised a handful of millions during its private life. The company confirmed that in its filing, stating that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our operations have historically been efficient with limited outside investment. Prior to issuing $10.0 million of convertible notes (which we also refer to as a Simple Agreement for Future Equity agreement (SAFE)) in a private financing round in August 2021, we had raised less than $3.0 million in outside equity since our founding in 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did anyone else mostly forget that you can build IPO-ready software companies without utter truckloads of external cash? Here&#8217;s a reminder.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Naturally, we&#8217;re going to figure out just how the company managed to grow to its current size without losing nine figures worth of venture money. And we&#8217;ll want to look at its gross margins.</p>
<p>Why? Because by offering storage, our presumption is that Backblaze has somewhat lackluster gross margins. But we could be wrong. Finally, we&#8217;ll pick up a topic we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/techcrunch-exchange-gitlabs-mega-ipo/">touched on last weekend</a>, namely specialty cloud infra providers and how they may stack up with the public cloud giants.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>How Backblaze grew to IPO scale without losing all of god&#8217;s money</h2>
<p>Backblaze has two main products, both of which sit atop its &#8220;storage cloud.&#8221; Or, as I like to think of it, a large bucket of online storage capacity. The company offers &#8220;B2 Cloud Storage,&#8221; a tool that includes API access for developers looking to back up information, mesh with third-party content delivery networks (CDNs), and the like. Its second product is called &#8220;Computer Backup.&#8221; It does what it says on the tin, for one computer or many.</p>
<p>For whom does Backblaze build? While the company claims that its &#8220;solutions are designed for individuals and businesses of all sizes and across all industries,&#8221; it does note a &#8220;particularly strong appeal to mid-market organizations,&#8221; or those with under 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>All of this matters because it frames our question: How did Backblaze grow to a greater than $60 million annual run rate (based on H1 2021 data; more on the matter shortly) without more venture dollars?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a hint:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220839" style="width: 367px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220839" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2220839 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-8.47.22-AM.png?w=357" alt="" width="357" height="79" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-8.47.22-AM.png 357w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-8.47.22-AM.png?resize=150,33 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-8.47.22-AM.png?resize=300,66 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-8.47.22-AM.png?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220839" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Backblaze S-1 filing</p></div></p>
<p>When we were first reading the company&#8217;s S-1 filing, this statistic caught our eye and we laughed at it. <em>What a silly non-GAAP metric!</em> However, it turns out that online demand generation through native content is actually a huge lever for Backblaze, so, sure, the blog readers metric actually does matter.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The life of a startup founder is not typically relaxing. Long hours are a given and days off are few. Your startup is your baby, and it needs care and feeding 24/7.</p>
<p>So what happens when a pandemic forces office shutdowns and a move to remote work for everyone? Great things, as it turns out.</p>
<p>For several years, my partner and I &#8212; normally based in Paris &#8212; discussed living a more nomadic life, spending a few months in one city and then moving on to another. When we started talking about it, we both worked in jobs (customer support and software development, respectively) that could in theory be done from anywhere. Then I co-founded my company, and we put our plans for a nomadic life on hold.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220205" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We already had a small number of employees working remotely. But when we shut our Paris office and went fully remote in March 2020, some of our staff were in a bit of a panic.</p>
<p>But a funny thing happened on the way to our home offices: Productivity didn’t change at all.</p>
<p>Inbound sales requests skyrocketed &#8212; within just a couple of weeks of the pandemic being declared, our leads had increased by 10x. We were signing clients left and right. We even made dozens of new hires while completely remote, doubling the size of the company &#8212; we now have people working from 17 countries.</p>
<p>Once things stabilized &#8212; albeit at a new, faster pace &#8212; my partner broached the topic again. If we’re remote anyway, what’s the difference between being remote from down the street or in another country? She had a point. Either way, we’re not in the office. It’s not as if I would be the only person working remotely &#8212; we all were.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We worked together to come up with some criteria. First, any location we chose had to be no more than a time zone or two outside of Paris, to make communication with the office smoother. Second, any apartment we rented had to have reliable, high-speed internet and two separate workspaces or nearby space, like a café or coworking space, since we’d both be working remotely. Third, I would need to travel back to Paris every four to six weeks, primarily to reduce my anxiety about being away.</p>
<p>We started off with a one-month trip to Iceland, where we worked from an Airbnb with a beautiful view of the mountains. We kept the same hours as we did before and did meetings via video conferences, the same way we did in Paris.</p>
<p>The only difference is when we were able to take a break from work, we used our time to explore and have new experiences. I remember speaking to one of our investors from Iceland, and he remarked on the view in my background &#8212; he didn’t realize I wasn’t in Paris and didn’t mind at all. He said that as long as the company was growing &#8212; and it was &#8212; he didn’t care where my desk was located.</p>
<p>The trip went so well that we decided to do this for a year. After a quick reset in Paris, we moved on to Barcelona for two months and then Greece. As I write this, I’m in Paris for a week and then we leave for Amsterdam. Next on our itinerary are trips to Scotland, Sweden and Norway.</p>
<p>We don’t consider ourselves on vacation &#8212; both my partner and I are still working fairly intense hours. We make the most of our off time but are primarily focused on work.</p>
<p>Here’s my advice if you decide to do this yourself:</p>
<p>Consider staying in a similar time zone to your usual office to make your travel less disruptive for others. You don’t want everyone to have to reschedule regular calls and video meetings, for instance.</p>
<p>Check and double-check the internet quality of every destination. We have stayed primarily at Airbnbs — I not only asked hosts about internet quality but also had them send me screenshots of speed tests. I also scout local coworking spaces in advance in case there is a problem with the internet, so I can get resettled quickly if needed.</p>
<p>Dress each morning as if you are going to work. This helps you not fall into vacation mode and stay in a work mindset.</p>
<p>Keep the same hours and routine as you did at home. Wake up at the same time, have your tea or coffee at the same time, and head to your desk.</p>
<p>Curate your remote work kit. Initially, I traveled with much more than I actually needed. Now I’m down to a laptop, a foldable laptop stand, a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, and a noise-canceling headset and mic. Have as few wires as possible. Initially, I had a mini router in case of emergencies, but I’ve learned that using my phone as a hotspot works just as well, and even that I’ve needed sparingly.</p>
<p>Very few people (at least in tech) work 9 to 5 — we are all connected, all the time. Often, we’re working with customers, colleagues and investors in different countries. Asynchronous communications have become the norm. Even before the pandemic, there were Livestorm employees and investors based in other countries whom I’d never met in person.</p>
<p>Over the past year as we&#8217;ve almost fully remote, we’ve doubled our headcount and nearly doubled revenue. We also closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/livestorm-series-b/">$30 million funding round</a>, completely via email and video conferencing.</p>
<p>Our Paris office has reopened, but in a different format — it’s now organized as more of a co-working space, with room for 30 (our total head count is more than 150). Staff who want to come in can make a reservation, and we have more meeting and hangout space than we used to, since most people who come in are there to collaborate with others.</p>
<p>The weeks I’m in Paris, I go in for meetings most days — but often can still be found working from a Paris apartment, which could be anywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WhatsApp is launching a new feature called ‘Collections’ to make it easier for users to shop for items using categories. The Facebook-owned platform is rolling out catalog collections to small businesses around the world starting today.</p>
<p>The new collections feature essentially allows businesses to organize items in their catalogs by category so customers won’t have to scroll through long lists of items to find what they’re looking for and can instead go directly to what they want to shop for.</p>
<p>For instance, restaurants can create collections featuring appetizers, entrees and desserts, while a clothing store could add collections for men’s clothes, women’s clothes, shirts, pants and more. Once shoppers have browsed collections, they can add items to their carts and send the order to the business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We want to make WhatsApp the best way for people to shop for goods and services and for businesses to connect with their customers, which is why we are making it easier to see what a business offers on WhatsApp,” the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>WhatsApp first rolled out its ‘<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/whatsapps-latest-feature-catalogs-caters-to-small-businesses-skipping-the-web-for-mobile/">Catalogs</a>’ feature in 2019 to allow businesses to showcase their products and services to potential customers who could then browse photos and view prices. The catalogs effectively serve as a mobile storefront on WhatsApp — and one that can be operated without the need for a web page at all. The company then launched its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/facebook-adds-carts-to-whatsapp-to-make-shopping-easier/"> ‘Carts’ feature</a> last year to make it easier for consumers to buy multiple items from a business and for merchants to keep better track of order inquiries and manage requests.</p>
<p>WhatsApp has added a number of shopping features in recent years to expand the e-commerce experience on its app. Most recently, Facebook added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">&#8216;Shops&#8217;</a> on WhatsApp to give customers the option to chat with businesses before buying something. Since Facebook has been pushing e-commerce on platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/instagram-adds-affiliate-and-shop-features-for-creators/">Instagram</a>, it makes sense that it&#8217;s doing the same for WhatsApp too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.upequity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UpEquity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a digital mortgage company that makes cash offers on a buyer’s behalf, announced today it has raised $20 million in equity funding and secured $30 in debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S3 Ventures led the equity raise, which brings the startup’s total funding haul since its 2019 inception to $77 million, with $29.15 million of that in equity. Next Coast Ventures, BP Capital Management, Alumni Ventures, Gaingels, Launchpad Capital and Early Light Ventures also put money in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many digital lenders out there (Better.com being among the higher-profile ones). And there are also many companies that will make cash offers on behalf of buyers. But there aren’t many that do both. (We </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/accept-inc-secures-90m-in-debt-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overed the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of another such startup, Accept.inc, in June).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220678" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with TechCrunch, UpEquity co-founder and CEO Tim Herman said the company has seen 500% year-over-year growth in revenue and transaction volume. He expects that it will originate more than $1 billion in mortgages over the next 12 months. UpEquity has so far worked with “thousands” of buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup pledges faster closing times, thanks to its mortgage underwriting technology &#8212; saying that it reduces closings from the industry standard of about 50 days to 18, Herman said. Its goal within the next year is to reduce that to an average 10-day close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also claims to offer lower interest rates than other companies in what it describes as the “power buying” space, with no incremental fees. UpEquity, he said, also can turn clients into all-cash buyers so they don’t risk losing a desired home in a competitive situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the first time in history, single family homes are an institutional asset class,” Herman told TechCrunch. “You have Blackstone and other private equity firms or sovereign wealth funds that are buying full neighborhoods with all-cash offers. And so, in this environment with constrained supply and increased demand, the average American is being excluded from accessing single-family housing, And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here to help solve.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herman met co-founder Louis Wilson while both were at Harvard Business School. They started the company in the spring of 2019 and participated in Y Combinator’s summer batch that year. UpEquity officially made Austin its home base in 2020. Since then, it has grown its team from about 15 to 90 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can automate the underwriting of a mortgage, there&#8217;s three things that you can do. You can remove cost from the mortgage, and you can increase speed and add certainty to that mortgage,” Herman said. “And we take that speed and certainty, and use that to create an all-cash offer for our borrowers that we can give them for free.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like other lenders, UpEquity makes its revenue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on a portion of the interest that a buyer pays over the life of the loan. Not all of its customers take advantage of the company’s ability to make an all-cash offer, but the “vast majority” do, according to Herman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Herman said, the mortgage industry has claimed they are going to have a digital mortgage, but “all they have done is put a slick user interface on the front end and poured money into marketing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But then if you look under the hood, it looks like technology from 1985,” he added. “And so, what we think really differentiates us is that we are the only company that has focused our technology on the back end of producing a mortgage.” As such, Herman said, UpEquity&#8217;s true competition is not other startups, but the legacy mortgage industry “that has failed to innovate, and is driving such bad user experience to consumers everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UpEquity is licensed in Texas, Colorado, Florida, Illinois and Georgia. It plans to expand state by state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S3 Ventures partner Charlie Plauche, who is taking a board seat as part of the financing, believes the company is solving a “very real, growing” problem in the mortgage industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Large institutional investors are buying up housing inventory at a record pace and winning bids by making all-cash offers and promising quick close times,” he wrote via email. “The average consumer is going to have to be able to make similar offers in order to buy their dream home and UpEquity empowers them to do that with their accelerated close times and all-cash offers.”    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plauche also believes that the company’s ability to make cash offers for buyers for no additional cost helps set it apart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Other mortgage companies charge up to 2% on the mortgage for a cash offer option,” he said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.stampli.com/">Stampli</a>, a SaaS company that streamlines corporate invoice management, has announced the launch of Stampli Card.</p>
<p>The idea here is that some corporations sign on with vendors who only accept, or prefer to accept, credit card payments. This can lead to something Stampli refers to as &#8216;shadow spend.&#8217; When a corporation pays a vendor through ACH or by check or even through a third-party payments service, there are usually pretty strict rules and procedures about how those invoices and payments are handled.</p>
<p>When a vendor asks for credit payment, that can get thrown off. It can end up on an employee&#8217;s corporate card or something else without the same stringent processes, leading to a breakdown in the system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220872" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With Stampli Card, accounts payable or other departments within the organization can create a digital card with a set limit, expiration date, etc. to pay out the vendor without abandoning the system already set in place. For example, Accounts Payable can issue, limit, suspend or cancel cards at any time, as well as control who is authorized to make the purchase, spending limits, and how often the card can be used. AP can even pre-define fields of the payment, such as GL-coding or the vendor.</p>
<p>Once used, Stampli Card transactions are automatically captured and processed just like other invoices and the cardholder is reminded to upload the supporting documentation, such as a receipt.</p>
<p>For now, Stampli Card is fully digital, but the company has plans to offer a physical card soon.</p>
<p>Stampli Card is built on top of the Stampli platform, which integrates all payments into a single system. Whether organizations are paying through ACH, check, direct pay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/stampli-an-invoice-management-software-startup-launches-a-payments-product/">(which the company launched this year)</a>, or card, everything goes through Stampli&#8217;s software to help accounts payable manage the finances of the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Yiky7ddwr4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/stampli-raises-50-million-in-series-c-to-help-companies-intelligently-manage-invoices/">Stampli raises $50 million in Series C to help companies intelligently manage invoices</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Stampli raises $50 million in Series C to help companies intelligently manage invoices&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/stampli-raises-50-million-in-series-c-to-help-companies-intelligently-manage-invoices/embed/#?secret=Yiky7ddwr4" data-secret="Yiky7ddwr4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In May, Stampli raised a $50 million Series C led by Insight Partners. At the time, the company was seeing $20 billion in transaction volume on the platform, with around 1,000 customers. Today, Stampli has about 1,200 customers and is seeing $26 billion in transaction volume via those customers.</p>
<p>The company has raised just under $85 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge for a company like Stampli is that we&#8217;re scaling really fast,&#8221; said CEO Eyal Feldman. &#8220;We want to make sure we keep the same values and customer-centric approach, which works really well for us. This is what keeps me up at night &mdash; how to bring in the right people and how to modify the processes in order to make sure that our customers continue to experience the same intimate relationship with us as a company, even as we grow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show, the time of the week when we niche down to a single topic. Today? The written word.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> got together to dig into the recent NerdWallet IPO filing, and what it can tell us about how the written word &#8212; in its digital form &#8212; can still be worth quite a lot. Here&#8217;s an outline of the chat:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220397" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>NerdWallet shows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/nerdwallets-ipo-filing-reveals-high-margin-content-business-accelerating-marketing-spend/">the financial power of the written word</a>, even if it isn&#8217;t the precise form of writing that we know and love.</li>
<li>Automattic is a large, startup bet on the written word, amongst other things. Danny had notes for us on the scale of its business, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1/">thanks to a new TC-1 </a>all about the publishing empire. Here we talked about the importance of proving value internally, before going external with word power.</li>
<li>And from <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/bringing-books-tiktok-era-amazons-kindle-vella-rise-new-story-platforms/">Kindle Vella</a> to <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/what-i-learned-from-a-year-on-substack">Substack</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/memberful-a-patreon-subsidiary-launches-a-newsletter-product-to-challenge-substack/">Memberful</a> from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/patreon-business/">Patreon,</a> there are more and more models for getting paid to write these days. Hell, you can charge for your <em>tweets</em> now.</li>
</ul>
<p>We were left with questions about if the return of text is inevitable, in an everyone-runs-to-video world. As Natasha notes, distribution is still a bottleneck and human attention is not entirely predisposed to sitting around reading things. But with Gen Z perhaps a little over screentime, perhaps there&#8217;s good news ahead for writers of all stripes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alphabet today announced that Walgreens is partnering with Wing to bring drone-based deliveries to a portion of Texas’s Dallas-Forth Worth region. The drugstore giant will be the first to take advantage of a new rapid drone deployment system being unveiled by the Alphabet subsidy.</p>
<p>In the lead up to this week’s announcement, Wing has been testing drone flights at the Fort Worth-based Hillwoods AllianceTexas Flight Test Center. In the coming weeks, it will begin test flights in the city of Frisco and town of Little Elm in the surrounding region, with further commercial expansion expected in the coming months.</p>

<p>Alphabet has been testing systems in Australia for some time now and has operated small-scale deliveries in the Virginia town of Christiansburg since 2019. The company says it has been working with the FAA to begin expanding into more densely populated areas. A representative told TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>In April of 2019, Wing became the first drone operator to be certified as an air carrier by the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing us to deliver commercial goods to recipients miles away, and we got an expanded version of that permission to launch in Virginia in October 2019. Now, we&#8217;re working toward permissions for this expansion, and we&#8217;ll be conducting test flights and demonstrating our new capabilities in the area in the coming weeks as part of that process. Prior to launching our service in DFW, we will work with authorities at the local, state and federal levels to secure all the appropriate permissions.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this initial implementation, drones will take off from the Walgreens parking lot. The system, which effectively uses the drone&#8217;s containers as hangars, can also be deployed on roofs or next to buildings.</p>
<p>“Until now, this type of service in the United States has been limited to smaller towns, where land usage is less crowded and complex,” said Alphabet in a release. “Wing’s reliable aircraft and advanced flight planning and routing capabilities make it uniquely capable of operating a highly automated drone delivery service in more crowded, complex operating environments.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify this morning <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/sell-merch-on-spotify-with-shopify">announced</a> a new partnership with e-commerce platform provider Shopify that will allow artists on its service to connect their Spotify profiles with their Shopify stores, allowing them to market their merchandise directly to fans through the Spotify app. After connecting their Spotify for Artists accounts with their Shopify online store, artists will be able to sync their product catalog to Spotify to showcase whichever products they choose on their profile in the streaming music app.</p>
<p>From there, fans will be able to browse the products and make purchases. In addition to enabling easier access to artists&#8217; existing Shopify stores, the integration could offer an additional revenue stream for artists that had not yet established a merchandise website, and could give those who already have a website elsewhere a reason to switch to Shopify&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>Shopify says it already powers the websites for thousands of artists who are expanding their businesses beyond music alone to build &#8220;fully realized&#8221; brands.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220866" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Artists today are entrepreneurial. They’re building multifaceted brands and businesses, and now we’re making it easier for them to meet fans where they are,&#8221; said Amir Kabbara, Spotify&#8217;s Director of Product, in a statement. &#8220;By bringing entrepreneurship to Spotify, we’re empowering artists to think beyond the traditional merch table with new ways to monetize, and to experiment with their brands through commerce.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220900" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220900" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220900" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-9.55.14-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-9.55.14-AM.jpg 1944w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-9.55.14-AM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-9.55.14-AM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-9.55.14-AM.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-9.55.14-AM.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-9.55.14-AM.jpg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-9.55.14-AM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220900" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Shopify also says its larger app ecosystem could help artists enable new services, as well, like print-on-demand or product discovery tools. And Shopify&#8217;s infrastructure is able to manage high volumes of traffic for artists with large followings who may send surges at times &#8212; like when they drop new products, for example, Shopify added.</p>
<p>While the Shopify partnership is significant, it&#8217;s not the first time Spotify has teamed up with another company to give artists the ability to market their merchandise through its app. The comapny, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/20/spotify-merch/">for many years, </a>has offered artist profile integrations with other merchandise service providers. Currently, this includes a deal with <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/merchbar-to-power-artist-merch">Merchbar</a>, but in previous years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/13/spotify-teams-up-with-bandpage-to-jump-deeper-into-artist-merchandising/">Bandpage</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/20/spotify-merch/">Topspin</a>, have been partnered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Merchbar, artists can select 3 products to showcase on their profile. Now artists using Shopify can do the same.</p>
<p>To get started, artists will first log in to their Spotify for Artists dashboard on desktop, then go to the &#8220;Profile&#8221; tab, and click &#8220;Merch.&#8221; From there, they will pick the three items from their Shopify store to feature on their profile. At present, artists are only able to connect one Shopify store per artist.</p>
<p>To encourage sign-ups, Shopify is offering a 90-day free trial to all Spotify artists signing up for the first time.</p>
<p>However, the feature is currently in &#8220;beta,&#8221; Spotify says. While all artists globally can link their Shopify stores, the merch will only appear to listeners in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and the U.S. for the time being.</p>

<p>Both Shopify and Spotify have similar interests in enabling the new creator economy, though with different focus areas. Shopify sees its e-commerce platform as a complement to creator businesses of all kinds, while Spotify&#8217;s interest is more on artists (and now, podcast creators, too). In the past, Spotify has rolled out a number of other tools in the creator space, including those for <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://artists.spotify.com/blog/you-can-now-list-virtual-events-on-spotify&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634821314995000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHrzmsagCw-wYHNG0j428qhnD5DWA">ticketing</a>, <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://artists.spotify.com/blog/introducing-artist-fundraising-pick&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634821314995000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEZ9vamY-owyrHuomqTp3ktyCx_gQ">tipping</a>, and <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/blog/back-to-live-resources-and-tools-for-artists-returning-to-the-stage" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://artists.spotify.com/blog/back-to-live-resources-and-tools-for-artists-returning-to-the-stage&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634821314995000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_wbNL-YCwPycH-9_cq3MhYURVdw">Fans First emails</a>, to help artists grow their larger businesses.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, both companies&#8217; CEOs &#8212; Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, and Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke &#8212; participated in a Clubhouse <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel">session</a> where they talked about the many ways creators today were diversifying their monetization strategies.</p>
<p>At the time, Ek hinted towards the possibilities of working more closely with Shopify, when he noted how many artists were already using its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost every successful creator now is omni- talented and omnichannel,&#8221; he said at the time. &#8220;That means that they are on YouTube putting up videos. They are on Instagram. They are perhaps putting together brands and putting it on Shopify, but they&#8217;re also putting out music and merchandise on Shopify and music on Spotify, of course, and touring. And so they&#8217;re really just doing a multitude of different things and connecting with their fan bases across many different platforms,&#8221; Ek had said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently no approved cures for Fragile X syndrome – the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fxs/data.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most common cause</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of inherited intellectual disability. At the moment, the treatments are designed to manage symptoms, from anxiety to OCD or in rare cases, seizures. But a new clinical trial is soon to be underway at a UK startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, drug discovery startup Healx announced that it has gained FDA investigational new drug status for a Phase 2a clinical trial on a repositioned drug (more on this later) for Fragile X syndrome. The study, which will evaluate the effects of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug on Fragile X, will begin by January 2022, per the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04823052?type=Intr">clinicaltrials.gov registration</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healx is one of a host of startups invested in using A.I for drug development and identification. So far, it has raised about $67 million in total funding – most recently the company closed a $56 Series B round in October 2019. Investors in Healx include Atomico, Balderton Capital, Amadeus Capital Partners, intel, Global Brain, btov partners, and angel investor Jonathan Milner. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220588" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healx’s platform, called <a href="https://healx.io/healnet/">Healnet</a>, uses machine learning to crawl through data on existing drugs, and potential disease targets, to find new connections. Healx’s platform can intake structured public or private data, or data that exists in other forms, like in scientific publications. Part of Healx’s approach is to use natural language processing to access data described in scientific literature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of that goes into the knowledge base, and then that&#8217;s basically the force our algorithms can use for the drug matching process,” Hall tells TechCrunch.  [The algorithms are] looking for the connections between the diseases, and the drugs that we can then take forward into preclinical and clinical trials.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.I-based Drug development is becoming a bigger piece of the A.I landscape. Funding for A.I.-based drug development skyrocketed to $13.5 billion between March 2020 and 2021, 4.5 times the amount of funding seen in 2019, according to </span><a href="https://aiindex.stanford.edu/report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AI Index 2021 Annual Report by Stanford University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Though some of that was likely influenced by the race to develop Covid-19 vaccines and drugs, there have still been some significant funding rounds (take <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-i-drug-discovery-platform-insilico-medicine-announces-255-million-in-series-c-funding/">Insilico Medicine</a>, which closed a $255m Series C round in June). Others have managed to strike </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d43747-021-00045-7"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deals with major pharmaceutical companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, Healx is focusing on rare diseases. Aside from Fragile X, the company has potential drug treatments for Pitt Hopkins syndrome in clinical planning, and 11 more candidates in preclinical development.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a number of other programs that are coming along,” says Hall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout that process, Healx has also worked closely with FRAXA – a non-profit research foundation focused on Fragile X. Michael Tranfaglia, the chief scientific officer and medical director of FRAXA, notes that Healx and FRAXA have worked together even before the clinical trial process, the step when patient organizations usually become involved in research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s unusual here is that we&#8217;ve been involved throughout the entire process,” he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been providing a lot of the information to the company that&#8217;s helped with the curation of these various datasets.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healx, so far, focuses on identifying drugs that already exist, rather than developing new ones – though Hall says developing new drugs isn’t off the table in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running studies on existing drugs (sometimes called drug repositioning) is far from unheard of, especially in the world of rare diseases. It lowers development costs, and has been proposed as one way to jumpstart research into rare diseases. These rare diseases are often overlooked because they can’t guarantee the same profit returns as treatments for common ailments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repurposed drugs, as one <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological-sciences/fulltext/S0165-6147(21)00006-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0165614721000067%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">2021 review paper</a> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trends in Pharmacological Sciences</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted, can reach patients in 3-12 years, compared to the 10-15 typically expected for new drugs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difficulty with drug repurposing is that, in the past, it hinged somewhat on dumb luck. </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/12/4/346/241233"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One 2011 paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pointed out that the next frontier in drug repurposing was “the ability to do it in a systematized and rational way as opposed to serendipity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healx’s approach that happens to be artificial intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healx’s clinical trial on potential Fragile X drugs will be the company’s first on a repositioned drug. But it has plans for more robust trials in the immediate future. Specifically, Healx sees this trial as the first phase of what the startup hopes will be an adaptive clinical study that will continue to test more drugs that have been identified by Healnet as candidates, and verified through preclinical testing.  </span></p>
<p>Hall explains that there are already plans to add two more drugs to that trial — t<span style="font-weight: 400;">he company didn&#8217;t to name the drugs they’re testing out of fears they might inspire off label-use. He did explain, that all together, the three drugs work on three different mechanisms of action related to Fragile X syndrome. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the trial will evaluate how well the drugs work against two major categories of endpoints in Fragile X research: cognitive function, and anxiety-based endpoints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that, within the world of autism research (people with Fragile X are </span><a href="https://fragilex.org/understanding-fragile-x/fragile-x-syndrome/autism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">often</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also diagnosed with autism) the search for a cure, rather than a treatment, is no longer </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/cure-autism-not-so-fast-n1055921"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as central as it once was</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For some autism is just another way of existing in the world, not something that needs a cure in the first place. </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33563480/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other arguments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggest that it’s society, not biology that stands in the way of neurodivergent people living happy and “normal” lives. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4489963/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies have shown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that therapy and having an environment receptive to their needs are often helpful for people with Fragile X. Drug-based treatments do play a role in managing symptoms like hyperactivity or anxiety. Still, as Tranfaglia points out, some of the symptom management drugs out there right now can be lackluster or lead to uncomfortable side effects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, children who are treated for hyperactivity might find that drugs increase their anxiety, he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a giant game of Whack-a-Mole where you go after one symptom and you hit that with a drug but then that ends up causing side effects in another area that makes something worse,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future study on three different drugs may feel like it has a lot of moving parts. Healx’s approach is, as Hall puts it, to put “multiple shots on goal.” These multiple shots, notes Tranfaglia, also fits with the idea that it will likely take more than one drug to tackle rare diseases, like Fragile X. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately we&#8217;re looking to figure out what are the best two or three drug combinations for each of these 7000 rare diseases that can be made out of these one or 200 repurposing candidates,” Tranfaglia says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study is still just a first step. But it will be a test of a larger trend in rare disease treatment: that drugs already in existence may make a difference, we just haven’t had the tools to find them yet. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data is everywhere inside organizations, and employees are increasingly trying to find ways to put it to work to improve business outcomes. <a href="http://hex.tech/">Hex</a>, a startup that wants to simplify how data scientists and other employees gather and share data, announced a $16 million Series A today. The round comes just a little over 6 months after the startup announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/hex-lands-5-5m-seed-to-help-data-scientists-share-data-across-the-company/">$5.5 million seed round</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s investment was led by Redpoint Ventures with help from previous investors Amplify Partners, as well as Data Community Fund, Geometry, Operator Collective, Tokyo Black, Vandelay Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital and various unnamed industry angels. Hex has now raised a total of $21.5 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>The startup has not been sitting still since that seed round when it was offering a beta of its fledgling product. Today it has a more complete product, says CEO and co-founder Barry McCardel. &#8220;We just released an all new version we&#8217;re calling Hex 2.0 and it fundamentally changes the way a lot of data science workflows work,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220617" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As we described the tool at the time of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/hex-lands-5-5m-seed-to-help-data-scientists-share-data-across-the-company/">$5.5 million seed round</a> in March:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most data scientists work with their data in online notebooks like Jupyter, where they can build SQL queries and enter Python code to organize it, chart it and so forth. What Hex is doing is creating this super-charged notebook that lets you pull a data set from Snowflake or Amazon Redshift, work with and format the data in an easy way, then drag and drop components from the notebook page — maybe a chart or a data set — and very quickly build a kind of app that you can share with others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hex is going after established data science notebook tools like Jupyter, which McCardel acknowledges is popular, but comes with a lot of baggage. &#8220;So, traditionally code notebooks like Jupyter have been really popular, but they have major issues with reproducibility, interpretability and performance. These are pretty well known.&#8221;  Hex 2.0 is designed to resolve those issues, he said.</p>
<p>Today they&#8217;ve got dozens of customers and are up from 5 employees at the time of the seed announcement to 18 today with plans to get to around 24 by the end of the year. With a diverse founding team that includes CTO Caitlin Colgrove and Chief Architect Glen Takahashi, the company wants to build a company that reflects the diversity of that group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Building a diverse team is something we&#8217;ve put a lot of energy and intentionality into from day one. And for us it means making sure that every part of our recruiting process is set up to be as equitable as possible from sourcing to interviewing to the offer stage. And there&#8217;s a bunch of things we&#8217;ve done embracing distributed hiring and reaching out and partnering with diverse communities and trying to open up new opportunities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company also announced a partnership with <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt Labs</a>, which is in the data transformation space, helping to take data in stored in data warehouses like Snowflake and preparing it to be analyzed in a tool like Hex. The two companies will share several integrations to make it easier to work in either application without having to jump between them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.element.fi">Element Finance</a> has raised a $32 million Series A round at a $320 million valuation. The company has been building a new DeFi (decentralized finance) protocol on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It lets you earn predictable returns on investments thanks to fixed rates over a predetermined period of time.</p>
<p>Polychain Capital is leading today’s funding round. Other new investors include Republic, Advanced Blockchain, P2P Validator, Rarestone, Ethereal Ventures and their limited partners. Some of the company’s existing investors are investing once again, such as Andreessen Horowitz, Placeholder, A_Capital, and Scalar Capital. Finally, there’s a <a href="https://medium.com/element-finance/element-finance-raises-32m-series-a-at-a-320m-valuation-6622fab5fb40">long list</a> of DeFi builders who participated in the round.</p>
<p>Element Finance is still relatively new as the company launched its protocol on the Ethereum mainnet on June 30. But it has been quite successful already as there are currently the equivalent of $180 million in total value-locked.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220842" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Users can currently participate in ten different <a href="https://app.element.fi/fixedrates/">fixed-rate pools</a>. They can contribute with stablecoins, such as DAI or USDC, with popular (wrapped) cryptocurrencies, such as wBTC, or with sophisticated deriative assets, such as steCRV — steCRV is a token that represents a stake in the <a href="https://curve.fi">Curve</a> ETH/stETH liquidity pool.</p>
<p>While this is already a cool product for individual investors, Element Finance also wants to convince fund managers to invest in an Element pool. The company has launched a <a href="https://medium.com/element-finance/introducing-elements-treasury-management-initiative-bbebbd99f89">treasury management initiative</a> to convince other DeFi protocol makers, funds and institutions that they should allocate a portion of their capital to Element Finance.</p>
<p>In order to guarantee fixed rates, some users can opt for higher returns. They contribute to liquidity pools with variable interests. But in that case you can’t predict your returns at the end of the year.</p>
<p>So far, 9,000 users have tried Element Finance. The company plans to introduce a <a href="https://medium.com/element-finance/an-introduction-to-elements-governance-model-efea13d1c7ee">governance system</a> with different voting vaults and different incentives. With today’s funding round, Element Finance will hire more people across all areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Modern Age provides digital tools to help users demystify and understand their aging options, including telemedicine and in-person treatments.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aging is inevitable, but <a href="https://modern-age.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Age</a> wants to help you do it in a way that is healthier.</p>
<p>Melissa Eamer, former vice president at Amazon and COO at Glossier, is behind the company, which is announcing $27 million in Series A funding led by Oak HC/FT.</p>
<p>Longevity has a personal component for her: As she watched her parents age, she saw the differences between her mother and her mother’s friends and got to thinking about how, in the second half of life, some people will thrive while others can decline rapidly.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220506" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“For example, what genetics and her environment is in her control,” said Eamer, who went to business school with the intention of getting into long-term care, but ended up finding it difficult to find a long-term care company that wanted an MBA. Instead, it was Amazon that gave her the foundation for customer focus and using technology to solve problems.</p>
<p>As such, Modern Age wants to help people live longer, healthier lives, providing digital tools to help users understand their aging options, including telemedicine and in-person treatments. While researching the topic, Eamer came across research that when you feel younger, you live longer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“That got me thinking about health and wellness to manage how you feel,” she added. “There are a lot of spot solutions out there, like going to the dermatologist for age spots, but not a lot of companies connecting the dots between all of the factors: nutrition, sleep, fitness, hair, skins, bones and metabolism. Humans are not great at these data points, but computers are, and using that, we have built something powerful.”</p>
<p>Users start by taking an assessment across variables to determine how old they feel and areas of health and wellness that are most important. The company plans to launch initially in the areas of skin, hair, bones and hormones.</p>
<p>For example, signs of aging in skin and hair are noticeable beginning in your 30s, which is also the time when people begin losing bone mass, something Eamer said is not talked about much. In addition, hormones affect how much energy you have, and Eamer says there is a lot of misinformation and a general lack of information, like women don’t realize that lower testosterone can lead to fatigue.</p>
<p>Also participating in the round are GV and founding partner Juxtapose, which gave the company a seed round in 2020, to bring the company’s total funding to $33 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much like some of our other successes in the health and wellness space, like Care/of or Tend Dental, we see Modern Age as another opportunity to utilize technology in a way that creates a hyper-personalized experience for customers and can lead to better resources and patient care,” Jed Cairo, co-founder and managing partner at Juxtapose, said via email.</p>

<p>A large portion of the new funding will be used to build out Modern Age’s flagship clinic in New York’s Flatiron district that is expected to open in early 2022. In addition, the company will invest in talent, technology development and customer engagement.</p>
<p>The company is now at 17 employees, and Eamer expects to grow to 50, not including the staff in the clinic, by the end of 2022. The clinic will have its own clinicians and medical team. She also will be hiring a chief medical officer to work with her as well.</p>
<p>Annie Lamont, co-founder and managing partner at Oak HC/FT, said the science of longevity is still in the early stages and it is going to be a major area of investment. Indeed, companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/longevity-startup-longevica-plans-to-launch-supplements-based-on-long-term-research/">Longevica</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/longevity-startup-gero-ai-has-a-mobile-api-for-quantifying-health-changes/">Gero AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/rosita-longevity-wants-to-teach-seniors-how-to-live-long-healthy-lives/">Rosita Longevity</a> recently were in the news about their approaches and attracting funding.</p>
<p>Lamont says Eamer “is incredibly experienced and grounded in sciences” and wants to build a company that is bringing clarity to consumers to become a trusted entity and credible voice to the topic of longevity.</p>
<p>“There are piecemeal attempts right now, and how people feel matters, as does the science,” she added. “Modern Age may not provide all of the services, but it will be a place to find out the truth of both the virtual and physical space and will have evolving services.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a>, the outsized fintech out of San Francisco that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $95 billion</a>, is making another acquisition to expand the services it offers alongside its core payments product. The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.recko.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recko</a>, which has built a platform that lets businesses track and automate payments reconciliation, covering both outgoing and incoming payments and the full ecosystem of inbound and outbound payment sources and receivers. Like Stripe itself, Recko leans heavily on APIs to integrate and work with different data sources.</p>
<p>Recko is based out of Bangalore, India, and significantly this will be Stripe&#8217;s first acquisition in the country when the acquisition officially closes (based on customary closing conditions),</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, Stripe tells us. For some background, though, Recko had raised about $7 million prior to this, with <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/268427-98/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors</a> including Vertex Ventures, Prime Venture Partners, and a number of individuals, including Taavet Hinirikus, the co-founder and former CEO of Wise (nee TransferWise). Founded in 2017 and based out of India, Recko had been seeing a lot of traction internationally, with Deliveroo, Meesho and PharmEasy among its wider list of customers. (That base and the crossover it has with Stripe&#8217;s customer base may well have been the trigger for getting on Stripe&#8217;s radar.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Stripe will begin integrating Recko into its wider payments stack, but also notes that existing Recko users will be able to continue using it as before. From the looks of it, the plan is not to limit any of the functionality of the product, which today is partly so effective because of how it precisely works across so much of the fragmentation you already have in the world of accounting and finance.</p>
<p>The acquisition is the latest move from Stripe to build out more services beyond basic payments, a way of capturing more revenue from existing customers, and more customers overall, in particular those seeing platforms that let them handle accounting and other work that goes hand-in-hand with taking or making payments.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Stripe acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/stripe-acquires-bouncer-will-integrate-its-card-authentication-into-the-radar-fraud-detection-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouncer</a> to integrate card authentication; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/stripe-acquires-taxjar-to-add-cloud-based-automated-sales-tax-tools-into-its-payments-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TaxJar</a> to bring in automatic sales tax tools. International acquisitions &#8212; others have included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paystack</a> in Nigeria and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/stripe-acquires-touchtech-updates-apis-to-prep-for-strong-customer-authentication-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Touchtech</a> in Ireland &#8212; have also been made strategically both to serve a wider network of territories and to tap into local expertise in those markets. Recko ticks both of those boxes.</p>
<p>Other features and products launched by Stripe to cover other aspects of the payments process include revenue recognition, billing and invoicing services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stripe&#8217;s moves come as part of a bigger consolidation we&#8217;ve been seeing in the world of fintech: a number of strong players have emerged covering very specific &#8220;point solutions&#8221; in the wider payments ecosystem, and so the stronger platform providers (and Stripe is among them) are now making moves to bring all of these together in the name of more convenience and efficiency for users, and better margins for Stripe itself.</p>
<p>“Payments reconciliation shouldn’t be a mild headache that balloons into a migraine as a company grows—it should be an easy, highly automated process,” said Will Gaybrick, Stripe’s Chief Product Officer, in a <a href="https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/recko" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> announcing the deal. “Stripe helps millions of businesses around the world streamline their revenue management—from subscriptions and invoicing to revenue recognition and bookkeeping. With Recko, we’ll automate their payments reconciliation, a critical input into their overall financial health.”</p>
<p>Reconciliation is one of the trickier aspects of a business, regardless of whether it&#8217;s a sole trader, and SMB or a larger organization, as it involves balancing money going in and out simultaneously across multiple parties, and the various fees that are potentially paid as that money moves around. The bigger an operation (regardless of organization size), the more complex it becomes. The smaller the organization, the more critical the work is since it&#8217;s closely linked to cashflow (and cashflow is often one of the bigger problems for smaller businesses: one reason why Stripe has also built a working capital product to advance money to customers that need it).</p>
<p>A diagram that Recko provides of where it sits in the payments and accounting environment really speaks to just how much integration of so many services is involved:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2220831" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="313" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png 2282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=768,354 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=680,313 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=1536,708 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=2048,944 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Of course, the other side of that argument is that a one-stop-shop leads to less competition, since Stripe offering an all-in-one solution becomes too compelling to pass up. (And while there remains a lot of competition in the world of payments, the competition argument becomes more serious when it gets applied in antitrust investigations when that bigger competitive landscape begins to disappear, for example when one platform, like Facebook&#8217;s or Microsoft&#8217;s, has been seen too much of the ecosystem in a particular area.)</p>
<p>Others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/primer-raises-50m-at-a-425m-valuation-for-a-framework-designed-to-help-merchants-build-more-powerful-payment-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primer</a>, which announced a fundraise this week, present another approach, building a platform that makes it easy for businesses to keep using a wide variety of services together, with less pain in the process.</p>
<p>For the startup, it&#8217;s a window to scaling in a way that would have been more challenging on its own, aligned with one of the bigger and interesting privately-held companies (I guess we can&#8217;t call Stripe a startup anymore?) out there challenging the established players in financial services.</p>
<p>“Joining Stripe is a perfect next chapter for Recko, and we can’t wait to help grow the GDP of the internet by removing the burden of reconciliation complexity,” commented Saurya Prakash Sinha, CEO and co-founder of Recko, in a statement. “Internet businesses need tools that can scale with their growth and automate the tasks required to produce an accurate picture of their financial health.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A company from the creator of Ello and Kidrobot is announcing a new $20 million funding round to build out an imagined virtual world populated with deranged-yet-cute cartoon influencers.</p>
<p><a href="https://superplastic.co/">Superplastic</a>&#8216;s investors include Google Ventures, Index Ventures, Founders Fund, Craft Ventures, Galaxy Digital, Mantis VC/The Chainsmokers, Kakao, LINE Friends and individual investors like Cyan Bannister, Jared Leto, Justin Timberlake and Scooter Braun, among others. The $20 million Series A round brings the company’s total capital raised to $38 million.</p>
<p>Superplastic’s proposition is a strange one. The company owns an animated collab house of “synthetic superstars” — characters who live on social media and pop up everywhere else through partnerships with celebrities, iconic fashion brands and gaming platforms. The company has already racked up millions of followers across Instagram and TikTok, sold millions in NFTs and built up a bustling Discord community, all around a stable of violent, fashion-forward cartoon characters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220536" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Everything is driven by the characters and the story&#8230; and in a way Superplastic [is] the management team,&#8221; Superplastic founder Paul Budnitz told TechCrunch.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Budnitz is aiming high, aspiring to build his own “fucked up Disney.” Guggimon, one of Superplastic’s central characters, intermittently tortures his counterpart and models virtual Gucci gear — just one of Superplastic’s many lucrative partnerships. Guggimon also popped up in one of Fortnite’s recent seasons, not just as a skin but as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens">full-blown featured character</a>, appearing next to Superman. Meanwhile, Superplastic&#8217;s relationship with LINE and Kakao is already helping the characters gain a foothold in Asian markets that Kidrobot never quite pulled off.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Superplastic is also deep into the NFT phenomenon, which makes sense given Budnitz’s experience shaping the world of IRL collectibles with KidRobot. But he wasn’t always a believer. Budnitz told TechCrunch that he dismissed the phenomenon at first. “With the NFT thing, I was like nah, this shit is stupid. Suddenly I totally fucking got it all at once.&#8221; (Budnitz also initially felt the same way about Bitcoin before meeting a mysterious crypto evangelist with “really long fingernails” at an event who talked him into investing.)</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Superplastic <a href="https://www.christies.com/about-us/press-archive/details?PressReleaseID=10144&amp;lid=1">partnered with Christie’s</a> for an NFT drop through the storied auction house, complete with its own fittingly chaotic fictional narrative about two of the characters blowing up the building in the process.</p>

<p>Superplastic dipped its toes into the wild world of digital collectibles starting in February, and now it’s running a full-blown Discord-based community known as the Jankyverse where members show off both the physical and digital figurines they’ve copped. Unlike most of the dime-a-dozen NFT projects churning out digital avatars, Superplastic developed its characters and fictional universe up front rather than tacking it on (or <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dyem/investors-spent-millions-on-evolved-apes-nfts-then-they-got-scammed">promising to tack it on</a>) after cashing in on the speculative craze driving astronomical prices on OpenSea.</p>
<p>Superplastic is doing the NFT thing, but that’s just one channel in what’s ultimately a platform-agnostic vision. The company is all about expanding its universe of fictional chaos across mediums and it’s already cashing in on toy sales, apparel, NFTs and licensing, like collaborations with Epic Games, virtual persona pioneer <a href="https://superplastic.co/collections/gorillaz-vinyl-art-toys-collectibles">Gorillaz</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CI6BjLRFgaZ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading&amp;hl=en">Gucci</a>.</p>
<p>The characters might be also all over the place, but Budnitz is very clear that his company won’t sell bits of the IP off — even in exchange for a major partnership. The company said no to Quibi before that company’s untimely demise last year and also turned down two streaming studios that wanted to own a piece of Superplastic’s characters in perpetuity.</p>
<p>With the new investment, Superplastic will run with its plans for an animated feature film slated for 2022 starring its disturbed cast of alt-Disney characters. The company also plans to open retail shops in New York and Miami early next year to tie its digital collectibles to exclusive IRL experiences like secret areas just for NFT holders in-store.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more interested in connecting the real world, not just doing stuff that&#8217;s all virtual,&#8221; Budnitz said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Digital traffic worldwide is increasingly done through mobile devices, and Embrace is bringing visibility to that data to companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies collect data from all of their users, but they don’t know what is good or bad data until it is collected and analyzed. Now in this increasingly mobile-first world, we use our phones for everything from apps to ordering to food to connecting with our cars.</p>
<p>Though these same companies have accelerated their digitalization to meet employees and customers where they are — up to 92% of all digital traffic worldwide is done through mobile devices — they lack visibility of this data and how it can be converted into retention and revenue.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://embrace.io/">Embrace</a> comes in. Founded in 2016, the Culver City-based observability and data company launched its Data Intelligence product following the raise of $45 million in Series B funding led by New Enterprise Associates. Joining NEA in the Series B are existing investors Greycroft, AV8 and Eniac, and a group of founders from PagerDuty, SendBird, LogDNA, Scopely and Testflight. The infusion of capital gives the company $57 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/embrace-io/company_financials">according to Crunchbase data</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220395" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2220408" style="width: 3850px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220408" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2220408 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg" alt="Embrace's User Timeline page" width="3840" height="2160" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220408" class="wp-caption-text">Embrace&#8217;s App Performance page. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Embrace</p></div></p>
<p>Its new Data Intelligence product enables organizations to make all of their mobile data accessible and actionable by their business intelligence and data science teams so that other departments, like engineering, product and marketing, can use that data to make better decisions about areas like new products and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>It joins previous products Observability and Resolution that can be used to proactively discover, prioritize and resolve regressions.</p>
<p>“This can be used across industries and for mobile apps like games and social media, but also for the next generation of digital-first industries as more mobile and IoT devices are being used as point-of-sale systems,” Eric Futoran, CEO of Embrace, told TechCrunch. “Mobile data can be disconnected from its user and very voluminous, and our product lets people like engineers look up a user and see what happened.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Embrace has a SaaS pricing model with both free and pro/enterprise tiers. It now works with more than 100 organizations, including Hyatt, GOAT, Apprentice, Glo, TextNow, Dave and ChowNow. Not only has it grown its customer base, but it has also increased its employee count to 45, which is nearly 400% since its last funding round in 2019. Futoran intends to continue that streak, noting that it will be over 100 within the next 12 months as a result of the new funding.</p>
<p>To keep up with growth, of which annual recurring revenue increased three times over the past year, he also intends to deploy the new funds to round out the company’s leadership team, to grow on the go-to-market side for enterprise companies and continue product development.</p>
<p>Embrace aims to verticalize data for mobile devices, for which the stakes are high, as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2020/02/28/50-stats-all-marketers-must-know-about-gen-z/?sh=6dbc9a4176d0">75% of all media consumed by Gen Z is on a mobile device</a>, Futoran said.</p>
<p>“When you think about experiences with phones, our expectations have never been higher,” he added. “We are pushing the lines of AI, mobile and observability to make sense of the data. That process has to be in real time and automated so that you can figure out what it is and fix it quickly, which is hard to do on mobile. It is a natural evolution for us, and we are going to provide data for those doing the AI and ML for decision making.”</p>

Around 142 million households worldwide watched the Korean-language show about debt-ridden individuals playing a deadly game for a cash prize worth tens of millions of dollars. That makes it the most-viewed new show in Netflix history, the publication said.</p>
<p><em>Squid Game</em> captured the &#8220;cultural zeitgeist&#8221; and claimed the number 1 spot in the streaming giant&#8217;s rankings in 94 countries, including the US, Netflix has revealed. Since there&#8217;s a huge demand for all things <em>Squid Game</em>, Netflix has also announced that consumer products based on the show are now on their way to retail.</p>

<p>Thanks in part to <em>Squid Game&#8217;s</em> massive viewership, Netflix said it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-19/netflix-tops-third-quarter-subscriber-views-sees-upbeat-fourth?sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">posted</a> its best subscriber growth of the year. &#8220;As the quarter continued, we saw an acceleration in our growth,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said on the call. It welcomed 4.38 million subscribers in the third quarter, mostly from Asia and Europe, and it expects to get 8.5 million more customers in the final quarter of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building usable models to run AI algorithms requires not just adequate data to train systems, but also the right hardware subsequently to run them. But because the theoretical and practical are often not the same thing, there is often a gap between what data scientists may hope to do and what they practically do. Today, a startup called <a href="https://deci.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deci</a> that has built a deep learning platform to help bridge that gap &#8212; by building models that can work with the data and hardware that are available to use &#8212; is announcing some funding after finding strong traction for its products with Fortune 500 tech companies running mass-market, AI-based products based on video and other computer vision-based services.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-based startup has picked up a Series A of $21 million, money that it will be using to continue expanding its product and customer base. Insight Partners is leading the round, with previous backers Square Peg, Emerge and Jibe Ventures, alongside some new backers: Samsung Next, Vintage Investment Partners, and Fort Ross Ventures. Square Peg and Emerge led Deci&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/deci-raises-9-1m-to-use-ai-to-optimize-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seed round of $9.1 million a year ago</a>. It also works very closely with others who are not strategic or financial investors (but may well be down the line?). Intel collaborated with it on<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deci-collaborates-with-intel-to-achieve-11-8x-accelerated-inference-speed-at-mlperf-301182412.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> MLPerf</a>, where Deci&#8217;s technology accelerates the inference speed of the ResNet-50 neural network when run on Intel CPUs.</p>
<p>Up to now, Deci has been focusing its attention on models for computer vision-based products, where its platform &#8212; built on its own proprietary AutoNAC (Automated Neural Architecture Construction) technology &#8212; is able to build, and continuously update, models quickly for services that might have otherwise taken longer, and a lot of trail and error, to devise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220792" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One key client, for example, is one of the world&#8217;s biggest and well-known videoconferencing platforms (unfortunately, name undisclosed) that is using Deci to build AI modeling so that users can blur their backgrounds in video calls. Here, all of the computing needed to execute that blurring is happening at &#8220;the edge&#8221;, on users&#8217; own CPU-based devices (that is, not typically optimized for AI workloads).</p>
<p>Yonatan Geifman, the CEO who co-founded Deci with Ran El-Yaniv and Jonathan Elial (a trio of AI specialists), said that the plan is now to start expanding from computer vision applications to another challenge, building better NLP (natural language) models, which you might need to run any kind of service with a voice interface, from personal assistants on phones or smart speakers through to audio-based search or any kind of customer service interface, for example.</p>
<p>Although Deci has picked up a lot of business by helping companies address the challenge of running AI services in a landscape of devices that are not necessarily optimized for AI, it has also found a lot of interest from organizations to use Deci to build better models for their own internal computing, even when they theoretically have the GPUs and compute power on hand to run anything. This taps into an interesting power balance that has long existed in enterprise IT and is very much getting played out in AI today, where enterprises will try to do more with the assets they have to hand, while at the same time they are regularly getting pushed to invest more in newer and more expensive and powerful equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a race to larger models all the time,&#8221; Geifman said in an interview, citing the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/using-deepspeed-and-megatron-to-train-megatron-turing-nlg-530b-the-worlds-largest-and-most-powerful-generative-language-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new language model</a> announced earlier this month by Nvidia and Microsoft as one example of that evolution. &#8220;So the hardware is just not enough. In one sense, maybe that race and drive to invest in new hardware is being pushed by the hardware makers themselves, but the models <em>are</em> getting larger. There is a gap, between the algorithm and the supply of the hardware. So, we need to have some convergence based on what hardware we have. Deci is bridging or even closing that gap.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With adequate training data being another perennial problem in AI, Deci is also working to give a boost on the data side of the equation. Geifman said that Deci essentially builds synthetic data sets to supplement data when more is needed to build the models. In all cases, the product works within organizations&#8217; developer environments, data stays where it is and does not go to Deci or anywhere else in the process of building the models.</p>
<p>Alongside that Deci is also using AutoNAC to build more products. The most recent of these is DeciNets, which Deci describes as &#8220;a family of computer vision models&#8221; that essentially skip some of the work of building models from the ground up and therefore using less compute power to run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deci is at the forefront of AI and deep learning acceleration, with highly differentiated technology that lets customers optimize blazingly fast deep learning models for inference tuned to any hardware platform,” said Lonne Jaffe, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “We are delighted to be part of Deci’s ScaleUp journey and look forward to supporting the company’s rapid growth.” Jaffe is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook &#8212; or whatever name the tech giant picks for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/facebook-reportedly-plans-to-change-its-name-to-focus-on-the-metaverse/">reportedly looming rebrand of its data-mining empire</a> as it seeks to teleport its business into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">metaverse</a> to escape the unending cavalcade of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">toxic publicity</a> its execs generate &#8212; has a new &#8216;bad behavior&#8217; badge to sport: It&#8217;s just been fined nearly $70 million (£50.5M) by a UK watchdog for deliberately withholding information related to ongoing antitrust oversight of its acquisition of Giphy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first time the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog has found a company to have breached this type of order &#8212; by &#8220;consciously refusing to report all the required information&#8221;, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-fines-facebook-over-enforcement-order-breach">as it puts it</a>.</p>
<p>So that looks like an epic win for Facebook&#8217;s current PR strategy of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiA4MPr2NjzAhURCewKHRg_CpEQFnoECAUQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fzuck%2Fposts%2F10113955029116581&amp;usg=AOvVaw0B23erwEIkDBpEVBjP3FsE">not giving two f***s</a> what anyone else thinks of it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The tech giant has also of course recently acquired an expensive taste in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/21/meet-facebooks-latest-fake/">self-configured &#8216;accountability apparatus&#8217;</a> (aka the self-styled &#8216;Facebook Oversight Board&#8217;) &#8212; which may have caused it some confusion over its legal requirements to comply with actual oversight bodies that exist within democratic societies.</p>
<p>But that might be a too generous an interpretation of what Facebook is doing here.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eNHOTq6hk7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">UK&#8217;s antitrust watchdog takes a closer look at Facebook-Giphy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK&#8217;s antitrust watchdog takes a closer look at Facebook-Giphy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/embed/#?secret=eNHOTq6hk7" data-secret="eNHOTq6hk7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The back story is that the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been scrutinizing Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of the animated GIF repository for well <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/12/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-facebooks-400m-acquisition-of-giphy/">over a year</a> now. But back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">April</a>, a new, in-depth phase of the probe was announced &#8212; after the regulator found concrete reasons to be concerned that Facebook owning Giphy would further reduce competition in the (already Facebook-dominated) digital advertising market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement at the time a faceless Facebook spokesperson claimed the tech giant would &#8220;continue to fully cooperate with the CMA’s investigation&#8221;. However it turns out even that Facebook claim was fake.</p>
<p>Per the CMA, Facebook has failed to follow the standard oversight process &#8212; failing to provide the regulator with required information related to an initial enforcement order (IEO) placed on it by the watchdog, despite repeated requests for it to do so.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s actions are such that they have led the CMA to conclude that non-compliance was deliberate. Hence the meaty penalty for what the CMA describes as a &#8220;major&#8221; breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time a company has been found by the CMA to have breached an IEO by consciously refusing to report all the required information,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Given the multiple warnings it gave Facebook, the CMA considers that Facebook’s failure to comply was deliberate. As a result, the CMA has issued a fine of £50 million for this major breach, which fundamentally undermined its ability to prevent, monitor and put right any issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tech giant was also criticised last year by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-welcomes-tribunal-judgment-in-facebook-and-giphy-case">Competition Appeal Tribunal</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-welcomes-court-judgment-in-facebook-and-giphy-case">Court of Appeal</a> over its lack of cooperation with the CMA &#8212; with judges calling it out over what they suggested “might be regarded as a high-risk strategy” in relation to not complying with the IEO and not keeping the CMA updated as the order required.</p>
<p>An IEO is intended to place a freeze on any further integration and ensure companies can continue to compete against each other in situations where an acquisition that&#8217;s under antitrust scrutiny has already been completed, as is the case with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">Facebook-Giphy buy</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook has been under a CMA IEO order since June 2020 in relation to its purchase of Giphy. But the watchdog said today that the tech giant &#8220;significantly limited&#8221; the scope of required updates related to its compliance with the order.</p>
<p>The concern driving what looks like an unprecedented penalty from the CMA appears to be both Facebook&#8217;s conscious flouting of standard compliance requirements, and the risk of it doing that to conceal what it&#8217;s doing with Giphy &#8212; in order to carry out activity that could, for example, make it harder for the watchdog to order a full unwinding of the acquisition &#8212; which is one of a number of <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6114d3e18fa8f53dc274c716/Facebook_GIPHY_Remedies_Notice_PV_120821.pdf">possible remedies it laid out this summer</a>. (And which Facebook <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-fights-british-watchdog-retain-gif-maker-giphy-2021-09-08/">quickly denounced</a> in a highly critical public response that also questioned the authority of the CMA to regulate the purchase at all.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another tidbit here too: The CMA has also issued a separate fine &#8212; stinging Facebook a further £500,000 for changing its Chief Compliance Officer on two separate occasions without first seeking consent from the regulator.</p>
<p>Commenting on the action in a statement, Joel Bamford, senior director of mergers at the CMA, said: &#8220;We warned Facebook that its refusal to provide us with important information was a breach of the order but, even after losing its appeal in two separate courts, Facebook continued to disregard its legal obligations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This should serve as a warning to any company that thinks it is above the law,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Explaining the IEO requirement Bamford also said: &#8220;Initial enforcement orders are a key part of the UK’s voluntary merger control regime. Companies are not required to seek CMA approval before they complete an acquisition but, if they decide to go ahead with a merger, we can stop the companies from integrating further if we think consumers might be affected and an investigation is needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook was contacted for a response to the CMA penalties &#8212; and in statement it criticized the action as &#8220;unfair&#8221;, claiming it had sought to take a &#8220;best effort compliance approach&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly disagree with the CMA’s unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. We will review the CMA’s decision and consider our options,” said Facebook&#8217;s unnamed spokesperson.</p>
<p>The company also provided some &#8220;background&#8221; information that it said this was not for direct quoting or for attribution &#8212; so we won&#8217;t be publishing it.</p>
<p>Instead, here&#8217;s a GIF:</p>
