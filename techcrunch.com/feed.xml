										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just a few years ago it seemed like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rocket-lab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rocket-lab">Rocket Lab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was going to be an up-and-comer in the launch world, and so they are today — in addition to going reusable, creating a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/rocket-lab-secretly-launched-its-very-first-satellite-first-light/">low-cost satellite platform</a>, and planning a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/rocketlab-tests-new-hypercurie-engine-that-will-power-its-deep-space-delivery-vehicle/">mission to Venus</a>. CEO and Founder Peter Beck, speaking at TC Sessions: Space, talked about how he and the company have taken on ever more responsibilities without burning out.</p>
<p>The company just had a successful launch earlier this week, and a month ago demonstrated its first ever recovery of an Electron vehicle&#8217;s first stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a really great flight, we got way further than we thought, and the stage looks in fantastic condition,&#8221; he said of that accomplishment. &#8220;The next phase for us of this program is to do the mid-air capture with the helicopter, so we don&#8217;t dunk the stage in the water.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reusable rockets could change the economics for small launch, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economics of small launch against larger rideshares are always going to be different, because you have a much smaller launch vehicle to amortize your costs over,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;However, this is the reason that small dedicated launch is so valuable, you get your own rocket and all the things that comes with that. But if you can get that and have a platform that&#8217;s closer to rideshare costs, then that&#8217;s really transformational for the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding the loss of a vehicle in July, Beck said that it was tough but not unexpected in this industry.</p>
<p>

		</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the day that you wish never comes, but it&#8217;s the day that will always come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The thing is about Rocket Lab — this is the magic, right? — no more than seconds after we realized that we had an anomaly on our hands, the team was already working it. it was an incredibly stressful time within the company, and a lot of people were sleeping under their desks, but this is the thing with this team, if you throw something hard at us, we&#8217;re just going to work harder. And that was exactly what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Rocket Lab had concluded its investigation to the satisfaction of authorities shortly afterward, and exactly 4 weeks later had its next launch.</p>

<p>All the while they&#8217;ve been planning an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/rocketlab-tests-new-hypercurie-engine-that-will-power-its-deep-space-delivery-vehicle/">ambitious mission to Venus</a>, which Beck called &#8220;the most underrated planet in our solar system.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I managed to convince the board the hand over a rocket and spacecraft, and we&#8217;re going to go to Venus as a private mission and look for life,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So 2023 is when we&#8217;re going to head on out there and see what we can find.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exact details of the mission and spacecraft will be made more clear in time, but Beck did emphasize that this is a serious undertaking: &#8220;Look, it&#8217;s a no joke mission. I thought the Moon was hard — you want to go to Venus, that&#8217;s a whole other level. But the way I view this is, if you have the resources to try, it&#8217;s just unacceptable to not. I don&#8217;t want to leave this planet knowing that I had a chance at answering arguably one of the biggest questions in the universe and didn&#8217;t try.&#8221;</p>
<p>With all these new responsibilities it&#8217;s amazing that Rocket Lab has been able to grow smoothly with no major upsets. Beck explained that while it may look like they&#8217;re just constantly adding new things to the lineup, it&#8217;s all part of a master plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody in Rocket lab knows the plan. And the plan wasn&#8217;t to just build a launch vehicle, the plan wasn&#8217;t to just build spacecraft, there&#8217;s a much bigger plan here that we&#8217;re all trying to execute on.&#8221; he said. &#8220;I guess it looks like we&#8217;re jumping into lots of different things. A good example is&#8230; there&#8217;s a very good reason why the kick stage looks remarkably similar to a satellite — it&#8217;s because that&#8217;s what was designed on day one. Quite frankly I was shocked that the moment we announced the kick stage everybody didn&#8217;t go, &#8216;oh, Pete&#8217;s building a satellite.&#8217; Internally we have a very clear plan on what we want to try to achieve. If I had to sum up the people that work at Rocket Lab, they&#8217;re just pure executors. The team we&#8217;ve created is just incredible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a clear path and a great team, so we&#8217;re just getting on with it,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">By now, most of us in tech know that the inherent bias we possess as humans creates an inherent bias in AI applications — applications that have become so sophisticated they’re able to shape the nature of our everyday lives and even influence our decision-making.</p>
<p>The more prevalent and powerful AI systems become, the sooner the industry must address questions like: What can we do to move away from using AI/ML models that demonstrate unfair bias?</p>
<p>How can we apply an intersectional framework to build AI for all people, knowing that different individuals are affected by and interact with AI in different ways based on the converging identities they hold?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Start with identifying the variety of voices that will interact with your model.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Intersectionality: What it means and why it matters</h2>
<p>Before tackling the tough questions, it’s important to take a step back and define “intersectionality.” A term defined by <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/kimberle_crenshaw">Kimberlé Crenshaw</a>, it’s a framework that empowers us to consider how someone’s distinct identities come together and shape the ways in which they experience and are perceived in the world.</p>
<p>This includes the resulting biases and privileges that are associated with each distinct identity. Many of us may hold more than one marginalized identity and, as a result, we’re familiar with the compounding effect that occurs when these identities are layered on top of one another.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://thetrevorproject.org/">The Trevor Project</a>, the world’s largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youth, our chief mission is to provide support to each and every LGBTQ young person who needs it, and we know that those who are transgender and nonbinary and/or Black, Indigenous, and people of color face unique stressors and challenges.</p>
<p>So, when our tech team set out to develop AI to serve and exist within this diverse community — namely to better assess suicide risk and deliver a consistently high quality of care — we had to be conscious of avoiding outcomes that would reinforce existing barriers to mental health resources like a lack of cultural competency or unfair biases like assuming someone’s gender based on the contact information presented.</p>
<p>Though our organization serves a particularly diverse population, underlying biases can exist in any context and negatively impact any group of people. As a result, all tech teams can and should aspire to build fair, intersectional AI models, because intersectionality is the key to fostering inclusive communities and building tools that serve people from all backgrounds more effectively.</p>
<p>Doing so starts with <strong>identifying the variety of voices that will interact with your model</strong>, in addition to the groups for which these various identities overlap. Defining the opportunity you’re solving is the first step because once you understand who is impacted by the problem, you can identify a solution. Next, <strong>map the end-to-end experience</strong> journey to learn the points where these people interact with the model. From there, there are strategies every organization, startup and enterprise can apply to weave intersectionality into every phase of AI development — from training to evaluation to feedback.</p>
<h2>Datasets and training</h2>
<p>The quality of a model’s output relies on the data on which it’s trained. Datasets can contain inherent bias due to the nature of their collection, measurement and annotation — all of which are rooted in human decision-making. For example, a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/racial-bias-found-in-a-major-health-care-risk-algorithm/">2019 study</a> found that a healthcare risk-prediction algorithm demonstrated racial bias because it relied on a faulty dataset for determining need. As a result, eligible Black patients received lower risk scores in comparison to white patients, ultimately making them less likely to be selected for high-risk care management.</p>
<p>Fair systems are built by training a model on datasets that reflect the people who will be interacting with the model. It also means recognizing where there are gaps in your data for people who may be underserved. However, there’s a larger conversation to be had about the overall <strong>lack of data representing marginalized people</strong> — it’s a systemic problem that must be addressed as such, because sparsity of data can obscure both whether systems are fair and whether the needs of underrepresented groups are being met.</p>
<p>To start analyzing this for your organization, <strong>consider the size and source of your data to identify what biases, skews or mistakes are built-in and how the data can be improved</strong> going forward.</p>
<p>The problem of bias in datasets can also be addressed by <strong>amplifying or boosting specific intersectional data inputs</strong>, as your organization defines it. Doing this early on will inform your model&#8217;s training formula and help your system stay as objective as possible — otherwise, your training formula may be unintentionally optimized to produce irrelevant results.</p>
<p>At The Trevor Project, we may need to amplify signals from demographics that we know disproportionately find it hard to access mental health services, or for demographics that have small sample sizes of data compared to other groups. Without this crucial step, our model could produce outcomes irrelevant to our users.</p>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Model evaluation is an ongoing process that helps organizations respond to ever-changing environments. Evaluating fairness began with looking at a single dimension — like race <em>or </em>gender <em>or</em> ethnicity. The next step for the tech industry is figuring out how to best compare intersectional groupings to evaluate fairness across all identities.</p>
<p>To measure fairness, try <strong>defining intersectional groups that could be at a disadvantage and the ones that may have an advantage</strong>, and then <strong>examine whether certain metrics (for example, false-negative rates) vary among them</strong>. What do these inconsistencies tell you? How else can you further examine which groups are underrepresented in a system and why? These are the kinds of questions to ask at this phase of development.</p>
<p>Developing and monitoring a model based on the demographics it serves from the start is the best way for organizations to achieve fairness and alleviate unfair bias. Based on the evaluation outcome, a next step might be to purposefully overserve statistically underrepresented groups to facilitate training a model that minimizes unfair bias. Since algorithms can lack impartiality due to societal conditions, designing for fairness from the outset helps ensure equal treatment of all groups of individuals.</p>
<h2>Feedback and collaboration</h2>
<p>Teams should also <strong>have a diverse group of people involved in developing and reviewing AI products</strong> — people who are diverse not only in identities, but also in skillset, exposure to the product, years of experience and more. Consult stakeholders and those who are impacted by the system for identifying problems and biases.</p>
<p>Lean on engineers when brainstorming solutions. For defining intersectional groupings, at The Trevor Project, we worked across the teams closest to our crisis-intervention programs and the people using them — like Research, Crisis Services and Technology. And reach back out to stakeholders and people interacting with the system to collect feedback upon launch.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there isn’t a “one-size-fits-all” approach to building intersectional AI. At The Trevor Project, our team has outlined a methodology based on what we do, what we know today and the specific communities we serve. This is not a static approach and we remain open to evolving as we learn more. While other organizations may take a different approach to build intersectional AI, we all have a moral responsibility to construct fairer AI systems, because AI has the power to highlight — and worse, magnify — the unfair biases that exist in society.</p>
<p>Depending on the use case and community in which an AI system exists, the magnification of certain biases can result in detrimental outcomes for groups of people who may already face marginalization. At the same time, AI also has the ability to improve quality of life for all people when developed through an intersectional framework. At The Trevor Project, we strongly encourage tech teams, domain experts and decision-makers to think deeply about codifying a set of guiding principles to initiate industry-wide change — and to ensure future AI models reflect the communities they serve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mytaprewards.com">Tap Network</a> is providing a new approach to loyalty rewards programs that it describes as &#8220;rewards as a service.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may recognize the Tap Network name, as well as its co-founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/lin-dai" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="lin-dai">Lin Dai, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> from Hooch, a startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/hooch-raises-1-5m-to-expand-its-drink-a-day-subscription-cocktail-app/">offered a drink-a-day subscription service</a> before shifting focus to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/hooch-rewards/">a broader rewards program</a>. Dai told me he &#8220;learned a lot from the Hooch experience&#8221; but ultimately &#8220;decided that Tap is a much bigger opportunity, we&#8217;re really looking at rewards in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Tap Network is a new startup, one that recently raised $4 million in funding from investors including Revelis Capital, Nima Capital, the Forbes family office, Warner Music Group, Access Industries, Bill Tai, Bob Hurst, Edward Devlin and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dai said that normal rewards programs are only accessible to the top 10% or 20% of a company&#8217;s customers. So in his view, businesses have an opportunity to &#8220;super serve the average customers who 40 years ago might not have been considered important customers, but who today could be building a loyalty behavior pattern.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089165" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089165" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2089165" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg?w=453" alt="Tap Network" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg 457w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/img-1.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089165" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tap Network</p></div></p>
<p>He added that making rewards programs accessible to more customers has an added benefit for many businesses, because &#8220;whether it’s a major bank or major travel company, they are starting to accrue billions of dollars<br />
that are locked up in these wallets.&#8221; Those points might never be redeemed, but they&#8217;re still considered liabilities from an accounting perspective.</p>
<p>Tap Network aims to solve this problem by allowing customers to spend those points through a broader network of rewards, which can usually be redeemed at a lower point level. It&#8217;s offered as a white-label addition to an existing rewards program, with each program choosing the rewards that might be the best fit for their customers.</p>
<p>For example, Uber recently worked with Tap Network to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-rewards-expansion-apple-music-hbo-max-140052177.html?guccounter=1">expand its Uber Rewards program</a>, offering new Tap Network-powered rewards like free Apple Music or HBO Max, as well as the option to donate to causes like World Central Kitchen. And the minimum number of points needed to claim a reward fell from 500 points to 100 points.</p>
<p>Other companies using Tap Network include Warner Music Group (which, as previously mentioned, is also an investor) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/24/brave-ads/">privacy-focused browser company Brave</a>.</p>
<p>Dai said that in the future, Tap could even allow consumers to combine rewards points from different programs: &#8220;If I want to redeem something, I might be able to take a little bit of my Uber points, a little bit of my Warner points, a little bit of points from another program&#8221; and combine them.</p>

<p>Thompson knows what he&#8217;s talking about.

<p>He pointed to three things when asked what&#8217;s a good first step for interfacing with the Space Force.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Join the Space Enterprise Consortium (SpEC)</strong>. He describes it as &#8220;A purpose-built consortium that values partnerships between government, traditional industry partners, and non-traditional partners like academia, small businesses, and startups&#8221; that&#8217;s grown to over 440 members in three years</p>
<p>At the end of the interview, General Thompson notes that he&#8217;s working on expanding the deployment of SpEC&#8217;s funds to reach more &#8220;game-changing technologies that those non-traditional small businesses and startups are bringing to SpEC.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Watch for Space Pitch Days.</strong> The next event is in the spring of 2021. These pitch days give startups an inside track to government contracts. Apparently, after the first event held with the Air Force, which General Thompson hosted, contracts were offered within three minutes of the pitches.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Look into SpaceWERX</strong>; a program launched this December to help Space Force work with private sector companies to field new technology for military applications. Like its Air Force counterpart, this &#8220;werx&#8221; center is a key component for Space Force&#8217;s acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roper" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roper">Roper <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> just announced it last week at the Space and Missile System Center,&#8221; Gen. Thompson said, &#8220;[This] is an integral part of the acquisition enterprise of the United States. Space Force is a full partner in the SpaceWERK endeavor. And using the WERKs model, we hope to inject more small businesses and startups into our innovation ecosystem.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following numerous reports that the U.S. government was seeking to crack down on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dji" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dji">DJI, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the Department of Commerce today will be adding the drone giant to its &#8220;Entity List.&#8221;  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idCAKBN28S24I-OCATC?edition-redirect=ca">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://dronedj.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-us-dept-of-commerce-entity-list-bad-news-for-chinese-company/">Drone DJ</a> have issued early reporting based on a conference call with a state official. The full list of 77 impacted companies <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/about-bis/2678-77-entity-list-additions/file">is available here</a>.</p>
<p>The news comes as a pretty massive blow to DJI. The 14-year-old Chinese company has been an utterly dominant force in the drone category. Here in the States, it commands an estimated 77% of the market.</p>
<p>Increased tensions between the U.S. and China have long been a looming concern for DJI’s presence in the States, with surveillance capabilities being a particular sticking point. Along with their wildly successful consumer drones, DJI also has a wide reach in both industrial and governmental applications. In fact, the company specifically offers a<a href="https://enterprise.dji.com/government"> government line of products</a> as part of its enterprise offerings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DJI is one of dozens of companies added to the list. Also of note is chipmaker, SMIC. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross didn&#8217;t mince words in a statement issued after the list went public,</p>
<blockquote><p>China’s corrupt and bullying behavior both inside and outside its borders harms U.S. national security interests, undermines the sovereignty of our allies and partners, and violates the human rights and dignity of ethnic and religious minority groups.   Commerce will act to ensure that America’s technology—developed and produced according to open and free-market principles—is not used for malign or abusive purposes.</p>
<p>“China actively promotes the reprehensible practices of forced labor, DNA collection and ubiquitous surveillance to repress its citizens in Xinjiang and elsewhere.  Over the last two years this administration has added nearly 50 entities to the Entity List for their support for the Chinese Communist Party’s despicable offensive against vulnerable ethnic minorities.  With these new additions, we are applying those principles to the rest of China, including in Tibet, and to the authoritarian regimes to which these practices are being exported.</p></blockquote>
<p>The DOC notably placed Huawei and several of its affiliates to the list last year, a move that has severely hamstrung the hardware giant. Among other things, it’s cut off the company’s access from key U.S. technologies like Google’s Android and other software. Huawei has opted to develop its own operating system, but the landing has been a difficult one to stick.</p>
<p>There’s been a good deal of talk around restricting use of the company’s technology by federal and state departments, but this update could prove even more sweeping. DJI has been bracing for this manner of revelation over the past year and chance. The drone maker <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/73687758-f050-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">has spent a lot of time</a> and resources lobby on Capitol Hill. There&#8217;s been a good deal of speculation around the shape these bans will take after a new President is sworn in on January 20.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, DJI was flagged as part of the report&#8217;s focus on &#8220;wide-scale human rights abuse.&#8221; Likely that specifically revolves around issues of &#8220;high-technology surveillance,&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>The ERC determined to add the entities AGCU Scientech; China National Scientific Instruments and Materials (CNSIM); DJI; and Kuang-Chi Group for activities contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests. Specifically, these four entities have enabled wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technology surveillance, and/or facilitated the export of items by China that aid repressive regimes around the world, contrary to U.S. foreign policy interests.</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to both DJI for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.creditas.com/">Creditas</a>, the Brazilian lending business, has raised $255 million in new financing as financial services startups across Latin America continue to attract massive amounts of cash.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s credit portfolio has crossed 1 billion reals ($196.66 million) and the new round will value the company at $1.75 billion thanks to $570 million raised in outside financing over five rounds.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/creditas" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="creditas">Creditas <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the latest company to benefit from a boom in financial services startup investing across the region. As the year dawned, venture investments into fintech startups in Latin America had grown from $50 million in 2014 to top $2.1 billion in 2020 across 139 deals, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/latin-america-fintech-drivers/">according to a report from CB Insights</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investors in the round include new investors like LGT Lightstone, Tarsadia Capital, Welington Management, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/e-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="e-ventures">e.ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and an affiliate of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/advent-international" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="advent-international">Advent International, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sunley House Capital. Previous investors including SoftBank Vision Fund 1, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="softbank">SoftBank <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Latin America DFund, VEF, Kaszek, Vemtires and Amadeus Capital Partners also returned to put more money into the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Creditas is still in the early innings of penetrating the huge untapped secured lending market in Brazil and Mexico&#8221; says Paulo Passoni, Managing Partner of Softbank Latam fund, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company&#8217;s growth is a testament both to the need for new lending products across Latin America and the perspicacity of investors like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kaszek-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kaszek-ventures">Kaszek Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> whose portfolio has included several massive wins from bets on startups tackling financial services in Latin America.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The journey since our investment in the Series A has been absolutely extraordinary. The team has executed on its vision, and Creditas has evolved into an asset-light ecosystem that resolves key financial needs of its customers throughout their lifetimes”, says Nicolas Szekasy, Managing Partner of Kaszek Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another big winner is Redpoint&#8217;s e.ventures fund, which has focused on investments in Latin America for the last several years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;By empowering Brazilians to take control of their lending needs at reasonable rates, Creditas creates a beloved consumer product that will drive significant value for customers and investors. Having been involved since the seed stage through Redpoint e.ventures, we&#8217;re thrilled to support the company with our Global Growth Fund as well, as they change the Brazilian fintech landscape,&#8221; said Mathias Schilling, co-founder and Managing Partner of e.ventures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Creditas has plans to use the cash to expand its home and auto lending as well as a payday lending service based on customers&#8217; salaries and a retail option to sell through buy now, pay later loans based on a customer&#8217;s salary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is also looking to expand to other markets, with an eye toward establishing a foothold in the Mexican market as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Founded in 2012, when the founders worked out of a 5 squre meter office on Berrini Avenue in Sao Paulo, the company now boasts a robust business with hundreds of employees and a business resting on a secured lending marketplace and independent home and auto lending operations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company also released quarterly results for the first time, showing losses narrowing from 74.9 million Brazilian reals to 40.5 million reais in the year ago quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zomato" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zomato">Zomato <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has raised $660 million in a financing round that it kicked off last year as the Indian food delivery startup prepares to go public next year.</p>
<p>The Indian startup said Tiger Global, Kora, Luxor, Fidelity (FMR), D1 Capital, Baillie Gifford, Mirae, and Steadview participated in the round &#8212; a Series J &#8211;which gives Zomato a post-money valuation of $3.9 billion. Zomato had previously disclosed fundraise of about $212 million as part of Series J round from Ant Financial, Tiger Global, Baillie Gifford, and Temasek.</p>
<p>Deepinder Goyal, the co-founder and chief executive of Zomato, said the 12-year-old startup is also in the process of closing a $140 million secondary transaction. &#8220;As part of this transaction, we have already provided liquidity worth $30m to our ex-employees,&#8221; he tweeted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup originally anticipated to close a round of about $600 million by January this year, but several obstacles including the global pandemic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/indias-zomato-raises-100m-from-tiger-global-says-it-is-planning-to-file-for-ipo-next-year/">delayed the fundraise effort</a>. Additionally, Ant Financial, which had originally committed to invest $150 million in this round, only delivered a third of it, Zomato&#8217;s investor Info Edge disclosed earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/uber-sells-food-delivery-business-in-india-to-zomato/">acquired the Indian food delivery business of Uber</a> early this year, competes with Prosus Ventures-backed <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/swiggy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="swiggy">Swiggy </a>in India. A third player, Amazon, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">emerged in the market</a>, though it currently offers its food delivery service in only parts of Bangalore.</p>
<p>At stake is India&#8217;s food delivery market, which analysts at Bernstein expect to balloon to be worth $12 billion by 2022, they wrote in a report to clients &#8212; accessed by TechCrunch. With about 50% of the market share, Zomato is the current leader among the three, Bernstein analysts wrote.</p>
<p>Zomato eliminated hundreds of jobs this year to improve its finances and navigate the coronavirus pandemic, which significantly hurt the food delivery business in India in the early months. Goyal said the food delivery market is &#8220;rapidly coming out of COVID-19 shadows. December 2020 is expected to be the highest ever GMV month in our history. We are now clocking ~25% higher GMV than our previous peaks in February 2020.&#8221; He added, &#8220;I am supremely excited about what lies ahead and the impact that we will create for our customers, delivery partners, and restaurant partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>In September, Goyal told employees that Zomato was working for its IPO for “sometime in the first half of next year” and was raising money to build a war-chest for &#8220;future M&amp;A, and fighting off any mischief or price wars from our competition in various areas of our business.”</p>
<p>Making money with food delivery has been especially challenging in India. Unlike Western markets such as the U.S., where the value of each delivery item is about $33, in India, a similar item carries the price tag of $4, according to estimates by Bangalore-based research firm RedSeer.</p>
<p>“The problem is that there are very few people in India who can afford to place an order from a food delivery firm each day,” said Anand Lunia, a venture capitalist at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/india-quotient" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="india-quotient">India Quotient, </a>in an interview with TechCrunch earlier this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So much for a year-end IPO slowdown.</p>

Let&#8217;s get into the filing!</p>
<h2>Poshmark</h2>
<p>Poshmark is an e-commerce marketplace that allows users to sell new and used fashion-related goods to one another. It sits atop secular trends towards e-commerce over traditional retail, mobile commerce over static, and what I would call a cultural rethinking of used goods in recent years.</p>
<p>And of course, Poshmark has braved the economic waves that COVID-19 brought to the global market.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s model is simple: It holds no inventory, instead providing a marketplace where buyers and sellers connect, juiced with an algorithmically-built feed of items and an emphasis on digital social interactions. At the end of 2019, the company&#8217;s audience was 83% female and 80% of its members were part of the Gen Z and Millennial generations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to understand how Poshmark makes money, with the company charging 20% of a sale price for goods over $15, or a capped rate for cheaper goods.</p>
<p>In theory, the company has a workable flywheel for growth. Attracting new users via marketing helps it build a deeper user base. Those users generate more social activity and purchases, which, in turn, could bring in more sellers.</p>
<p>That would help keep Poshmark&#8217;s goods selection fresh. Which, could attract even more buyers. More goods and more sales means more revenues for Poshmark. Which can then spend some of the resulting margin back into marketing, kickstarting the process all over again.</p>
<p>But despite that winsome circular updraft, the company has posted regular losses, which means Poshmark has had to outspend its business model to keep its growth up. Until 2020, that is. This year, things turned around in profit-terms for the e-commerce marketplace, ending with the company turning in consecutive profitable quarters.</p>
<p>Poshmark&#8217;s cash generation also improved in 2020, putting it on strong footing heading into its public offering. As with other companies that wound up enjoying a strong 2020 based at least in part on COVID-19 and its resulting economic impacts, investors will have to math out what happens to the company in 2021.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the company&#8217;s historical growth and how it wound up generating net income this year.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>From the first nine months of 2019 to the same period of 2020, Poshmark grew its revenues 28% from $150.5 million to $192.8 million. Its profitability, however, swung sharply from a net loss of $33.9 million in the first three quarters of 2019 to net income of $8.1 million during the same period of 2020.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://unfold.com">Unfold</a>, the social media startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/squarespace-acquires-unfold/">acquired by Squarespace</a> last year, is launching a new tool for users to share all the links that are important with them.</p>
<p>This is the first step <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unfold-ee0f" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unfold-ee0f">Unfold <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has taken beyond its story-format authoring tools. Co-founder Andy McCune told me that the team has a bigger vision now — just as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/squarespace" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="squarespace">Squarespace <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has become &#8220;the all-in-one platform for your web presence,&#8221; Unfold aims to become &#8220;the all-in-one platform for your social presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re both playing in very saturated spaces with a lot of competitors,&#8221; McCune said. &#8220;We both stand out because we appeal to the person that cares about design. That’s always been the North Star.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the case of the new <a href="https://unfold.com/biosites">Bio Sites</a>, he said one of the goals is to help Unfold users — whether they&#8217;re individuals or large brands — become less reliant on a single social media platform. After all, he noted that when you build a following on Instagram, you&#8217;re building on &#8220;borrowed territory,&#8221; and &#8220;you don&#8217;t really own your audience.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089113" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089113" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2089113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BioSites_Interface.gif?w=680" alt="Unfold Bio Sites" width="680" height="441" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Unfold</p></div></p>
<p>By creating a simple profile that highlights the links of your choice, then by linking your Instagram and other social profiles to your Bio Site, you can then point audiences to other channels where you have more control — or at least diversify the platforms that you&#8217;re relying on.</p>
<p>McCune and his co-founder Alfonso Cobo aren&#8217;t the first ones to think of this idea. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/linktree-raises-10-7m-for-its-lightweight-link-centric-user-profiles/">Linktree raised funding</a> earlier this year, and there are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21443811/social-media-bio-links-business-tiktok-instagram-influencers">other startups creating similar products</a>. But Cobo said Bio Sites benefit from Unfold&#8217;s design-centric approach, allowing users to create simple profiles that aren&#8217;t just functional, but also looks great and reflect their personality.</p>
<p>Cobo also noted that Bio Sites are created from the Unfold native app — it&#8217;s launching on Android today, with plans for iOS in January. The feature will be available available to all Unfold users, including free users, but subscribers to the premium Unfold+ and Unfold for Brands tiers get additional features like custom URLs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re really going to be expanding in the next few weeks with presence and expressibility tools to help users stand out in different ways,&#8221; Cobo said. &#8220;We&#8217;re also very interested in commerce and will be exploring that route in the future, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a return to active launch, constellation satellite operator <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oneweb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oneweb">OneWeb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has sent 36 new satellites to join its existing spacecraft on orbit. This is the third large batch of OneWeb satellites to be delivered, after an initial launch of six in 2019, and then a second and third launch of 34 satellites each in February and March of this year. The company then ran into financial difficulties that led to its filing for bankruptcy protection in March, before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/oneweb-emerges-from-bankruptcy-aims-to-begin-launching-satellites-again-on-december-17/">emerging from said bankruptcy in July</a> thanks to a deal funded in part by the UK government, and in part by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/03/the-uk-government-to-acquire-satellite-company-oneweb-in-deal-funded-in-part-by-indias-bharti-global/">Bharti Global</a>. In short, it&#8217;s <em>been a year</em> for OneWeb.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s launch took off from the Vostochny cosmodrome, and used a Russian Soyuz-2.1b rocket to make the trip. This is the first ever commercial launch from Vostochny (prior commercial launches handled by Roscosmos have used the Baikonur cosmodrome), and it meant that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oneweb" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oneweb">OneWeb <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> could launch 36 satellites instead of 34, because of its position relative to OneWeb&#8217;s target orbit.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OneWeb emerges from bankruptcy, aims to begin launching satellites again on December 17&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/oneweb-emerges-from-bankruptcy-aims-to-begin-launching-satellites-again-on-december-17/embed/#?secret=SlEhZv7ixH" data-secret="SlEhZv7ixH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>OneWeb is building a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites that will provide high-bandwidth connectivity for use in Earth-based networks. The company aims to ultimately have 648 satellites on orbit, and intends to speed up the pace of its launches in order to achieve its target by 2022, which will enable it to offer global network coverage to its customers.</p>
<p>Getting ramped and operational is key to OneWeb being able to generate revenue from its offering. The company is also competing with major, well-capitalized LEO networks being created by both <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon – but we heard from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Dave Limp just this past week at TC Sessions: Space that there should be plenty of room for multiple winners in the LEO broadband market, since there&#8217;s no shortage of demand for high-quality connectivity at a global scale.</p>
<p>While OneWeb&#8217;s arrangement with Bharti and the UK has helped it emerge from bankruptcy, Bharti founder and Chairman Sunil Mittal <a href="https://spacenews.com/oneweb-optimistic-about-raising-the-funding-needed-to-complete-its-constellation/">noted earlier this week</a> that the company will likely need to raise a total of $2.5 billion to finish its constellation – half of which is provided by the UK/Bharti consortium.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve seen a big wave of proptech startups emerge to reimagine how houses and bought and sold, with some tapping into the opportunity with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/sundae-snags-36m-to-build-out-its-distressed-property-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distressed property</a>, and others exploring the &#8220;<a href="http://opendoor.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBuyer</a>&#8221; model where houses are bought, fixed up and resold by a single startup to homeowners who don&#8217;t want to invest in a fixer-upper. But the vast majority of homes are still sold the traditional way, by way of a real estate agent working via a broker.</p>
<p>Today, a startup is announcing that it has raised seed funding not to disrupt, but improve that basic model with a more flexible approach that can help agents work in a more modern way, and to ultimately scale out the number of people working as agents in the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.avenue8.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Avenue 8</a>, which describes itself as a &#8220;mobile-first residential real estate brokerage&#8221; &#8212; providing a new set of tools for agents to source, list and sell homes, and handle the other aspects of the process that fall between those &#8212; has raised $4 million. This is a seed round, and Avenue 8 plans to use it to expand further in the cities where it is already active &#8212; it&#8217;s been in beta thus far in the San Francisco and Los Angeles areas &#8212; as well as grow to several more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is notable because of the backers that the startup has attracted early on. It&#8217;s being led by Craft Ventures &#8212; the firm co-founded by David Sacks and Bill Lee that has amassed a <a href="https://www.craftventures.com/portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prolific and impressive portfolio of companies</a> &#8212; with Zigg Capital, and Good Friends (an early-stage fund from the founders of Warby Parker, Harry&#8217;s, and Allbirds) also participating.</p>
<p>There has been at <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/5230/proptech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">least $18 billion in funding</a> raised by proptech companies in the last decade, and with that no shortage of efforts to take the lessons of tech &#8212; from cloud computing and mobile technology, through to artificial intelligence, data science, and innovations in e-commerce &#8212; and apply them to the real estate market.</p>
<p>Michael Martin, who co-founded Avenue 8 with Justin Fichelson, believes that this pace of change, in fact, means that one has to continually consider new approaches.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It&#8217;s important to remember that Compass&#8217;s growth strategy was to roll out its technology to traditional brokerages,&#8221; he said of one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/real-estate-platform-compass-raises-another-370m-on-a-6-4b-valuation-en-route-to-an-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big juggernauts</a> in the space (which itself has seen its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/with-the-real-estate-industry-facing-headwinds-softbank-backed-compass-lays-off-15-of-staff-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">challenges</a>). &#8220;But if you built it today, it would be fundamentally different.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And he believes that &#8220;different&#8221; would look not unlike Avenue 8. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup is based around a subscription model for a start, rather than a classic 30/70 split on the sales commissions that respectively (and typically) exist between brokers and agents. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Around that basic model, Avenue 8 has built a set of tools that provides agents with an intuitive way to use newer kinds of marketing and analytics tools both to get the word out about their properties across multiple channels; analytics to measure how their efforts are doing, in order to improve future listings; and access to wider market data to help them make more informed decisions on valuations and sales. It also providers a marketplace of people &#8212; valets &#8212; who can help stage and photograph properties for listing, and Avenue 8 doesn&#8217;t require payments to be made to those partners unless a home sells.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also provides all of this via a mobile platform &#8212; key for people in a profession that often has them on the move. </span></p>
<p>Targeting agents that have in the past relied essentially on using whatever tools the brokers use &#8212; which often were simply their own sites plus some aggregating portals &#8212; Avenue 8&#8217;s pitch is not just better returns but a better process to get there.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard time and time again that agents struggle to identify and leverage the technology and tools to successfully manage their relationships and properties. Changing buyer/seller expectations have accelerated the digital transformation of most agents’ workflows,” said Ryan Orley, Partner at Zigg Capital, in a statement. “Avenue 8 is building and integrating the right software and resources for our new reality.”</p>
<p>What&#8217;s also interesting about Avenue 8 is how it can open the door to a wider pool of agents in the longer run.</p>
<p>The real estate market has been noticeably resilient throughout the pandemic, with lower interest rates, a generally lower overall home inventory, and people spending more time at home (and wanting a better space) creating a high level of demand. With a number of other industries feeling the pinch, a flexible platform like Avenue 8&#8217;s creates a way for people &#8212; who have taken and passed the certifications needed to become agents &#8212; to register and flexibly work as an agent as much or as little as they choose, creating a kind of &#8220;Uber for real estate agents,&#8221; as it were.</p>
<p>That scaling opportunity is likely one of the reasons why this has potentially caught the eye of investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Avenue 8&#8217;s organic growth is clear evidence that the market demands a mobile-first, digital platform,” said Jeff Fluhr, General Partner at Craft Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Michael and Justin have a clear vision for modernizing real estate while keeping agents at the center. Avenue 8’s model helps agents take home more even in today’s environment where commissions are compressing.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, just as Uber&#8217;s changed the way that on-demand transportation is ordered and delivered, Avenue 8 is starting to see some interesting traction in terms of its place in the real estate market. Although it was originally targeted at agents with the pitch of being like &#8220;a better broker&#8221; &#8212; providing the services brokers are regulated to provide, but with a more modern wrapper around it &#8212; it&#8217;s also in some cases attracting brokerages, too. Martin said that it&#8217;s already working with a few smaller ones, and ultimately might consider ways of providing its tools to larger ones to manage their businesses better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I was made aware of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/surrogate" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="surrogate">Surrogate.tv’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> work earlier this year when the site released a Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit tournament. Nintendo’s IRL take on its popular racing title was a great showcase for the technology &#8212; though, admittedly, there was enough lag in the remote operation to make control something of an issue.</p>
<p>Of course, Mario Kart is just one of the experiences the platform offers. It’s a pretty broad range, all told, from pinball to battling robots to claw machines. The diversity of experience is probably the service’s biggest strength, all told.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxsjNP-KpIQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today the Finnish startup announced that it has closed a $2.5 million seed round, led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rooks-nest-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rooks-nest-ventures">Supernode Global <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and followed by PROfounders, Brighteye Ventures and Business Finland. The latest sum joins a $2 million pre-seed announced by the company last year.</p>
<p>The company’s big play is an ultra-low-latency streaming and robotics bundle that lets users remotely control real-world objects in the manner of a streaming gaming service. Another recent example is a partnership with Ubisoft, where users raised miniature Viking ships against strongman Hafþór Björnsson, for some reason. 2020, I guess.</p>

<p>“Previously, such teleoperation technology would be accessible only for very specific, mainly enterprise, applications,” CEO Shane Allen said of the seed raise. “With this second round of funding, we will be able to launch a string of exciting initiatives that will enable people to create experiences that have never been possible before, all using our technology.”</p>
<p>It seems clear that Surrogate.tv is looking to expand beyond its own entertainment site, offering up its teleoperation technology to interested third-parties. It’s something many have no doubt been investigating in a year when in-person events have been largely off limits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After spending more than a decade disrupting the neighborhood stores in the U.S. and several other markets, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Walmart are employing an unusual strategy in India to face off this competitor: Friending them.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/walmart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="walmart">Walmart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon, both of which face restrictions from New Delhi on what all they could do in India, have partnered with tens of thousands of neighborhood stores in the world’s second-largest internet market this year to leverage the vast presence of these mom and pop stores.</p>
<p>In June this year, at the height of the pandemic, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-launches-smart-stores-in-india-to-win-mom-and-pop/">announced “Smart Stores.”</a> Through this India-specific program, for instance, Amazon is providing physical stores with software to maintain a digital log of the inventory they have in the shop and supplying them with a QR code.</p>
<p>When consumers walk to the store and scan this QR code with the Amazon app, they see everything the shop has to offer, in addition to any discounts and past reviews from customers. They can select the items and pay for it using Amazon Pay. Amazon Pay in India supports a range of payments services, including the popular UPI, and debit and credit cards.</p>
<p>The world’s largest e-commerce giant also maintains partnerships that allow it to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/18/amazon-india-kirana-neighborhood-stores/">turn tens of thousands of neighborhood stores as its delivery point for customers</a> &#8212; and sometimes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/amazon-begins-selling-items-from-neighborhood-stores-in-india-amid-facebooks-deal-with-jio/">even rely on them for inventory</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amazon partners with thousands of kirana stores all over India as delivery points. It’s good for customers, and it helps the shop owners earn additional income.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>India has over 60 million small businesses that dot the thousands of cities, towns and villages across the country. These mom and pop stores offer all kinds of items, are family run, and pay low wages and little to no rent.</p>
<p>This has enabled them to operate at an economics that is better than most &#8212; if not all &#8212; of their digital counterparts, and their scale allows them to offer unmatched fast delivery.</p>
<p>Krishna Shah, a New Delhi-based doctor, on paper is one of the perfect customers of e-commerce services. She lives in an urban city, uses digital payments apps and her earnings put her in the top 5% income level in the country. Yet, when she needed to buy food for her cats and needed it as soon as possible, she realized the major giants would take hours, if not longer. She ended up placing a call to a neighborhood store, which delivered the item within 10 minutes.</p>
<p>That neighborhood store, which employs fewer than half a dozen people, was competing with over a dozen giants and heavily funded startups including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="grofers-trusted-delivery-partner">Grofers <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bigbasket-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bigbasket-com">BigBasket <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; and it won.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s retail market, which is estimated to be worth $1.3 trillion by 2025, from about $700 billion last year, according to Boston Consulting Group and the Retailers’ Association India. E-commerce, by several estimates, accounts for just 3% of the retail market in the country.</p>
<p>If that figure wasn’t small enough already, consider this: Some of the biggest customers of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flipkart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flipkart">Flipkart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Amazon are these small retail stores. An executive with direct knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch that during some sales, as high as 40% of all smartphone units are bought by physical stores. The idea is, the executive said, to buy the devices at a discounted price, sit on them for a few days and when Amazon and Flipkart are done with their sales, sell the same phones at their standard prices.</p>
<p>Sujeet Kumar, co-founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/udaan" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="udaan">Udaan, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Bangalore-based startup that works with merchants, said that even as smartphones and the internet have reached all corners of India, e-commerce hasn’t been able to disrupt the retail market.</p>
<p>“The problem is that it is very difficult for e-commerce companies to build a supply chain and distribution network that is more efficient than those established by neighborhood stores. These mom and pop stores operate on an insanely different kind of cost economics. E-commerce companies are not able to match it,” he said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China&#8217;s top chipmaker, is under mounting pressure as reports of its CEO&#8217;s looming departure and a potential U.S. sanction concern investors.</p>
<p>The U.S. Commerce Department is looking to add dozens of companies, mostly Chinese and including partially state-owned SMIC, to its trade blacklist, <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-sanctions-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-to-blacklist-dozens-of-chinese-firms-including-smic-sources-say-idUSKBN28S0HL">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-sanctions-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-to-blacklist-dozens-of-chinese-firms-including-smic-sources-say-idUSKBN28S0HL">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported on Friday. The move will restrict SMIC from buying key components from U.S. suppliers by mandating U.S. exporters to apply for a license to sell to the Chinese firm.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/12/commerce-adds-chinas-smic-entity-list-restricting-access-key-enabling">confirmed</a> later on the day that its Bureau of Industry and Security has added SMIC to the so-called Entity List to &#8220;protect U.S. national security.&#8221; Sixty other entities, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/dji-added-to-commerce-department-entity-list/">China&#8217;s drone giant DJI</a>, are added to the list for actions deemed contrary to the national security or foreign policy interest of the U.S.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This action stems from China’s military-civil fusion doctrine and evidence of activities between SMIC and entities of concern in the Chinese military industrial complex,&#8221; the agent said in a statement.</p>
<p>Components used to produce semiconductors at top-class nodes &#8212; 10 nanometers or below &#8212; will be &#8220;subject to a presumption of denial to prevent such key enabling technology from supporting China’s military-civil fusion efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/the-trump-administration-will-add-smic-chinas-largest-chipmaker-to-its-defense-blacklist-report/">reportedly</a> added SMIC to its defense blacklist, which would bar American investors from buying securities from the company.</p>
<p>SMIC cannot be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The sanction arrived amid SMIC&#8217;s management shakeup and what appears to be internal politics at the chipmaking firm. SMIC recently appointed Chiang Shang-Yi, formerly a co-chief operating officer at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), as vice-chairman. Days later an alleged resignation letter from Liang Mong Song made rounds online, and in it, the co-chief executive of SMIC said he was unaware of Chiang&#8217;s appointment and the hiring had prompted him to quit.</p>
<p>SMIC subsequently issued a statement saying<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-champion-chip-maker-checks-if-co-ceo-still-wants-to-work-there-11608117694"> it is &#8220;verifying&#8221;</a> the executive&#8217;s intention to quit, sending the company&#8217;s shares <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55f1cafb-91b8-4ddf-8b83-be8f5f71d327">plummeting</a>.</p>
<p>The fate of SMIC and TSMC is tightly linked to that of Huawei. TSMC, once an important supplier to the telecoms equipment and smartphone making giant, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/tsmc-reportedly-stops-taking-orders-from-huawei-after-new-u-s-export-controls/">reportedly halted orders</a> from the Chinese firm following new U.S. export controls. There were hopes that SMIC could be a TSMC replacement for Huawei, but industry observers have long argued that the Chinese chipmaker is <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smic-everything-you-need-know">years behind its Taiwanese rival</a> on making state of the art chipsets for phones.</p>
<p>Huawei has been struggling with phone production after the Trump Administration added it to the Entity List and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/us-commerce-department-updates-rules-to-further-limit-huaweis-chip-access/">cut off its chip supplies</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sony" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sony">Sony <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has pulled &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077,&#8221; one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/cyberpunk-2077-a-retro-futuristic-fantasy-with-huge-potential-if-you-can-ignore-the-cyberjank/">most anticipated games in recent years</a>, from its PlayStation Store after a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kdjq1h/rcyberpunkgame_console_bugs_questions/">flood of complaints</a> and ridicule over compatibility issues and bugs from customers.</p>
<p>The gaming giant <a href="https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/status/1339737360184078336">said</a> it is offering full refunds to any customer who purchased CD Projekt’s title from the PlayStation Store &#8212; though customers need to ask for it. Last week, CD Projekt announced that &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; had been pre-ordered more than 8 million times. A day later (Friday), the company said its revenue from digital pre-order sales alone exceeded all of Cyberpunk 2077&#8217;s production, marketing, and promotional costs.</p>
<p>Daniel Ahmad, Senior Analyst at Niko Partners, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1339762629422804993">said</a> the delisting of a much-anticipated title is unprecedented in the gaming industry. “I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve ever really seen something like this in the industry before. The only thing that comes close is when Warner Bros. delisted &#8216;Batman Arkham Knight&#8217; from PC due to technical issues, but that was from the publisher themselves. This is the platform holder delisting the game.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said CD Projekt could have delayed the release of &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; by another year and avoided the situation it has landed itself in. “&#8217;Cyberpunk 2077&#8242; was expected to become a 30 million+ seller prior to launch. But the state of the game and CDPR&#8217;s handling of the situation post launch has led to this.”</p>
<p>CD Projekt released &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077,&#8221; a game that was first unveiled seven years ago, on December 10 following multiple delays. Shares of CD Projekt were down more than 13% at the time of publishing.</p>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment “strives to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction, and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased Cyberpunk 2077 via PlayStation Store and want a refund,” the company said Friday. &#8220;Cyberpunk 2077&#8221; title is also plagued by bugs and other glitches on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kdjq0z/rcyberpunkgame_pc_bugs_questions/">other platforms</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, CD Projekt acknowledged that more attention should have been paid to make the game “play better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.” The company also said it would offer refund to unsatisfied customers, but many users said they had not received their money back.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like people didn&#8217;t see this coming for a few months now,&#8221; said Niko Partners&#8217; Ahmad. &#8220;From the many delays of the game prior, to developers and QA pointing out issues, to last gen footage of the game being deliberately hidden / taken down (as admitted by CDPR) and more. There are multiple lessons to learn from this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An important one being that management /production processes need to improve. It turns out crunching non stop for months doesn&#8217;t make a game good. It negatively impacts not just the health of devs, but the game too There will also be wider impacts on the industry when it comes to guidelines for marketing, certification and refunds from a publisher and platform holder level Anyway, will be interesting to see how CDPR respond and how they can salvage the lost goodwill they built up over years,&#8221; he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tencent is further strengthening its ties with music giant Universal Music Group as it continues to dominate the Chinese music streaming market.</p>
<p>A consortium led by Tencent and comprising <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/china-music-corp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="china-music-corp">Tencent Music Entertainment, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the internet giant&#8217;s music spinoff, is set to buy an additional 10% equity stake in UMG from French media conglomerate Vivendi SA, TME <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consortium-including-tencent-music-entertainment-group-exercises-call-option-to-acquire-additional-equity-interests-in-universal-music-group-301195812.html">said</a> on Friday.</p>
<p>The round values <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/umg" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="umg">UMG <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> at 30 billion euros, or $36.8 billion, and will increase the consortium&#8217;s stake in the music company to 20%. TME continues to hold a 10% equity interest in the consortium, of which other members are not disclosed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span id="textmarker_11" class="textmarker textmarker_5">&#8220;The transaction reinforces TME&#8217;s commitment t</span><span id="textmarker_12" class="textmarker textmarker_6">o strengthening its strategic partnership with UMG. </span>TME looks forward to an ongoing and deeper collaboration with UMG as both companies work together to bring unparalleled service and product offerings to artists and fans in <span class="xn-location">China&#8217;s</span> booming music entertainment market,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021 and is subject to regulatory approvals, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tme" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tme">TME <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> noted.</p>
<p>In August, TME and UMG <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/universal-music-tencent-joint-label/">said</a> they were launching a joint label to discover, develop and promote Chinese artists domestically and to the world.</p>

<p>Tencent has been pally with all three music label giants, which have been licensing content to the Chinese firm&#8217;s music-focused apps. Both Warner Music and Sony Music Entertainment bought shares in TME when the latter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/tencent-music-ipo/">went public in Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<p>Warner Music&#8217;s SEC filing earlier this year showed that it had <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/tencent-now-owns-10-of-universal-9-of-spotify-and-nearly-2-of-warner-music-group/">sold a small stake</a> to Tencent. And one should be reminded that Tencent also had a deal with Spotify from 2017 when the two <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/spotify-tencent-share-swap/">swapped stakes</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When an accident on a building site resulted in the death of their friend, the founders of <a href="https://safesitehq.com/">Safesight</a> were inspired to launch the platform to digitize safety programs for construction. The data from that gave birth to a new InsurTech startup this year, <a href="https://getforesight.com/">Foresight</a>, which covers workers&#8217; compensation. The startup has now released, for the first time, news that it raised a $15 million funding round back in May this year, with participation from Blackhorn Ventures and Transverse Insurance Group. To date, it has raised $20.5 million from industrial technology venture capital firms, led by Brick and Mortar Ventures and Builders VC.</p>
<p>Foresight launched in August of this year but has already covered $30M in risks. The company says it is now on pace to reach $50M in underwritten premium in 2021. By leveraging the data from sister company Safesite, the platform says it has been able to reduce workers comp incidents by up to 57% in a study conducted by actuarial consulting firm Perr &amp; Knight.</p>
<p>Foresight’s algorithm leverages Safesight data to predict incidents, highlight risks, and informs underwriting. By wrapping Safesite risk management technology and services into every policy, Foresight provides a path to lower incident rates and lower premiums for customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of the $57Bn national workers compensation market, Foresight focuses on policies ranging from $150K to $1M+ in annual premiums. The company says this segment has been largely overlooked by well-funded InsurTech startups such as Next <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/insurance-1d9d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="insurance-1d9d">Insurance <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Pie, which provide small business policies under $50K in annual premiums.</p>
<p>Foresight and Safesite were developed by longtime friends and co-founders David Fontain, Peter Grant, and Leigh Appel.</p>
<p>Fontain said: “Foresight strengthens the correlation between safety and savings while providing the fast and easy user experience InsurTechs are known for. We leverage purpose-built technology to drive behavioral shifts and provide an irresistible alternative to traditional workers compensation coverage.”</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/darren-bechtel" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="darren-bechtel">Darren Bechtel, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the founder and managing director at Brick &amp; Mortar Ventures commented: &#8220;We first invested in 2016 and have known the founders since 2015 when it was just the two of them, squatting at a couple of empty desks inside another portfolio company’s office. Their initial vision was both elegant and powerful, and the demonstrated impact of their solution on safety performance, even in early interactions with the product, was impossible to ignore.”</p>
<p>Foresight now covers Nevada, Oklahoma, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arizona" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arizona">Arizona, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. The company expects to launch workers compensation in the eastern US and a general liability line in early 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.v7labs.com/">V7 Labs</a>, the makers of a computer vision platform that helps AI teams &#8220;automate&#8221; and future-proof their training data workflows as advances in AI continue, has picked up $3 million in funding. Leading the seed round is Amadeus Capital Partners, with participation from Partech, Nathan Benaich’s Air Street Capital and Miele Venture.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Singularity University alumnus Alberto Rizzoli and former R&amp;D lead at RSI, Simon Edwardsson (the same team behind &#8220;seeing&#8221; app Aipoly), the V7 Labs platform promises to accelerate the creation of high-quality training data by 10-100x. It does this by giving users the ability to build automated image and video data pipelines, organize and version complex data sets, and train and deploy &#8220;state-of-the-art&#8221; vision AI models.</p>
<p>“For companies to build computer vision solutions that deliver business value, they must continuously collect, label and retrain their models,” explains V7 Labs’ Rizzoli. “When we built Aipoly in 2015, we needed to build and maintain our own tools, whilst keeping up with the rapid state of the art of AI, because no third-party SaaS products were available”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fast-forward to today and Rizzoli says that many of the best computer vision companies are now turning to SaaS platforms like V7 to solve this problem. “There’s a lot to think of when building an AI startup, and ‘how can we efficiently store and query 100 different video data sets’ is something you only think of when you’re mid-flight in trying to deliver your service.</p>
<p>“V7 codifies industry best-practices for organizing data, labelling and launching computer vision models for real-world problems”.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088643" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088643" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2088643" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="430" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg 954w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=768,485 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bina-lab-flood-recognition.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088643" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> V7 Labs</p></div></p>
<p>The browser and cloud-based platform claims the ability to quickly upload and render large image/video data sets “without lag,” and enable labelling to be automated (to varying degrees) without the need for prior training data. V7 has also been designed to make it possible to keep track of a very large number of labels per image/video, supporting thousands of annotations per image and millions of images per data set. Crucially, Rizzoli tells me it is possible to train, deploy and run computer vision models within the platform “in a few clicks without having to worry about DevOps”.</p>
<p>“Customers will soon be able to audit those models &#8212; and their corresponding training sets &#8212; to debug, test data quality, discover failure cases and eliminate any unwanted bias,” he adds, noting that these are all huge unsolved pain-points in the AI industry.</p>
<p>To that end, V7 Labs&#8217; existing 100 or so customers include Tractable, GE Healthcare and Merck. It is growing fastest within medical imaging, in part because it offers support for DICOM annotation and HIPAA compliance, both must-haves in healthcare.</p>
<p>However, measured by the quantity of data processed on the platform, Rizzoli tells me that routine “expert inspections” are the most popular tasks. “These include dozens of companies using AI to look for damage or anomalies in cars, oil rigs, power lines, pipelines or roads,” he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese tech giants have drawn international criticism after research showed they have technologies that enable the authorities to profile Muslim Uyghurs.</p>
<p>The cloud computing unit of Alibaba, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alibaba-cloud" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alibaba-cloud">Alibaba Cloud, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> developed a facial recognition algorithm that can identify a person&#8217;s ethnicity or whether a person is &#8220;Uyghur&#8221;, according to <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/alibaba-uyghur">research</a> from surveillance industry publication IPVM.</p>
<p>China has repeatedly <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1723306.shtml">defended</a> its controversial &#8220;<a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xwfw_665399/s2510_665401/t1623846.shtml">vocational training programs</a>&#8221; imposed upon its Muslim ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs, Kazakhs and others, as part of what the government calls counter-terrorism efforts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alibaba <a href="https://www.alizila.com/statement-from-alibaba-group-regarding-recent-reports-of-the-companys-facial-recognition-technology/">said</a> in a statement that it is &#8220;dismayed&#8221; to learn that Alibaba Cloud tested a technology that included &#8220;ethnicity as an algorithm&#8221; and that &#8220;racial or ethnic discrimination or profiling in any form violates Alibaba’s policies and values.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We never intended our technology to be used for and will not permit it to be used for targeting specific ethnic groups, and we have eliminated any ethnic tag in our product offering. This trial technology was not deployed by any customer. We do not and will not permit our technology to be used to target or identify specific ethnic groups,&#8221; the company added.</p>
<p>A security breach from last year revealed that a &#8220;smart city&#8221; surveillance system hosted on Alibaba Cloud could detect people&#8217;s ethnicity or label them Uyghur Muslim, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/china-smart-city-exposed/">reported</a> earlier. At the time, Alibaba said as a public cloud provider, it &#8220;does not have the right to access the content in the customer database.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Security lapse exposed a Chinese smart city surveillance system&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/china-smart-city-exposed/embed/#?secret=hEEqYZpg55" data-secret="hEEqYZpg55" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>IPVM also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/12/huawei-uighurs-identify/">found</a> earlier this month that Huawei and artificial intelligence unicorn Megvii, known for its facial recognition product Face++, jointly developed a technology that could alert the Chinese government when the system detected the face of a member from the Uyghur community.</p>
<p>As China&#8217;s tech upstarts seek overseas growth, they increasingly find themselves stuck between the demands of Beijing and international scrutiny over their stance on human rights issues.</p>
<p>Cloud computing is one of Alibaba&#8217;s fastest-growing segments and the giant is eyeing to attract more international customers. Last year, Alibaba Cloud was the biggest player in the Asia Pacific region and the third-largest Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider globally, <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-named-by-gartner-as-third-biggest-global-provider-for-iaas-and-first-in-asia-pacific_596191">according to</a> research firm Gartner.</p>
<p>Alibaba&#8217;s cloud unit grew 60% year-over-year to account for nearly 10% of the firm&#8217;s revenues in the <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p201105.pdf">three months ended September</a>. As of the quarter, approximately 60% of A-share listed companies, those that are based in mainland China and trade in RMB, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">are customers of Alibaba Cloud, the company claimed.</span></p>
