										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://jointoucan.com/">Toucan</a>, a startup that helps users learn a new language while they browse the web, is announcing that it has raised an additional $4.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/toucan-funding/">As I wrote last fall</a>, the Santa Monica, Calif.-based startup has built a Chrome extension that scans the text of whatever website you&#8217;re reading and translates select words into whichever language you&#8217;re trying to learn. That means you&#8217;re expanding your vocabulary without having to make time to study or otherwise change your behavior.</p>
<p>Toucan currently supports seven languages — Spanish, Korean, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese. Co-founder and CEO Taylor Nieman said the company now has around 60,000 monthly active users, all acquired organically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;On the surface, Toucan can look like a toy, but there&#8217;s massive engineering tech on the backend,&#8221; Nieman added.</p>
<p>For one thing, although the startup has a team of human translators, it also relies on machine learning and natural language processing to understand the context of each word and make sure it&#8217;s being translated properly. Nieman also said that the company also takes an intelligent, personalized approach to the translations that appear over time, allowing them to become more complex in order to keep challenging users.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144425" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144425" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2144425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?w=680" alt="Toucan screenshot" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg 1360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/browser-only.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144425" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Toucan</p></div></p>
<p>Toucan is free, but users can subscribe to Toucan Premium, which starts at $4.99 per month and offers a higher density of translated words. Premium subscribers can also opt in or out of advertising — apparently the ability to &#8220;own&#8221; a word (a.k.a. have your sponsorship message appear anytime that word is translated) is popular enough that some paying users don&#8217;t want to lose it.</p>
<p>Toucan has now raised a total of $7.5 million. The new round was led by LightShed Ventures, with participation from new investors Next Play Ventures, Concrete Rose Capital, GingerBread Capital, Form Capital, Goodwater Capital, Hampton VC, Spacecadet Ventures, GTMfund, Baron Davis Enterprises and Human Ventures, as well as existing investors GSV Ventures, Amplifyher Ventures and Vitalize.</p>
<p>“Screen time is escalating globally with younger generations living their lives always connected,&#8221; said LightShed Ventures General Partner Richard Greenfield in a statement. &#8220;Toucan seamlessly integrates language learning into the websites (and soon apps) you are already using via a simple browser extension transforming screen time into learning time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nieman said Toucan will use the new funding to expand the team from 12 to 16. It&#8217;s also planning to internationalize — so not just translating English to Spanish, but Spanish to English, and so on — and is launching a new Safari extension (it will support more browsers in the future). The ultimately vision is for Toucan to be &#8220;layered wherever you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be this augmented layer of learning on the web, on mobile browsing, the most popular social apps and even in the physical world,&#8221; she said, predicting that in the future, you might be &#8220;wearing a crazy cool contact lens that can translate a sign on the subway and provide you with those same micro-moments of learning.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile social networking app for women, <a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/">Peanut</a>, is today becoming the latest tech company to integrate audio into its product following the success of Clubhouse. Peanut, which began with a focus on motherhood, has expanded over the years to support women through all life stages, including pregnancy, marriage and even menopause. It sees its voice chat feature, which it&#8217;s calling &#8220;Pods,&#8221; as a way women on its app can make better connections in a more supportive, safer environment than other platforms may provide.</p>
<p>The pandemic, of course, likely drove some of the interest in audio-based social networking, as people who had been stuck at home found it helped to fill the gap that in-person networking and social events once did. However, voice chat social networking leader Clubhouse has since seen its model turned into what&#8217;s now just a feature for companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, and others to adopt.</p>
<p>Like many of the Clubhouse clones to date, Peanut&#8217;s Pods offer the basics, including a muted audience of listeners who virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to speak, emoji reactions, and hosts who can moderate the conversations and invite people to speak, among other things. The company, for now, is doing its own in-house moderation on the audio pods, to ensure the conversations don&#8217;t violate the company&#8217;s terms. In time, it plans to scale to include other moderators. (The company pays over two dozen moderators to help it manage the rest of its app, but this team has not yet been trained on audio, Peanut notes.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though there are similarities with Clubhouse in its design, what Peanut believes will differentiate its audio experience from the rest of the pack is where these conversations are taking place &#8212; on a network designed for women built with safety and trust in mind. It&#8217;s also a network where chasing clout is not the reason people participate.</p>
<p>Traditional social networks are often based on how many likes you have, how many followers you have, or if you&#8217;re verified with a blue check, explains Peanut founder CEO Michelle Kennedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of all based around status and popularity,&#8221; she says. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve only ever seen on Peanut is this &#8216;economy of care,&#8217; where women are really supportive of one another. It&#8217;s really never been about, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got X number of followers.&#8217; We don&#8217;t even have that concept. It&#8217;s always been about: &#8216;I need support; I have this question; I&#8217;m lonely or looking for a friend;&#8217; or whatever it might be,&#8221; Kennedy adds.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKE6H5HDf2I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>In Peanut Pods, the company says it will continue to enforce the safety standards that make women feel comfortable social networking. This focus in particular could attract some of the women, and <a href="https://www.thelily.com/women-in-tech-are-networking-through-clubhouse-an-invite-only-app-but-these-black-women-say-its-not-a-place-for-us/">particularly</a> women of color, who have been <a href="https://taylorlorenz.medium.com/clubhouse-moderation-issues-and-incidents-726a88a1b4bd">targeted</a> with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/the-murky-world-of-moderation-on-clubhouse">harassment</a> on other voice-based networking platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one thing I would say is we&#8217;re a community, and we have standards,&#8221; notes Kennedy. &#8220;When you have standards and you let everyone know what those standards are, it&#8217;s very clear. You&#8217;re allowed an opinion but what you&#8217;re not allowed to do are listed here&#8230;Here are the things we expect of you as a user and we&#8217;ll reward you if you do it and if you don&#8217;t, we&#8217;re going to ask you to leave,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is not what Peanut&#8217;s about, she adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have standards and we ask you to adhere to them,&#8221; says Kennedy.</p>
<p>In time, Peanut envisions using the audio feature to help connect women with people who have specific expertise, like lactation consultants for new moms or fertility doctors, for example. But these will not be positioned as lectures where listeners are held hostage as a speaker drones on and on. In fact, Peanut&#8217;s design does away with the &#8220;stage&#8221; concept from Clubhouse to give everyone equal status &#8212; whether they&#8217;re speaking or not.</p>
<p>In the app, users will be able to find interesting chats based on what topics they&#8217;re already following &#8212; and, importantly, they can avoid being shown other topics by muting them.</p>
<p>The Pods feature is rolling out to Peanut&#8217;s app starting today, where it will reach the company&#8217;s now 2 million-plus users. It will be free to use, like all of Peanut, though the company plans to eventually launch a freemium model with some paid products further down the road.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the course of the last few years, <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> morphed from a basic newsletter platform to a fully-fledged marketing company. And while the service already offered integrations with a number of e-commerce sites, it is now launching its own online stores for small and medium businesses, as well as a new appointment booking service.</p>
<p>These new services will be part of MailChimp&#8217;s new &#8216;Websites &amp; Commerce&#8217; plans, which starts with a free tier that offers most of the basic functionality. Users on the free plan will pay a 2% transaction fee. For $10/month, Mailchimp will remove its own branding and users will get access to email and chat support and only pay a 1.5% transaction fee, while those who opt for the &#8216;Plus&#8217; plan at $29/month will only pay a 0.5% transaction fee per order.</p>
<p>All plans will let users build sites with unlimited pages and without bandwidth restrictions, and include SEO tools and integration with Google Analytics. As for the stores, users will be able to build their product catalogs and manage their orders, taxes and shipping configurations. All of this, as well as the appointments functionality, is obviously deeply integrated with the rest of the Mailchimp stack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2144064" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mailchimp_gif.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144064" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144064" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mailchimp_gif.gif" alt="" width="800" height="402" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144064" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mailchimp</p></div></p>
<p>These new plans are currently in beta and the new e-commerce features will become available to all Mailchimp customers in the U.S. and UK by May 18, while the appointments booking feature will go live for all users on April 28.</p>
<p>This addition of built-in commerce features marks a major step in Mailchimp&#8217;s evolution. But it also makes sense. The company says about 40% of its customers over fourteen million customers are in the commerce space already and many of them have been asking for more native commerce features. Almost 30% of its users are also using its existing commerce features and integrations and the company saw its revenue for e-commerce customers grow 61% from 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>Since Mailchimp already offers websites, domains and other adjacent services, adding these new features feels like a natural next step, whether that&#8217;s selling directly from a Mailchimp store or taking appointment bookings for a service business.</p>
<p>The company stresses that while it is entering a new space, it is not walking away from its existing products and customers. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rest assured, we’re not abandoning our smart marketing solutions,&#8221; Mailchimp CEO and co-founder Ben Chestnut writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;In fact, our goal is still to have the best email marketing in the world. We know our customers and partners demand consistency and continuity as much as they demand new features and functionality, so we’re refining and nurturing existing tools, too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We continue to work on making the process of designing emails as easy as possible, and in a few months we’re adding new beautiful email templates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Like all business operators and investors, I value recurring revenue. From my time as president &amp; CFO of Shutterstock and in many other positions over the last 15 years, I have seen just how powerful a pitch-perfect subscription model can be for scaling quickly and responsibly.</p>
<p>However, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has perhaps become a bit too interchangeable with subscription models. Every software company now looks to sell by subscription ASAP, but the model itself might not fit all industries or, more importantly, align with customer needs, especially early on.</p>
<h2>New categories make for skeptical customers</h2>
<p>In established categories, customers have preconceived ideas as to what a software product should look like and how it should work and be sold. In most cases, this aligns with subscriptions. Customers are just used to it.</p>
<p>However, newer categories of software that address fresh problems-to-solve bring more skeptical, or at least, less experienced customers. They usually want to try a variety of solutions before they settle on the one that works for them. This means they will naturally value flexible terms more than the companies in established categories might.</p>
<p>Requiring commitment via subscriptions or larger agreements up front, in this environment, might actually hurt you rather than help you solidify your value proposition. Moreover, it certainly does not align with the customer’s need to identify the best solution for them by trying several.</p>
<p>A great example of this is the virtual events category. The COVID-19 pandemic instantly created a massive need for better virtual event software. Initially, people tried to use standard video call software for this purpose, but quickly came to the conclusion that they needed more customized solutions, since, as we all now know (and event planners knew all along), events are not meetings!</p>
<p>What happened? Lots of new virtual event companies and products sprang up, and with no established favorite and no clear understanding of the category, customers wanted to try out a variety of solutions. A similar series of events unfolds regularly in many other categories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What will China&#8217;s answer to Estée Lauder look like in the digital age?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/shopal-6257">Ushopal</a>, it will provide a seamless online and offline shopping experience, where China&#8217;s savvy beauty shoppers get to discover niche, tasteful brands and learn their stories.</p>
<p>Ushopal was founded in 2017 by J&amp;J veteran Lu Guo as an &#8220;omni-channel&#8221; partner for luxury beauty brands at a time when online and offline consumption were increasingly merging in China. Unlike traditional import distributors, which simply puts goods on the shelves, Ushopal offers a holistic solution that helps brands develop their digital and brick-and-mortar retail channels as well as marketing content through its network of 2,500 influencers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ushopal felt that patnerships weren&#8217;t enough, so in 2019, it took a step further by adding a strategic investment arm to seek deeper operational influence on brands. Check sizes range from $10 million to $100 million, and for the larger rounds, Ushopal says it can leverage its own investors such as Cathay Capital, a private equity firm focused on global companies.</p>
<p>For instance, Cathay Capital bought a minority stake in the Paris-based, high-end fragrance brand Juliette Has A Gun. As its investor and partner, Ushopal helped the brand, which was founded by the grandson of the legendary couturier Nina Ricci, grow its gross merchandise value in China from zero to over 70 million yuan within a year.</p>
<p>To boost its capital pool, Ushopal raised <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ushopal-completes-another-round-of-financing-raising-100-million-usd-reinforcing-leadership-as-a-luxury-beauty-omni-brand-partner-for-china-301242206.html">$100 million</a> in March that lifted its total fundings to $200 million. Aside from Cathay Capital, its past investors also include FountainVest Partners, a Chinese private equity firm that recently acquired the Canadian premium outdoor clothing label Arc&#8217;teryx, and Chinaccelerator, SOSV&#8217;s China-based accelerator focused on cross-border businesses.</p>
<p>Chinese consumers are hooked to e-commerce today, but there is still much of the shopping experience that Alibaba&#8217;s marketplace and WeChat mini-stores can&#8217;t offer. As such, Ushopal opened its first multi-brand store in an upscale mall in Shanghai last year, carrying brands that are normally found in Neiman Marcus in the U.S. and Le Bon Marché in Paris. The goal is to showcase treasures from around the world, an idea that is captured by the chain&#8217;s name &#8212; Bonnie&amp;Clyde &#8212; the names of a Depression-era crime couple who is often depicted as chic and rebellious in popular culture.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Customers don&#8217;t pay at B&amp;C&#8217;s brick-and-mortar store; instead, they order through its app and can have the order delivered to their doorsteps within four hours if they live in Shanghai. </span>The delivery time is much shorter than China&#8217;s standard e-commerce import practice, which normally takes three to seven days for goods to arrive from their overseas distribution centers.</p>
<p>B&amp;C, on the other hand, stockpiles in its own warehouse in a free trade zone in Shanghai, which allows for much quicker delivery. And since it holds exclusive and selective distribution rights to the brands it works with, it has a good grasp over how much inventory to keep.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144364" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144364" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/46291619534641_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/46291619534641_.pic_hd.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/46291619534641_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/46291619534641_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/46291619534641_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/46291619534641_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/46291619534641_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/46291619534641_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/46291619534641_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144364" class="wp-caption-text">A promotional short video made by Ushopal for Juliette Has A Gun in China</p></div></p>
<p>At China&#8217;s beauty stores targeting the mass market, shoppers are often seen moving from one busily stocked shelf to another while their eyes are fixated on their phones<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, browsing product reviews on content commerce apps like Xiaohongshu. </span>B&amp;C wants full attention from its customers by limiting its in-store product number and statinoing a team of beauty advisors. The demographics it targets are also quite different.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they are traveling in the U.S., they are going to Barneys, Saxs Fifth Avenue and whey they are in the U.K., they are going to Harrods,&#8221; Lau, vice president of brands at Ushopal, told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;They are familiar with the experience, and they are not here to line up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, B&amp;C generated over $200 million in gross merchandise value through the products it bought from a dozen of brands and subsequently sold in China. The average ticket size of its sales was over 5,000 yuan ($770), with shoppers often spending over 10,000 yuan per order, according to Lau. Many of the customers were what he called &#8220;second-generation rich,&#8221; roughly China&#8217;s equivalent to trust fund kids, as well as &#8220;well-to-do wives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ushopal doesn&#8217;t limit its portfolio to overseas products. It doesn&#8217;t distinguish the origin of a brand, said Lau, whether it&#8217;s Chinese, Japanese or European. Though the company mainly works with Western brands at the moment, Lau said Chinese brands are becoming more sophisticated and often understand the local market better.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us, it&#8217;s just about creating great brands. It&#8217;s like Estée Lauder, which has brands from all over the world. We are a China-based company but a global luxury business.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://greenlightcard.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenlight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the fintech company that pitches parents on kid-friendly bank accounts, has raised $260 million in a Series D funding round that nearly doubles its valuation to $2.3 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding comes just months after the Atlanta-based startup landed $215 million in funding at a $1.2 billion valuation. With the latest round, Greenlight has now raised over $550 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led its Series D, which also included participation from return backers TTV Capital, Canapi Ventures, Wells Fargo Strategic Capital, BOND, Fin VC, Goodwater Capital, as well as new investors Wellington Management, Owl Ventures and LionTree Partners.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it launched its debit cards for kids in 2017, the company has managed to set up accounts for more than 3 million parents and children, who have saved more than $120 million through the app. That’s up from 2 million parents and kids having saved $50 million at the time of its September 2020 raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Greenlight says it has “more than tripled” YoY revenue, more than doubled the number of parents and kids on its platform and doubled the size of its team within the past year.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144362" style="width: 238px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144362" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2144362" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Parent-Child-Dashboard.png?w=150" alt="" width="228" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Parent-Child-Dashboard.png 850w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Parent-Child-Dashboard.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Parent-Child-Dashboard.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Parent-Child-Dashboard.png?resize=768,1536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Parent-Child-Dashboard.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Parent-Child-Dashboard.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144362" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Greenlight</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Greenlight has quickly emerged as a leader in the family finance category,&#8221; said Andreessen Horowitz general partner David George, who will join Greenlight’s board of directors, in a written statement. “Greenlight was built to help parents raise financially-smart kids, and with its breakthrough combination of easy-to-use money management tools and educational resources, the company is well-positioned to become one of the most loved and trusted brands for families around the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he company pitches itself as more than just a debit card, with apps that give parents the ability to deposit money in accounts and pay for allowance, manage chores and set flexible controls on how much kids can spend. In January, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenlight introduced its educational investing platform for kids — Greenlight Max. Through that platform, kids can research stocks with analysis from Morningstar and actually make real investments in companies like Apple, Tesla, Microsoft and Amazon as long as their parents approve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As TechCrunch previously reported, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s a potentially massive business that can lock in a whole generation to a financial services platform, which is likely one reason why a whole slew of companies have launched with a similar thesis. There’s Kard, Step, Till Financial and Current pitching similar businesses in the U.S. and Mozper recently launched from Y Combinator to bring the model to Latin America. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/">Step</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/mobile-bank-current-raises-220-million-series-d-triples-valuation-to-2-2b/">Current</a> also announced big rounds today, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/forget-the-piggy-bank-till-financials-kids-spend-management-app-gets-gates-backing/">Till Financial</a> announced its seed round last week. Notably, a16z also led Current&#8217;s raise).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our vision at Greenlight is to create a world where every child grows up to be financially healthy and happy,” said Tim Sheehan, co-founder and CEO of Greenlight. “Today’s financing will enable us to bring even more value to families as we continue to introduce new innovative products that shine a light on the world of money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenlight says it will use the new capital to accelerate product development to add more financial services to its platform as well as to invest further in strategic distribution partnerships and geographic expansion. It also plans to hire another 300 employees over the next two years, with an emphasis on engineers.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.venasolutions.com/?utm_source=release&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=FY22Q1_Fund_Raise_4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vena</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Canadian company focused on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate Performance Management (</span>CPM<span style="font-weight: 400;">) software </span>space<span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $242 million in Series C funding from Vista Equity Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the financing, Vista Equity is taking a minority stake in the company. The round follows $25 million in financing from CIBC Innovation Banking last September, and brings Vena’s total raised since its 2011 inception to over $363 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vena declined to provide any financial metrics or the valuation at which the new capital was raised, saying only that its “consistent growth and&#8230;strong customer retention and satisfaction metrics created real demand” as it considered raising its C round.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was originally founded as a B2B provider of planning, budgeting and forecasting software. Over time, it’s evolved into what it describes as a “fully cloud-native, corporate performance management platform” that aims to empower finance, operations and business leaders to “Plan to Grow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">their businesses. Its customers hail from a variety of industries, including banking, SaaS, manufacturing, healthcare, insurance and higher education. Among its over 900 customers are the Kansas City Chiefs, Coca-Cola Consolidated, World Vision International and ELF Cosmetics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vena CEO Hunter Madeley </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">told TechCrunch the latest raise is “mostly an acceleration story for Vena, rather than charting new paths.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new funds to build out and enable its go-to-market efforts as well as invest in its product development roadmap. It’s not really looking to enter new markets, considering it’s seeing what it describes as “tremendous demand” in the markets it currently serves directly and through its partner network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we support customers across the globe, we’ll stay focused on growing our North American, U.K. and European business in the near term,” Madeley said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vena says it leverages the “flexibility and familiarity” of an Excel interface within its “secure” Complete Planning platform.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Interactive voice advertising startup <a href="https://instreamatic.com/">Instreamatic</a>, which can insert interactive voice ads into an audio stream, has raised $6.1 million in a Series A funding led by <a href="https://www.progressventures.com/">Progress Ventures</a> led the round, joined by <a href="https://accomplice.co/">Accomplice</a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/assistant-investments">Google Assistant Investments</a>.</p>
<p>SF-HQ&#8217;d Instreamatic lets brands that advertise through streaming music apps and podcasts (for instance) have interactive voice-based dialogues with consumers. So instead of an audio ad playing in a one-way experience (as all adverts currently do), the listener can talk to, and interact, with the ad.</p>
<p>For example, when an Instreamatic advert says “Hello! Need help sleeping?” the microphone on the device it&#8217;s playing on opens, and the listener can respond however they like. If they say “Yes” then the brand&#8217;s voice (perhaps it&#8217;s a mattress brand) will respond with “Then we will sing you a lullaby&#8221;. If the user doesn’t respond then the ad experience is over and the content resumes playing. There are also more complex versions of this scenario. The key is that Instreamatic knows what happened and can tailor future ads to match the listener&#8217;s past engagement. <a href="https://dsc.cloud/FK/UberEats_1.mp4">Here’s an example</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_K9oLORbOc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The company says its technology can understand the ‘intent and tone’ of consumers’ natural responses to take the next action.</p>
<p>The upshot is that this AI-fueled voice ad could be coming to an audio stream near you soon. And with audio exploding following the pandemic, the platform is likely to benefit.</p>
<p>CEO Stas Tushinskiy, CEO, Instreamatic said in a statement: “Consumers don’t like being fed annoyingly repetitive ads. Brands are under ever-increasing pressure to make those moments meaningful while supporting strong ROI demands. On the publisher side, audio and video platforms need a better way to prove their audiences and ad inventory deliver their promise to brands. Our voice AI infrastructure, deployed by brands such as IKEA, Infiniti, and HP and across platforms like Pandora and Gaana, is empirically demonstrating that conversational marketing benefits brands, consumers, and publishers alike.”</p>
<p>Instreamatic says its voice ads can reach an average of 12% engagement, with some campaigns reaching 19%. These figures are quite unusual for the online advertising industry &#8211; the average CTR of mobile advertising is 0.6%.</p>
<p>The company says that a recent campaign by Infiniti saw 5.5% of listeners who declined the offer in the first conversation ask to receive more information about the vehicle after the second (and more personalized) chat.</p>
<p>Instreamatic also says it can achieve what it calls ‘continuous dialogues’ with consumers, not dissimilar to an Alexa or Siri device.</p>
<p>Because of the platforms complexity, Instreamatic also says it can build up a profile of the user based on an individual consumer’s previous interactions with a brand, allowing it to customize future campaigns.</p>
<p>So far brands that have used the platform include Pandora, Salem Media, Gaana (the Indian streaming music service), as well as a recent deal with Universal Electronics to expand voice ads into the smart-TV industry. It is also working with Triton Digital, one of the larger audio ad networks.</p>

<p> <br />
“Consumer demand for audio and video content, and the ubiquity of smart devices delivering that content on-demand, continues to accelerate,” said Nick MacShane, the founding partner at Progress Ventures, the venture capital arm of Progress Partners, a full-service merchant bank. “What hasn’t caught up is how brands and publishers can effectively engage those audiences in the same medium and analytically prove the ROI of their audio and video platform ad spend.”<br />
 <br />
A competitor to Instreamatic is AdsWizz, which, instead of voice, allows users to shake their phones when they are interested in an ad. But its interactions are obviously, therefore, more limited.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/08/voice-enabled-smart-speakers-to-reach-55-of-u-s-households-by-2022-says-report/">According to Juniper Research</a>, the voice-based ad market will grow to $19 billion in the U.S. by 2022, growing the market share from the $17 billion audio ad market and the $57 billion programmatic ad market. Voice assistant usage is booming. Some estimates put it at over at 3 billion right, and half of all searches are expected to be done via voice. Some 55% of teens use voice search daily.</p>
<p>As well as Tushinskiy, the Instreamatic team also includes cofounder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-dunlop-85b328/?originalSubdomain=uk">Simon Dunlop</a> (former CEO/Founder of Bookmate, a subscription-based reading and audiobook platform,  and Zvuk;  Victor Frumkin (co-founder at Zvuk, a mobile music streaming app in Eastern Europe and Bookmate); Ilya Lityuga, CTO, one of the original team members at RuTube; and Andy Whatley, U.S. radio industry veteran.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The director of a new unit set up this month inside the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog &#8212; with a dedicated focus on tech giants&#8217; impacts on digital markets &#8212; has been giving a hint of how it could operate, once it&#8217;s on a statutory footing and imbued with powers to sanction problem platforms and potentially even order some forms of structural separation.</p>
<p>The government announced its intention to regulate big tech in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">November</a> last year &#8212; saying it would establish a &#8220;pro-competition&#8221; regime to tackle concerns associated with digital markets, such as &#8216;winner takes all&#8217; network-effect dynamics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear when exactly that will happen &#8212; the government has only said it will do so as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The UK is devising its own approach to digital regulation now that the country is outside the European Union &#8212; where lawmakers recently proposed a major new set of pan-EU rules to apply to digital services (the Digital Services Act) and ex ante requirements for the largest tech giants (the Digital Markets Act).</p>
<p>EU lawmakers have also proposed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">draft rules for high risk applications of AI,</a> while the UK has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">Online Safety bill</a> in the pipeline (a legislative proposal is due this year) &#8212; so there are a lot of new digital rules being written right now, and the potential for confusing and counterproductive regulatory overlap if lawmakers don&#8217;t end up on the same page.</p>
<p>Continued divergence of approach between the UK and the EU is, nonetheless, to be expected, even as UK lawmakers say they want to engage with the international community as they work on drafting rules to ensure a British digital rulebook aligns in spirit (if not letter) with requirements being shaped for Internet platforms elsewhere.</p>

<p>The UK&#8217;s Digital Markets Unit (DMU) launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">earlier this month</a>, to help support the government as it drafts legislation to put it on a statutory footing and ahead of the unit being able to function as big tech&#8217;s British overseer.</p>
<p>Speaking at <a href="https://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/agenda/Competition-in-digital-markets-2021.pdf">a conference</a> on Friday the head of the DMU, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-batchelor-b61072b2/">Catherine Batchelor</a>, detailed the approach she wants the unit to take, and some of the powers it has advised the government it needs to deliver on ministers&#8217; goal of fostering competition in tipping-prone digital markets.</p>
<p>Giving an overview of the issues, she said a new approach is needed to regulating digital markets owing to changed dynamics &#8212; noting that companies &#8220;who were once garage startups or started from campuses in universities [and] are now the most powerful firms across the world&#8221; &#8212; and saying tech giants have been able to accrue so much market power as a result of digital market characteristics like access to data; network effects and economies of scale associated with platform business; and the ecosystems firms have been able to build around their core businesses &#8212; leveraging those interlocking benefits of data, scale and network effects to also acquire rivals to (further) grow and consolidate a powerful position.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might say well what&#8217;s the danger of that? But I think we see the danger of that on a day to day basis. Firms can use this position to exploit the consumers and businesses that rely on them,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;From a business perspective that might be the price you&#8217;re paying to sell your goods and services on the marketplace or the price you&#8217;re paying to list your app in an app store or the price you&#8217;re paying to advertise your products and services.</p>
<p>For consumers she pointed out they may be &#8216;paying&#8217; for free digital goods and services with their attention or data, highlighting concerns over whether the amount of data being provided by users is a &#8220;fair exchange&#8221; for what they&#8217;re getting in return.</p>
<p>On the business side, Batchelor pointed to &#8216;self preferencing&#8217; as one of the problematic &#8220;exclusionary&#8221; tactics tech giants indulge in that the unit will be seeking to tackle. &#8220;The overarching impact of that is a less vibrant digital economy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have these new tech firms coming through, able to grow in the way the ones of old were.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem with trying to tackle unfair (digital) market behaviors with existing competition law is that it can&#8217;t be &#8220;proactive and preventative&#8221;, she said &#8212; hence DMU has recommended setting rules that prevent firms from engaging in such conduct in the first place.</p>
<p>But she also said the unit is keen to avoid the risk of over-regulating. So unlike the EU&#8217;s DMA proposal it hasn&#8217;t supported having a set list of &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; to apply universally to all platforms which fall under scope of the regulation.</p>
<p>Instead she said it wants more flexibility to target requirements at specific platforms &#8212; to take account of unique characteristics and any variations in market or operation.</p>
<p>On the question of who would fall under scope of the incoming pro-competition regime, the unit has recommended an &#8220;evidence-based assessment&#8221; to define whether or not a firm has &#8216;strategic market status&#8217; (SMS) &#8212; meaning they are &#8220;in a position which is unlikely to be transitory&#8221;, as she put it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our recommendations were that to come within scope of this regime the DMU should have to assess whether a firm has substantial, entrenched market power and that that market power provides the firm with a strategic position,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be looking at the factors which might lead to that entrenched position &#8212; so things like barriers to entry and expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The addition of strategic position is probably the more novel or more new element,&#8221; she added. &#8220;What we are getting at with that is whether the effects of the firm&#8217;s market power are particularly widespread or significant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Batchelor also gave a few examples of what strategic position might boil down to. Such as the sheer size of the business (which makes its impact particularly significant or widespread); or that the firm acts as an important access point to businesses trying to reach customers (along the lines of the &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; designation EU lawmakers have used in the DMA); or its ability to leverage or extend its market power from a core operational market into neighbouring markets.</p>
<p>The recommendation is for the SMS test to be carried out by the regulator, which would consult and take views during the process of arriving at a designation &#8212; a period which she suggested could take as long as a year.</p>
<p>It has also recommended that the SMS designation &#8212; once arrived at &#8212; is fixed for a set period. (Batchelor said they&#8217;d recommended five years.)</p>
<p>Firms that meet the SMS test will be subject to the full sweep of the pro-competition regime. The DMU wants this to include a preventative code of conduct &#8212; specific to the firm but with general objectives set out in legislation (such as &#8220;fair trading, open choices and trust and transparency&#8221;). And the government appears to have accepted that approach.</p>
<p>Also speaking at the conference was Harry Lund, who works on digital policy at the Department of Digital, Media, Culture and Sport, as deputy director for digital regulation and markets, as it draws up the new competition approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the centre of this regime will be an enforceable code of conduct to provide firms with substantial and endearing market power &#8212; so &#8216;SMS&#8217; status &#8212; with clear expectations over what&#8217;s acceptable and what&#8217;s not acceptable behavior,&#8221; he said, adding: &#8220;The government has also accepted the case in principle for pro-competition interventions &#8212; which would address the underlying sources of market power, noting that these are potentially very major market interventions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lund added that the overarching aim for the regime will be for regulators &#8220;to proactively shape platforms&#8217; behaviour to avoid harmful behavior before it happens&#8221;, while when harmful behavior does happen the goal is to be able to address it more quickly then currently happens under existing competition law.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DMU would be able to set the code itself, very much targeted at the evidence of harms and problematic conduct that was identified through the SMS designation,&#8221; Batchelor went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the key factors that we highlighted in our advice is the ability for these codes to differ between the activities of different SMS firms. So we are not necessarily recommending there is one code that is uniform across different SMS firms and activities but that there should be the discretion to be able to target those codes depending on the particular activity that is of concern, or the particular business model of the firm for example,&#8221; she went on, flagging that as a distinguishing feature from the European Commission&#8217;s approach &#8212; and part of the DMU&#8217;s philosophy of trying to avoid &#8220;over or under regulation&#8221;.</p>
<p>The idea is therefore &#8220;the ability to go further when you feel that it warrants it, but equally the ability to row back and take away regulation where you feel it&#8217;s not needed for a particular firm&#8221;, she also said, adding that the unit feels that&#8217;s &#8220;very important&#8221;.</p>
<p>Batchelor said the DMU has suggested each code be developed alongside an SMS designation &#8212; so that a consultation on a firm&#8217;s SMS status would happen in parallel to a consultation on a draft code of conduct for the same firm.</p>
<p>On top of the code, the DMU has proposed pro-competition interventions &#8212; which she said are intended to address the reason why a firm has a powerful position in the first place. The aim will be for interventions to try and promote &#8220;greater contestability, greater competition&#8221; in the markets where a given firm operates, she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are vital interventions if what you want to do is not just deal with the consequences of the firm having this powerful position &#8212; but actually try and change it for the future,&#8221; she emphasized.</p>
<p>The unit has suggested a range of pro-competitive interventions to be able to do the job &#8212; including data-related interventions, such as personal data mobility (so consumers can seamlessly move their data from platform to platform); interoperability; access to data (by competitors or third parties); common standards; and separation remedies &#8212; &#8220;not necessarily going so far as full ownership separation&#8221;, but perhaps separation of different business divisions within a firm, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognize that these are very significant interventions and would not be undertaken lightly. The idea around the pro-competitive interventions is that the DMU would have to go through&#8230; and evidence-based process to firstly identify what is the particular problem that is causing a lack of competition in the market but also then to satisfy itself that the remedy it&#8217;s proposing&#8230; is a rational, proportionate and effective way of dealing with that problem,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would expect significant consultation to go into the development of these remedies, and, for example, to undergo testing to ensure that they were effective and they were going to have the intended outcome. So we recognize the significance of these remedies but we also recognize how powerful they could be and we think they&#8217;re a very important part of the regulator&#8217;s toolkit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DMU has also proposed a bespoke merger regime for firms with SMS &#8212; including an obligation to make the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) aware of all intended transactions and mandatory notifications for some transactions that meet particular thresholds.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is in contrast to the CMA&#8217;s existing regime which is a voluntary regime,&#8221; Batchelor noted, saying the intent is to make sure the watchdog is in a position to consider the market impacts of proposed transactions.</p>
<p>Significantly, she said the DMU has proposed using &#8220;a more caution standard of proof&#8221; in relation to mergers &#8212; which could mean it will become much, much harder for tech giants to gain regulatory approval for acquisitions in the UK (assuming the government decides to take this particular piece of the DMU&#8217;s advice).</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re saying is that with this mergers, quite often there is a small likelihood of a very, very significant impact on competition, with the likelihood for significant harm, and with these tech mergers where you have these firms in such significant positions perhaps having to say that on the balance of probabilities this merger is likely to lead to a significant lessening of competition is too high a bar,&#8221; said Batchelor, adding: &#8220;We think that [having a more cautious standard of proof is] really important so we can effectively scrutinize the mergers and acquisitions that these firms are undertaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the enforcement front, she notes that it&#8217;s important the DMU is able to take action if firms breach codes of conduct or pro-competition interventions.</p>
<p>Though she said it has suggested a &#8220;participatory&#8221; approach to tackling compliance issues in the first instance &#8212; &#8220;working with the firm in a relatively informal way&#8221;, i.e. to try and address the problem without regulatory sanction.</p>
<p>If that fails she said it&#8217;s recommended the DMU has the power to order firms to change behaviors to comply with requirements. And for those tech giants that act negligently or intentionally breach requirements the DMU wants to have the power to issue &#8220;very significant&#8221; penalties &#8212; of up to 10% of a firm&#8217;s global annual turnover.</p>
<p>Lund said the government has a number of priorities as it works on developing and implementing the new regime &#8212; which includes instructing the DMU to look at how the code of conduct could work in practice for specific sectors of the economy &#8212; such as content creators and news publishers (&#8220;where we know from the CMA&#8217;s market study and other work that there&#8217;s a particular competition issue&#8221;).</p>
<p>It is also seeking to shape international debate on digital competition &#8212; such as at the G7. &#8220;The international dimension of this is really important. The UK is not operating in a vacuum so we&#8217;re looking to build consensus, foster dialogue and increase co-operation with international partners as they seek to develop their own approaches.&#8221;</p>
<p>He confirmed that a consultation will be launched later this year to set out the government&#8217;s vision on digital competition and its specific proposals for the regime &#8212; fed by the expert advice from the DMU (which Lund said DCMS is now working through, as well as taking advice from other sources).</p>
<p>The final details of the regime &#8212; including key elements such as penalties for breaches &#8212; will be set out in a legislative proposal from DCMS once it&#8217;s concluded the consultation process.</p>
<p>The latter is slated to take place in the first half of this year, but there&#8217;s no timeframe from government on when it will introduce legislation. But the soonest would logically be the second half of this year &#8212; so there&#8217;s no realistic prospect of legislation being introduced before 2022.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A discussion at the conference, Lund gave an example of a potential pro-competition remedy the DMU may be able to apply &#8212; albeit at what he couched as &#8220;the more radical end of the spectrum&#8221; &#8212; as ordering changes to default settings which affect how people&#8217;s data is collected, such as requiring an active opt in from consumers to gather their data, rather than consumers having to actively opt out.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be &#8220;one-size fits all&#8221;, he emphasized, saying &#8220;the tailored nature of the pro-competition interventions is that if that&#8217;s the issue then that&#8217;s where the remedy can be targeted&#8221;.</p>
<p>He added that the work reconfiguring competition policy for an era of digital giants is &#8220;complex and far-reaching&#8221;, adding: &#8220;A new competition regime will be a major change to the regulatory landscape so it&#8217;s really important we get it right.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Sao Paulo-based venture firm, has secured $10 million for its latest fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive Ventures has raised the capital from an impressive list of LPs including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investor Luis Stuhlberger, founding partner of Verde Asset Management and Teresa and Cândido Bracher, who was the chairman of Itaú-Unibanco, Brazil’s largest bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Brazilian venture firm’s self-described mission is to “invest in startups where every dollar of revenue is also delivering environmental or social impact.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke with co-founder and co-CEO Fabio Kestenbaum who emphasized the importance of such an investment strategy in a country like Brazil that has had its share of corruption over the years. (Kestenbaum co-founded the firm with </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-andrade-de-oliveira-03983129/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Oliveira</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruna-constantino-6773b57a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruna Constantino).</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive Ventures prides itself on being guided by the United Nations as part of its Global Compact </span><a href="https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/121901-Positive-Ventures.noncommunicating"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also has a </span><a href="https://bcorporation.net/directory/positive-ventures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top tier B Impact Score</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning as a B Corp. that makes impact part of its core strategy, it’s doing pretty darn good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm’s sweet spot is early-stage &#8212; Seed and Series A &#8212; ventures “that can deliver outsized impact and financial return,” according to Kestenbaum. Its average investment size is $500,000, but the firm can go up to $1.5 million in follow-on rounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive Ventures seeks to back impact-oriented early-stage companies “building breakthrough solutions to tackle massive challenges related to inequality and climate change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner and CIO Murilo J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ohas Menezes is based out of the Bay Area and leads the firm’s offshore strategy and investments in companies.</span></p>
<h2><b>Investments</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive Ventures is sector agnostic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but keeps three impact megatrends in mind when sourcing deals: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Planetary Boundaries</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as recycling, carbon, sustainable systems</span></li>
<li><b>Social Resilience</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as financial services, credit, workforce upskilling and </span></li>
<li><b>Institutional Voids</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focused on emerging economies’ most pressing challenges such as education, health and rising technologies.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you want to bring private capital to the game to help address social and environmental challenges, we have to reward this capital,” Kestenbaum told me in a previous interview. “As such, we recognize that we have to invest in good businesses that can provide financial returns as well.”So far, Positive Ventures has backed five companies from its new fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of its first investments, Labi Exames, went on to become a “yardstick for fighting Covid in Brazil,” Kestenbaum said, by delivering a fair-priced and quality alternative to test millions of uninsured low-income families in vulnerable communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labi helped support companies in reopening safely by continually testing their workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This hybrid value proposition made Labi the most admired health tech in Brazil and resulted in MRR growth beyond 600%, accelerating their Series B, which will happen in the upcoming months,” Kestenbuam noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another cornerstone investment for Positive Ventures was </span><a href="https://slangapp.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slang</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an AI-driven app to challenge the English illiteracy in Latin America backed by Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital and Mexico’s AllVP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Less than 3% of Brazilians speak English with proficiency, and such a void hammers their chances to get a decent job and improve income,” Kestenbaum said. “The same happens in all LATAM&#8217;s countries.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive Ventures recently went on to close its largest investment thus far &#8212; in </span><a href="https://provi.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a B-Certified fintech providing education-driven loans to enable upskilling and employability for LATAM&#8217;s workforce, starting in Brazil. The company&#8217;s mission is to revolutionize education by delivering hassle-free and impact-oriented credit.      </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provi has pioneered income-share agreements (ISAs) in the region and already generated over $30 million in credit, most of which will go toward technology and healthcare courses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up for Positive Ventures is a $30 million growth fund.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five months ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/adobe-acquires-marketing-workflow-startup-workfront-for-1-5b/">Adobe purchased Workfront</a> for $1.5 billion, a company that helps build marketing department workflows. Today the company is officially announcing how it intends to use it. As marketing executives try to balance mapping strategy to the creative process while building customized experiences, a marketing workflow tool would fit neatly into Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), and that&#8217;s where it has landed.</p>
<p>Alex Shootman, who was CEO at Workfront and is now VP and GM of Adobe Workfront, told me they see the tool as the system of record for the marketing department inside of AEM. While there is more than a hint of marketing in that explanation, the data from Workfront&#8217;s workflows acts as a record of the creative process.</p>
<p>As part of Adobe, the company has built hooks into Experience Manager and Creative Cloud to enable marketing&#8217;s creative work to move through an organized and auditable process, leaving a data trail that lets management know exactly what happened, a marketing system of record.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shootman says having this system of record in place allows marketing teams to do several things. For starters, it lets them connect strategy to execution. &#8220;If you think about a CMO, he or she and their team is developing the key priorities for decisions for the year or for the quarter [and this helps them] take those key priorities and make sure that they are driving the activities within the marketing organization,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says that involves connecting the people, processes and data within marketing into a single system where teams can iteratively plan on the work as changes arise. That&#8217;s where Workfront comes into play.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Adobe shifted a Las Vegas conference to executives&#8217; living rooms in less than 30 days&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/how-adobe-shifted-a-las-vegas-conference-to-executives-living-rooms-in-less-than-30-days/embed/#?secret=2Q08wcoikn" data-secret="2Q08wcoikn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Brent Leary, lead analyst at CRM Essentials, says the approach makes a great deal of sense. &#8220;Creating enough personalized content at scale to stay connected with customers as their needs evolve over time is a team sport. That calls for tighter collaboration throughout the creation process, and Workfront within the AEM brings a sophisticated project management capability to the creative process,&#8221; Leary said.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, that became imperative as the majority of sales moved on online. That increased the need for speed and agility. Having this workflow tool in place inside the Adobe Experience Manager means it&#8217;s not only allowing marketing to build customized experiences for its customers, it also enables them to automate the workflows behind those customizations.</p>
<p>The way this could work in practice is a marketing team creates a campaign and maps it out in Workfront. From there, creatives get assigned tasks and these tasks show up in Creative Cloud. When they complete the assignment, it automatically goes back into Workfront where it will be reviewed, eventually get approved and get published to the Digital Asset Management (DAM) tool where it will be available for use by the entire marketing team.</p>
<p>When it comes to acquisitions, it&#8217;s hard to know how well they&#8217;ll turn out, but Workfront seems particularly well suited to the Adobe ecosystem, a tool that can help bring a missing workflow automation component to the entire creative process, while allowing marketing execs to see exactly how their strategy played out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Popular family tracking app <a href="https://www.life360.com/">Life360</a> is investing in hardware. The company this morning announced the $37 million acquisition of Chicago-based <a href="https://www.jiobit.com/">Jiobit</a>, the maker of a wearable location device designed for use by families with younger children, pets, or seniors. The $37 million is primarily in stock and debt, Life360 notes, but if certain performance metrics are met within two calendar years following the deal&#8217;s close, the deal price could increase to $54.5 million.</p>
<p>The Jiobit was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/jiobit-launches-its-more-secure-modular-child-location-tracker-starting-at-99/">introduced</a> on the market in 2018, mainly as a kid and pet tracker. The small, lightweight device can be attached to items kids wear or carry, like belt loops, shoelaces, and school backpacks, and appealed in particular to families who wanted a way to track younger children who didn&#8217;t yet have their own mobile device. Earlier this year, t<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/jiobit-launches-an-improved-version-of-its-kid-or-pet-tracker-the-jiobit-next/">he company launched an updated version</a> of the Jiobit ($129.99) that included a combination of radios (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular and GPS), as well as sensors, including an accelerometer/pedometer, temperature sensor and barometer.</p>
<p>The new antenna system was specifically designed to increase performance inside schools, stores, high rises and other challenging signal environments. It also leveraged the reach of low-power, wide-area (LPWA) wireless networks in order to better serve rural regions where cellular coverage is limited and spotty. And the new device was waterproof (IPX8) up to 30 minutes in up to 5 feet of water and had a longer battery life.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Life360 envisions adding the Jiobit to its existing family safety membership, allowing family members and pets with the device attached to show in the Life360 mobile app&#8217;s map interface, alongside other family members. Life360&#8217;s paid users (Premium members) would get a discounted Jiobit along with their subscription.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve long wanted to expand beyond the smartphone into wearable devices, and Jiobit offers the market leading device for pets, younger children, and seniors,&#8221; said Chris Hulls, CEO and co-founder of Life360, in a statement about the deal. &#8220;With Jiobit, Life360 would be the market leader in both hardware and software products for families once the deal closes. We will continue to seek out additional opportunities that could further cement our position as the leading digital safety brand for families,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>San Francisco-based Life360 made a name for itself over the years as an app that parents love, but teens hate. In more recent months, however, the company has been responsive to teens&#8217; criticism of being helicopter-parented with no freedom of privacy, by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/family-tracking-app-life360-launches-bubbles-a-location-sharing-feature-inspired-by-teens-on-tiktok/">announcing new features like &#8220;bubbles&#8221;</a> that instead allow the teen to share a generalized location instead of their specific whereabouts. Hulls has also regularly engaged with teens via TikTok, in a clever marketing move.</p>
<p>As of the end of 2020, Life360 claimed more than 26 million monthly active users across 195 countries.</p>
<p>The acquisition is still pending the approval of the boards of the two companies.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Adobe today announced the launch of a new asset management tool, Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials. That&#8217;s a mouthful, but while the company didn&#8217;t necessarily simplify the name, the idea here is to give teams that work with lots of digital assets an easier-to-use management experience in the Adobe Experience Cloud than Adobe&#8217;s current enterprise-centric [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adobe today <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/04/27/introducing-adobe-experience-manager-assets-essentials-to-simplify-collaboration-across-teams.html">announced</a> the launch of a new asset management tool, Adobe Experience Manager Assets Essentials. That&#8217;s a mouthful, but while the company didn&#8217;t necessarily simplify the name, the idea here is to give teams that work with lots of digital assets an easier-to-use management experience in the Adobe Experience Cloud than Adobe&#8217;s current enterprise-centric asset management tool can offer.</p>
<p>In addition, Adobe is also launching the first tool to integrate this new experience: the Adobe Journey Optimizer. This new tool is meant to help users leverage their customer data to build out customer journeys and figure out the best ways to deliver messages and content along that journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;The push towards digital content and building these richer, engaging experiences &#8212; customers expect it,&#8221; Elliot Sedegah, director of Strategy and Product Marketing, Adobe, told me. &#8220;Almost every interaction that you go along, you expect a rich experience. And not only at that point of just having richer material, like images or video, etc., but you expect it at every point of interaction with that customer. So that customer, if you think of it, isn&#8217;t just interacting with a brand, but our customers, they think of it as a customer journey. So using the same content, from awareness to conversion to post-sale and loyalty &#8212; they expect that same story to maintain. And it&#8217;s getting increasingly hard to get to all the different touchpoints.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2144100" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-Metadata.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144100" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144100" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-Metadata.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144100" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>Like with similar products, the idea here is to create a centralized, collaborative space for content creators and the teams that use their work. In that respect, this new tool isn&#8217;t necessarily all that different from other shared online file management services. But Adobe is also leveraging some of its unique capabilities. It&#8217;s using its AI smarts and Adobe Sensei platform to help users organize and tag their assets, for example, to make them more easily searchable. And the new tool is integrated with Adobe Asset Link, so creative professionals can search, browse and edit these assets directly from Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and XD without having to switch context.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;CIO Cynthia Stoddard explains Adobe&#8217;s journey from boxes to the cloud&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/adobes-complex-journey-from-boxes-to-the-cloud/embed/#?secret=vPhg6SOXrm" data-secret="vPhg6SOXrm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As Sedegah noted, not too long ago, it was mostly the creative teams and marketing that were involved in the content creation and management process. But today, this group also includes sales teams and customer support, for example, and the pandemic only accelerated this process.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144099" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-View-Create-Tasks.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144099" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144099" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-View-Create-Tasks.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144099" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adobe</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;[Our customers] have been forced to rethink their business models, rethink the way that they engage with customers &#8212; and it essentially accelerated this digital-everywhere process of the experiences customers get, the agility that customers expect from businesses, and then the number of people &#8212; and how they work &#8212; leveraging that content.&#8221;</p>
<p>So while Adobe&#8217;s enterprise asset management tools worked just fine before, the company&#8217;s users were telling it that it needed to do a better job at creating tools that made its asset management technology easier to use by more teams.</p>
<p>The first tool to integrate this new asset management experience directly is the Journey Optimizer. &#8220;That was a great opportunity for us to rethink that user experience that our customers wanted to deliver &#8212; and then make it easier for that person to do,&#8221; Sedegah said. &#8220;So as you&#8217;re building out a content journey &#8212; or maybe you&#8217;re designing a piece of content that&#8217;s going to get sent to maybe a customer as they engage with a brand &#8212; the digital assets appear right there for that author to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next up for integration is <a href="https://www.workfront.com/">Workfront</a>, the work management platform Adobe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/adobe-acquires-marketing-workflow-startup-workfront-for-1-5b/">acquired last year</a>. There&#8217;s an obvious synergy here between Workfront&#8217;s abilities to manage the planning, review and approval stages of a project and an asset management system like this.</p>
<p>The long-term strategy, though, is to integrate this experience across all Experience Cloud applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.step.com/">Step</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/step-targets-teens-and-parents-with-a-no-fees-mobile-bank-account-and-visa-card/">digital banking service aimed at teens</a> and endorsed by TikTok star Charli D&#8217;Amelio, announced this morning the close of a $100 million round of Series C funding after growing to over 1.5 million users just six months after launch. The new round, led by General Catalyst, comes shortly after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/teen-banking-service-step-raises-50m-adds-tiktok-star-charli-damelio-to-investor-list/">Step&#8217;s $50 million Series B,</a> announced at the end of last year after the startup hit half a million users in only two months post-launch.</p>
<p>The new round also includes participation from Step&#8217;s existing investors, Coatue, Stripe, Charli D’Amelio, The Chainsmokers, Will Smith and Jeffrey Katzenberg, and brings on newcomer Franklin Templeton, signaling a plan to move into investments is on the horizon. It also includes actor and musician Jared Leto. Step is also formally announcing NBA All-Star Stephen Curry as an investor, which had not previously been disclosed, as well as former Square executives, Sarah Friar, Jacqueline Reses and Gokul Rajaram.</p>
<p>As a result of the fundraise, Kyle Doherty of General Catalyst is joining Step’s board. To date, Step has raised over $175 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>According to CEO CJ MacDonald, Step hasn&#8217;t yet spent the money from its Series B yet, but believes the additional funds can help the startup to grow more quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve signed up more than a million and a half accounts in the first six months. We&#8217;re signing up 10,000 accounts-plus a day, and there&#8217;s just a lot of things that we want to do to bring this to millions and millions of households to help educate the next generation be smarter with money,&#8221; he says. At the time of the Series B, for comparison, Step said it was adding round 7,000 to 10,000 accounts per day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly we don&#8217;t need the capital,&#8221; MacDonald added. &#8220;It&#8217;s just we think speed to market is really key and we think we can accelerate our growth and invest in infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is also planning to hire across operations, engineering, product, and design, to double its now 65-person team over the next year.</p>
<p>Step today competes in a crowded market of mobile banking services aimed at a younger demographic, but it&#8217;s one of very few that targets teenagers ages 13 to 18. Through Step&#8217;s app, teens gain access to an FDIC-insured bank account without fees and a secured Visa card that helps them to establish credit before they turn 18. The app also offers Venmo-like functionality for sending money to friends.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081789" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081789" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2081789" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="299" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg 2568w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=300,132 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=768,338 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=680,299 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=1536,676 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=2048,901 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Step-Product-Visuals.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081789" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Step</p></div></p>
<p>Step&#8217;s growth so far has benefitted from a combination of factors including word-of-mouth, use of social media, and its popular referral program, which has paid out a few dollars per new sign-up. Step has also leveraged its partnerships with social media influencers like D&#8217;Amelio and Josh Richards as well as celebs like Step investor Justin Timberlake.</p>
<p>The company believes the Curry announcement may also help to raise awareness about the banking app. As a father of three, if Curry talks about introducing Step to his own children, people will take notice.</p>
<p>While the additional funds are focused on driving growth, Step is also thinking about its future as its existing users begin to age up. The company plans to enter into the credit and lending market, as well as introduce investments at some point in the future. The Franklin Templeton investment could be useful here, MacDonald notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Franklin [Templeton is] obviously, one of the largest financial institutions in the world. And, as we start thinking about investments and the journey of the customer, to have a great brand like Franklin Templeton that&#8217;s invested in this round &#8212; I think it&#8217;s just a testament to where they see the world going,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Step&#8217;s fundraise falls on the same day that competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/mobile-bank-current-raises-220-million-series-d-triples-valuation-to-2-2b/">Current</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/">Greenlight</a>, both who focus on families, also raised new rounds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a bunch of tablet news coming from Amazon this morning. Leading the way is the release of two new 10-inch devices: the Fire HD 10 and Fire HD 10 Plus. The former features a 1080p display with a bump in brightness, an unnamed eight-core processor and 3GB of RAM &#8212; a 50% jump over the last version.</p>
<p>The device is thinner and lighter, with a stated 12 hours of battery life. As ever, the headliner here is the price. The system starts at $150, which includes 32GB of storage, which you can upgrade to 64GB. Adding $30 will upgrade you to the Plus, which bumps the RAM to 4GB, adds wireless Qi charging and upgrade’s the device&#8217;s finish.</p>
<p>There’s also a $220 bundle that includes a keyboard case and a year subscription to Microsoft 365 Personal. Or you can buy the magnetic case separately for $50.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Fire 10 Kids tablet is getting an upgrade as well, featuring the same battery life, coupled with a 10.1-inch HD display. That’s encased in a kid-proof case that features a combo kickstand/handle. It runs $200 and is aimed at ages 3 to 7.</p>

<p>Joining it is the Fire Kids Pro. We may have lost all meaning of the word “Pro” when it comes to consumer hardware. Here it means the device is aimed at slightly older and tech-savvy kids &#8212; namely ages 6 to 12. The device includes a digital store with restricted access, including some bigger apps like Disney+, Spotify, Minecraft and Zoom, which kids can request. That, along with much of the content, can be monitored via parental controls.</p>

<p>The tablet has a browser (again with restricted access). The company notes that YouTube access is on by default, since the service has become an important part of remote learning, though again, parents can restrict access. There’s no YouTube app, however, as Google hasn’t made one for Fire tablet &#8212; perhaps owing to ongoing friction between the companies.</p>
<p>The Fire 7 Kids Pro is $100 and the Fire HD 8 Kids Pro is $140. The devices are up for preorder today and are set to ship May 26.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arm today announced the launch of two new platforms, Arm Neoverse V1 and Neoverse N2, as well as a new mesh interconnect for them. As you can tell from the name, V1 is a completely new product and maybe the best example yet of Arm&#8217;s ambitions in the data center, high-performance computing and machine learning space. N2 is Arm&#8217;s next-generation general compute platform that is meant to span use cases from hyperscale clouds to SmartNICs and running edge workloads. It&#8217;s also the first design based on the company&#8217;s new Armv9 architecture.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, high-performance computing was dominated by a small number of players, but the Arm ecosystem has scored its fair share of wins here recently, with supercomputers in <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2020/11/11/south-korea-funds-first-supercomputing-cpu-designed-for-ai-hpc/">South Korea</a>, India and <a href="https://sipearl.com/">France</a> betting on it. The promise of V1 is that it will vastly outperform the older N1 platform, with a 2x gain in floating-point performance, for example, and a 4x gain in machine learning performance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144143" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/neoverse_roadmap.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144143" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144143" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/neoverse_roadmap.png" alt="" width="1024" height="557" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/neoverse_roadmap.png 1349w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/neoverse_roadmap.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/neoverse_roadmap.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/neoverse_roadmap.png?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/neoverse_roadmap.png?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/neoverse_roadmap.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144143" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arm</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The V1 is about how much performance can we bring &#8212; and that was the goal,&#8221; Chris Bergey, SVP and GM of <span class="il">Arm</span>’s Infrastructure Line of Business, told me. He also noted that the V1 is Arm&#8217;s widest architecture yet. He noted that while V1 wasn&#8217;t specifically built for the HPC market, it was definitely a target market. And while the current Neoverse V1 platform isn&#8217;t based on the new Armv9 architecture yet, the next generation will be.</p>
<p>N2, on the other hand, is all about getting the most performance per watt, Bergey stressed. &#8220;This is really about staying in that same performance-per-watt-type envelope that we have within N1 but bringing more performance,&#8221; he said. In Arm&#8217;s testing, NGINX saw a 1.3x performance increase versus the previous generation, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144153" style="width: 291px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Arm_Neoverse_V1_chip_image1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144153" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144153" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Arm_Neoverse_V1_chip_image1.png" alt="" width="281" height="186" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Arm_Neoverse_V1_chip_image1.png 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Arm_Neoverse_V1_chip_image1.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Arm_Neoverse_V1_chip_image1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 281px) 100vw, 281px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144153" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arm</p></div></p>
<p>In many ways, today&#8217;s release is also a chance for Arm to highlight its recent customer wins. AWS Graviton2 is obviously doing quite well, but Oracle is also betting on Ampere&#8217;s Arm-based Altra CPUs for its cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Arm is going to be everywhere &#8212; from edge to the cloud. We are seeing N1-based processors deliver consistent performance, scalability and security that customers want from Cloud infrastructure,&#8221; said Bev Crair, senior VP, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute. &#8220;Partnering with Ampere Computing and leading ISVs, Oracle is making Arm server-side development a first-class, easy and cost-effective solution.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alibaba Cloud and Tencent are both investing in Arm-based hardware for their cloud services as well, while Marvell will use the Neoverse V2 architecture for its OCTEON networking solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zengo.com">ZenGo</a>, a mobile app to manage your cryptocurrencies, has raised a $20 million Series A funding round led by Insight Partners. ZenGo is a non-custodial wallet, which means that the company doesn’t manage your crypto assets for you —&nbsp;you remain in control.</p>
<p>Other investors include Distributed Global and Austin Rief Ventures. Existing investors Benson Oak, Samsung Next, Elron, Collider Ventures, FJ Labs and others also participated in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>What makes ZenGo different from other wallet apps is that the company is trying to build something that is more secure than your average crypto wallet while remaining simple to use and understand. It competes with other non-custodial wallets, such as <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com">Coinbase Wallet</a> (not Coinbase.com), <a href="https://www.argent.xyz">Argent</a>, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In particular, ZenGo is based on multiparty computation (MPC). When you first create your wallet, ZenGo generates multiple secrets that are stored and encrypted in different ways. It means that the company can’t access your tokens directly <em>and</em> you can recover your wallet if you lose your phone.</p>
<p>Other crypto companies focused on infrastructure and enterprise clients have also opted for MPC as their security model. <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com">Fireblocks</a>, a company that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/crypto-infrastructure-provider-fireblocks-raises-133-million/">recently raised $133 million</a>, is one example.</p>
<p>But ZenGo is building a consumer app. In 2020, the company has processed over $100 million in crypto transactions from 100,000 users. ZenGo has reached the same milestone in the first three months of 2021 and added another 100,000 users.</p>
<p>You can browse DeFi projects through ZenGo and access savings pools. The startup takes a cut on these investments.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, ZenGo plans to expand with the same philosophy in mind. You can expect support for more chains and assets, more partnerships and options to buy cryptocurrencies and convert them to fiat money, etc.</p>
<p>The company recently announced plans to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/crypto-wallet-app-zengo-to-launch-debit-card/">a debit card</a>. This way, users will be able to convert their crypto assets and then spend them wherever Visa cards are accepted. In other words, ZenGo is building a crypto super app with a focus on security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup Wingcopter has launched a new autonomous delivery drone designed to remove a technical bottleneck hindering the growth of drone transport services.</p>
<p>The Wingcopter 198, which was revealed Tuesday, is capable of making three separate deliveries per flight, the company said. Wingcopter has couched this multi-stop capability as a critical feature that will allow it to grow a cost-efficient — and hopefully profitable — drone delivery as a service business.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2017, got its start manufacturing drones. It used the revenue to scale and now expand its business model to include drone-delivery-as-a-service. “That’s actually our next mission, to not just build drones, but to build networks,” CEO Tom Plümmer told TechCrunch. The company&#8217;s website is now promoting the delivery business, which aims to provide healthcare, e-commerce and grocery delivery among other services. It&#8217;s ultimate aim is to create “logistical highways in the sky,” according to a statement by Plümmer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The key to this delivery nirvana, the company claims, is its patented tilt-rotor propellant mechanism that combines the advantages of two drone types — the multicopter, which gives drones their smooth vertical take-off and landing capabilities and the ability to hover precisely in the air, with the fixed wing, which provides fast flight times over long distances.</p>
<p>The new model Wingcopter 198 has a top speed of 93 miles an hour and can carry payloads up to 13 pounds for a distance of about 47 miles from a single battery charge. It can travel up to 68 miles when carrying lighter cargo, the company said.</p>
<p>Plümmer explained that the tilt-rotors can also automatically respond to gusts of wind and other inclement weather conditions. Its architecture includes eight motors for redundancy and safety reasons.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144071" style="width: 3850px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2144071 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png" alt="" width="3840" height="2061" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=768,412 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=680,365 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=1536,824 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=2048,1099 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144071" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Wingcopter</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drones, which are equipped with sensors and software to avoid obstacles and drop parcels at designated sites, are all automated. This level of automation allows one human operator to monitor and control up to 10 of these new drones from a computer equipped with Wingcopter&#8217;s control station software anywhere in the world. Plümmer explained that running the drones is a simple as the operator pressing &#8216;start&#8217; on the software program from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Plümmer also touted the scalability of the tilt-rotor system, noting that it could be applied (theoretically) to a larger aircraft to carry cargo, or even human passengers.</p>
<p>“It’s just a cost factor,” Plümmer said, noting that the company already employs people who have the experience in aviation and aerial engineering required to one day take the tilt-rotor aircraft to scale. “However, we thought, let’s start with the smaller version &#8230; get these 1000s of [flight] hours, 1000s of kilometers, and take these learnings into every next generation of Wingcopter so they will constantly get bigger, first for cargo, later for mobility.”</p>
<p>Plümmer said they’ve drawn a hard line at working with any company or government institution that would use their drones for military or surveillance purposes.</p>
<p>“It’s mainly moral,” he said of the objection. “We believe it would be really not fitting to our vision. Our vision is to save lives and improve life by using drone technology and drone solutions.”</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the company is currently pursuing a type certification from the Federal Aviation Administration, which would allow it to operate commercial flights in the United States. If they receive this certification, they will be one of only a handful of competitors operating in the space. They&#8217;ve also set their sights on another funding round, fresh of the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/wingcopter-raises-22-million-to-expand-to-the-u-s-and-launch-a-next-generation-drone/">$22 million Series A round</a> in January. The company has around 120 employees but with an additional injection of capital in a Series B, it could hire people with expertise in AI, piloting and production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S.-based challenger bank <a href="https://current.com/">Current</a>, which has now grown to nearly 3 million users, announced this morning it has raised a $220 million round of Series D funding, led by new investor Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The funding swiftly follows Current&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/mobile-banking-app-current-raises-131m-series-c-tops-2-million-members/">$131 million Series C</a> at the end of last year, at which point the company had doubled its user base over just six months to over 2 million users.</p>
<p>As a result of the new roud, the fintech company has roughly tripled its valuation in five months&#8217; time to $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>Other participants in the round include returning investors Tiger Global Management, TQ Ventures (the fund managed by media executive Scooter Braun), Avenir, Sapphire Ventures, Foundation Capital, Wellington Management and EXPA. David George, who led the round with a16z, will become a Current board member.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Current began its life as a teen debit card controlled by parents, but later expanded to offer personal checking accounts powered by the same underlying banking technology. Like a range of modern-day &#8220;neobanks,&#8221; or digital banks, the Current app offers a baseline of standard features like free overdrafts, no minimum balance requirements, faster direct deposits, instant spending notifications, banking insights, free ATMs, check deposits using your phone’s camera and more. It also last year launched<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/mobile-bank-current-launches-a-points-rewards-program-for-debit-card-users/"> a points rewards program</a> in an effort to better differentiate its service from the growing number of competitors and became one of the first banks to transfer the early round of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vc-daily-fintechs-step-in-to-help-deliver-another-round-of-stimulus-checks-11615899257">stimulus payments</a> during the pandemic.</p>
<p>These days, Current is <a href="https://current.com/current-creator">partnering with creators</a>, like the recently <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/04/26/mrbeast-invests-current-banking-app-giveaway/">announced</a> MrBeast (aka Jimmy Donaldson), who said last week <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQHEJj68Jew&amp;t=375s">on his YouTube channel</a> that he will personally send $1 to every 100,000 people who sign up using his Creator code. MrBeast is also an investor.</p>
<p>Like other fintechs in its same space, Current has benefitted from the younger generation&#8217;s adoption of mobile banking apps instead of larger, traditional banks, who they feel don&#8217;t serve their interests. Its average <a href="https://www.alleywatch.com/2020/11/current-banking-challenger-digital-bank-stuart-sopp/">customer age</a> is 27, for example. Digital banks can keep costs down by not having to pay for the overhead of brick-and-mortar locations, allowing them to roll out benefits like reduced or zero account fees and other consumer-friendly protections.</p>
<p>Current today continues to offer teen banking, in a challenge to mobile banking app Step, which has also leveraged social media influencers to get the word out with a younger demographic. But Step today is appealing to the 13 to 18-year old crowd directly, offering banking services and a secured card. Current, meanwhile, targets its service to the <a href="https://support.current.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003712113-How-do-I-link-my-teen-to-my-account-">parents</a>.</p>
<p>Its teen account costs $36 per year, while personal checking is available both as a free and premium ($4.99/mo) service. The company <a href="https://www.alleywatch.com/2020/11/current-banking-challenger-digital-bank-stuart-sopp/">in the past has said</a> its primary focus is the over 130 million Americans who live paycheck to paycheck. This continues to be its main drive today, though the mission may attract a broader slice of the American population over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still focused on onboarding people to the financial system, making sure that everyone has access to everything, and then democratizing &#8212; or going out and getting that value &#8212; in this new world that&#8217;s being rewritten and bringing it back to as many people as possible,&#8221; says Current CEO and founder Stuart Sopp. &#8220;Now, in that increase of scope and time. I think we&#8217;re going to pick up more and more people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Current says the new funds will be used to grow the company and its member base as it expands it range of banking products. One key area of new investment will be cryptocurrency, it says, which will involve a partnership and an educational component to help Current&#8217;s users better understand the crypto market.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Sopp&#8217;s background includes crypto, in addition to just Wall St. trading. In fact, an early version of Current designed by Sopp and CTO Trevor Marshall involved crypto.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little-known fact is that Current started with Bitcoin wallet addresses and Ripple gateways,&#8221; he says. But the team realized the technology was a little too nascent at the time, and moved to mobile banking. &#8220;We have this background, and this knowledge of how it all works. Now do we need to build it ourselves? No, I don&#8217;t think we need to build it all ourselves. There&#8217;s lots of good companies out there,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Crypto fits into Current&#8217;s vision of democratizing access to financial systems to those in the U.S. who are today underserved by traditional banking and investing products and services.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a ton of value being created [in crypto] and we want to make sure we have this nexus of providing safe, and trustworthy financial services in that world, as well as what we already exist in,&#8221; notes Sopp. &#8220;And then, lending, credit cards,&#8221; he adds, noting how important these moves are &#8220;done safely, in a respectful way for our demographic &#8212; because traditionally most of our members have a FICO score of 650.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, Current will use the new funds for hiring across all roles, including marketing, product, engineering, fiance, customer success, fraud and risk, and, of course, crypto. The company today has 100 employees, and plans to grow to around 200 or 300 in the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Current&#8217;s fundraise remarkably falls on the same day that competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/">Step</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/">Greenlight</a>, both who focus on families, also raised new rounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new generation of customers doesn&#8217;t want to bank in physical branches,&#8221; said a16z&#8217;s David George, in a statement. &#8220;We believe there will be a shift in the next 10 years to mobile and consumer-focused banking services powered by innovation in technology, and with Current&#8217;s exceptional growth over the past year, they&#8217;ve clearly demonstrated they&#8217;re at the forefront of this trend. Their product is among the best in the market, and they have proven an ability to reach customers who previously were unserved or underserved by traditional banks,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a very tough year for <a href="https://www.placer.ai/">Placer.ai</a>’s core customer segments of retail and commercial real estate, to put it mildly. But the foot traffic and location analytics startup saw growth in new categories, including consumer packaged goods (CPG) and hedge funds that use its tech to perform due diligence. The Los Altos, California-based company announced today that has raised a $50 million Series B led by Josh Buckley, the chief executive officer of Product Hunt. Participants included Fifth Wall, Rahul Vohra and returning investors JBV Capital and Aleph VC.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used on research and development and expanding Placer.ai’s sales and marketing teams. Its last funding announcement was in January 2020 for a $12 million Series A.</p>

<p>Placer.ai collects geolocation and proximity data from devices that are enabled to share that information by their users, and creates anonymized and aggregated consumer profiles. Since its launch, the company’s key customers have been offline retail businesses, shopping centers, hotels and other brick-and-mortar businesses that use it to analyze foot traffic, the success of marketing campaigns and location performance. Placer.ai’s co-founder and chief executive officer Noam Ben-Zvi said he expected the COVID-19 pandemic to be challenging as people stayed away from stores and purchased online instead.</p>
<p>But adoption of Placer.ai’s tech increased among several new segments, including CPG and hedge funds, and it is continuing to expand in retail and commercial real estate as companies plan ahead.</p>
<p>The company’s CPG clients use its tools for market analysis, refining category management or promotion strategies and tracking product performance. Ben-Zvi expects its CPG customer base to continue growing as more brands, like direct-to-consumer labels, open their own stores.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;4 views on the future of retail and the shopping experience&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/29/4-views-on-the-future-of-retail-the-check-out-process-and-lines/embed/#?secret=mDSG9FXn35" data-secret="mDSG9FXn35" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Placer.ai’s hedge fund clients use it to research potential investments. “Because data is in near real-time, reliable and very granular, it allows investors to quickly identify signals that speak to the true offline health of any brand. But there is also a qualitative data element that allows strategic initiatives to be thoroughly analyzed,” Ben-Zvi said in an email.</p>
<p>“For example, we looked at CVS Health Hubs when they were in their pilot stage in a handful of locations. When the company announced that they would be rolling this out to over a thousand branches, investors had a strong sense of the potential,” he added. “The ability of the data to fuel both quantitative and qualitative analysis at a very high level is a powerful combination.”</p>
<p>For retail and commercial real estate users, “the situation ahead is going to be turbulent, and data is going to play a fundamental role in confidently navigating the changing environment and driving effective decision making,” said Ben-Zvi. Commercial real estate owners need to make sure the mix of tenants in their properties are compelling enough to draw in shoppers, and understand how they are faring against competitors. Some retailers are focused on expansion, while others are testing new concepts and formats.</p>
<p>In a press statement about his investment, Buckley said, “Placer allows businesses that operate offline to make data-driven decisions, fundamentally improving the way they operate. This is the same type of tooling that online businesses have used to grow, moving from hunches to definitive answers. I’m excited to be partnering with the company’s next phase of growth and product development.”</p>
