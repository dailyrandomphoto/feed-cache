										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ViacomCBS announced a new <a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=showtimebundle&amp;ftag=PPM-00-10ahd6f">streaming bundle</a> today for U.S. subscribers, offering access to both Paramount+ and Showtime. If you subscribe to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/paramount-will-launch-a-4-99-monthly-ad-supported-subscription/">ad-supported Paramount+ Essential</a> plan, the bundle will cost $9.99 per month. But if you don&#8217;t want to watch ads when you&#8217;re laser-focused on the &#8220;iCarly&#8221; reboot (yes, that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-06-17/new-icarly-reboot-paramount-plus-miranda-cosgrove-explained">exists</a>), you can pay $12.99 per month to bundle Showtime with Paramount+ Premium. The Premium plan also includes support for 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, mobile downloads, and livestreams of local CBS affiliates in 200 U.S. markets.</p>
<p>Each bundle will cost about 38% less than if you were to subscribe to Paramount+ and Showtime separately. Showtime alone costs $10.99 per month, so the bundle could motivate Showtime subscribers to check out the newer Paramount+, which includes shows like &#8220;RuPaul&#8217;s Drag Race,&#8221; which <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/rupaul-emmy-record-most-wins-black-performer-1235015916/">broke records</a> at the Emmy&#8217;s this week, &#8220;Star Trek: The Original Series&#8221; and &#8220;The Good Fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parent company ViacomCBS added 6.5 million global streaming subscribers across its various services in Q2, bringing the conglomerate to over <a href="https://ir.viacomcbs.com/news-releases/news-release-details/viacomcbs-reports-q2-2021-earnings-results">42 million</a> subscribers total. The company said that Paramount+ helped fuel its 82% year-over-year growth in streaming revenue. The service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/paramount-the-successor-to-cbs-all-access-launches-march-4-in-the-u-s-canada-and-latin-america/">rebranded</a> from CBS All Access in March to better reflect the content available after the Viacom-CBS merger in 2019.</p>
<p>In August 2020, Apple TV+ launched a similar bundle, offering CBS All Access Ad-Free and Showtime for just $9.99 a month on top of Apple TV+&#8217;s $4.99 monthly fee. After the rebrand to Paramount+, existing Apple TV+ subscribers were allowed to keep their plan, but a payment processing issue in July of this year <a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/paramount-plus-showtime-9-99-bundle-on-apple-tv-plus-isnt-going-away-just-a-technical-glitch-for-subscribers">led customers to worry</a> that the deal had expired. Meanwhile, Paramount+ subscribers were previously able to subscribe to Showtime at a $3 discount. But today&#8217;s announcement offers an even better deal.</p>
<p>The Paramount+ and Showtime websites say that this offer is only available for a limited time. It&#8217;s unclear whether those who subscribe now will have access to this discounted pricing even after the deal expires.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The consequences are mounting for gaming giant Activision Blizzard after the company became the subject of a landmark state investigation into discriminatory workplace practices and sexual harassment this summer.</p>
<p>Now, Activision Blizzard confirms that it is the subject of a federal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">ramping up enforcement efforts against tech companies</a> in recent months.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-is-investigating-activision-blizzard-over-workplace-practices-disclosures-11632165080">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported Monday that the SEC has subpoenaed Activision Blizzard and a number of the company&#8217;s key executives, including CEO Bobby Kotick. Activision Blizzard confirmed the SEC investigation Tuesday in a <a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-provides-update-workplace-initiatives">statement to investors,</a> noting that it &#8220;continues to productively engage with regulators&#8221; including the SEC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.</p>
<p>The SEC requested documents from the company including &#8220;minutes from Activision board meetings since 2019, personnel files of six former employees and separation agreements the company has reached this year with staffers&#8221; according to the WSJ. The paper also reported that the agency is seeking any records between Kotick and other executives discussing sexual harassment and discrimination allegations at the company.</p>
<p>The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/07/22/california-activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexism/">sued Activision Blizzard in July</a> over allegations that it created a hostile &#8220;frat house&#8221; environment in which gender-based harassment and discrimination were routine.</p>
<p>Following an inflammatory response from the company&#8217;s leaders, who dismissed the lawsuit as the actions of &#8220;unaccountable state bureaucrats,&#8221; a group of employees <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/blizzard-walkout-activision-lawsuit/">staged a high profile walkout</a>. The protest attracted solidarity from many corners of the gaming world and drew more attention to the workplace environment that many Blizzard workers allegedly suffered in for years.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard publishes some of the biggest titles in gaming, including the Call of Duty franchise, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Starcraft. The flurry of regulatory interest in allegations of a toxic, hostile work environment at the company could have far-reaching implications for workplace culture not just at Activision Blizzard, but for the gaming industry at large.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After the state lawsuit became public, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack">former President of Blizzard Entertainment, J. Allen Brack</a> left the company, followed by its global HR head <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22608340/blizzard-hr-sexual-harassment-lawsuit">Jesse Meschuk</a>. On Tuesday, Blizzard Entertainment Chief Legal Officer Claire Hart became the latest high profile employee to announce their departure, signaling that she wouldn&#8217;t be sticking around to weather the regulatory storm.</p>
<p>&#8220;The past three years have been full of unexpected twists and turns, but I feel honored to have worked with and met so many great people at Blizzard and across the Activision Blizzard businesses,&#8221; Hart <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/claireelisehart_after-more-than-three-years-at-blizzard-entertainment-activity-6845779647314169856-Nnrf/?src=aff-lilpar&amp;veh=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.10078_plc.Skimbit%20Ltd._pcrid.449670_learning&amp;trk=aff_src.aff-lilpar_c.partners_pkw.10078_plc.Skimbit%20Ltd._pcrid.449670_learning&amp;clickid=wU206jxCOxyIWOKxvCW%3ANVnAUkBV08TrQUDMzc0&amp;irgwc=1">wrote on Linkedin</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Medical, a telemedicine company focused on women’s healthcare, closed a $24 million Series B round on Tuesday. It’s another company situated squarely in the crosshairs of a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/telemedicine-startups-are-positioning-themselves-for-a-post-pandemic-world/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pandemic-fueled boom in telemedicine investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though Alpha Medical’s approach has one notable difference: you won’t be logging on to any Zoom calls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Medical was founded in 2017. Since then, the company has created a network of 30 staffed primary care providers (PCPs in industry shorthand), who treat female patients online, without phone or video calls. For $120 yearly fee (not covered by insurance) you can make an account, supply your medical history and patient intake forms, and are assigned a PCP who you’ll communicate via an online platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of telehealth is sometimes called “store and forward” – patient health records can be viewed by a physician on an online platform, rather than during a real-time visit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We give you a primary care physician who is fluent [in women’s health],” Lau tells TechCrunch. “We do all of this online, asynchronously.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are exceptions to this; you might be referred to a lab for testing, or to another primary care provider if a condition can’t be managed online. “But when you look at the grand scheme of things we think about 80% of stuff can be done online. The remaining 20% or so needs to be in person,” Lau says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups focusing on women’s health are starting to attract more attention and investment. Tia, another women’s telehealth company with a brick-and-mortar clinic component just closed a $100 million series B round. Maven Clinic, a female-founded company focusing on women’s and family health, closed a $110 Series D round in August, and achieved </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/mavens-comprehensive-approach-to-womens-health-earns-it-unicorn-status/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unicorn status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha’s new funding may not be a mega-round, but it fits within the trend. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It brings the company’s total funding to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/28/startups-weekly-alpha-medical-wants-to-rebuild-womens-healthcare/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$35 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, counting a Series A round that gleaned about $11 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It includes participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">SpringRock Ventures, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margo Georgiadis, Outcomes Collective Growth Capital, FMZ Ventures, Samsung Next, Chamaeleon, AV8 Ventures, and GSR Ventures.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous round of funding helped the company accelerate its coverage: the company grew from offering services in about 10 states to 46, including D.C., Lau estimates. It also helped the company up the number of conditions its providers can manage, from about three to 60.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new round will allow the company to train and locate providers who can manage even more conditions (the most recent addition was polycystic ovarian syndrome). It will also allow the company to expand from direct to consumer services to B2B services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve started talking to health plans and employers to bridge the gap,” says Lau. “We&#8217;re in lots of conversations with health plans, we have some very small employer contracts that are inbound – actually that&#8217;s how we started thinking about it in the first place.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lau is one of Alpha Medical’s two co-founders, and her expertise is primarily in the data world. She&#8217;s a </span><a href="https://cee.stanford.edu/person/gloria-lau"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consulting faculty member</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Stanford Engineering and a former Vice President of Data at Timeful, which was </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/04/google-acquires-timeful-to-bring-smart-scheduling-to-google-apps/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired by Google in 2015</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The clinical expertise informing Alpha medical comes from Lau’s chief medical director Mary Jacobson, an obstetrician and gynecologist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Medical is hoping to fill a growing gap in primary care service. And there’s evidence that a lack of primary care is a pressing problem. The Health Resources and Services Administration has designated about </span><a href="https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/shortage-areas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3,434 medically underserved areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – meaning these areas are experiencing a shortage of primary care providers. A total of 14 million people </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">live in those medically underserved areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The existence of these “primary care deserts” has long been a selling point for DTC telehealth companies. Companies like Ro, now </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/online-pharmacy-ro-is-said-to-raise-funds-at-5-billion-value-kml4u3wu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">valued at $5 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  just boasted of reaching patients in 98 percent of such deserts, by its own calculations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alpha Medical user is also a woman who lives somewhere without a plethora of PCPs. But that’s just one piece of the puzzle. Alpha’s target demographic also includes people with high deductible health plans, or people with no insurance at all, says Lau. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even among people with insurance in places </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">with </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">primary care available, there’s some evidence that primary care visits are declining. </span><a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-1834"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study published in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Annals of Internal Medicine </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">analyzed 142 million primary care visits among people who had insurance between 2008 and 2016. The study found that primary care visits had declined 24.2 percent, while visit rates to specialists remained stable. The decline was greatest among young adults. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study outlined a few factors driving the decline. Higher costs (the average out of pocket cost rose from $29 to $39 over that time period), high deductibles, lack of access to care, and the fact that people might be visiting urgent care clinics or specialists instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Medical’s services aren’t currently covered by insurance – but Lau offers that the $120 per year price for all visits is sufficiently affordable to entice people who already pay for high deductible health plans or those who are uninsured. There’s also an a la carte feature of the service, where a visit costs anywhere from </span><a href="https://www.helloalpha.com/?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=net-g_dev-c_mat-e_cam-2077035485_adg-73994924822_cre-435005964852_kwd-299225555501_ext-_gcl-CjwKCAjwhaaKBhBcEiwA8acsHEky2_Judu7wa9mW-hTet9aJSUleAny4kqni-uftki3hsCIqxxRtTxoC0WEQAvD_BwE&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwhaaKBhBcEiwA8acsHEky2_Judu7wa9mW-hTet9aJSUleAny4kqni-uftki3hsCIqxxRtTxoC0WEQAvD_BwE"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$15-$30</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average income for an Alpha medical user, Lau says about $40,000 per year. That’s </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2020/demo/p60-270/figure4.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">somewhat aligned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the median income for women working full time, per the 2020 census: about $47,300 per year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason why we can be so affordable is because it&#8217;s asynchronous,” says Lau. &#8220;You&#8217;re not paying for the time while the doctor is waiting for you to think about your symptoms or your family history. We only notify the clinician when all the information is collected in the system, [and] integrated in the EMR [electronic medical record].&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of asynchronous healthcare might feel a bit strange at first glance. One of the biggest advantages of having a primary care doctor is having a personal relationship with a healthcare provider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if there was ever a time to fuse telehealth and women’s healthcare, now might be the time. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the midst of TechCrunch Disrupt, hundreds of founders will video call into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley</a>, eager to share what makes their company stand out. But 24-year-old Clare Carroll&#8217;s video background speaks for itself as she calls in from her NYC apartment, which doubles as a stock room for hundreds of books she sells online.</p>
<p>Just months ago, the recent Marquette University graduate left her job in consulting at IBM to found <a href="https://foliobookshop.com/">Folio</a>, an online bookshop that helps Gen Z and millennial readers discover (and then purchase) their next favorite books.</p>
<p>Carroll is a company of one, doing everything from web design, order packaging, social media marketing, and accounting on her own. But as she rediscovered her love of reading in quarantine, Carroll realized that her peers didn&#8217;t know where to turn for book recommendations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodreads has benefits, but the UI hasn&#8217;t been updated since Amazon bought it,&#8221; Carroll says &#8212; and, at least judging by the image in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/amazon-acquires-social-reading-site-goodreads/">TechCrunch&#8217;s article on the acquisition</a> from eight years ago, she&#8217;s not wrong. &#8220;The problem of helping people rediscover their love of books really resonated with me. I couldn&#8217;t find something I wanted online, and I couldn&#8217;t believe it didn&#8217;t exist: a cool online bookstore. I was really reflecting on what I want to get out of my career, so I was like, okay, screw it, I guess I&#8217;ll make it.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203352" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203352" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203352" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Quincie_06-HR.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="487" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Quincie_06-HR.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Quincie_06-HR.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Quincie_06-HR.jpeg?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Quincie_06-HR.jpeg?resize=768,550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Quincie_06-HR.jpeg?resize=680,487 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Quincie_06-HR.jpeg?resize=1536,1100 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Quincie_06-HR.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203352" class="wp-caption-text">Folio (Photo by Christina Stoever)</p></div></p>
<p>Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/with-sales-momentum-bookshop-org-looks-to-future-in-its-fight-with-amazon/">Bookshop.org</a> and <a href="https://libro.fm/">Libro.fm</a> have proven that bookworms want an alternative to buying books on Amazon, and <a href="https://www.thestorygraph.com/">The Storygraph</a> is trying to build the next Goodreads.</p>
<p>But Folio lies somewhere in the middle, trying to solve discovery while helping support publishers and independent booksellers at the same time. Right now, Folio has about 200 hand-picked books in stock, including buzzworthy hits like &#8220;Detransition, Baby&#8221; by Torrey Peters, &#8220;Song of Achilles&#8221; by Madeline Miller, and &#8220;Crying in H-Mart&#8221; by Michelle Zauner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t try to have every book in stock. We never will,&#8221; said Carroll. &#8220;Even if a book is targeted toward my demographic of 18-to-30-year-olds, skewing female, we still scan and pre-select for quality. We will probably never have more than 1,000 different books.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of Folio&#8217;s stock comes directly from publishers, which means that a book will cost, on average, about $18 to $20. &#8220;We&#8217;re not falling into the Amazon trap of like, let&#8217;s try to bring the price down as low as possible. I believe in paying artists for their work, and devaluing books is doing no one any favors,&#8221; Carroll says. But other titles are purchased as overstock &#8212; that means that if a brick-and-mortar store doesn&#8217;t sell all the copies they purchase, the books can be returned to a wholesaler, which then sells at a discount to businesses like Folio.</p>
<p>Folio has only been online since August &#8212; Carroll started the company in May this year &#8212; but through influencer collaborations, an <a href="https://foliobookshop.com/pages/ambassador">affiliate program</a>, a <a href="https://foliobookshop.com/pages/book-club">book club</a>, and its addictive <a href="https://foliobookshop.com/pages/quiz">book suggestion quiz</a>, Carroll says the company has developed an enthusiastic consumer base. Though she declined to share sales numbers just yet, she said that about 30% of customers post about their purchase on social media, and the company has many repeat customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really see ourselves as the Sephora of books,&#8221; Carroll says. &#8220;You go in, you browse, and there are other options, but you&#8217;re not completely overwhelmed. Whatever you get there, someone else has already said, &#8216;Yes, this is worthwhile.'&#8221;</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The Oversight Board is <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/3056753157930994-to-treat-users-fairly-facebook-must-commit-to-transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="13" data-v9y="1"><ins>pushing</ins></a> Facebook to provide more information on its controversial “cross-check” system, following a report that the company has allowed celebrities, politicians and other public figures to break its rules.</p>
<p>“In light of recent developments, we are looking into the degree to which Facebook has been fully forthcoming in its responses in relation to cross-check, including the practice of whitelisting,” the board said in a statement. “We expect to receive a briefing from Facebook in the coming days and will be reporting what we hear from this as part of our first release of quarterly transparency reports which we will publish in October.”</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>The statement comes one week after <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1"><ins>internal memos</ins></a> that raised significant issues with the “cross check” system. Facebook has said the rules are meant to provide an extra lawyer of scrutiny to potential rule-breaking posts from high-profile accounts. But according to <em>The WSJ</em>, these extra checks are often very delayed or don’t happen at all, effectively allowing famous people to break the platform’s rules without consequences. The report also stated that Facebook had ‘misled’ the Oversight Board when it said it was “not feasible” to share more information about cross check, and that the system only impacted a “small number” of accounts.</p>
<p>The cross check system was also one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><ins>central issues</ins></a> in the decision about Donald Trump’s suspension from Facebook. “In our decision concerning former US President Donald Trump’s accounts, we warned that a lack of clear public information on cross-check and Facebook’s ‘newsworthiness exception’ could contribute to perceptions that Facebook is unduly influenced by political and commercial considerations,” the board writes. The group also notes that Facebook didn’t provide specifics data it had asked for about how cross check works.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how much more information Facebook plans to share with the Oversight Board. The company declined to comment on the board’s statement. But the Oversight Board says it will publish its first transparency report next month, which will provide an update on cross check, as well as its assessment of how Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-trump-influence-203741183.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"><ins>is following</ins></a> its recommendations.</p>

Researchers hope that analysis of data such as mobility, sleep patterns and how people type could spot behaviors associated with those conditions, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-wants-iphones-to-help-detect-depression-cognitive-decline-sources-say-11632216601?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>.</p>
<p>Other measurements could include facial expression analysis and heart and respiration rates. All of the processing would take place on the device, with no data sent to Apple servers.</p>
<p>The company is working on research projects that could lead to the development of these features. The University of California, Los Angeles, is studying stress, anxiety and depression, with Apple Watch and iPhone data for 3,000 volunteers being tracked in a study that starts this year. A pilot phase that began in 2020 recorded data from 150 participants.</p>
<p>Researchers will compare data captured from iPhone and Watch sensors with questionnaires participants fill out about how they feel, according to the report. They&#8217;re also said to be measuring the level of the stress hormone cortisol in participants&#8217; hair follicles. Apple and UCLA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ucla-depression-study-225118236.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="27" data-v9y="1"><ins>announced the three-year study</ins></a> in August 2020.</p>
<p>Another research project is underway that may factor into this Apple project. The company and pharmaceutical firm Biogen <a href="https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biogen-launch-pioneering-study-develop-digital-biomarkers" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="28" data-v9y="1">said</a> in January they&#8217;re working on a two-year study to monitor cognitive function and perhaps spot mild cognitive impairment, which has the potential to develop into Alzheimer’s. The plan is to track around 20,000 participants, around half of whom have high risk of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>If data from the studies lines up with symptoms of depression or anxiety, Apple could use it to create a feature that warns users if it sees signs of a mental health condition. The iPhone could prompt users to seek care, which could be important as early detection can improve quality of life in the long run.</p>
<p>Apple and its partners are in the early stages of this work, so it&#8217;ll likely be a few years at least before the company adds mental health monitoring features to the iPhone. There&#8217;s no guarantee the research will lead to such features at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some previous studies have indicated people with certain conditions use devices differently than other folks. It&#8217;s not yet clear whether developers can build algorithms that can detect mental health conditions reliably and accurately.</p>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s no smoke without fire. Health has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1"><ins>a growing focus</ins></a> for Apple over the past few years, so there&#8217;s a chance features based on this research will eventually emerge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://www.happaning.com/">Happaning</a> wants to make video a more immersive experience by allowing people to watch the same event from multiple perspectives. Or, as co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ando-eni/">Andrew Eniwumide</a> likes to say, it&#8217;s &#8220;Google Street View, but with video.&#8221; The company believes its unique technology offering these multi-vantage point videos could ultimately do more than just introduce a new user experience for video &#8212; it could solve other issues with misinformation or deep fakes, for example, as there would be other, verified perspectives of the same scene that could be used to fact check any attempts at misleading others through video edits.</p>
<p>Some of its loftier goals in this area are further down the line, however.</p>
<p>Launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 as the &#8220;wildcard&#8221; in the Startup Battlefield, Happaning&#8217;s early beta version will first introduce its concept of multi-vintage videos, or what it&#8217;s trademarked as <a href="https://www.viividtech.com/">&#8220;ViiVid&#8221; technology</a>. This is a system where users create video content using its mobile app which is then combined alongside videos filmed at that same location at the same time.</p>
<p>While the system is not using blockchain technology to verify the videos in any way, there are some similarities with that concept. Happaning borrows from the blockchain&#8217;s idea of a decentralized network where many sources are contributing to something like a master ledger. But in Happaning, no single node has all the same information as another &#8212; that is, one person&#8217;s video is unlike anyone else&#8217;s. Together, however, they display a fuller truth about what took place at a given place and time.</p>
<p>The company has<a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2585183"> patented</a> some <a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-find-publication-getPDF.pdf?PatentNo=GB2585183&amp;DocType=A&amp;JournalNumber=6868">concepts</a> related to its technologies involving synchronizing multiple video streams and the user experience of swiping through different video perspectives, locally in the U.K., where the team is based, and with the <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2020249948&amp;tab=PCTDOCUMENTS&amp;_cid=P10-KLFZ85-56958-1">World Intellectual Property Organization</a>.</p>
<p>The initial use cases for such technology would be recording real-world events like weddings, concerts, sports events, protests or marches, or any others where a larger crowd of people would attend. Once recorded in Happaning, you can then swipe from one video to the next to see the same event from other angles and perspectives by tapping on markers inside the video. Imagine, for example, being able to swipe from a video filmed in the back of the concert looking down on the stage to a video in the front row.</p>
<p>Eniwumide says he came up with the idea for Happaning to solve the issues around how video is being abused to mislead people. He notes that the issue is widespread across social media, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-study-misinformation-six-times-more-engaged-with-than-news-2021-9">pointing to a report</a> that indicates Facebook posts from misinformation sources were getting 6 times more engagement than those from reputable news sites.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As time has moved on, storytelling media has become more and more sophisticated to the point where now we&#8217;ve got 360 videos. But we&#8217;re also seeing with videos, is the fact that they&#8217;re subject to abuse, they&#8217;re subject to careless editing, they&#8217;re subject to bias, and even deep fakes,&#8221; Eniwumide says. He imagined that an app that could verify video content hadn&#8217;t been altered and was really taking place where it claimed to be, could be useful.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to think of it like Google Street View, but with video,&#8221; Eniwumide continues. &#8220;So you could be recording a video and somebody else is recording in the local area, and we synchronize those video feeds by time, location, and audio and visual cues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then someone watching could swipe in the direction they want to move in, similar to how Google Street View lets you move in different directions to see things from other angles and vantage points.</p>
<p>At launch, the focus is on live-streamed videos, but further down the road, the startup wants to develop its IP into more of a technology standard and offer ways for the videos to be exported and published elsewhere. The debut version of Happaning is very much an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a> and technology demo &#8212; the overall user interface and experience doesn&#8217;t look or feel fully developed at this point. But the app is free to use, with longer-term plans for subscription tiers, presuming it gains traction.</p>
<p>Eniwumide&#8217;s background includes over 12 years of experience as both a software developer and principal consultant at U.K. engineering firms including Detica and BAE Systems. He&#8217;s joined by CFO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leslie-sagay-0408753a/">Leslie Sagay</a>, CMO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/misssteele/">Joanna Steele</a>, CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-agbabiaka/">Colin Agbabiaka</a>, and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aj-adesanya-miet-citp-cist-incose-vcp-b027604/"> AJ Adesanya</a>, who works on infrastructure. Most of the team, however, is not full-time with the startup at this point.</p>
<p>Happaning has raised a total of £219,500 in pre-seed funding at a £3 million pre-money valuation, and is aiming to raise a £500,000 seed at a £4.5 million pre-money valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://tatum.io">Tatum</a>, a blockchain infrastructure startup that wants to make it much easier to develop your own blockchain-based product. The company operates a platform-as-a-service product so that you don’t have to manage your own nodes and learn how to interact with each client. Tatum is participating in TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield">Startup Battlefield</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt</a>.</p>
<p>While blockchain development was quite easy at first, it quickly became much more complicated as new blockchains emerged. There are now dozens of different blockchains. Some examples of popular blockchains are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stellar, Litecoin, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to interact with a blockchain directly, you have to run a client on a server. This is the easy part, as it basically comes down to spinning up a Linux server, installing a package and running this client. Once you have a node up and running, you can query the blockchain, initiate a transaction and run dapps — decentralized applications based on smart contracts.</p>
<p>What if you want to build a product that supports multiple blockchains and multiple cryptoassets? You have to start from scratch again and learn how the client works. Each client has different commands and returns different results.</p>
<p>Some companies have been working on ways to make this easier. For instance, cloud hosting services, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, let you run a managed node so that you don’t have to manage the cloud server that runs the client. But they don’t support a ton of blockchains and you still have to become a blockchain expert.</p>
<p>Other companies go one step further. They run a node for you and let you interact with the node using API calls. Interacting with the blockchain feels like using the REST API of your favorite SaaS product. For instance, <a href="https://www.alchemy.com">Alchemy</a> or <a href="https://infura.io">Infura</a> makes it easier to get started with Ethereum development.</p>
<p>Tatum’s differentiating factor is that it isn’t limited to Ethereum. You can use the exact same API calls to interact with multiple blockchains. When you know how to send assets from one wallet to another using Tatum, you know how to do it across 20 different blockchains.</p>
<p>“Blockchain is like the internet in 1997. We’re trying to bring the developer experience that developers have today to the blockchain space,” Tatum co-founder and CEO Jiri Kobelka told me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With Tatum, developers can basically code once and deploy everywhere. For instance, if there’s a new blockchain that seems more effective for your smart contracts and you want to build the next version of your decentralized app on this new blockchain, you can reuse parts of your code base.</p>
<p>Tatum doesn’t want to make a bet on a specific blockchain; the startup considers itself as blockchain-agnostic. Developers can build crypto wallets, exchanges, NFT marketplaces, NFT in-game assets, decentralized identity products and more. There are 10,000 developers using Tatum right now, and the startup can see that more and more people are interested in NFT-related projects, as they represent 60% to 70% of Tatum’s usage right now.</p>
<p>Kobelka has a background in banking infrastructure. “I’ve spent over 15 years in banking as a technical core banking expert,” he told me. That’s why the team has developed a built-in compliance engine. This way, you can accept customers in different countries and comply with local regulations depending on the location of your customers.</p>
<p>Overall, Tatum opens up blockchain development to a new set of developers who are more familiar with web development and integrations with third-party services that offer API endpoints. And given the current interest in blockchain development, Tatum could become a popular development platform for the next generation of blockchain products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of working in marketing for a number of financial services companies, Solape Akinpelu came to a conclusion: T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here was an “alarmingly low adoption” by women for financial services in her home country of Nigeria and all of Africa as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I could see women living the reality around me,” Akinpelu recalls. “These women could not make sound financial decisions. Some of these women that do not even know that they could do better with their money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She found that the problem is particularly acute for women living in rural areas, especially those working on farms.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201183" style="width: 254px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201183" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2201183 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24.jpg" alt="Nigerian fintech Hervest wants to bring financial inclusion to more African women. Founder Solape Akinpelu" width="244" height="528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24.jpg 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/24.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201183" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hervest</p></div></p>
<p>So in August 2020, she teamed up with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yomi Ogunleye</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to found Lagos, Nigeria-based </span><a href="http://www.hervest.ng"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hervest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that describes itself as “an inclusive fintech company” serving underserved and excluded women in Africa through a gender lens. The company presented today at the Startup Battlefield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadly speaking, Hervest aims to bridge the $42 billion gender finance gap for urban and last-mile women in the country with an emphasis on women in agriculture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup, she said, provides familiar access to savings, fund transfers, impact investment, financial insights and tools to underserved women while offering blended finance to smallholder female farmers in underserved African communities. Put simply, it offers a way to invest in female farmers while seeing a return on that investment, and giving the farmers the financial literacy, education and opportunities they might not have otherwise had access to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to address the gender gap in Africa by giving access to savings, impact investment and credit to women, regardless of who they are and where they live,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, just over one year after Akinpelu started the company, over 4,000 women are on the Hervest platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Hervest raised a friends and family funding round of $100,000. The company plans to use the capital to add to its nine-person team, strengthen its digital infrastructure and accelerate marketing efforts. It started operations as a distributed company and still mostly operates as one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before becoming CEO at Hervest, Akinpelu’s last role was head of marketing for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">capital market conglomerate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mersitem, and prior to that, she worked in marketing for various financial brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experiences gave her insight into the need to provide more access to financial services for women. And the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic crisis, Akinpelu believes, have only emphasized the vulnerability of low-income women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This makes financial inclusion ever more critical as a means for women to recover from the global crisis and build resilience in the long term,” she told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While starting with Nigeria, where Akinpelu says is home to over 57 million working women, Hervest has plans to roll out its platform into other West and East African countries in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:15107,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16750848},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Open Sans&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}"> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614a2cd637969837d3103d4f" post-id="2206068"></div> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">roblem we’re solving is an African finance gender gap, not just Nigerian,” Akinpelu said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get the word out, Hervest has relied on referrals and partnerships with co-operatives and social media. The company has a live app on iOS and Android and recently launched a desktop application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to its website, Hervest says that its cooperative members “can earn as high as 25% annualized returns while strengthening the financial capacity of female farmers” through access to capital, trainings and markets. What this means, Akinpelu said,</span> women with disposable income pool funds together as credit (impact investment) for small holder women farmers  as a cooperative.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, women also get to create automatic savings plan towards their personal goals. Picture an ‘inclusive neobank for women,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;To assure our stakeholders, our funds are held in trust by a trustee firm, FBNQuest Trustees Limited. This is an added layer of accountability and transparency of our funds management.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By investing in these women, Hervest aims to provide growth opportunities towards specific crops, grain banking, livesto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ck and provision of digitized e-extension services to female small-scale farmers in rural areas.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.luos.io/">Luos</a>, a participant in the TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield competition this week, wants to make it easy for embedded hardware developers to connect to any hardware component, such as a motor or sensor, then build a reusable configuration profile to give them the same type of flexibility that software engineers have with microservices.</p>
<p>Luos CEO and co-founder Nicolas Rabault says that as a former embedded hardware engineer, he wanted to build a solution that would simplify the way these engineers have historically worked. &#8220;The idea of Luos is to allow embedded system developers to create things that could be easily reusable by others, and a way to just compose with existing [profiles], instead of remaking everything every time,&#8221; Rabault told me.</p>
<p>He said the inspiration for this approach came from the world of microservices. &#8220;We based our technology on microservices in the web world because microservices allow web developers to create reusable bits of software that can be used by anyone, anywhere in the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As he describes it, &#8220;Luos exposes a standard API for any part (buttons, motors, batteries, cameras, WiFi, etc.) allowing anyone to use all those services without any additional development and then you can create portable and reusable behavior code [we call a profile].&#8221; So you might have a battery profile or a motor profile that you can apply to every type of battery or motor regardless of which company produced it.</p>
<p>To put this capability in reach of any embedded hardware engineer, the company has developed an open source library that enables developers to create these different generic profiles. To get things started, the startup seeded it with some common ones like motors, but an embedded developer can download the open source framework and create one anytime, and then share it with the community.</p>
<p>Prior to creating this framework, engineers would typically create custom code for each component on a board, a time-consuming and frustrating process. The Luos solution removes much of that complexity and provides a common way to connect to different parts on the board by creating these common profiles.</p>
<p>While there isn&#8217;t a marketplace or central library for sharing profiles quite yet, the plan is to create one where there will be an organized way to share them. Today, the company makes money by working with organizations in a consulting or support role to help them use the development library or build profiles via a subscription model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:15107,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16750848},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Open Sans&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}"> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614a2a2d37969837d310357d" post-id="2206060"></div> </span></p>
<p>Luos is also working on a SaaS tool to help the embedded engineers troubleshoot problems on shipped boards, allowing them to remotely figure out what happened to a particular component like a motor and send a fix. This will add to the revenue base when it&#8217;s completed.</p>
<p>Rabault and his co-founders launched the startup in 2018, but the roots of the idea go back 14 years when Rabault was still a student. He says he has spent his entire career working directly or indirectly on these issues, and when he started this company, the technology had matured enough to implement a solution like this.</p>
<p>The company today has 12 employees, including the three founders and has plans to hire more, especially around community management, an important role in a company like this, along with user experience people and more embedded system engineers. He wants to build a diverse company, and while they only have employees living in France at the moment, they are a remote company and open to hiring from anywhere, which could help drive diversity as they continue to build the company.</p>
<p>So far the startup, which is based in Bordeaux, France, has raised $1.4 million in seed money. The primary goal for this initial investment is to help spread the word about what the startup is doing among its target audience of embedded system engineers.</p>
<p>Certainly participating in Battlefield will help amplify their mission, but the founders have also gotten practical advice on how to frame and pitch the company to users, customers and investors, and to introduce themselves to a U.S. audience, where Rabault believes that engineers are more open to experimenting with new tools like the ones from his company than they are in Europe where he is based. He sees Battlefield as a key way to reach that audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Raised in a Tanzania refugee camp, Dieumerci Christel’s first brush with entrepreneurship began with a stick of gum.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, kids in his camp were all gravitating toward a<a href="https://the-schuttes.blogspot.com/"> brand of gum named after Barack Obama, </a>the then-soon-to-be U.S. president. Noticing the budding interest, Christel began selling Obama gum to his friends, and soon enough, he had a stream of disposable income.</p>
<p>While gum sales taught Christel the power of scrappiness and smart timing, it’s what he spent his earnings on that brought him the bigger entrepreneurial lesson. He used the money to go to the movies, where he would see glimpses of what life looked like outside his world. He was struck by scenes with computers, excited students in lab coats, and the overall allure of school in America. The visuals, and opportunity of a computer, gave him the motivation he needed to study his way out of his situation.</p>
<p>“You’re going to school in a refugee camp knowing that you won’t go anywhere at all,” he said. “[Movies] for me was where I got to see the window through the world.”</p>
<p>Today, Christel is the founder of <a href="https://www.enlightapp.co/">Enlight</a>, a web platform that aims to help teachers carve out the intrinsic motivations within their students at scale. It wants to recreate what Christel stumbled upon through his own grit: a reason to go to school, communicated in a language that resonated with his natural interests.</p>
<p>While Christel was motivated by the opportunity of America and access to computers, another student may be motivated by the overlap between their dream of being an artist and how English class could get them there.</p>
<p>The goal to motivate students based on their interests is philosophical, but Enlight, competing in TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield this week, believes that it hinges on giving teachers better data about their students.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>To do so, Enlight invites students to fill out a profile and answer questions like top interests and learning mode preference, as well as respond to open-ended response prompts like “if you could solve any problem in your community or the world, what would it be and why?”</p>
<p>The data begins to get aggregated so that teachers can see the common denominators within their classes when it comes to teaching style or hobbies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200237" style="width: 893px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200237" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2200237" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Student-Profile.png" alt="" width="883" height="552" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Student-Profile.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Student-Profile.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Student-Profile.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Student-Profile.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Student-Profile.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Student-Profile.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 883px) 100vw, 883px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200237" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p>The platform also gives teachers the ability to run polls to temperature check their classes. By embedding live feedback, as well as student interests, into one platform, Christel thinks it will be easier for teachers to get a holistic view of their classes.</p>
<p>It’s here where the startup’s impact will get tested: What will teachers do with those insights?</p>
<p>If Enlight works the way that Christel intends it to, he thinks that it will help “everyone find their why.”</p>
<p>“How can that educator understand that you have a passion for writing and then ignite that potential to actually make you continue to follow it?” he said.</p>
<p>It’s a question Enlight will need to do more than pose in order to be an effective product.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200236" style="width: 922px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200236" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2200236" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Manage-a-Course-Poll.png" alt="" width="912" height="570" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Manage-a-Course-Poll.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Manage-a-Course-Poll.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Manage-a-Course-Poll.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Manage-a-Course-Poll.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Manage-a-Course-Poll.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Manage-a-Course-Poll.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200236" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dieumerci Christel</p></div></p>
<p>Enlight is currently working with a charter school right now to help teachers develop curriculum with passion data that they aggregate.</p>
<p>“We want to become a recommendation engine for the teacher on how to make better and faster decisions [that] actually engage students emotionally and in the classroom,” Christel said. He likened Enlight&#8217;s data profile for teachers to how TikTok gives analytics to content creators that shows how their audience looks and where they’re coming from.</p>
<p>For now, teachers and students can use the basic Enlight product for free but the startup is experimenting with a paid tier that could show a district-view of student interests, or provide more analytics.</p>
<p>Beyond implementation, a challenge for Enlight will be the sheer fatigue that teachers and learners already face today. Another platform, even with well intent, could add more work to their plates or another to-do list item.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200235" style="width: 958px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200235" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2200235" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard-–-21.png" alt="" width="948" height="603" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard-–-21.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard-–-21.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard-–-21.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard-–-21.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard-–-21.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard-–-21.png?resize=1536,977 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Dashboard-–-21.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 948px) 100vw, 948px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200235" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dieumerci Christel</p></div></p>
<p>“You don’t have to go to each student and learn about them right away,” Christel said. “Instead, you can get an overview on how to tailor your instruction. We find a common denominator between the students and give that teacher the data to help them tailor for the masses.” Enlight is also creating a student-of-the-week feature to motivate teachers to continuously learn about their students without requiring a 1:1 meeting.</p>
<p>Enlight’s communication focus means that it may have to compete with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/">the well-capitalized ClassDojo</a>, a communication app to help parents and teachers better communicate about students that recently became profitable.</p>
<p>“I think the thing that they are missing is the student,” he said. “Sometimes you feel like these people are making decisions for you&#8230;student feedback is missing.” Enlight thinks it can differentiate by involving students into communication channels, better aligning decision-making to what they request.</p>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:15107,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16750848},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Open Sans&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}"> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614a2a2d37969837d310357e" post-id="2206059"></div> </span></p>
<p>Involving students is important, but it isn’t so simple. Early on, Enlight thought it had a massive problem when it started seeing students unable to list any passions or interests on the platform. Long-term, he thinks that Enlight can be the hub where students showcase their learnings in and out of school, giving communities, schools, and employers a better understanding of upcoming generations.</p>
<p>For now, it’s focused on testing and tweaking the platform. It has only raised $365,000 in funding to date, from investors such as Techstars, UUntapped VC, Headstream and Teach for America. About 200 teachers use Enlight to date, with nearly 500 on the waitlist.</p>
<p>Christel said an early problem they faced through these testing days was students who said they didn’t have any interest and passions to fill out the profiles with.</p>
<p>“[But] then teachers said that this is another data point for us, so we can actually have conversations with these kids who aren’t even thinking about this stuff in the first place.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the largest providers of HTTPS certificates, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/lets-encrypt/">Let’s Encrypt</a>, will stop using an older root certificate next week — meaning you might need to upgrade your devices to prevent them from breaking.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s Encrypt, a free-to-use non-profit, issues certificates that encrypt the connections between your devices and the wider internet, ensuring that nobody can intercept and steal your data in transit. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/14/three-years-later-lets-encrypt-now-secures-75-of-the-web/">Millions of websites alone</a> rely on Let’s Encrypt. But, as warned by security researcher Scott Helme, the root certificate that Let’s Encrypt currently uses — the IdentTrust DST Root CA X3 — will expire on September 30. After this, computers, devices, and web clients — such as browsers — will no longer trust certificates that have been issued by this certificate authority.</p>
<p>For the overwhelming majority of website users, there is nothing to worry about and September 30 will be business as usual. Older devices, however, could run into some trouble, much like they did when the AddTrust External CA Root expired back in May. Stripe, Red Hat, and Roku all suffered outages as a result.</p>
<p>“Given the relative size difference between Let&#8217;s Encrypt and AddTrust, I have a feeling that the IdenTrust root expiry has the potential to cause more problems,” Helme warned <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/lets-encrypt-old-root-expiration/">in a blog post</a>, referring to the upcoming expiry.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;At least something, somewhere is going to break.&#8221;							<cite>Scott Helme, security researcher</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Devices likely to be affected by the certificate expiry are those that don’t get updated regularly, like embedded systems that are designed not to automatically update or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/smartphones/">smartphones</a> running years-old software releases. Users running older versions of macOS 2016)and Windows XP (with Service Pack 3) are likely to face issues, along with clients dependent on OpenSSL 1.0.2 or earlier, and older PlayStations that haven&#8217;t been upgraded to newer firmware.</p>
<p>While Android, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet.html">in Let’s Encrypt’s words</a>, has a “long-standing and well known issue with operating system updates”, the non-profit has a workaround that might prevent the majority of smartphones from being impacted by the expiry. The organization this year transitioned to its own ISRG Root X1 certificate, which doesn’t expire until 2035. While many <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/android/">Android</a> devices still don’t trust this certificate — namely versions of Android (Nougat) 7.1.1 and earlier — Let’s Encrypt obtained a cross-signature for its own certificate that&#8217;s valid for longer than the signing root, meaning most Android devices should remain breakage-free for three more years.</p>
<p>Some Android devices may still run into issues, Let’s Encrypt said, and it’s recommending that users running Android (Lollipop) 5.0 install Firefox.</p>
<p>&#8220;For an Android phone’s built-in browser, the list of trusted root certificates comes from the operating system — which is out of date on these older phones,” Let’s Encrypt explains. “However, Firefox is currently unique among browsers — it ships with its own list of trusted root certificates.”</p>
<p>Let’s Encrypt, which as of early September issued more than two billion certificates since it was founded in 2014, told TechCrunch that users should look at how many clients are using affected versions of OpenSSL and years-old operating systems. Its advice for those who can&#8217;t upgrade is to “look into whether serving a certificate chain with our new cross-sign makes sense.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to predict what will happen come September 30, but as Helme puts it: &#8220;At least something, somewhere is going to break.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies continue to delay their returns to the office and find temporary remote work policies becoming permanent, the startups building tooling for remote work-first cultures are finding a seemingly endless supply of customers.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Companies are finding the shift to remote work is not a one-time aberration due to Covid,&#8221; <a href="https://almanac.io/">Almanac</a> CEO Adam Nathan tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Over the past several months we’ve seen pretty explosive revenue growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almanac, which builds a doc editor that takes feature cues like version control from developer platforms like Github, has been seizing on the shift to remote work, onboarding new customers through its open source office document library Core while pushing features that allow for easier onboarding like an online company handbook builder.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LW8jEH4gHw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/almanac-is-building-a-faster-doc-editor-for-the-remote-work-era/">Almanac is building a faster doc editor for the remote work era</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Almanac is building a faster doc editor for the remote work era&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/almanac-is-building-a-faster-doc-editor-for-the-remote-work-era/embed/#?secret=LW8jEH4gHw" data-secret="LW8jEH4gHw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the past couple years, timelines between funding rounds have been shrinking for fast-growing startups. Almanac announced its $9 million seed round earlier this year led by Floodgate, now they&#8217;re taking the wraps off of a $34 million Series A led by the pandemic&#8217;s most prolific startup investment powerhouse &#8212; Tiger Global. Floodgate again participated in the raise, alongside General Catalyst and a host of angels.</p>
<p>The company wants its collaborative doc editor to be the way more companies fully embrace online productivity software, leaving local-first document editors in the dust. While Alphabet&#8217;s G Suite is a rising presence in the office productivity suite world, Microsoft Office is still the market&#8217;s dominant force.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see ourselves as a generational challenger to Microsoft Office,&#8221; Nathan says. &#8220;It’s not only an old product, but it’s totally outmoded for what we do to today.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While investors have backed plenty of startups based on pandemic era trends that have already seemed to fizzle out, the growing shift away from office culture or even hybrid culture towards full remote work has only grown more apparent as employees place a premium on jobs with flexible remote policies.</p>
<p>Major tech companies like Facebook have found themselves gradually adjusting policies towards full-remote work for staff that can do their jobs remotely. Meanwhile, Apple&#8217;s more aggressive return-to-office plan has prompted a rare outpouring of public and private criticism from employees at the company. Nathan only expects this divide to accelerate as more companies come tor grips with the shifting reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally don’t believe that hybrid is a thing,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You have to pick a side, you’re either office culture or ‘cloud culture.’”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">General Motors has spent a lot of time recently talking up the capabilities of its upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">Ultium battery technology</a> but has said significantly less so about the motors those cells will power. That changed on Tuesday when the company detailed its new <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/sep/0916-ultium-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">Ultium Drive motors</a>. With today’s announcement, the series consists of three different models: a 180 kW front-drive model, a 255 kW rear- and front-drive variant and a 62 kW all-wheel drive assist motor. The first two models are permanent magnet motors GM designed in such a way so as to try and reduce its dependence on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-rare-earth-metal-recycling-process-181124555.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">heavy rare metals</a>.</p>
<p>The company didn’t speak to the specific torque and power density characters of each motor but claimed they should deliver “excellent” performance on those fronts. It also revealed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmc-hummer-ev-reveal-001354369.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">2022 Hummer EV</a> will feature three of the 255 kW models. GM claims they will enable the vehicle to produce a combined 11,500 ft/lb of torque and accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in approximately three seconds.</p>
<p>GM says its engineers designed the motors with scalability in mind. Each one can be made using similar tools and manufacturing techniques. It also found a way to integrate components like the power inverter directly into the motors, a feat the company said should reduce costs and simplify manufacturing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["That's us, developing a relationship and trust with customers in places where weed is not legal yet."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I was annoying Seth Rogen. We had just started the interview, and while he politely answered my questions, he was growing tired of talking about his celebrity status. He was more interested in discussing how Houseplant, the company he co-founded, is succeeding by overcoming countless regulatory hurdles. To him, that success has little to do with the Seth Rogen brand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m a real celebrity. It&#8217;s not like Chris Evans is behind this,&#8221; Rogen said, laughing. &#8220;On the grand scale, celebrities are very low on the pecking order. I don&#8217;t even know if I am a celebrity since I haven&#8217;t been in a Marvel movie.&#8221;</p>
<p>I spoke with Rogen, CEO Mike Mohr and chief commerce officer Haneen Davies at TechCrunch Disrupt. Houseplant launched in March with two product categories: &#8220;House,&#8221; as in, home goods, and &#8220;Plant,&#8221; as in weed. One is highly regulated by the federal government and social media companies, and the other is not.</p>
<p>&#8220;We approached [building the brand] in a way that nobody else has,&#8221; Davies said. &#8220;I think the merger of house and plant is what&#8217;s going to help us establish a brand name that goes beyond the limiting restrictions you have to abide by to communicate cannabis.&#8221;</p>
<h2>From pot to pottery</h2>
<p>Look at Houseplant&#8217;s Instagram presence, and their strategy is obvious. The company has two accounts: One for the House side and one for the Plant side. One account has ashtrays and lighters, and one account has the pot. The account with just lifestyle items has twice as many followers as the pot account.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s home goods line is expanding, too, and soon it will sell lamps, furniture and more. Why? Because these household items are not censored by social media companies and let the company tell its story without restrictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve sold house goods in all 50 states at this point,&#8221; Seth Rogen explained. &#8220;That&#8217;s us, developing a relationship and trust with customers in places where weed is not legal yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the ethos of our launch,&#8221; said Davies. &#8220;You can talk about house goods the way you can talk about any product, and to us, they&#8217;re very much linked to cannabis and a cannabis lifestyle. But we can gain the trust of a national audience and be in many homes across the nation while we wait for cannabis to follow.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Portal line has always been a kind of odd duck in the world of smart screens. Facebook’s most significant contribution to the category is almost certainly Smart Camera, which uses AI to track a subject and pan and zoom accordingly to keep them in frame. It was the first big line to bring the clever feature to market, though Google, Amazon and even Apple have since offered their own takes on the category.</p>
<p>Portal’s other primary appeal (versus a Nest or Echo) is its integration with Facebook’s own software like Messenger and WhatsApp. Beyond that, the line has struggled to differentiate itself from Amazon and Google’s head start in the world of connected home hardware and smart assistants.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205404" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205404" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205404 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png 8192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go-with-Packaging.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205404" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Today’s news brings an interesting new layer to the conversation, with the arrival of the Portal Go, a battery-powered portal smart screen. The 10-inch device sports a handle on the back for quick gripping and a battery that promises five hours of standard usage and up to 14 hours of music playback with the screen off (there’s currently no specific battery-saving mode).</p>
<p>It’s a clever addition to the line. We are, no doubt, pushing further into tablet territory here, but I’ve felt the impulse to pick up and bring my Nest Home into the other room more than once. Your mileage will vary.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205412" style="width: 8202px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205412" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205412 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Office-Desk-e1632175444636.png" alt="" width="8192" height="4608" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205412" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>I haven’t seen the thing in person yet, but I do dig the design. It’s got rounded edges around some big black bezels and a fabric-covered backing that’s been all the rage in the smart home category for several years now. The Go is propped up in a wedged design, with two front-facing speakers and a rear-facing woofer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s got an ultrawide front-facing 12-megapixel camera that does the aforementioned smart panning, along a with a physical lens cover for privacy. The screen can also be titled up and down for an optimized viewing angle. The system doesn’t currently support far-field technology for a multiple speaker setup, which could complicate things as you move it around the house.</p>
<p>There’s also a new version of the Portal+, which features the same camera setup, coupled with a thin 14-inch tiltable display that can view up to 25 people at a time on a Zoom call. The Portal Go runs $199, while the new Portal+ is $349. Both devices are available for preorder today and start shipping October 19.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205424" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205424" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205424 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png 8192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Portal-Go_Portal_Portal-TV-Products.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205424" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Today’s news also finds Faceboook launching Portal for Business, aimed at positioning the smart screens as teleconferencing products. Per a release:</p>
<blockquote><p>With Portal for Business, SMBs will be able to create and manage Facebook Work Accounts for their teams. This is a new account type that allows businesses to use their own company email addresses to set up Portal. These Work Accounts will also provide access to other popular Facebook work products in the coming year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using Portal Device Manger, IT departments can set up and remotely wipe employee machines. The system is available now as a closed beta.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox is introducing an optional age verification for its users that will combine an ID check with a selfie scan. While the system will not be needed to play most Roblox games, it will be required for those who want to gain early access to Roblox&#8217;s upcoming voice chat features when they roll out later this fall. Additionally, the company says developers will be able to create new experiences that will rely on identity verification in the future.</p>
<p>The verification system is an acknowledgment that many of Roblox&#8217;s core users are aging up. The company said earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/roblox-voice-chat-spatial-audio/">when introducing</a> its new &#8220;Spatial Voice&#8221; feature, that 50% of its users are now over the age of 13. It&#8217;s also seeing the most explosive growth among the 17 to 24-year old demographic.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/09/future-communication-metaverse/">Spatial Voice</a>, which will allow Roblox gamers to have real voice conversations while in games, will initially be made available to a group of 5,000 developers, all 13 and older, who will be able to test voice chat in a custom-built Roblox community space. The rollout to Roblox&#8217;s wider user base will proceed slowly, as it will require new moderation tools and safety features to be built in parallel, the company had said. Age verification is now one of those tools.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205714" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205714" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2205714" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png 1298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Group-2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2205714" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roblox</p></div></p>
<p>Age Verification will come in two stages.</p>
<p>First, using the app, Roblox users will scan an ID card, driver&#8217;s license, passport or other government ID. The company says it won&#8217;t store the raw ID document data. Instead, an anonymized value is generated, which allows Roblox to verify the identity without risking exposure of the user&#8217;s real identity. Roblox matches the data on the document to a library of thousands of global document types to determine it&#8217;s legitimate. After scanning, the user will take a selfie to verify they are a living individual as opposed to uploaded a selfie image &#8212; something that could be automated to trick the system. The selfie is then matched to the person on the document. The process takes a few seconds after the image is snapped, Roblox says.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fairly common for identity verification to be offered on social platforms, as an optional tool. Facebook, for example, may ask users to verify their identity <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1555715811351399/?helpref=search&amp;query=identity%20verification&amp;search_session_id=39050418d137b21988c9af677693ded8&amp;sr=1">to use its payments or donations services</a> or to have their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/295038365360854">profile or Page verified</a>. Twitter <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">may also ask for an ID to verify accounts</a>. Tinder recently <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category">made its own ID verification available</a> to members, as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, in Roblox&#8217;s case, verification will become more common as it&#8217;s tied to access to newer voice-enabled games and experiences down the road. Roblox hasn&#8217;t yet said what, if any, alternatvie methods of verifying age for voice chat it may later employ.</p>
<p>The company notes that developers and creators will be able to use verification as a signal of trust when looking for collaborators, too &#8212; the verified status, in this case, may hold the same sort of clout that it does elsewhere in social media. On this front, Roblox this summer launched a <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/introducing-talent-hub-open-beta-new-platform-to-find-post-work/1396502">Talent Hub</a>, where users can look for jobs within the Roblox developer community.</p>
<p>Age verification is rolling out gradually, starting today, and will reach all users over the next few weeks. The opt-in feature will be globally available to everyone 13 years old or older in over 180 countries on both desktop and mobile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Age Verification marks a big milestone in our long-term vision of building a trusted, fun, and civil platform for everyone,&#8221; noted Roblox Senior Product Manager, Chris Aston Chen, in an announcement. &#8220;As part of that vision, we will continue to work on seamless ways to verify a user’s age, always respecting a user&#8217;s privacy. Over time, we’ll continue to introduce new and innovative ways for users to easily and securely maintain and protect their identity on the Roblox platform, unlock new and immersive social capabilities, and build and enjoy amazing experiences together,&#8221; Chen added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.mirakl.com">Mirakl</a> has closed a new Series E funding round of $555 million. Following this round, the company is now valued at $3.5 billion. Mirakl helps you launch a marketplace on your online store for your end customers or for your B2B clients. It’s a software-as-a-service marketplace, meaning that Mirakl manages the marketplace for you.</p>
<p>Silver Lake is leading the investment with existing investors 83North, Elaia Partners, Felix Capital and Permira also participating. With today’s funding round, Mirakl is experiencing a sharp valuation bump as the company closed a $300 million funding round at a $1.5 billion valuation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/mirakl-raises-300-million-for-its-marketplace-platform/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Some of Mirakl’s clients include ABB, Accor, Airbus Helicopters, Carrefour, Express, Leroy Merlin, The Kroger Co and Toyota Material Handling.</p>
<p>Chances are you’re already familiar with marketplaces on online stores. If the e-commerce brand doesn’t have the item you’re looking for, they might be recommending some third-party sellers. You can buy the item from this third-party seller directly on the store you’re using. Mirakl helps you add a marketplace to your site.</p>
<p>On some online stores, marketplace transactions have overtaken in-house transactions. It’s a lucrative shift as e-commerce companies don’t own the inventory of third-party sellers. It frees up some capital to increase reach and online sales.</p>
<p>And that trend isn’t limited to consumer-facing online stores. B2B marketplaces are emerging. For instance, car manufacturers rely on many different suppliers. They could all list parts directly on a marketplace so that repair shops can easily find the right part to fix a car.</p>
<p>When you add a marketplace component, you switch from a one-to-many model to a many-to-many model. It means that you have to make sure that you’re taking advantage of your marketplace by partnering with the right third-party sellers. As a third-party seller, it also means that you need to list your products on as many marketplaces as possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why the company has also built something called <a href="https://www.mirakl.com/mirakl-connect/">Mirakl Connect</a>. The startup positions itself as a center piece of the marketplace ecosystem by connecting online stores with sellers. Mirakl customers can use Mirakl Connect to find third-party sellers. And third-party sellers can more easily list their products on Mirakl-compatible marketplaces.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Mirakl plans to increase the size of its engineering team. It’ll add 350 engineers on top of its team of 150 — they will form a team of 500 engineers in total. Similarly, the customer success team will double in size. In other words, things are going well for Mirakl, so let’s invest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Mercedes-Benz has priced the flagship EQS electric vehicle more than $8,700 below its gas-powered S-Class counterpart, a strategic move by the German automaker aiming to ensure a successful rollout of the luxury EV in North America.</p>
<p>The EQS, which will arrive in U.S. dealerships in fall 2021, will start at $103,360, including the $1,050 destination charge. The federal tax credit will provide another $7,500 off of the sticker price.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz will start with two models: the EQS 450+ and the EQS 580 4MATIC, which has a higher base price of $120,160. These two variants will be offered in three trims — the top is appropriately called Pinnacle — pushing that price point as high as 126,360, including the $1,050 destination charge.</p>
<p>Mercedes&#8217;s decision to price the EQS below the S Class, which <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-7122b266eca9fbce132ea26634041549-2022-mercedes-benz-s-class-sedan-quick-reference-guide">starts at $$112,150</a> (including destination charge), illustrates the stakes at play here. The S-Class has long been the company&#8217;s storied and luxurious flagship sedan. Mercedes, which earlier this year outlined a €40 billion ($47 billion) plan to become an electric-only automaker by the end of the decade, needs to either convert old S Class owners to the EQS or bring in a new slate of buyers.</p>
<p>The 2022 Mercedes-Benz exudes ultra-luxury, as expected. But it&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/all-the-tech-crammed-into-the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs/">loaded with tech</a>, including a 56-inch hyperscreen, monster HEPA air filter and the software that intuitively learns the driver&#8217;s wants and needs. There is even a new fragrance called No.6 MOOD Linen and is described as &#8220;carried by the green note of a fig and linen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercedes is betting that the tech, coupled with performance, design and the price will attract buyers. As TechCrunch has noted before, this is a high-stakes game for Mercedes. The German automaker is banking on a successful rollout of the EQS in North America that will erase any memory of its troubled &#8212; and now nixed &#8212; launch of the EQC crossover in the United States.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ultimately, BioNTech's mission is to make treatments that are optimized not only to specific patient needs, but also to time and place.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">BioNTech&#8217;s founding story dates back to the late 1990s, when CEO and co-founder Uğur Şahin, his wife and co-founder Özlem Türeci, and the rest of the seven-person founding team began their research.</p>
<p>Focused specifically on an area dubbed &#8220;New Technologies,&#8221; mRNA stood out as one area with tremendous potential to deliver the team&#8217;s ultimate goal: Developing treatments personalized to an individual and their specific ailments, rather than the traditional approach of finding a solution that happens to work generally at the population level.</p>
<p>Şahin, along with Mayfield venture partner Ursheet Parikh, joined us at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine, his long journey as a founder, what it takes to build a biotech platform company, and what&#8217;s coming next from BioNTech and the technologies it&#8217;s developing to help prevent other outbreaks and treat today&#8217;s deadliest diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;At that time, mRNA was not potent enough,&#8221; Şahin recalled. &#8220;It was just a weak molecule. But the idea was great, so we invested many years in an academic setting to improve that. And in 2006, we realized &#8216;Wow, this is now working. Okay, it&#8217;s time to initiate a company.'&#8221;</p>
