										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today announced PyTorch Enterprise, a new Azure service that provides developers with additional support when using PyTorch on Azure. It&#8217;s basically Microsoft&#8217;s commercial support offering for PyTorch</p>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> is a Python-centric open-source machine learning framework with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing. It was originally developed by Facebook and is, at least to some degree, comparable to Google&#8217;s popular TensorFlow framework.</p>
<p>Frank X. Shaw, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate VP for communications, described the new PyTorch Enterprise service as providing developers with &#8220;a more reliable production experience for organizations using PyTorch in their data sciences work.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With PyTorch Enterprise, members of Microsoft&#8217;s Premier and Unified support program will get benefits like prioritized requests, hands-on support and solutions for hotfixes, bugs and security patches, Shaw explained. Every year, Microsoft will also select one PyTorch support for long-term support.</p>
<p>Azure already made it <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/pytorch/">relatively easy to use PyTorch</a> and Microsoft has long invested in the library by, for example, taking over the development of PyTorch for Windows <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/microsoft-becomes-maintainer-of-the-windows-version-of-pytorch/">last year</a>. As Microsoft noted in today&#8217;s announcement, the latest release of PyTorch will be integrated with Azure Machine Learning and the company promises to feed back the PyTorch code it developers back to the public PyTorch distribution.</p>
<p>Enterprise support will be available for PyTorch version 1.8.1 and up on Windows 10 and a number of popular Linux distributions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new enterprise-level offering by Microsoft closes an important gap. PyTorch gives our researchers unprecedented flexibility in designing their models and running their experiments,&#8221; said Jeremy Jancsary, Senior Principal Research Scientist at Nuance. &#8220;Serving these models in production, however, can be a challenge. The direct involvement of Microsoft lets us deploy new versions of PyTorch to Azure with confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this new offering, Microsoft is taking a page out of the open-source monetization playbook for startups by offering additional services on top of an open-source project. Since PyTorch wasn&#8217;t developed by a startup, only to have a major cloud provider then offer its own commercial version on top of the open-source code, this feels like a rather uncontroversial move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unlike in other years, this year&#8217;s Microsoft Build developer conference is not packed with huge surprises &#8212; but there&#8217;s one announcement that will surely make developers&#8217; ears perk up: The company is now using OpenAI&#8217;s massive GPT-3 natural language model in its no-code/low-code Power Apps service to translate spoken text into code in its recently announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform/">Power Fx language</a>.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get carried away. You&#8217;re not going to develop the next TikTok while only using natural language. Instead, what Microsoft is doing here is taking some of the low-code aspects of a tool like Power Apps and using AI to essentially turn those into no-code experiences, too. For now, the focus here is on Power Apps formulas, which despite the low-code nature of the service, is something you&#8217;ll have to write sooner or later if you want to build an app of any sophistication.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using an advanced AI model like this can help our low-code tools become even more widely available to an even bigger audience by truly becoming what we call no code,&#8221; said Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s low-code application platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8I6xrknY62"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform/">Microsoft launches Power Fx, a new open source low-code language</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft launches Power Fx, a new open source low-code language&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform/embed/#?secret=8I6xrknY62" data-secret="8I6xrknY62" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In practice, this looks like the citizen programmer writing &#8220;find products where the name starts with &#8216;kids&#8217; &#8221; &#8212; and Power Apps then rendering that as <em>&#8220;Filter(‘BC Orders’ Left(‘Product Name’,4)=&#8221;Kids&#8221;)&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>Because Microsoft is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-in-new-multiyear-partnership/">an investor in OpenAI</a>, it&#8217;s no surprise the company chose its model to power this experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156679" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GPT-3-Power-Fx-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156679" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2156679" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GPT-3-Power-Fx-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156679" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that while this makes programming easier, Microsoft itself stresses that users still have to understand the logic of the application they are building. &#8220;The features don’t replace the need for a person to understand the code they are implementing but are designed to assist people who are learning the Power Fx programming language and help them choose the right formulas to get the result they need. That can dramatically expand access to more advanced app building and more rapidly train people to use low code tools,&#8221; the company explains in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>To some degree, this isn&#8217;t all that different from using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/natural-language/q-and-a-intro">natural language query functions</a> that are now available in tools like <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/introducing-natural-language-queries-in-ideas/ba-p/1594687">Excel</a>, PowerBI or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/analyzing-text-in-a-google-sheet-using-cloud-natural-language-api-and-apps-script">Google Sheets</a>. These, too, translate natural language into a formula, after all. GPT-3 is probably a bit more sophisticated than this and capable of understanding more complex queries, but translating natural language into formulas isn&#8217;t all that new.</p>
<p>The long-term promise here, though, is for tools like this to become smarter over time and be able to handle more complicated programming tasks. But that&#8217;s a big step up from what is essentially a translation problem, though. More complex queries require more of an understanding of a program as a whole. A formula, for the most part, is a pretty self-contained statement but a similar model that could generate &#8220;real&#8221; code would have to contend with a lot more context.</p>
<p>These new features will go live in public preview in English to users in North America by the end of June.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual Build conference today, Microsoft announced a couple of new features for version 91 of its Edge browser that, like so much at Build this year, aren&#8217;t earth-shattering (developer velocity!) but nice quality-of-life upgrades for its users. Since Microsoft develops Edge in the open, these may also feel familiar to those who keep a close eye on the Edge roadmap &#8211; indeed, I think I&#8217;ve seen most of these in Edge 90 already&#8230;</p>
<p>One new feature is Startup Boost, which allows Edge to start up almost instantly. The way Microsoft does this is pretty straightforward. It simply loads some of the core Edge processes whenever you boot up your Windows machine, so when you task Edge with starting up, there isn&#8217;t all that much work left to do. This shouldn&#8217;t have too much of an effect on your Windows 10 bootup time, so it&#8217;s probably a trade-off worth making, but I also can&#8217;t recall anybody complaining about browser startup times in the last couple of years either.</p>
<p>The other new feature is &#8216;sleeping tabs,&#8217; which does pretty much what you expect it to do. It puts your tabs to sleep so they don&#8217;t use up unnecessary memory and CPU cycles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Microsoft first announced that it was testing this feature <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/12/09/sleeping-tabs-beta-performance/">back in December</a> and at the time, the Edge team said that it reduces memory usage by 32% and helps improve battery life as well, given that sleeping tabs use 37% less CPU on average compared to non-sleeping tabs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Google&#8217;s Chrome browser, which shares many of its underlying technology with Edge, also features tools to limit resource usage, including what Google calls &#8216;tab freezing,&#8217; as does virtually every other major browser today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its (virtual) Build conference today, Microsoft launched a number of new features, tools and services for developers who want to integrate their services with Teams, the company&#8217;s Slack competitor. It&#8217;s no secret that Microsoft basically looks at Teams, which now has about 145 million daily active users, as the new hub for employees to get work done, so it&#8217;s no surprise that it wants third-party developers to bring their services right to Teams as well. And to do so, it&#8217;s now offering a set of new tools that will make this easier and enable developers to build new user experiences in Teams.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on here, but maybe the most important news is the launch of the enhanced Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>&#8220;This essentially enables developers to build apps easier and faster &#8212; and to build very powerful apps tapping into the rich Microsoft stack,&#8221; Microsoft group program manager Archana Saseetharan explained. &#8220;With the updated toolkit [&#8230;], we enable flexibility for developers. We want to meet developers where they are.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2156680" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Shared-Stage-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156680" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2156680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Shared-Stage-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="562" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156680" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The toolkit offers support for tools and frameworks like React, SharePoint and .NET. Some of the updates the team enabled with this release are integration with Aure Functions, the SharePoint Framework integration and a single-line integration with the Microsoft Graph. Microsoft is also making it easier for developers to integrate an authorization workflow into their Teams apps. &#8220;Login is the first kind of experience of any user with an app &#8212; and most of the drop-offs happen there,&#8221; Saseetharan said. &#8220;So [single-sign on] is something we completely are pushing hard on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team also launched a new Developer Portal for Microsoft Teams that makes it easier for developers to register and configure their apps from a single tool. ISVs will also be able to use the new portal to offer their apps for in-Teams purchases.</p>
<p>Other new Teams features for developers include ways for developers to build real-time multi-user experiences like whiteboards and project boards, for example, as well as a new meeting event API to build meeting-related workflows for when a meeting starts and ends, for example, as well as new features for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/microsoft-makes-teams-video-meetings-less-tiring-with-its-new-together-mode/">Teams Together mode</a> that will let developers design their own Together experiences.</p>
<p>There are a few other new features here as well, but what it all comes down to is that Microsoft wants developers to consider Teams as a viable platform for their services &#8212; and with 145 million daily active users, that&#8217;s potentially a lucrative way for software firms to get their services in front of a new audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teams is enabling a new class of apps called collaborative apps,&#8221; said Karan Nigam, Microsoft&#8217;s director of product marketing for Teams. &#8220;We are uniquely positioned to bring the richness to the collaboration space &#8212; a ton of innovation to the extensibility side to make apps richer, making it easier with the toolkit update, and then have a single-stop shop with the developer portal where the entire lifecycle can be managed. Ultimately, for a developer, they don&#8217;t have to go to multiple places, it&#8217;s one single flow from the business perspective for them as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its Build developer conference today, Microsoft announced a new set of Azure services (in preview) that businesses can now run on virtually any CNCF-conformant Kubernetes cluster with the help of its <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-arc/">Azure Arc</a> multi-cloud service.</p>
<p>Azure Arc, similar to tools like Google&#8217;s Anthos or AWS&#8217;s upcoming <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/">EKS Anywhere</a>, provides businesses with a single tool to manage their container clusters across clouds and on-premises data centers. Since its launch back in late 2019, Arc enabled some of the core Azure services to run directly in these clusters as well, though the early focus was on a small set of data services, with the team also later adding some machine learning tools to Arc as well. With today&#8217;s update, the company is greatly expanding this set of containerized Azure services that work with Arc.</p>
<p>These new services include <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/">Azure App Service</a> for building and managing web apps and APIs, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Azure Functions</a> for event-driven programming, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/">Azure Logic Apps</a> for building automated workflows, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-grid/">Azure Event Grid</a> for event routing, and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/">Azure API Management</a> for&#8230; you guessed it&#8230; managing internal and external APIs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The app services are now Azure Arc-enabled, which means customers can deploy Web Apps, Functions, API gateways, Logic Apps and Event Grid services on pre-provisioned Kubernetes clusters,&#8221; Microsoft explained in its annual &#8220;Book of News&#8221; for this year&#8217;s Build. &#8220;This takes advantage of features including deployment slots for A/B testing, storage queue triggers and out-of-box connectors from the app services, regardless of run location. With these portable turnkey services, customers can save time building apps, then manage them consistently across hybrid and multicloud environments using Azure Arc.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The highest chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has delivered a blow to anti-surveillance campaigners in Europe by failing to find that bulk interception of digital comms is inherently incompatible with human rights law &#8212; which enshrines individual rights to privacy and freedom of expression.</p>
<p>However today&#8217;s Grand Chamber <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press#{&quot;itemid&quot;:[&quot;003-7028496-9484349&quot;]}">judgement</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">underscores</a> the need for such intrusive intelligence powers to be operated with what the judges describe as &#8220;end-to-end safeguards&#8221;.</p>
<p>Governments in Europe that fail to do so are opening such laws up to further legal challenge under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Grand Chamber ruling also confirms that the UK&#8217;s historic surveillance regime &#8212; under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (aka RIPA) &#8212; was unlawful because it lacked the necessary safeguards.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big Brother Watch now out. Looking at the dissents, it does not look good for anti-surveillance campaigners: &#39;with the present judgment the Strasbourg Court has just opened the gates for an electronic “Big Brother” in Europe&#39; <a href="https://t.co/1HqKz64qS5">https://t.co/1HqKz64qS5</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Michael Veale (@mikarv) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikarv/status/1397123680883314689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Per the court, &#8216;end-to-end&#8217; safeguards means that bulk intercept powers need to involve assessments at each stage of the process of the necessity and proportionality of the measures being taken; that bulk interception should be subject to independent authorisation at the outset, when the object and scope of the operation are being defined; and that the operation should be subject to supervision and independent &#8216;ex post facto&#8217; review.</p>
<p>The Grand Chamber judgement identified a number of deficiencies with the bulk regime operated in the UK at the time of RIPA &#8212; including that bulk interception had been authorised by the Secretary of State, rather than by a body independent of the executive; categories of search terms defining the kinds of communications that would become liable for examination had not been included in the application for a warrant; and search terms linked to an individual (e.g. specific identifiers such as an email address) had not been subject to prior internal authorisation.</p>
<p>The court also found that the UK&#8217;s<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> bulk intercept regime had breached Article 10 (freedom of expression) because it had not contained sufficient protections for confidential journalistic material.</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>While the regime used for obtaining comms data from communication service providers was found to have violated Articles 8 (right to privacy and family life/comms) and 10 &#8220;as it had not been in accordance with the law&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, the court held that the regime by which the UK could request intelligence from foreign governments and/or intelligence agencies had had sufficient safeguards in place to protect against abuse and to ensure that UK authorities had not used such requests as a means of circumventing their duties under domestic law and the Convention.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Court considered that, owing to the multitude of threats States face in modern society, operating a bulk interception regime did not in and of itself violate the Convention,&#8221; it added in a press release. </span></p>
<p>The RIPA regime has since replaced by the UK&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption/">Investigatory Powers Act</a> (IPA) &#8212; which put bulk intercept powers explicitly into law (albeit with claimed layers of oversight).</p>
<p>The IPA has also been subject to a number of human rights challenges &#8212; and in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43928147">2018</a> the government was ordered by the UK High Court to revise parts of the law which had been found to be incompatible with human rights law.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Grand Chamber judgement relates specifically to RIPA and to a number of legal challenges brought against the UK&#8217;s mass surveillance regime by journalists and privacy and digital rights campaigners in the wake of the 2013 mass surveillance revelations by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden which the ECHR heard simultaneously.</p>
<p>In a similar ruling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/uks-mass-surveillance-regime-violated-human-rights-law-finds-echr/">back in 2018</a> the lower Chamber found some aspects of the UK&#8217;s regime violated human rights law &#8212; with a majority vote then finding that its <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">bulk interception regime had violated Article 8 because there was insufficient oversight (such as of selectors and filtering; and of search and selection of intercepted communications for examination; as well as inadequate safeguards governing the selection of related comms data). </span></p>
<p>Human rights campaigners followed up by requesting and securing a referral to the Grand Chamber &#8212; which has now handed down its view.</p>
<p>It <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">unanimously </span>found there had been a violation of Article 8 <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">in respect of the regime for obtaining communications data from communication service providers.</span></p>
<p>But by <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">12 votes to 5 it ruled there had been no violation of Article 8 in respect of the UK’s regime for requesting intercepted material from foreign governments and intelligence agencies.</span></p>
<p>In another <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">unanimous vote the Grand Chamber found </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">there had been a violation of Article 10, concerning both the bulk interception regime and the regime for obtaining communications data from comms service providers.</span></p>
<p>But, again, by <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">12 votes to 5 it ruled there had been no violation of Article 10 in respect of the regime for requesting intercepted material from foreign governments and intelligence agencies.</span></p>
<p>Responding to the judgement in a <a href="https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/2021/05/uk-mass-surveillance-found-unlawful-by-europes-highest-human-rights-court/">statement</a>, the privacy rights group Big Brother Watch &#8212; which was one of the parties involved in the challenges &#8212; said the judgement &#8220;confirms definitively that the UK’s bulk interception practices were unlawful for decades&#8221;, thereby vindicating Snowden&#8217;s whistleblowing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The organization also highlighted a dissenting opinion from Judge Pinto de Alburquerque, who wrote that:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Admitting non-targeted bulk interception involves a fundamental change in how we view crime prevention and investigation and intelligence gathering in Europe, from targeting a suspect who can be identified to treating everyone as a potential suspect, whose data must be stored, analysed and profiled (…) a society built upon such foundations is more akin to a police state than to a democratic society. This would be the opposite of what the founding fathers wanted for Europe when they signed the Convention in 1950.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In further remarks on the judgement, Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, added: &#8220;Mass surveillance damages democracies under the cloak of defending them, and we welcome the Court’s acknowledgement of this. As one judge put it, we are at great risk of living in an electronic &#8216;Big Brother&#8217; in Europe. We welcome the judgment that the UK’s surveillance regime was unlawful, but the missed opportunity for the Court to prescribe clearer limitations and safeguards mean that risk is current and real.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue our work to protect privacy, from parliament to the courts, until intrusive mass surveillance practices are ended,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><a href="https://privacyinternational.org/press-release/4522/human-rights-groups-win-european-court-human-rights-claim-uk-mass-surveillance">Privacy International</a> &#8212; another party to the case &#8212; sought to put a more positive spin on the outcome, saying the Grand Chamber goes further than the ECHR&#8217;s 2018 ruling by &#8220;providing for new and stronger safeguards, adding a new requirement of prior independent or judicial authorisation for bulk interception&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Authorisation must be meaningful, rigorous and check for proper &#8216;end-to-end safeguards&#8217;,&#8221; it added in a statement.</p>
<p>Also commenting publicly, the Open Rights Group&#8217;s executive director, Jim Killock, said: “The court has shown that the UK Government’s legal framework was weak and inadequate when we took them to court with Big Brother Watch and Constanze Kurz in 2013. The court has set out clear criteria for assessing future bulk interception regimes, but we believe these will need to be developed into harder red lines in future judgments, if bulk interception is not to be abused.&#8221;</p>
<p>“As the court sets out, bulk interception powers are a great power, secretive in nature, and hard to keep in check. We are far from confident that today’s bulk interception is sufficiently safeguarded, while the technical capacities continue to deepen. GCHQ continues to share technology platforms and raw data with the US,&#8221; Killock went on to say, couching the judgment as &#8220;an important step on a long journey&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even as 2021 shapes up to see a record number of launches, demand is growing fast. Companies like <a href="https://phantomspace.com/">Phantom Space Corporation</a> aim to fill it with mass manufacturing techniques never yet seen in the space industry. Now the company has acquired StratSpace, a satellite program designer and manager, Phantom Space announced Tuesday. It&#8217;s a critical step towards building out a turnkey space transportation and manufacturing service, Phantom Space co-founder Michal Prywata told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“[StratSpace] has all the know-how, all the tools, the satellite structures, communication systems that can make a spacecraft operate,” he explained. “Which is very critical for us, because we want to be one of the first companies that covers gives that full spectrum of service from start to finish.” The company declined to disclose the terms of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Phantom Space’s bet is that combining a mass rocket manufacturing strategy with acquisitions that position it as a ‘one-stop-shop’ will help bring down the cost of space access. Prywata said the company’s aiming to charge $4 million for a dedicated launch that would bring up to 450 kilograms to low Earth orbit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re talking about hundreds to potentially thousands a year,” Prywata said, referring to the number of launches the company eventually hopes to achieve. “As of right now, the market certainly supports hundreds of launches a year.”</p>
<p>They&#8217;re big aspirations for a company that has not yet begun even flight testing a rocket model. Phantom Space said it is outsourcing many components, like the engine and avionics system, that can take years to develop, to get it there. For other components and services, it&#8217;s looking to use an acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re looking at acquisitions pretty aggressively because we feel there&#8217;s an opportunity now to start integrating these types of technologies and companies within one umbrella and create this overall infrastructure of a company that can take ideas and bring them to space,” he said. That includes building satellites, integration, launch, and data communication. “We&#8217;re trying to cover that full spectrum, where we can help other companies that have some application that they want to launch into space, we can help them get there, because we have all these specific pieces that can make it all happen.”</p>
<p>Phantom Space is aiming to launch its two-stage Daytona rocket for the first time in the first quarter of 2023, with stage-level testing commencing in early 2022. Daytona, the company&#8217;s &#8220;workhorse&#8221; launch vehicle, comes in at 61 feet in height and can carry 450 kilograms to LEO on eight engines. While the Daytona is totally expendable, the company has plans to reuse its larger Laguna rocket model.</p>
<p>The company has signed a right of entry for Space Launch Complex 5 at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, which will likely be the location of its first launches. It also just signed an agreement with the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Alaska, where Astra (another company looking toward mass rocket manufacturing) completes its launches, and it’s planning on eventually having launch agreements with Cape Canaveral Spaceport in Florida.</p>
<p>But even if flight testing goes smoothly, reaching hundreds or even thousands of launches per year is still currently impossible given the small number of spaceports in the country.</p>
<p>“That said, having launch capability just in the US isn&#8217;t enough, because you won&#8217;t be able to get to hundreds a year, just out of those three sites,” Prywata said. So, the company is also looking at a site in northern Sweden, northern Australia, and Brazil. It’s also in talks with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to license spaceports that are restricted to horizontal launches only to allow for vertical launch.</p>
<p>Phantom Space&#8217;s acquisition of StratSpace it’s only going to be the first of many, Prywata said. “We’re still small so we’re trying to grow aggressively,” he said. “So we’re starting with these smaller acquisitions but very key acquisitions to enable our overall strategy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People in a Beijing suburb will begin to see autonomous delivery mini-vans across their neighborhood, moving cautiously alongside human delivery riders belting down the streets.</p>
<p>Beijing has greenlighted JD.com, Meituan, and Neolix to trial self-driving delivery vehicles on designated public roads in the Yizhuang Development Area, an economic and technological growth pilot initiated by the municipal government of the capital city, according to an announcement made by local authorities at a mobility conference on Tuesday. Yizhuang has aggressively rolled out 5G coverage in part to<a href="http://www.china.org.cn/china/2019-08/30/content_75155825.htm"> prepare the infrastructure for autonomous driving ventures</a>.</p>
<p>All three companies are using dainty box-on-wheels vehicles similar to those of Nuro to shuffle goods around. Three-year-old Neolix, backed by Chinese electric vehicle startup Li Auto, focuses on making self-driving vehicles for retail, surveillance and other city services, while both JD.com and Meituan are tech heavyweights that find unmanned delivery increasingly important to their existing core business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2157082" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157082" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2157082 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46691621951315_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46691621951315_.pic_hd.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46691621951315_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46691621951315_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46691621951315_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46691621951315_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46691621951315_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157082" class="wp-caption-text">Meituan&#8217;s self-driving delivery vehicle / Photo: Meituan via WeChat</p></div></p>
<p>Online retailer JD.com hires its own in-house delivery staff while Meituan relies on a national network of riders to bring restaurant takeout to customers. Both have been working on autonomous driving technologies internally in recent years and are also testing small fleets of delivery drones in China.</p>
<p>Neolix will place 150 delivery robots on Beijing roads by June. JD.com declined to disclose its deployment number. Meituan can&#8217;t be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>At the Tuesday event, authorities from the Beijing pilot zone also <a href="http://www.chinanews.com/cj/2021/05-25/9485293.shtml">laid out</a> rules for operating zero-occupant delivery vehicles in the area. The robots are categorized as &#8220;non-motor vehicles,&#8221; which suggests they will be moving next to bicycles and electric scooters instead of faster-moving cars. Road conditions in Chinese cities are often much more complicated than in the United States, even on sidewalks and bike lanes thanks to unpredictable pedestrians, unleashed pets, and reckless scooter riders.</p>
<p>Importantly, the rules also stipulate that the robots need to have safety drivers &#8220;on the spot and remotely.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157081" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157081" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2157081 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157081" class="wp-caption-text">Neolix&#8217;s delivery robot / Photo: Neolix via WeChat</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">JD.com says its technology allows every remote safety driver to monitor up to 50 operating delivery robots simultaneously. Its vehicles will carry packages from logistics centers and supermarkets to nearby office buildings, residential complexes and school campuses. Customers will then fetch their order directly from the van using a pick-up code sent to them through a text message ahead of time.</p>
<p>Neolix&#8217;s vehicles in the pilot area, in comparison, act more like mobile vending machines peddling snacks and lunchboxes to workers around office complexes. Users can place their order on a little screen attached to the robot, pay by a QR code and get their warm bento or ice cream instantaneously.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Lordstown is not the only SPAC that is going to see some daylight between its pitch and its performance. But it's a pretty stark reminder that SPAC decks are sales pitches, not promises.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The lackluster performance of shares in companies that have combined with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) in recent quarters took another hit yesterday when Lordstown Motors reported its first-quarter results.</p>
<p>Lordstown, part of a wave of electric-vehicle companies that raised capital and went public via SPACs, announced lower-than-expected 2021 vehicle production, higher capital expenditures (capex) for the year, and the need to raise more capital. For holders of its equity, the news was a disappointment, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">TechCrunch explored after the results dropped</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Shares of Lordstown are down 14% in pre-market trading after falling in after-hours trading yesterday evening.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more to the Lordstown mess than merely a single bad quarter. What the company reported is somewhat contradicted by its SPAC deck, a document that every startup combining with a blank-check company releases. They are often cheery and full of good news. With just a little capital, the company in question is going to scale rapidly in the coming years, with improving profitability to boot.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995210" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Then the deal is sold, capital is raised, entities combine, and the startup in question becomes public, with earnings calls commencing on a quarterly cadence. That&#8217;s where the rubber meets the road.</p>
<p>Lordstown&#8217;s earnings mess and the resulting dissonance with its own predictions are notable on their own, but they also point to what could be <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-startup-leaders-spacs-have-lost-their-allure-11621774800?mod=djemalertNEWS">shifting sentiment regarding SPAC combinations</a>. Returns <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c7c0f11c-b678-491d-9173-fe49ea29b4b8">are lackluster</a>, the SEC is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/spacs-ipos-liability-risk-under-securities-laws">worried about too-rosy forecasts</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-congress-hold-hearing-spacs-ramping-up-scrutiny-2021-05-21/">Congress is looking into the boom</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re taking a look into Lordstown&#8217;s results this morning, but don&#8217;t think that we&#8217;re only singling out one company; others fit the bill, and more will in time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.eys3d.com/">eYs3D Microelectronics</a>, a fabless design house that focuses on end-to-end software and hardware systems for computer vision technology, has raised a $7 million Series A. Participants included ARM IoT Capital, WI Harper and Marubun Corporation, who will each serve as strategic investors.</p>
<p>Based in Taipei, Taiwan, eYs3D was spun out of <a href="http://www.etron.com/en/aboutus/company.php">Etron</a>, a fabless IC and system-in-package (SiP) design firm, in 2016. It will use its new funding to build its embedded chip business in new markets. The company’s technology, including integrated circuits, 3D sensors, camera modules and AI-based software, have a wide range of applications, such as robotics, touchless controls, autonomous vehicles and smart retail. eYs3D’s products have been used in the Facebook Oculus Rift S and Valve Index virtual reality headsets, and Techman Robots.</p>
<p>ARM, the microprocessor company, will integrate eYs3D’s chips into its CPU and NPUs. WI Harper, a cross-border investment firm with offices in Taipei, Beijing and San Francisco, will give eYs3D access to its international network of industrial partners. Marubun Corporation, a Japan-based company that distributes semiconductors and other electronic components, will open new distribution channels for eYs3D.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a press statement, ARM IoT Capital chairman Peter Hsieh said, “As we look to the future, enhanced computer vision support plays a key role in ARM’s AI architecture and deployment. eYs3D’s innovative 3D computer vision capability can offer the market major benefits, and we are pleased to partner with the company and invest in the creation of more AI-capable vision processors.”</p>
<p>The new funding will also be used to expand eYs3D’s product development and launch a series of 3D computer vision modules. It will also work with new business partners to expand its platform and hire more talent.</p>

<p>eYs3D’s chief strategy officer James Wang told TechCrunch that the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-chip-shortage-is-bad-taiwans-drought-threatens-to-make-it-worse-11618565400">global chip shortage and Taiwan’s drought</a> haven’t significantly impacted the company’s business or production plans, because it works with Etron as its integrated circuits manufacturing service.</p>
<p>“Etron Technology is one of the major accounts for the Taiwanese foundry sector and has strong relationships with the foundries, so eYs3D can receive products for its customers as required,” he said. “Meanwhile, eYs3D works closly with its major customers to schedule a just-in-time supply chain for their production pipelines.”</p>
<p>The company’s systems combine silicon design and algorithms to manage information collected from different sensor sources, including thermal, 3D and neural network perception. Its technology is capable of supporting visual simultaneous location and mapping (vSLAM), object feature depth recognition, and gesture-based commands.</p>
<p>Yang said eYs3D can provide end-to-end services, from integrated circuit design to ready-to-use products, and works closely with clients to determine what they need. For example, it offered its chip solution to an autonomous robot company for obstacle avoidance and people-tracing features.</p>
<p>“Since their expertise is in robotic motor controls and mechanicals, they needed a more complete solution for a design module for 3D sensing, as well as object and people recognition. We provided them with one of our 3D depth camera solutions and SDK along with middleware algorithm samples for their validation,” said Yang. “The customer took our design package and seamlessly integrated our 3D depth camera solution for proof-of-concept within a short period of time. Next, we helped them to retrofit the camera design to fit in their robot body prior to commercialization of the robot.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hyro.ai/">Hyro</a>, formerly Airbud, is today announcing the close of a $10.5 million Series A financing round led by Spero Ventures, with participation from Twilio, and Mindset Ventures. Existing investors Hanaco Ventures, Spider Capital and Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Hyro is an enterprise application, currently aimed at the healthcare sector but with eyes on new verticals, that adds an intelligent layer of voice chat or text chat to any application or website.</p>
<p>The company calls itself an adaptive communications platform, which essentially means that customers use plug-and-play tools to get information to end-users in a conversational way, whether that be voice or chat. It can integrate with contact centers, chatbots, SMS and other forms of communication. Essentially, Hyro targets information-heavy industries that often have to communicate with end-users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This type of scenario, in the words of cofounder Israel Krush, usually leads to a terrible experience for the end user and a costly, inefficient process for the organization. The problem was no more apparent than in the healthcare sector during the pandemic. End users would flood platforms for information regarding the virus, the vaccine, testing, etc., but ask those redundant questions in myriad ways. On the enterprise side, the answers to those questions were changing over time.</p>
<p>Hyro allows these organizations to easily edit and change that information and deliver it to end users in an efficient way. But perhaps most importantly, Hyro scrapes information from the website to set up its own conversational tree, so the client doesn&#8217;t have to do a lot of heavy lifting up front.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cTYqkUHMGs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/airbud-raises-4-million-to-add-a-voice-interface-to-your-website/">Airbud raises $4 million to add a voice interface to your website</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Airbud raises $4 million to add a voice interface to your website&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/airbud-raises-4-million-to-add-a-voice-interface-to-your-website/embed/#?secret=cTYqkUHMGs" data-secret="cTYqkUHMGs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Krush says that the problem is big, which means that the space is crowded. He views Twilio&#8217;s participation in this round of fundraising as a differentiator.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market is crowded so it&#8217;s really hard to differentiate yourself from the crowd,&#8221; said Krush. &#8220;Even though we have great technology, everyone says they have great technology. Twilio coming into this round and the partnership we&#8217;re trying to develop around contact centers really attests to the differentiation of our approach, to the scalability and the modularity of our approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Hyro is not a healthcare company &#8212; &#8220;it&#8217;s really about serving any enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyro healthcare customers include Carroll, Wheelpros, Mercy Health, University of Rochester Medical Center and Weill Cornell Medicine, but the company plans to use this new funding to scale into more verticals, with an aim toward real estate, government, and other information-heavy industries. </span></p>
<p>This latest round brings Hyro&#8217;s total funding to $15 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/propy-a-blockchain-verified-platform-for-selling-houses-raises-funding-from-tim-draper/">wrote about Propy</a> using blockchain technology to smooth real-world real estate sales by introducing the concept of smart contracts. Propy was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-entire-real-estate-deal-takes-place-online-using-cryptocurrency-technology-1506462545">the first</a> blockchain startup to make that work. Now the company is pushing the boundaries again, by <em>auctioning a real apartment as an NFT</em>. Although one might want to brush this aside as a stunt, the event is designed to make the point that it could well be done legally. And, by golly, they are going to try.</p>
<p>The auction will be of the NFT attached to a modern, brand new, one-bedroom apartment in Kiev, Ukraine, that Propy previously made history with by making it the first-ever level blockchain-based real estate sale.</p>
<p>The NFT created by Propy will, it says, transfers real ownership of the property. Just in case you haven;t been paying attention, NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are cryptographic &#8216;tokens&#8217; that represent a unique asset — such as a piece of art, music, or other collectibles — and certify ownership digitally. NFTs have set the crypto-world alight with their potential to be applied to just about anything, including a work of art by Banksy which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/09/nfts-flying-cats-burning-banksy-digital-art-crypto-art-bitcoin-rocketing">then burnt</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once someone has won the NFT of the apartment at auction, the NFT will include access to the ownership transfer paperwork; a digital artwork NFT by a popular Kiev graffiti artist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chizz.xr/">Chizz</a> (a physical painting of the digital artwork is painted on a wall of the apartment)’ and the apartment pictures. But obviously, the apartment is the main asset here.  </p>
<p>The auction itself will happen over a 24hr period with the initial listing starting at $20,000. Details for the NFT sale are <a href="https://propy.com/browse/propy-nft/">available here</a> and will be updated with any new information as the auction proceeds.</p>
<p>The apartment in question is currently owned by <a href="https://twitter.com/arrington">Michael Arrington</a>, founder of this very news site, and now a Crypto investor with <a href="http://arringtonxrpcapital.com/">Arrington XRP Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Investors in Propy &#8211; which says it has so far processed $1bn worth of transactions via its platform &#8211; include Arrington himself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/propy-a-blockchain-verified-platform-for-selling-houses-raises-funding-from-tim-draper/">and Tim Draper</a>, former founder of DFJ.</p>
<p>Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of Propy said: “This NFT will go down in history. For Propy it is a major milestone in leveraging the promise of blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFT) to achieve &#8216;self-driving&#8217; real estate transactions and real estate participation in the decentralized finance economy.”</p>
<p>Here’s how this is all going to work: Arrington has signed legal papers designed by  Propy’s lawyers for the NFT to transfer ownership to a future buyer. Propy then conducts the NFT auction and receives payment in cryptocurrency. The winner in the auction becomes the owner within a minute, after filling out KYC details.</p>
<p>The Kiev property is owned by a USA-based entity, and when the auction completes, the new owner of the NFT becomes the owner of the entity and thus the property itself. This process is repeated every time the NFT attached to the property is resold. </p>
<p>In an interview with me, Karayaneva said: “We were brainstorming and this appeared to be a natural development of our white paper of 2017. And in fact, many things we transact, real estate, via property, we are actually already kind of doing NF T&#8217;s, but with our unique smart contracts. But now the NFT concept provides a different approach, where a property can be transferred between two wallets, peer to peer.”</p>
<p>“Thus we do not need to change the name of the owner in the land registry. And this applies to many countries, as well as the United States. This model will work for the United States, and overall, there is this notion of buying real estate via LLC in the United States to preserve the privacy of the owner.”</p>
<p>Over the same call, Arrington added: “Coming at this from a crypto angle, we’ve seen what happens how DeFi gets plugged into credit markets. If I have an NFT or any DeFI asset I can then borrow against it, without a middleman. Right now, if I have a real piece of real estate, there is no way for me to borrow against it, without a middleman, because I have to go through a bank and get a mortgage or whatever. And it&#8217;s also the friction all of the costs in terms of speed and how long it takes.”</p>
<p>“If we can find a way to plug real estate and other real-world assets into DeFi, I think that the amount of credit that can be created around that is in the trillions, eventually. And so I think that has to happen. The questions around this are legal and regulatory… The legal stuff around this is tough, and so Propy has done a lot of work with that. But if they do, I think that the idea of an NFT representation of a real-world asset purely from the point of view of ease of trade and ease of access to credit markets is a big idea.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://flexibits.com">Flexibits</a>, the company behind productivity apps <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical" title="Learn More">Fantastical</a> and <a href="https://flexibits.com/cardhop">Cardhop</a>, is releasing a new version of Cardhop for both macOS and iOS. This is the second major version of the app and it adds new features, such as business card scanning, widgets, organizational charts and a deeper integration with Fantastical.</p>
<p>Cardhop is a clever take on contact management. It uses the same address book as the default Contacts app on your Mac, iPhone and iPad. But it lets you search, add and edit contacts much more efficiently.</p>
<p>On the Mac, Cardhop sits in the menu bar. When you click on the icon or hit a keyboard shortcut, you can see your contacts but you can also start typing. This is when it gets interesting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As expected, you can find a contact card by typing a few letters. But you can also add information to an existing contact this way.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157037" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157037" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cardhop-2-Mac-action.png?w=400" alt="" width="400" height="277" class="size-medium wp-image-2157037" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157037" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flexibits</p></div></p>
<p>For instance, if you type a name followed by a phone number, Cardhop automatically figures out that the phone number doesn’t exist in the existing contact entry — hit enter and the number is saved. If the person isn’t even in your address book, you can create a new contact just by dumping information in the search field.</p>
<p>The app truly shines if you think about Cardhop as a sort of command-line interface to interact with your contacts. You can type ‘call Jane’, ‘email Tom’ or ‘whatsapp Natasha’ — Cardhop parses the action for you. It can be particularly handy to initiate calls on your iPhone from your Mac.</p>
<p>With Cardhop 2, the design has been updated and there are a handful of new features. You can now create widgets with your favorite actions. On iOS, you can add it to your home screen. On macOS, you can access it from the Notification Center. Widgets have been a popular feature of iOS 14 and many users will like that new feature.</p>
<p>If you’re also using Fantastical, you can send a calendar invite to someone else from Cardhop. And if you tend to invite the same group of people to your events, you can create a group in Cardhop. The next time you want to send an invitation, you can create an event with everyone in the group from Cardhop. This is going to be a good alternative to email aliases.</p>
<p>Cardhop can now also generate organizational charts and family trees based on relationships in your contacts. And if you work for a big company with a contact directory, you could easily find the right person to talk with using this new feature.</p>
<p>On iOS, Flexibits has also added a business card scanning feature. You can add contacts just by pointing your phone at a business card. There are many apps that offer that feature already, but now it’s integrated.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157041" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157041" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cardhop-2-iOS.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="733" class="size-full wp-image-2157041" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cardhop-2-iOS.jpg 3882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cardhop-2-iOS.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cardhop-2-iOS.jpg?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cardhop-2-iOS.jpg?resize=768,550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cardhop-2-iOS.jpg?resize=680,487 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cardhop-2-iOS.jpg?resize=1536,1099 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cardhop-2-iOS.jpg?resize=2048,1466 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cardhop-2-iOS.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Flexibits</p></div></p>
<p>Flexibits has been around for 10 years. Originally, the company released new major updates and users had to pay to download the new version. That&#8217;s how independent development companies used to charge for apps.</p>
<p>Last year, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/flexibits-launches-major-fantastical-update/">a new version of Fantastical</a> with a freemium model. New users could download the app for free and would have to pay a subscription of $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year to unlock all features. Existing users could keep using the app for free as all existing features had been unlocked for them.</p>
<p>After switching to this new model, Flexibits released quite a few updates to Fantastical already. For instance, you can now join conference calls quickly with shortcuts in the menu bar and in the app. Fantastical now also supports Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>Flexibits wants to go one step further and create an ecosystem of productivity apps. Cardhop 2 is a free app with a few free features. If you want to unlock everything, you have to subscribe to the same Flexibits Premium subscription.</p>
<p>In other words, the company is bundling premium versions of Fantastical and Cardhop in a single subscription —&nbsp;and the price isn’t changing. Existing Cardhop users who don’t want to subscribe will also keep everything that was available in Cardhop 1 for free.</p>
<p>And if you’re already using Cardhop, it’s nice to see an update. It means that the app is going to be supported going forward. When you rely on an app for your work, it’s better when it’s regularly updated and keeps working as expected years after years. And I suspect many Fantastical users will try out Cardhop thanks to the new Flexibits Premium subscription.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the latest chunky funding round out of Europe, UK-based email security startup, <a href="https://www.tessian.com">Tessian</a>, has closed $65 million in Series C funding. The startup applies machine learning to build individual behavior models for enterprise email use that aims to combat human error by flagging problematic patterns which could signify risky stuff is happening &#8212; such as phishing or data exfiltration.</p>
<p>The Series C round was led by March Capital. Existing investors Accel, Balderton Capital, Latitude and Sequoia Capital also participated, along with new investor Schroder Adveq.</p>
<p>The latest financing brings Tessian&#8217;s total raised to-date to $120M+, and values the company at $500M, it said today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The 2013 founded startup last raised back in January 2019 when it closed a $40M Series B (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/cc-sequoia-tessian/">news that was scooped</a> by former TCer, Steve O&#8217;Hear). Prior to that it grabbed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/18/tessian/">$13M Series A in mid 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Tessian has around 350 global customers at this stage, across the legal, financial services, healthcare and technology sectors &#8212; name-checking the likes of Affirm, Arm, Investec and RealPagem among them.</p>
<p>Over the past year there has been much coverage of the security risks associated with the pandemic-sparked remote working boom, as scores of white collars workers started logging on from home &#8212; expanding the attack surface area which enterprises needed to manage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a risk that&#8217;s been good for Tessian&#8217;s business: The startup says it tripled its Fortune 500-level customer base last year &#8212; &#8220;as enterprises required a solution that could protect them against human layer security threats&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>It says the new funding will go on expanding its platform’s capabilities; helping companies replace their secure email gateways and legacy data loss prevention solutions; and on growing its team (it plans to triple headcount in short order with a particular focus on growing its sales team in North America).</p>
<p>The Series C funds will also support a plan to expand beyond email to offer security protections for other interfaces such as messaging, web and collaboration platforms &#8212; which it says is on the cards &#8220;soon&#8221;.</p>
<p>Commenting on the round in a statement, Jamie Montgomery, co-founder and managing partner at March Capital said: &#8220;Human activity &#8212; whether inadvertent or malicious &#8212; is the leading cause of data breaches. In Tessian, we found a best-in-class solution that automatically stops threats in real-time, without disrupting the normal flow of business. It is rare to hear such overwhelmingly positive feedback from CISOs and business users alike. We came to the same conclusion; Tessian is rapidly emerging as the leader in human layer security for the enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>A number of UK-based AI security startups have been building momentum in recent years, with others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/red-sift/">Red Shift</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/19/senseon-raises-6-4m-to-tackle-cybersecurity-threats-with-an-ai-triangulation-approach/">Senseon</a> also getting traction by applying machine learning to tackle risks.</p>
<p>In April, Cambridge-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/darktrace-raises-50-million-new-funding/">Darktrace</a> &#8212; a category pioneer &#8212; led the pack by floating on the London Stock Exchange where it saw its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/325059d4-a24c-4d4c-9fdb-0214179fc822">shares pop 32%</a> in the IPO debut.</p>
<p>While, last year, the UK government pledged to ramp up R&amp;D spending on AI as part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/uk-to-invest-in-ai-and-cyber-as-part-of-major-defense-spending-hike/">a major defense spending hike</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a world defined by tons of noise and little signal, startups that make it easier for consumers to make a choice just make sense. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/career-karma-series-a/">Career Karma helps students</a> pick a tech bootcamp, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/stackin-raises-12-6-series-b-to-help-millennials-navigate-the-crowded-fintech-space/">Stackin’ helps millennials</a> navigate the world of neobank and savings apps, and a new Boston-based company is helping doctors keep track of the most up-to-date medical devices on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://acuitymd.com/about/">AcuityMD</a>, founded in 2019 by Mike Monovoukas, Lee Smith, and Robert Coe, is an enterprise software company that wants to unlock the often siloed world of medical device data. And to do so, it landed a $7 million seed round this week, led by Benchmark.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Benchmark GP Eric Vishria will join AcuityMD’s board of directors. Ajax Health, which <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ajax-health-raises-100-million-to-advance-innovations-in-medtech-300927456.html">closed $100 million in 2019</a> to back medtech companies, also participated in the round. With seed capital, Monovoukas said that AcuityMD plans to double its eight-person team by the end of the year, and invest heavily in one specific area: “product, product, product.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AcuityMD is a data platform that tracks the entire medical device lifecycle &#8211; from the sale of an item to a patient’s outcome after a surgery. It aggregates industry and market data on individual medical devices to give a metadata of sorts on a singular product.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2157014 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_06.png" alt="" width="828" height="537" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_06.png 1468w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_06.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_06.png?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_06.png?resize=768,498 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_06.png?resize=680,441 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_06.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></p>
<p>“There are 1000s of products being launched each year and so it&#8217;s almost impossible for a surgeon, after they&#8217;ve graduated fellowship or residency to keep track of the latest and greatest medical technology out there,” Monovoukas said. “We view this as a software and coordination problem, where you have all this data out there and it’s inefficient in getting to the decision-maker.”</p>
<p>Monovoukas experienced noticed inefficiencies in medical device management first-hand when a family member needed to go through a series of surgeries.</p>
<p>“What was fascinating to me is that the manufacturer holds a lot of information about what to use, [and] sometimes that didn&#8217;t get disseminated to the right surgeon at the right point of time,” he said. “The fundamental realization I had was that the information flow in this industry was a little bit broken&#8230;It wasn&#8217;t an issue of being competent doctors or surgeons, but a lack of information transfer, which is kind of crazy in a data driven world.”</p>
<p>So, the entrepreneur, who worked at Bain &amp; Company as well as a medical device company prior, began thinking of how to use data to make medical devices more responsive to long-term patient outcomes. While doctor’s were a key stakeholder set to benefit from more information, AcuityMD’s team landed on selling to device manufacturers as their key customer.</p>
<p>Now, part of that reason might be because hospitals and doctors are notoriously a pain to sell to. The other reason, Monovoukas tells me, is that performance data on medical devices is a key signal that Sales teams within manufacturers can use to beef up, and better target, their pitches. The co-founder explained how manufacturers want visibility into the market for their products, ranging from data on where high volume surgeons might need one of their devices to long-term outcomes on certain devices over time.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2157013" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_01.png" alt="" width="521" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_01.png 1245w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_01.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_01.png?resize=300,269 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_01.png?resize=768,690 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_01.png?resize=680,611 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ACU_Image_01.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px" /></p>
<p>The data could help a sales rep pre-emptively figure out how targeting 10 surgeons for a specific product impacts the manufacturer financially and in context with the rest of the market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AcuityMD is teeing itself up to become a real-time database of medical devices. Long-term, it could position itself as a Same Day Shipping service connecting manufacturers to surgeons in high-demand and vital transactions. Monovaukus says that while logistics and inventory is a “visceral” problem for the medical device industry, it doesn’t have a solution in place yet. He could see the startup getting to a point in the future where they can predict inventory levels required at each facility &#8211; similar to how some companies already like <a href="https://www.medinas.com/">Medinas</a>, co-founded by Chloe Alpert, operate and manage within hospital systems.</p>
<p>But for now, AcuityMD thinks it can best use its platform and millions of venture-backed capital outside the provider system. It sources a lot of its data on hospitals and surgeons from Medicare CMS and insurance companies, so leaving no action required on the end of providers.</p>
<p>A challenge will be making sure those data sources are good enough to extract true signals. The startup is still defining good.</p>
<p>“I heard someone once say that any digital health company eventually becomes a healthcare data company,” he said. “We’re approaching things a little bit differently.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce is on the rise, but that also means the risk, and occurrence, of e-commerce fraud is, too. Now, <a href="https://www.forter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forter</a>, one of the startups building a business to tackle that malicious activity, has closed $300 million in funding &#8212; a sign both of the size of the issue, and its success in tackling it to date.</p>
<p>The new funding, a Series F, values Forter at $3 billion &#8212; notable not least because the funding is coming only about <a href="https://www.forter.com/blog/expansion-fraud-fighting-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six months since Forter&#8217;s previous round</a>, a $125 million Series E that valued it at over $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>Tiger Global Management is leading this latest equity infusion, with new backers Third Point Ventures and Adage Capital Management, and existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, March Capital, NewView Capital, Salesforce Ventures and Scale Venture Partners, also involved.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The plan will be to use to the money to expand Forter &#8212; founded in Tel Aviv and now based in New York &#8212; geographically, to bring more functionality into its product, and to look at adjacent areas where Forter might expand its capabilities, either organically or by way of acquisition.</p>
<p>Forter today focuses mainly on identifying fraud at the point of transaction and building an AI-based platform that &#8220;learns&#8221; more behaviors to improve its accuracy; it also builds models that keep more people transacting and helps bring down the number of &#8220;false positives&#8221; where activity that appears suspicious actually is not.</p>
<p>One area on its roadmap for expansion is remediation after the fraud occurs, said Liron Damri, Forter&#8217;s co-founder and president.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our vision is to serve the merchant as the go-to trusted partner for everything, so remediation is definitely on our roadmap,&#8221; he said of potential acquisition targets.</p>
<p>Damri, who co-founded the company with Michael Reitblat, CEO, and Alon Shemesh, chief analyst, said in an interview that the startup &#8212; which works with some 350 large customers like Priceline and Instacart and a growing number of service providers like FreedomPay and Flutterwave, altogether seeing some $250 billion dollars worth of transactions globally last year &#8212; wasn&#8217;t proactively looking for more money.</p>
<p>&#8220;All we wanted to do was go back to run the company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But in the past six months we’ve seen such a great momentum, doubling revenue and ARR, and seeing our customer volumes grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>That led to a lot of investors proactively reaching out and ask questions, he continued. He described Tiger as a &#8220;kingmaker&#8221; in the category of e-commerce, so it was an easy decision to make, and gave it the &#8220;gas&#8221; it needed to take its next growth steps.</p>
<p>E-commerce has been one of the major technology growth stories of the last year, fueled by a rush of consumers and businesses playing out their lives online at a time when it has been harder, and in some cases impossible, to transact in person.</p>
<p>While we have definitely seen a lot of growth, and growing sophistication, in the number of tools on the market to combat cybercrime, it&#8217;s in some ways an ouroboros of a problem: the more transactions that are made, the more there are that need to be monitored for suspicious activity. And in any case fraud in e-commerce is not exactly going away. It&#8217;s estimated that it will cost retailers <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210425005002/en/Juniper-Research-eCommerce-Losses-to-Online-Payment-Fraud-to-Exceed-20-Billion-Annually-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some $20 billion in 2021</a> and is always on the rise.</p>
<p>Forter got its start in 2013 focusing first on monitoring activity on sites wherever customers happened to be to identify suspicious behavior &#8212; a sign that it might be a bot or someone on an illicit spending spree racking up a lot of items in quick succession &#8212; with the bigger concept being to build a network of activity from which to learn and help make more informed decisions over time.</p>
<p>In more recent years, the essence of the issue has expanded somewhat, and also grown more sophisticated. As companies have grown their businesses to reach beyond early adopters and core audiences, and into a more &#8220;omnichannel&#8221; environment beyond basic check-outs on their own sites, so too have the kinds of consumers coming to shop.</p>
<p>This has meant that traditional &#8220;signals&#8221; of legitimate buyers no longer were the same as before &#8212; a predicament that really rose in profile in the last year, as many newcomers came to e-commerce for the first time during the pandemic. In fact, Damri told me that in 2020 there were seven times more &#8220;newcomers&#8221; to sites than in 2019, huge growth of that segment.</p>
<p>So with most of the flagging of suspicious activity coming up at the point of transaction, Forter expanded to analyzing activity there.</p>
<p>As with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/stripe-acquires-bouncer-will-integrate-its-card-authentication-into-the-radar-fraud-detection-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent acquisition of Stripe&#8217;s, Bouncer</a>, to build out its own anti-fraud product, a large part of Forter&#8217;s attention these days is on providing tools to companies to identify suspicious purchasing, but even more than that, to make sure that the many occasions that might look suspicious are not, to help reduce the amount of &#8220;cart abandonment&#8221; and increase conversions.</p>
<p>The old way of doing things, Damri said, involved &#8220;thousands of rules and applying suspicion on everyone. You were guilty unless proved otherwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using its AI engine and a some risk analysis (not unlike the kind that, say, an insurance or loan provider might apply in their businesses), Forter turned the proposition on its head.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to approve as much as possible. We wanted to gradually increase the trust you have of your own customers. We changed the sentiment and approach&#8230; especially in areas that were neglected, such as those who saw significant changes in life,&#8221; Damri said. &#8220;This was extremely important as Covid-19 hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forter&#8217;s risk tolerance model, it seems, has so far proven out. Damri said that its algorithms applied reduce the total number of declines by 80%, but also reduce the number of chargebacks &#8212; one indicator of a mistake &#8212; by 60%.</p>
<p>This implies that it&#8217;s blocking more of the &#8220;wrong&#8221; kind of purchases, and letting through more of the legitimate ones.  (That is, he pointed out, in addition to a few bad actors Forter intentionally lets buy things, just to learn how they operate. Damri referred to this as &#8220;paid-tuition.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Risk-based approvals, coupled with algorithms to learn what is truly bad, has resonated with customers, and investors.</p>
<p>“With the unprecedented rate of digital transformation and the fierce competition in creating the slickest user experience, superior fraud prevention plays an ever more critical role in e-commerce revenue growth&#8221; said John Curtius, a partner at Tiger Global Management, in a statement. &#8220;After we talked with dozens of customers of every relevant solution in this space, it was very clear to us that Forter is the clear leader in performance and scale.”</p>
<p>“As a longtime investor, it’s been incredible to see Forter’s ascent,” added Ravi Viswanathan, NewView Capital. “It’s a testament to the leadership team’s vision and execution in allowing merchants to provide the seamless experiences customers expect and to be able to accept as many transactions as possible, while still accurately identifying and blocking fraud.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Young startup Atlan, which has built a SaaS data collaboration platform and is courting customers in international markets, has now won the trust of some high-profile investors.</p>
<p>Atlan said on Tuesday it has raised $16 million in its Series A financing round that was led by Insight Partners. Bob Muglia (former CEO of Snowflake), Bob Moore and Jake Stei (founders of Stitch) and Auren Hoffman (founder of Safegraph and Liveramp), and Akshay Kothari (co-founder and COO of Notion) also invested in the round, as did existing investors Sequoia Surge and Waterbridge Ventures.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; which was founded in India and now has teams across the U.S., Singapore, Philippines, and Nigeria &#8212; operates an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/atlan-socialcops/">eponymous data stack that brings together diverse data from internal and external sources</a> such as Snowflake and Databricks to one interface and allows teams to collaborate easily.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The thesis behind Atlan is that the way most people in enterprises deal with data is inefficient. This is because of the fundamental diversity of people involved &#8212; scientists, analysts, engineers, business users &#8212; who all have their own skill sets and tool preferences.</p>
<p>This makes collaboration between the teams a challenge as they struggle to find the right data at the right time, for instance.</p>
<p>It’s a challenge that the founders of Atlan &#8212; Prukalpa Sankar and Varun Banka (pictured above) &#8212; faced first hand at their first venture, SocialCops. The venture was behind several data science for social good projects including India&#8217;s National Data Platform and SDGs global monitoring in collaboration with the United Nations.</p>
<p><a href="https://atlan.com">Atlan</a> started out as an internal tool to help the data team at SocialCops carry out projects more efficiently, before being opened up to teams around the world.</p>
<p>“We are reimagining the human experience with data &#8212; why can’t data assets be shared as easily as sharing a link on Google Docs, or if Google Analytics can tell you usage on a website, why can’t we do the same for our data?” said Sankar.</p>
<p>Teddie Wardi, Managing Director at Insight Partners, likened Atlan’s relevance to companies just as Figma is crucial to design teams and Github is important to engineering teams.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1851098" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1851098" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1851098 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Atlan-Discovery-2.jpg?w=680" alt="Atlan Discovery 2" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Atlan-Discovery-2.jpg 5184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Atlan-Discovery-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Atlan-Discovery-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Atlan-Discovery-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Atlan-Discovery-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Atlan-Discovery-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Atlan-Discovery-2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Atlan-Discovery-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1851098" class="wp-caption-text">Dashboard of Atlan (Atlan)</p></div></p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Sankar said more than 60% of Atlan&#8217;s clients today are in the U.S., and the market will be a big focus as the startup scales. She declined to reveal the number of clients the startup has amassed, but said the startup has grown 16X times in the last two quarters.</p>
<p>Some of its clients include giants such as Unilever, Scripps Health, Postman, and Techstyle, one of the world’s largest membership-based fashion firms with a diverse portfolio of brands including Fabletics, Savage X Fenty, JustFab, FabKids, and ShoeDazzle.</p>
<p>“As we rolled-out our modern data platform, we were looking for a product that made it easier to democratize our data and was less dependent on someone central answering each individual analyst’s questions on a one-off basis. Legacy solutions in the market were tailored to legacy systems and approaches where IT or a single data stewardship team owns the data,&#8221; said Danielle Boeglin Ragan, Vice President of Data &amp; Analytics at Techstyle, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Atlan was the only solution that was built for a collaborative, bottom-up approach. With native integrations with our modern analytics stack like Snowflake and Tableau, Atlan was very easy to set-up &#8211; we had all of our data sources flowing within the first day.”</p>
<p>The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand its team of 40 people across marketing, sales, and customer success, said Banka.</p>
<p>“Atlan has become a valuable resource for the data team to get context about data. In the long run, for our data democratization vision, we see the entire organization working towards analyzing the data and taking actions in a coherent, seamless fashion. Having Atlan in the mix of our toolchains opens the possibility of providing data context at scale, thereby enabling the entire org to be data aware and data driven.” said Prudhvi Vasa, Analytics Leader at Postman, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York City-based vertical farming startup Bowery Farming this week has announced a $300 million Series C. The round, which brings its total funding north of $472 million, values the company at $2.3 billion.</p>
<p>Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company led the beefy round, with participation from existing investors GV (formerly Google Ventures), General Catalyst, GGV Capital, Temasek and Groupe Artémis. Amplo and Gaingels participated, as well, along with some celebrity individual investors, including Lewis Hamilton, Chris Paul, Natalie Portman, José Andrés and Justin Timberlake.</p>

<p>The funding comes as Bowery has experienced some impressive real-world growth, touting a 750% increase in availability since January of last year. If anything, the company appears to have thrived during the pandemic. Its vertically farmed produce is now available in 850 grocery stores, including big-name chains like Albertsons (incl. Safeway and Acme), Giant Food, Walmart and Whole Foods.</p>

<p>Amazon Fresh has also provided a sizable e-commerce footprint &#8212; a big must during the pandemic-fueled shutdowns of the past year.</p>
<p>“This infusion of new capital from Fidelity, other new investors, and the additional support of our long-term investor partners is acknowledgement of the critical need for new solutions to our current agricultural system, and the enormous economic opportunity that comes with supporting our mission,” CEO Irving Fain said in a release. “This funding not only fuels our continued expansion but the ongoing development of our proprietary technology, which sits at the core of our business and our ability to rapidly and efficiently scale towards an increasingly important opportunity in front of us.”</p>

<p>The company says the massive windfall will go toward expanding its indoor farms to additional locations in the United States, as well as investing in headcount and R&amp;D. Included in the former is a new site located in an industrial area in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which Bowery says will be its largest to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Herman and Adam Gefkovicz </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched Jumpstart in 2017 with a clear mission: to make the world more equitable via a more fair and balanced hiring process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company released its “Diversity Recruitment Platform” in July of 2018 with the aim of helping people earlier in their careers get a “jumpstart&#8221; via technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, the startup’s mission has evolved beyond helping college grads to helping all employees &#8212; regardless of career stage &#8212; get a fair shot at jobs. And it’s doing that by teaming up with hundreds of companies &#8212; such as Airbnb, Bloomberg, Coinbase, Samsung, Lyft, Pinterest, Plaid, Roblox, Audible, Headspace and Stripe &#8212; to help them hire a more diverse pool of candidates.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FcNivBPIxm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/jumpstart-nabs-8-5m-led-by-sequoia-for-a-recruitment-platform-that-aims-to-increase-diversity/">Jumpstart nabs $8.5M led by Sequoia for a recruitment platform that aims to increase diversity</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jumpstart nabs $8.5M led by Sequoia for a recruitment platform that aims to increase diversity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/jumpstart-nabs-8-5m-led-by-sequoia-for-a-recruitment-platform-that-aims-to-increase-diversity/embed/#?secret=FcNivBPIxm" data-secret="FcNivBPIxm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand has accelerated exponentially, and the San Francisco-based startup saw its revenue grow “3x” in 2020 compared to 2019, although execs declined to provide hard figures. Considering its broadened focus, Jumpstart has rebranded to </span><a href="http://canvas.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canvas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and announced today that it has closed on $20 million in funding. Early Stripe employee and angel investor Lachy Groom and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia Capital co-led the round, which included participation from Four Rivers Capital. The raise brings Canvas&#8217; total raised to $32.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew we were only scratching the surface of our vision, and knew we had a solution that could reimagine diversity hiring for everyone,” said co-founder and CEO Ben Herman. “You know how everyone has a CRM? We believe every company should have a DRP, which is a diversity recruitment platform. That&#8217;s the category we want to create and we want to be the largest in that space.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt that the Black Lives Matter movement in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder helped, well jumpstart, the company’s efforts. Canvas is able to sell its offering as more companies “are being held accountable for their promises of equity and hiring diverse talent,” Herman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hiring diverse teams is not only a matter of corporate social responsibility,” he added. “Diversity and inclusion are a competitive advantage and strategic priority for every company in today’s landscape. We believe representation is a huge part of what we stand for. So we want everyone to be able to create their own canvas, and to be able to paint their own picture.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canvas describes its SaaS offering as a “fully virtual” recruiting platform that is based on self-reported data. About 87% of candidates on its platform disclose their demographic information (which it says is 7x the industry standard), according to the startup. Canvas also says it gives companies the ability to narrow down the priority groups and talent it wants to focus on by filtering over 75+ self-reported candidate data points. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup claims that it’s different from others in the space for that reason, among other features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unlike other solutions that might utilize inferred data that could be inaccurate or illegal, Canvas helps create a more accurate data set to identify diverse candidates, helping to solve the core problem of talent discovery,” Herman said. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On the diversity front, 2020 may prove a tipping point&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/on-the-diversity-front-2020-may-prove-a-tipping-point/embed/#?secret=GCHOcmhcUX" data-secret="GCHOcmhcUX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also &#8212; unlike some diversity hiring platforms &#8212; does not rely on artificial intelligence, a fact that Herman is actually proud of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t believe that AI is the future. It&#8217;s not about getting someone&#8217;s gender or ethnicity based off of their name, or to inform the hiring decision without candidates knowing,” Herman told TechCrunch. “It&#8217;s all about how to empower talent to self-identify&#8230;We want to enable the talent to own their data, and truly be able to represent themselves in unique ways. That’s not leveraging AI.”</span></p>
<p>Canvas also gives companies a way to design, promote and run events, such as webinars, aimed at hiring diverse talent.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also wants to get to a place where companies are working together “to complete the diversity data gap.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem is about accessibility, and so we want to give equal access to anyone and everyone &#8212; from all companies to all candidates,” Herman said. “And so that is really the most important part of what we are creating &#8212; the ability for companies to share data.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how does it measure its own success? Canvas claims that 56% of all hires on the Canvas platform are made from underrepresented groups (URGs), and that it helps employers achieve a 30% reduction in time to hire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herman is not your typical startup founder, having dropped out of high school and starting his own recruitment agency at the age of 21. His tenacity is one of the things that attracted Sequoia partner and Canvas board member Mike Vernal to back the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we first met Ben, it was clear that he was&#8230;a natural-born talent scout,” Vernal told TechCrunch. “He thought there was a better way for the industry to work &#8212; one where companies and recruiters were more collaborative and used technology to build stronger, more diverse teams.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its initial investment in the company, Vernal believes building diverse teams has never been more important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those teams create better products, make stronger business decisions, and it’s just the right thing to do,” he said. “We believe companies can do a better job sourcing underrepresented talent using Canvas than on their own.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canvas plans to use its new capital to expand the product into other industries and verticals beyond technology and continue to address the recruiting process for later stages of people&#8217;s careers. The company currently has 70 employees and expects to have 100 by the end of 2021.</span></p>
<p>As mentioned above, hiring diverse talent is becoming a bigger priority for big tech companies (such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/hp-outlines-ambitious-diversity-goals/">HP</a>) and startups alike. Earlier this year, diverse hiring startup SeekOut <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/seekout-raises-65m/">raised $65 million</a>. The company has built out a database with hundreds of millions of profiles using its AI-powered talent search engine and “deep interactive analytics.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sinch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinch</a> &#8212; a Twilio competitor based out of Sweden that provides a suite of services to companies to build communications and specifically &#8220;customer engagement&#8221; into their services by way of APIs &#8212; has been on a steady funding and acquisitions march in the last several months to scale its business, and today comes the latest development on that front.</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sinch-ab-publ-sinch-completes-220300243.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has raised another $1.1 billion in a direct share issue, with significant chunks of that funding coming from Temasek and SoftBank, in order to continue building its business.</p>
<p>Specifically, the company &#8212; which is traded on the Swedish stock exchange Nasdaq Stockhom and currently has a market cap of around $11 billion &#8212; said that it was making a new share issue of 7,232,077 shares at SEK 1,300 per share, raising approximately SEK 9.4 billion (equivalent to around $1.1 billion at current rates).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sinch said that investors buying the shares included &#8220;selected Swedish and international investors of institutional character,&#8221; highlighting that Temasek and SB Management (a direct subsidiary of SoftBank Group Corp.) would  respectively take SEK 2,085 million and 0.7 million shares. This works out to a $252 million investment for Temasek, and $110 million for SoftBank.</p>
<p>SoftBank last December took a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/softbank-takes-a-690m-stake-in-cloud-based-swedish-crm-company-sinch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$690 million stake in Sinch</a> (when it was valued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/sinch-inteliquent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at $8.2 billion). That was just ahead of the company scooping</a> up Inteliquent in the U.S. in January for $1.14 billion to move a little closer to Twilio&#8217;s home turf.</p>
<p>Sinch is not saying much more beyond the announcement of the share issue for now, except that the raise was made to shore up its financial position ahead of more M&amp;A activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinch has an active M&amp;A-agenda and a track record of successful acquisitions, making [it] well placed to drive continued consolidation of the messaging and [communications platform as a service, CPaaS] market,&#8221; it said in a short statement. &#8220;Furthermore, the increased financial flexibility that the directed new share issue entails further strengthens the Company’s position as a relevant and competitive buyer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is profitable and active in more than 40 markets, and <a href="https://investors.sinch.com/static-files/6d18a742-dd9f-40af-a973-ff69163aa56b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO Oscar Werner said in Sinch&#8217;s most recent earnings report</a> that in the last quarter alone that its communications APIs &#8212; which works across  channels like SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, chatbots, voice and video &#8212; handled 40 billion mobile messages.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Notably, its strategy has a strong foothold in the U.S. because of the Inteliquent acquisition. It will be interesting to see how and if it continues to consolidate to build up market share in that part of the world, or whether it focuses elsewhere, given the heft of two very strong Asian investors now in its stable. </span></p>
<p>“Becoming a leader in the U.S. voice market is key to establish Sinch as the leading global cloud communications platform,” said Werner in January.</p>
<p>While Sinch has focused much of its business, like Twilio, around an API-based model focused on communications services, its acquisition of Inteliquent also gave it access to a large, legacy Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) product set, aimed at telcos to provide off-net call termination (when a call is handed off from one carrier to another) and toll-free numbers.</p>
<p>Tellingly, when Sinch acquired Inteliquent, the two divisions each accounted for roughly half of its total business, but the CPaaS business is growing at twice the rate of IaaS, which points to how Sinch views the future for itself, too.</p>
