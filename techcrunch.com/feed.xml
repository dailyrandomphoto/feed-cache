										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain and fleet management solutions company <a href="https://ryder.com/expertise/videos/embark">Ryder</a> is partnering with yet another autonomous trucking company. On Thursday, Ryder announced its plans to help Embark launch a nationwide network of up to 100 transfer points that will be owned and operated by the autonomous trucking developer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Ryder’s third public partnership with autonomous trucking companies. It recently announced plans that are currently underway to <a href="https://ryder.com/expertise/videos/embark">help </a></span><a href="https://ryder.com/expertise/videos/embark"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waymo Via </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ryder.com/expertise/videos/embark">scale its autonomous trucking business</a> by helping with standardized fleet maintenance and management. Ryder is also working with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TuSimple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/tusimples-self-driving-truck-network-takes-shape-with-ryder-partnership/">leverage its own facilities as terminals for the startup</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re on the cutting edge and really beginning to understand that AV could have a pretty significant role in the future of transportation logistics, so we want to get in as early as possible and start working with these companies that seem to be dominating the market with their technologies,” Karen Jones, Ryder’s EVP for new product innovation, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Ryder has been in talks with other AV companies like Kodiak, Aurora and Plus, Jones said no other deals are in the pipeline. Jones says Ryder is hoping to learn and grow through the different use cases its existing partnerships provide, as well as come up with a replicable transfer hub model that will help the company go to market faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think as we move this technology forward there&#8217;s still a lot of unknowns about how to maintain, how to service and how to operate,” said Jones. “Ryder is a natural fit to partner with because we have huge facilities for maintenance, and then we also have our supply chain and logistics business. We are a real operator that knows how these facilities and the complexities of getting vehicles in and out for delivery to larger facilities work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of its partnership with Embark, Ryder will provide yard operations, maintenance and fleet management. It will also play an advisory role on Embark’s network of strategically located transfer points where freight is moved from driverless long-haul trucks to driver-controlled trucks for first- and last-mile delivery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryder is helping Embark to understand what’s required at the facilities and cooperating with Embark’s third-party partners who will either be constructing or locating sites for these facilities, says Jones. At the start, the companies will select sites in key freight markets in California, Arizona, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida through which Embark will be able to begin operations early next year in preparation for a larger commercial launch in 2024. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2204206" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2204206" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2204206" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Embark-Coverage-Map.png" alt="" width="1024" height="557" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Embark-Coverage-Map.png 2504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Embark-Coverage-Map.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Embark-Coverage-Map.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Embark-Coverage-Map.png?resize=768,418 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Embark-Coverage-Map.png?resize=680,370 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Embark-Coverage-Map.png?resize=1536,835 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Embark-Coverage-Map.png?resize=2048,1114 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Embark-Coverage-Map.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2204206" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Embark</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autonomous companies often choose Sun Belt regions to begin operations because it’s rare to have to account for inclement weather patterns like snow and sleet, making the environment optimal for testing. But over the next five years, Embark and Ryder aim to work with a network of real estate operators to open 100 Embark transfer points across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Embark, which recently</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/autonomous-trucking-startup-embark-to-go-public-in-5-2b-spac-deal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced plans to go public via a SPAC deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, moves freight for companies like HP and Budweiser makers AB inBev, as well as Knight Swift Transportation, Werner Enterprises and other “top 25 U.S. truckload carriers,” according to CEO Alex Rodrigues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodrigues says Embark’s current freight partnerships are either pilots or smaller scale versions of what the company plans to launch in the future. The company has a fleet of 16 trucks today that operate on highways with a human safety operator in the front seat just in case, but usually, the driver does not have to take over, even if the AV encounters a new scenario. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating on highways means building out a network of off-highway transfer hubs, which is actually pretty essential, even though it will require a lot of capital and time to scale. TuSimple, by comparison, is using existing Ryder locations and retrofitting them to serve as TuSimple terminals, rather than building out new terminals, like what Embark is doing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waymo Via is also building its own hubs, and Ryder’s fleet maintenance, inspections and roadside assistance will help the autonomous trucking arm of Waymo scale those sites as well as maximize vehicle uptime and reliability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ryder lends its varied capabilities to all of these different use cases, it is able to consider its own potential in the AV space, and not just in the logistics of it all. Jones said the company is open to operating an autonomous fleet one day if it makes sense to do so on behalf of a customer, and is also very entrenched in its first- and last-mile delivery services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a number of spaces for Ryder to play as the whole AV initiative evolves, but our first foray into this is really servicing and beginning to understand the technology, as well as the requirements for operating hubs,” said Jones. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a message posted on an internal employee message board today, Apple said that it was monitoring the legal challenges to what it refers to as the &#8220;uniquely restrictive abortion law&#8221; that was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/10/us/politics/texas-abortion-law-facts.html">recently passed in Texas</a>. Apple confirmed the authenticity of the message to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are actively monitoring the legal proceedings challenging the uniquely restrictive abortion law in Texas,&#8221; the unsigned memo reads. &#8220;In the meantime, we want to remind you that our benefits at Apple are comprehensive, and that they allow our employees to travel out-of-state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new law essentially bans the vast majority of abortions from occurring in the state and is <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/572526-judge-schedules-hearing-on-doj-request-to-halt-texas-abortion-law">currently being legally challenged</a> in a variety of ways. A series of companies in and outside of tech have taken public stances against the law in recent days. Salesforce has offered to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/salesforce-offers-to-relocate-employees-from-texas-after-abortion-bill.html">relocate any employees in Texas</a> that are concerned about the ability to access reproductive care in the state post-enactment of the law. Offers to cover travel expenses for employees that needed care out of the state <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-companies-wade-into-abortion-politics-in-texas/">were set up by Match Group and Bumble</a>, both Texas-based companies.</p>
<p>The message does not detail any further actions that Apple is taking to actively oppose the bill but says that Apple supports &#8220;our employees’ rights to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple is a large employer in Texas where it has a campus of thousands in Austin, as well as a manufacturing plant and many Apple stores across the state.</p>
<p>The full text of the message is below:</p>
<blockquote><p>A message about women’s reproductive health care</p>
<p>At Apple, we support our employees’ rights to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive health.</p>
<p>We are actively monitoring the legal proceedings challenging the uniquely restrictive abortion law in Texas. In the meantime, we want to remind you that our benefits at Apple are comprehensive, and that they allow our employees to travel out-of-state for medical care if it is unavailable in their home state. If you need help in navigating your care or that of your dependents, your health plan carrier can confidentially assist you.</p>
<p>Your health and well-being remain our highest priority, and we will continue to do all that we can to ensure that you and your families have access to the care that Apple provides.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is extending the shutdown of its Orion Assembly Plant until at least mid-October as a result of a battery pack shortage related to the recently announced Chevy Bolt EV and EUV safety recall.<u></u><u></u> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/gm-extends-its-halt-of-bolt-production-through-mid-october">Bloomberg</a> first reported that the company intends to idle its plant through the week of October 11.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“These most recent scheduling adjustments are being driven by the continued parts shortages caused by semiconductor supply constraints from international markets experiencing COVID-related restrictions,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;We remain confident in our team’s ability to continue finding creative solutions to minimize the impact on our highest-demand and capacity constrained vehicles. Although the situation remains complex and very fluid, GM continues to prioritize full-size truck production which remains in high demand.”</p>
<p>Last week, GM announced the shutdown of the Michigan assembly plant, which began on August 23<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-another-two-weeks/">, would extend to September 20</a>, but it&#8217;s clear that the company has not yet found a solution to the causes of delay. In the meantime, GM said it would continue to work with its battery supplier, LG Chem, to update its manufacturing processes and production schedules.</p>

<p>In July, the company began recalls for its Chevy Bolts due to fire risks, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nhtsa-urges-some-chevy-bolt-owners-to-park-their-car-away-from-home-citing-fire-risk/">National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration has recommended</a> customers park their vehicles away from homes and other vehicles as a precaution.</p>
<p>Last week, GM said production on its full-size trucks and full-size SUVs would begin by this week, but chip shortages have also caused GM to announce slowing production at five other assembly plants in North America. Some, like the Fort Wayne Assembly and Silao Assembly plants, which produce the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 models, have already ramped up to full capacity as of September 13 after being briefly impacted by the global semiconductor shortage, GM said.</p>
<p>The Lansing Delta Township Assembly plant in Michigan, which builds the Chevrolet Traverse and the Buick Enclave, will add an additional week of downtime the week of September 27 and is expected to resume production the week of October 4. The plant has been shut down since July 19. Downtime for the Chevrolet Camaro and Cadillac Black Wing have also been extended through the week of the 27th, as well as previously announced downtime for Cadillac CT4 and CT5 production. Production on the Camaro has been down since September 13, and on the CT4 and CT5 since May 10.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Production of the Equinox, Blazer and GMC Terrain have been pushed out through the week of October 11, as well, which are produced at the CAMI Assembly plant in Canada and San Luis Potosi Assembly and Ramos Assembly in Mexico. Production of the Blazer and Equinox have been down since August 23 and August 16, respectively.</p>
<p>Cadillac XT4 production, which has been down since February 8, will resume at Fairfax Assembly in Kansas next week. GM said production of the Chevrolet Malibu, which is also at Fairfax and has been down since February 8, will remain down through the week of October 25.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is in the hot seat again.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">published a powerful multi-part series on the company this week, </a>drawing from internal documents on everything from the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=article_inline">secretive practice of whitelisting celebrities</a> to its knowledge that Instagram is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">taking a serious toll on the mental health of teen girls</a>.</p>
<p>The flurry of investigative pieces makes it clear that what Facebook says in public doesn&#8217;t always reflect the company&#8217;s knowledge on known issues behind the scenes. The revelations still managed to shock even though Facebook has been playing dumb about the various social ills it has sown for years. (Remember when Mark Zuckerberg dismissed the notion that Facebook influenced the 2016 election as &#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/10/13594558/mark-zuckerberg-election-fake-news-trump">crazy</a>?&#8221;) Facebook&#8217;s longstanding PR playbook is to hide its dangers, denying knowledge of its darker impacts on society publicly, even as research spells them out internally.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all well and good until someone gets ahold of the internal research.</p>
<p>One of the biggest revelations from the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">WSJ&#8217;s report:</a> The company knows that Instagram poses serious dangers to mental health in teenage girls. An internal research slide from 2019 acknowledged that &#8220;We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls&#8221; — a shocking admission for a company charging ahead with <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13">plans to expand</a> to even younger and more vulnerable age groups.</p>
<p>As recently as May, Instagram&#8217;s Adam Mosseri dismissed concerns around the app&#8217;s negative impact on teens as &#8220;quite small.&#8221;</p>
<p>But internally, the picture told a different story. According to the WSJ, from 2019 to 2021, the company conducted a thorough deep dive into teen mental health, including online surveys, diary studies, focus groups and large-scale questionnaires.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to one internal slide, the findings showed that 32% of teenage girls reported that Instagram made them have a worse body image. Of research participants who experienced suicidal thoughts, 13% of British teens and 6% of American teens directly linked their interest in killing themselves to Instagram.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,&#8221; another internal slide stated. &#8220;This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the WSJ report, Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-and-blackburn-announce-probe-into-facebook-coverup-of-its-platforms-negative-impact-on-teens_children">announced a probe</a> into Facebook&#8217;s lack of transparency around internal research showing that Instagram poses serious and even lethal danger to teens. The Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security will launch the investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in touch with a Facebook whistleblower and will use every resource at our disposal to investigate what Facebook knew and when they knew it – including seeking further documents and pursuing witness testimony,&#8221; Senators Blackburn and Blumenthal wrote. &#8220;The Wall Street Journal’s blockbuster reporting may only be the tip of the iceberg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blackburn and Blumenthal weren&#8217;t the only U.S. lawmakers alarmed by the new report. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL), and Lori Trahan (D-MA) <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fb_wsj_report.pdf">sent Facebook their own letter</a> demanding that the company walk away from its plan to launch Instagram for kids. &#8220;Children and teens are uniquely vulnerable populations online, and these findings paint a clear and devastating picture of Instagram as an app that poses significant threats to young people’s wellbeing,&#8221; the lawmakers wrote.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Facebook gobbled up Instagram because they were too chicken to compete against them fair &amp; square for younger users.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In May, a group of 44 state attorneys general wrote to Instagram to encourage the company to abandon its plans to bring Instagram to kids under the age of 13. “It appears that Facebook is not responding to a need, but instead creating one, as this platform appeals primarily to children who otherwise do not or would not have an Instagram account,” the group of attorneys general wrote. They warned that an Instagram for kids would be “harmful for myriad reasons.”</p>
<p>In April, a collection of the same Democratic lawmakers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/markey-letter-instagram-kids/">expressed “serious concerns”</a> about Instagram&#8217;s potential impact on the well-being of young users. That same month, a coalition of consumer advocacy organizations also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/consumer-groups-and-child-development-experts-petition-facebook-to-drop-instagram-for-kids-plan/"> demanded that the company reconsider</a> launching a version of Instagram for kids.</p>
<p>According to the documents obtained by the WSJ, all of those concerns look extremely valid. In spite of extensive internal research and their deeply troubling findings, Facebook has downplayed its knowledge publicly, even as regulators regularly pressed the company for what it really knows.</p>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s Mosseri may have made matters worse Thursday when he made a less than flattering <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1438535203186634754">analogy between social media platforms and vehicles</a>. &#8220;We know that more people die than would otherwise because of car accidents, but by and large, cars create way more value in the world than they destroy,&#8221; Mosseri <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/recode-media/id1080467174?i=1000535489497">told Peter Kafka on Recode&#8217;s media podcast</a>. &#8220;And I think social media is similar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mosseri dismissed any comparison between social media and drugs or cigarettes in spite of social media&#8217;s well-researched addictive effects, likening social platforms to the auto industry instead. Naturally, the company&#8217;s many critics jumped on the car comparison, pointing to their widespread lethality and the fact that the auto industry is heavily regulated — unlike social media.</p>

<p>Additionally, the service includes Rivian off-Roadside Assistance, additional coverage that will see the company send a recovery vehicle to you if you get stuck out on the trail or need an emergency battery recharge. The company also promised to add additional perks in the future, including new drive modes, community meetups and in-cabin content. Each new Rivian vehicle will come with 12 months of free access to the service. After that, you’ll need to pay to continue enjoying the perks of the membership. The company hasn’t said how much it plans to charge for the service, so we’ve reached out to it for more information.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">You&#8217;ve probably learned from Reid Hoffman before, either through his inventions, investments or inspirational words. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The entrepreneur is the co-founder of LinkedIn, a partner at Greylock and the author of a new book based off of his hit podcast, Masters of Scale. </span></p>
<p>His storied past makes him chock-full of interesting anecdotes and lessons, which is why we&#8217;re excited to have him back on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=hoffmanpost&amp;display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> stage happening next week from September 21-23. I&#8217;ll sit down with him to learn about his perspective on some of the biggest tensions that entrepreneurs face today. Hoffman&#8217;s advice is often fueled by his raw conversations with top tech CEOs and founders, so we&#8217;ll broaden access to his speed-dial list to understand how even his own perceptions on blitzscaling, growth and entrepreneurship are changing amid the pandemic. As I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/reid-hoffmans-masters-of-scale-book/">explained in my review of his new book</a>, his words read like a well-networked mentor giving you a pep talk &#8212; so even if you&#8217;re not building a startup, there will be useful lessons to learn just by listening.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Here&#8217;s how it impacted my interview process, for example:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While press wasn’t a main character in the book, “Master of Scale” has already changed my perspective on how I interview founders. Lessons from Tristan Walker made me want to ask more questions about founders, and their most controversial beliefs, rather than how they plan to spend their new round of funding. A note from Andrés Ruzo made me realize that a startup that makes too much sense might be a comfortable read, but it might not be a moonshot that disrupts the world; in other words, pursue the startups that have too much seemingly foolish ambition — because they may be where the best strides, and stories, are made. Finally, it confirmed my belief that the best litmus test for a founder is if they are willing to talk about the hardships ahead of them in an honest, humble way.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m hinting. Join me at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=hoffmanpost&amp;display=true">Disrupt</a>, where I&#8217;ll put Hoffman on the hot seat, balance out the cheerfulness with some cynical takes and push him to explain what his inevitable next book is about.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/actuator-5/"><strong>Tigers love robots:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure we’re accustomed to seeing Tiger cut checks into every software company still alive, but did you know that the capital fund is also into physical goods? Our own Brian Heater has the news.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/what-could-stop-the-startup-boom/">What could stop the startup boom?</a> </strong>Today on the site TechCrunch dug back through its coverage of the Q2 venture capital cycle, asking what could stop the momentum that we’ve seen in recent quarters. The short answer? Not too much. The heady startup market is more stable than you’d think, but only partially on its own merit.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ftc-says-health-apps-must-notify-consumers-if-their-data-is-breached-or-face-fines/">The American government gets serious about breaches:</a> </strong>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is making sure that companies know that if their apps “collect personal health information [they] must notify consumers if their data is breached or shared with third parties without their permission.” Which is good. But how was that not <em>always</em> the rule?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Apple held an event this week, so the technology market is still reverberating with takes about why it’s the iPhone 13 and not the iPhone 12S. Regardless of your take there, Apple&#8217;s long shadow is making itself known in other places. Like the market for helping folks find their gadgets. The Cupertino-based giant made waves the other month by introducing AirTags, in competition with Tile, a startup. Well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/tile-secures-another-40-million-to-take-on-apple-airtag-with-new-products/">Tile is now back with $40 million in new capital</a>. To war!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/fiberplane-nabs-e-7-5m-seed-to-bring-google-docs-like-collaboration-to-incident-response/"><strong>Fiberplane raises capital to build Google Docs for SREs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Building software tuned for a particular market is hot these days. The strategy is akin to building an anti-Word, if you will. In Fiberplane’s case &#8212; the company just raised $8.8 million &#8212; it’s building a Google-Docs-style product for site reliability engineers, or SREs. Is that niche too small? Probably not?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/codesignal-secures-50m-for-its-tech-hiring-platform/"><strong>CodeSignal raises (again):</strong></a> Ah, credentialing. CodeSignal wants to make applying for developer gigs a bit more based on skill and a bit less based on where one went to school. Investors are lining up to fund its vision, dropping a fresh $50 million into the company’s coffers less than a year after it raised $25 million.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/self-financial-raises-50m-to-help-the-subprime-consumer-build-credit-and-savings-at-the-same-time/">Self Financial proves that credit-building is still venture-backable:</a> </strong>Altos Ventures led a $50 million Series E for the company, which wants to help “consumers build credit and savings at the same time.” It’s a good idea, given how broken the American credit system still is today.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/byjus-acquires-coding-platform-tynker-for-200-million-in-us-expansion-push/"><strong>Byju’s buys coding platform Tynker:</strong></a> The $200 million transaction will help Byju’s continue to expand in the United States. The Indian company’s bullishness on its own sector is perhaps balm to founders and investors worried about edtech in the wake of China’s decision to kneecap its domestic startup class chasing the market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/open-mineral-raises-33m-series-c-funding-for-its-ebay-for-commodities-trading-platform/"><strong>Open Mineral:</strong></a> What a great startup name. And it is more than apt, as the company wants to bring transparency to the global commodities markets. Which is good, as more transparency means better price discovery, and a more efficient market. Open Mineral just closed $33 million in a Series C.</li>

<h2>3 strategies to make adopting new HR tech easier for hiring managers</h2>
<p>Most of us prefer to trust our instincts instead of letting automated tools help us make decisions, particularly when it comes to hiring. But that&#8217;s not smart.</p>
<p>If your startup has an ad hoc hiring process, you&#8217;re not tracking candidates properly, there&#8217;s little consistency regarding how they&#8217;re treated and bias plays a major role in who gets hired.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine to be skeptical of automated hiring tools —- but not ignorant.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Businesses that don’t invest in their future may not have a future to look forward to.</p>
<p>Whether you’re investing in your human resources or in critical tech, some outlay in the short term is always needed for long-term success. That&#8217;s true when it comes to marketing as well — you can’t market your product or service without investing in advertising. But if that investment isn’t turning into leads and conversions, you’re in trouble.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			A “good” ROAS score is different for each company and campaign. If your figure isn’t where you’d like it to be, you can leverage ROAS data to create targeted campaigns and personalized experiences.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s vital to identify and apply the most suitable metrics based on business goals, and there&#8217;s no one best practice or one-size-fits-all method.</p>
<p>However, smart use of the return on advertising spend (ROAS) data can triple lead generation, as I discovered when I joined Brightpearl to restructure the marketing campaigns. Let’s take a look at some of the ways Brightpearl used ROAS to improve campaigns and increase lead generation. The key is to work out what represents a healthy ROAS for your business so that you can optimize accordingly.</p>
<h2>Use the right return metric</h2>
<p>It is paramount to choose the right return metric to calculate your ROAS. This will depend partly on your sales cycle.</p>
<p>Brightpearl has a lengthy sales cycle. On average it’s two to three months, and sometimes up to six months, meaning we don’t have tons of data on a monthly basis if we want to use new customer’s revenue data as the return metric. A company with a shorter sales cycle could use revenue, but that doesn’t help us to optimize our campaigns.</p>
<p>We chose to use the sales accepted opportunity (SAO) value instead. It usually takes us about a month to measure, so we can get more ROAS data at the same time. It’s the last sales stage before a win, and it’s more in line with our company goal (to grow our recurring annual revenue), but takes less time to gather the data.</p>
<p>By the SAO stage, we know which leads are good quality­ — they have the budget, are a good fit, and our software can meet their requirements. We can use them to measure our campaign performance.</p>
<p>When you choose a return metric, you need to make sure it matches your company goal without taking ages to get the data. It also has to be measurable at the campaign level, because the aim of using ROAS or other metrics is to optimize your campaigns.</p>
<h2>Accept that less is more</h2>
<p>I’ve noticed that many companies harbor a fear of missing out on opportunities, which leads them to advertise on all available channels instead of concentrating resources on the most profitable areas.</p>
<p>Prospects usually do their research on multiple channels, so you might try to cover all the possible touch points. In theory, this could generate more leads, but only if you had an unlimited marketing budget and human resources.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://mirantis.com">Mirantis</a> has been around the block, starting way back as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/openstack/">OpenStack</a> startup, but a few years ago the company began to embrace cloud-native development technologies like containers, microservices and Kubernetes. Today, <a href="https://www.mirantis.com/blog/data-center-change-you-get-benefits/">it announced</a> Mirantis Flow, a fully managed open source set of services designed to help companies manage a cloud-native data center environment, whether your infrastructure lives on-prem or in a public cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re about delivering to customers an open source-based cloud-to-cloud experience in the data center, on the edge, and interoperable with public clouds,&#8221; Adrian Ionel, CEO and co-founder at Mirantis explained.</p>
<p>He points out that the biggest companies in the world, the hyperscalers like Facebook, Netflix and Apple, have all figured out how to manage in a hybrid cloud-native world, but most companies lack the resources of these large organizations. Mirantis Flow is aimed at putting these same types of capabilities that the big companies have inside these more modest organizations.</p>
<p>While the large infrastructure cloud vendors like Amazon, Microsoft and Google have been designed to help with this very problem, Ionel says that these tend to be less open and more proprietary. That can lead to lock-in, which today&#8217;s large organizations are looking desperately to avoid.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The large infrastructure vendors] will lock you into their stack and their APIs. They&#8217;re not based on open source standards or technology, so you are locked in your single source, and most large enterprises today are pursuing a multi-cloud strategy. They want infrastructure flexibility,&#8221; he said. He added, &#8220;The idea here is to provide a completely open and flexible zero lock-in alternative to the [big infrastructure providers, but with the] same cloud experience and same pace of innovation.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On balance, the cloud has been a huge boon to startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/05/on-balance-the-cloud-has-been-a-huge-boon-to-startups/embed/#?secret=0Sne8sDLwI" data-secret="0Sne8sDLwI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>They do this by putting together a stack of open source solutions in a single service. &#8220;We provide virtualization on top as part of the same fabric. We also provide software-defined networking, software-defined storage and CI/CD technology with DevOps as a service on top of it, which enables companies to automate the entire software development pipeline,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the company describes the service <a href="https://www.mirantis.com/blog/data-center-change-you-get-benefits/">in a blog post</a> published today, it includes &#8220;Mirantis Container Cloud, Mirantis OpenStack and Mirantis Kubernetes Engine, all workloads are available for migration to cloud native infrastructure, whether they are traditional virtual machine workloads or containerized workloads.&#8221;</p>
<p>For companies worried about migrating their VMware virtual machines to this solution, Ionel says they have been able to move these VMs to the Mirantis solution in early customers. &#8220;This is a very, very simple conversion of the virtual machine from VMware standard to an open standard, and there is no reason why any application and any workload should not run on this infrastructure &#8212; and we&#8217;ve seen it over and over again in many many customers. So we don&#8217;t see any bottlenecks whatsoever for people to move right away,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this solution does not include hardware. It&#8217;s about bringing your own hardware infrastructure, either physical or as a service, or using a Mirantis partner like Equinix. The service is available now for $15,000 per month or $180,000 annually, which includes: 1,000 core/vCPU licenses for access to all products in the Mirantis software suite plus support for 20 virtual machine (VM) migrations or application onboarding and unlimited 24&#215;7 support. The company does not charge any additional fees for control plane and management software licenses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s creator platform <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-super-follows">Super Follows</a> is off to an inauspicious start, having contributed to somewhere around $6,000 in U.S. iOS revenue in the first two weeks the feature has been live, according to app intelligence data provided by <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a>. And it&#8217;s made only around $600 or so in Canada. A small portion of that revenue may be attributed to <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces">Ticketed Spaces</a>, Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed#how-do-i-purchase">other in-app purchase</a> offered in the U.S. &#8212; but there&#8217;s no way for this portion to be calculated by an outside firm.</p>
<p>Twitter first announced its plans to launch Super Follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">during its Analyst Day event </a>in February, where the company detailed many of its upcoming initiatives to generate new revenue streams.</p>
<p>Today, Twitter&#8217;s business is highly dependent on advertising, and Super Follows is one of the few ways it&#8217;s aiming to diversify. The company is also now offering a way for creators to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/twitter-super-follows-and-ticketed-spaces/">charge for access </a>to their live events with Ticketed Spaces and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-launches-its-premium-subscription-twitter-blue-initially-in-canada-and-australia/">outside the U.S., Twitter has begun testing </a>a premium product for power users, called <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue.html">Twitter Blue</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203950" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203950" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203950" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="525" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png 4916w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=768,592 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=1536,1185 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=2048,1580 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/creator_posting_superfollows_content.png.img_.fullhd.medium.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203950" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>But Super Follows, which targets creators, is the effort with the most potential appeal to mainstream users.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also one that is working to capitalize on the growing creator economy, where content creators build a following, then generate revenue directly through subscriptions &#8212; decreasing their own dependence on ads or brand deals, as a result. The platforms they use for this business skim a little off the top to help them fund the development of the creator tools. (In Twitter&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s taking only a 3% cut.)</p>
<p>The feature would seem to make sense for Twitter, a platform that already allows high-profile figures and regular folks to hobnob in the same timeline and have conversations. Super Follows ups that access by letting fans get even closer to their favorite creators &#8212; whether those are musicians, artists, comedians, influencers, writers, gamers or other experts, for example. These creators can set a monthly subscription price of $2.99, $4.99 or $9.99 to provide fans with access to bonus, &#8220;behind-the-scenes&#8221; content of their choosing. These generally come in the form of extra tweets, Q&amp;As and other interactions with subscribers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>At launch, Twitter opened up Super Follows to <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-super-follows">a handful of creators</a>, including the beauty and skincare-focused account <a href="https://twitter.com/MakeupForWOC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@MakeupforWOC</a>; astrology account <a href="https://twitter.com/TarotByBronx">@TarotByBronx</a>; sports-focused <a href="https://twitter.com/KingJosiah54">@KingJosiah54</a>; writer <a href="https://twitter.com/myeshachou">@myeshachou</a>; internet personality and podcaster <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelaOkla">@MichaelaOkla</a>; spiritual healer <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/kemimarie?lang=en">@kemimarie</a>; music charts tweeter <a href="https://twitter.com/chartdata">@chartdata</a>; Twitch streamers <a href="https://twitter.com/FaZeMew">@FaZeMew</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/VelvetIsCake">@VelvetIsCake</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MackWood1x">@MackWood1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GabeJRuiz">@GabeJRuiz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/saulsrevenge?lang=en">@Saulsrevenge</a>; YouTubers <a href="https://twitter.com/DoubleH_YT">@DoubleH_YT</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LxckTV">@LxckTV</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PowerGotNow">@PowerGotNow</a>; and crypto traders <a href="https://twitter.com/itsALLrisky">@itsALLrisky</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/moon_shine15">@moon_shine15</a>; among others. Twitter says there are fewer than 100 creators in total who have access to Super Follows.</p>
<p>While access on the creation side is limited, the ability to subscribe to creators is not. Any Twitter iOS user in the U.S. or Canada can &#8220;Super Follow&#8221; any number of the supported creator accounts. In the U.S., Twitter has 37 million monetizable daily active users <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">as of Q2 2021</a>. Of course, only some subset of those will be iOS users.</p>
<p>Still, Twitter could easily count millions upon millions of &#8220;potential&#8221; customers for its Super Follow platform at launch. Its current revenue indicates that, possibly, only thousands of consumers have done so, given many of the top in-app purchases are for creators offering content at lower price points.</p>

<p>Sensor Tower notes Twitter’s $6,000 in U.S. consumer spending on iOS was calculated during the first two weeks of September (September 1-14). Before this period, U.S. iOS users spent only $100 from August 25 through 31 &#8212; a figure that would indicate user spending on Ticketed Spaces during that time. In other words, the contribution of Tickets Spaces revenue to this total of $6,000 in iOS consumer spending is likely quite small.</p>
<p>In Canada, the other market where Super Follow is now available to subscribers, Twitter&#8217;s iOS in-app purchase revenue from September 1 through September 14, was a negligible $600. (This would also include Twitter Blue subscription revenue, which is <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">being tested</a> in Canada and Australia.)</p>
<p>Worldwide, Twitter users on iOS spent $9,000 during that same time, which would include other Ticketed Spaces revenues and tests of its premium service, Twitter Blue. (Twitter&#8217;s Tip Jar, a way to pay creators directly, does not work through in-app purchases).</p>
<p>Unlike other Twitter products that developed by watching what users were already doing anyway &#8212; like using hashtags or retweeting content &#8212; many of Twitter&#8217;s newer features are attempts at redefining the use cases for its platform. In a massive rush of product pushes, Twitter has recently launched tools not just for creators, but also for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/twitter-tests-new-e-commerce-features-for-tweets/">e-commerce</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue">organizing reading materials</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers">subscribing to newsletters</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/testing-communities">socializing in communities</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/spaces-is-here">chatting through audio</a>,<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation"> fact-checking content,</a> <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/adding-more-context-to-trends">keeping up with trends</a>, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/new-conversation-settings-coming-to-a-tweet-near-you">conversing more privately</a> and more.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s position on the slower start to Super Follows is that it&#8217;s still too early to make any determinations. While that’s fair, it’s also worth tracking adoption to see if the new product had seen any rapid, out-of-the-gate traction.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is just the start for Super Follows,” a Twitter spokesperson said, reached for comment about Sensor Tower’s figures. “Our main goal is focused on ensuring creators are set up for success and so we’re working closely with a small group of creators in this first iteration to ensure they have the best experience using Super Follows before we roll out more widely.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson also noted Twitter Super Follows had been set up to help creators make more money as it scales.</p>
<p>“With Super Follows, people are eligible to earn up to 97% of revenue after in-app purchase fees until they make $50,000 in lifetime earnings. After $50,000 in lifetime earnings, they can earn up to 80% of revenue after in-app purchase fees,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Correction,</em> <em>9/16/21: Twitter mDAU was 37 million in the last quarter, not 169 million— the latter was the international figure. This has been updated. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building an orbital launch business from scratch is no simple matter, but what if that business is just a stepping stone to a vertically integrated, interplanetary space company? Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck will be joining us next week at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> (Sept 21-23) to talk about the challenge and exhilaration of pursuing his passion for space, all the way to orbit, the moon and beyond.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab started over a decade ago as Beck tested increasingly large rockets, with the (supposedly) ultimate goal of building a small, reliable and relatively inexpensive launch vehicle that could deliver payloads to orbit at a weekly cadence &#8212; or even faster.</p>
<p>Since then the company and its Electron launch vehicle have become not just a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/rocket-labs-order-backlog-tops-141m-as-the-company-inks-five-launch-deal-with-kineis/"> sought-after ride to orbit</a>, but it has begun expanding into spacecraft design and manufacturing with Photon, and announced a much larger vehicle called Neutron. Now they&#8217;ve even been tapped for an Artemis-related lunar mission and are planning a privately funded mission to Venus. (And of course they&#8217;ve raised a boatload of money and are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-ceo-peter-beck-explains-why-the-company-needs-a-bigger-rocket-and-why-its-going-public-to-build-it/">going public</a>.)</p>
<p>The always forthcoming, Beck will join us virtually from his home country HQ in New Zealand to discuss Rocket Lab&#8217;s success and future endeavors, and the challenge of adapting a company from underdog launch provider to sprawling space services company with competition nipping at its heels.</p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;ll join us next week at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">Disrupt</a>. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?display=true">get your passes now</a> for under $100 until Monday, September 20.</p>

Marketers and decision-makers, already suffering from FOMO about opportunities within gaming, have latched onto buzzy trends like the applications of blockchain in gaming and the “metaverse” in an effort to get ahead of the trend rather than constantly play catch-up.</p>
<p>The allure is obvious, as the relationship between the blockchain, metaverse and gaming makes sense. Gaming has always been on the forefront of digital ownership (one can credit gaming platform Steam for normalizing the concept for games, and arguably other media such as movies), and most agreed upon visions of the metaverse rely upon virtual environments common in games with decentralized digital ownership.</p>
<p>Whatever your opinion of either, I believe they both have an interrelated future in gaming. However, the success or relevance of either of these buzzy topics is dependent upon a crucial step that is being skipped at this point.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the example of blockchain and, more specifically, NFTs. Collecting items of varying rarities and often random distribution form some of the core “loops” in many games (e.g., kill monster, get better weapon, kill tougher monster, get even better weapon, etc.), and collecting “skins” (i.e., different outfits/permutation of game character) is one of the most embraced paradigms of microtransactions in games.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The way NFTs are currently being discussed in relation to gaming are very much in danger of falling into this very trap: Killing the core gameplay loop via a financial fast track.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Now, NFTs are positioned to be a natural fit with various rare items having permanent, trackable and open value. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/loot-games-the-crypto-world/">Recent releases</a> such as <a href="https://decrypt.co/80108/what-is-loot-ethereum-nft-role-playing-phenonemon">“Loot (for Adventurers)”</a> have introduced a novel approach wherein the NFTs are simply descriptions of fantasy-inspired gear and offered in a way that <a href="https://www.lootproject.com/resources">other creators can use them as tools to build worlds around</a>. It’s not hard to imagine a game built around NFT items, à la Loot.</p>
<p>But that’s been done before … kind of. Developers of games with a “loot loop” like the one described above have long had a problem with “farmers,” who acquire game currencies and items to sell to players for real money, against the terms of service of the game. The solution was to implement in-game “auction houses” where players could instead use real money to purchase items from one another.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unfortunately, this had an unwanted side effect. As noted by renowned game psychologist Jamie Madigan, our brains are evolved to pay special attention to rewards that are both unexpected and beneficial. When much of the joy in some games comes from an unexpected or randomized reward, being able to easily acquire a known reward with real money robbed the game of what made it fun.</p>
<p>The way NFTs are currently being discussed in relation to gaming are very much in danger of falling into this very trap: Killing the core gameplay loop via a financial fast track. The most extreme examples of this phenomena commit the biggest cardinal sin in gaming — a game that is “pay to win,” where a player with a big bankroll can acquire a material advantage in a competitive game.</p>
<p>Blockchain games such as <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a> have rapidly increased enthusiasm around the concept of &#8220;play to earn,&#8221; where players can potentially earn money by selling tokenized resources or characters earned within a blockchain game environment. If this sounds like a scenario that can come dangerously close to &#8220;pay to win,&#8221; that&#8217;s because it is.</p>
<p>What is less clear is whether it matters in this context. Does anyone care enough about the core game itself rather than the potential market value of NFTs or earning potential through playing? More fundamentally, if real-world earnings are the point, is it truly a game or just a gamified micro-economy, where “farming” as described above is not an illicit activity, but rather the core game mechanic?</p>
<p>The technology culture around blockchain has elevated solving for very hard problems that very few people care about. The solution (like many problems in tech) involves reevaluation from a more humanist approach. In the case of gaming, there are some fundamental gameplay and game psychology issues to be tackled before these technologies can gain mainstream traction.</p>
<p>We can turn to the metaverse for a related example. Even if you aren’t particularly interested in gaming, you’ve almost certainly heard of the concept after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">Mark Zuckerberg staked the future of Facebook upon it</a>. For all the excitement, the fundamental issue is that it simply doesn’t exist, and the closest analogs are massive digital game spaces (such as Fortnite) or sandboxes (such as Roblox). Yet, many brands and marketers who haven’t really done the work to understand gaming are trying to fast-track to an opportunity that isn’t likely to materialize for a long time.</p>
<p>Gaming can be seen as the training wheels for the metaverse — the ways we communicate within, navigate and think about virtual spaces are all based upon mechanics and systems with foundations in gaming. I’d go so far as to predict the first adopters of any “metaverse” will indeed be gamers who have honed these skills and find themselves comfortable within virtual environments.</p>
<p>By now, you might be seeing a pattern: We’re far more interested in the “future” applications of gaming without having much of a perspective on the “now” of gaming. Game scholarship has proliferated since the early aughts due to a recognition of how games were influencing thought in fields ranging from sociology to medicine, and yet the business world hasn’t paid it much attention until recently.</p>
<p>The result is that marketers and decision-makers are doing what they do best (chasing the next big thing) without the usual history of why said thing should be big, or what to do with it when they get there. The growth of gaming has yielded an immense opportunity, but the sophistication of the conversations around these possibilities remains stunted, due in part to our misdirected attention.</p>
<p>There is no “pay to win” fast track out of this blind spot. We have to put in the work to win.</p>

<p>By breaking away from traditional business models centered around benefiting large corporations, Web3 brings the possibility of community-centered economies of scale. This collaborative spirit and its associated incentive mechanisms are attracting some of the most talented and ambitious developers today, unlocking projects that were previously not possible.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

<p>Web3, as <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-web-3">Ki Chong Tran</a> once said, is &#8220;The next major iteration of the internet, which promises to wrest control from the centralized corporations that today dominate the web.&#8221; Web3-enabled collaboration is made possible by decentralized networks that no single entity controls.</p>
<p>In closed-source business models, users trust a business to manage funds and execute services. With open source projects, users trust the technology to perform these tasks. In Web2, the bigger network wins. In Web3, whoever builds the biggest network together wins.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>In a decentralized world, not only is participation open to all, the incentive structure is designed so that the greater the number of participants, the more everybody succeeds.</p>
<h2>Learning from Linux</h2>
<p>Linux, which is behind a majority of Web2&#8217;s websites, changed the paradigm for how the internet was developed and provides a clear example of how collaborative processes can drive the future of technology. Linux wasn&#8217;t developed by an incumbent tech giant, but by a group of volunteer programmers who used networked collaboration, which is when people freely share information without central control.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Musings-Accidental-Revolutionary/dp/0596001088">&#8220;The Cathedral &amp; The Bazaar,&#8221;</a> author Eric S. Raymond shares his observations of the Linux kernel development process and his experiences managing open source projects. Raymond depicts a time when the popular mindset was to develop complex operating systems carefully coordinated by a small, exclusionary group of people — “cathedrals,” which are corporations and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Linux evolved in a completely different way. Raymond explains, &#8220;Quality was maintained not by rigid standards or autocracy, but by the naively simple strategy of releasing every week and getting feedback from hundreds of users within days, creating a sort of Darwinian selection on the mutations introduced by developers. To the amazement of almost everyone, this worked quite well.&#8221; This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel#Development_model">Linux development model</a>, or “bazaar” model as Raymond puts it, assumes that &#8220;bugs are generally shallow phenomena&#8221; when exposed to an army of hackers without significant coordination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies process ever-increasing amounts of data, moving it in real time is a huge challenge for organizations. <a href="https://www.confluent.io/">Confluent</a> is a streaming data platform built on top of the open source <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> project that&#8217;s been designed to process massive numbers of events. To discuss this, and more, Confluent CEO and co-founder Jay Kreps will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=jaycrepspost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=jaycrepspost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS on Oct 27th</a> for a fireside chat.</p>
<p>Data is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/datarobot-ceo-dan-wright-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-to-discuss-role-of-data-in-machine-learning/">a big part of the story</a> we are telling at the SaaS event, as it has such a critical role in every business. Kreps has said in the past the data streams are at the core of every business, from sales to orders to customer experiences. As he wrote in <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/series-e-round-metamorphosis/">a company blog post</a> announcing the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/confluent-lands-another-big-round-with-250m-series-e-on-4-2b-valuation/">$250 million Series E</a> in April 2020, Confluent is working to process all of this data in real time &#8212; and that was a big reason why investors were willing to pour so much money into the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason is simple: though new data technologies come and go, event streaming is emerging as a major new category that is on a path to be as important and foundational in the architecture of a modern digital company as databases have been,&#8221; Kreps wrote at the time.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s streaming data platform takes a multi-faceted approach to streaming and builds on the open source Kafka project. While anyone can download and use Kafka, as with many open source projects, companies may lack the resources or expertise to deal with the raw open source code. Many a startup have been built on open source to help simplify whatever the project does, and Confluent and Kafka are no different.</p>
<p>Kreps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/confluent-raises-50m-to-continue-growing-commercial-arm-of-apache-kafka/">told us in 2017</a> that companies using Kafka as a core technology include Netflix, Uber, Cisco and Goldman Sachs. But those companies have the resources to manage complex software like this. Mere mortal companies can pay Confluent to access a managed cloud version or they can manage it themselves and install it in the cloud infrastructure provider of choice.</p>
<p>The project was actually born at LinkedIn in 2011 when their engineers were tasked with building a tool to process the enormous number of events flowing through the platform. The company eventually open sourced the technology it had created and Apache Kafka was born.</p>
<p>Confluent launched in 2014 and raised over $450 million along the way. In its last private round in April 2020, the company scored a $4.5 billion valuation on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/confluent-lands-another-big-round-with-250m-series-e-on-4-2b-valuation/">a $250 million investment</a>. As of today, it has a market cap of over $17 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to our discussion with Kreps, the conference will also include Google&#8217;s Javier Soltero, Amplitude’s Olivia Rose, as well as investors Kobie Fuller and Casey Aylward, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a thought-provoking lineup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.whatnot.com">Whatnot</a>, a livestreaming shopping platform for collectors to buy and sell things like rare Pokémon cards and Funko Pops, has closed a $150 million Series C — its third round of fundraising in 2021 alone. This round pins Whatnot&#8217;s valuation at $1.5 billion, earning it a spot on the ever-growing list of unicorns.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s a Whatnot? The app captures a trend that had been growing popular on platforms like Instagram in the U.S. (and was already hugely popular in China): live shopping. Verified sellers can go on the air at any time, hosting on-the-fly video auctions for their goods. Sometimes buyers know exactly what they&#8217;re getting. Other times it&#8217;s more of a mystery bag; with the popular &#8220;card break&#8221; concept, for example, users buy assigned portions of an unopened (and often itself rare) box of Pokémon or sports cards and watch its contents revealed live.</p>
<p>This round was funded by return investors a16z and Y Combinator&#8217;s Continuity Fund, along with one new firm joining them: CapitalG (which was known as Google Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/04/google-capital-changes-its-name-to-capitalg/">before the Google/Alphabet name change</a>.) They&#8217;ve also added a few well-known names to their list of angel investors, including Andre Iguodala of the Golden State Warriors, Zion Williamson of the New Orleans Pelicans and Logan Paul of the YouTube. Initial word of this round broke last week, via <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/live-shopping-startup-whatnot-raising-at-1-5-billion-valuation">The Information.</a></p>
<p>Whatnot originally started as a more standard (less live) resale platform, at first focused on authenticating just one kind of collectable: Funko Pops. As the pandemic took over and everyone was suddenly stuck at home, they leaned hard into live shopping — and grew rapidly as a result.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Whatnot wants to be the GOAT of collectible toys, starting with Funko Pops&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/embed/#?secret=GVdEe3JryL" data-secret="GVdEe3JryL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the company has been quickly expanding its scope; it grew from just Funko Pops to all sorts of other collectables, including Pokémon cards, pins, vintage clothing, sneakers and more. Whatnot co-founder Grant Lafontaine tells me that its biggest driver is sports cards, followed by Pokémon and Funko Pops. With each category it dives into, Whatnot focuses on onboarding sellers that are already known and trusted in their respective community; each streamer on the platform is currently vetted by the company before they can go live, helping them keep fraud to a minimum. Doing anything sketchy just means getting booted off the platform and burning your own reputation in the process.</p>
<p>A few other key bits from my conversation with Lafontaine:</p>
<ul>
<li>He sees &#8220;thousands&#8221; of potential categories they can expand into. One they&#8217;re working on right now: NFTs. Streamers would be able to import their NFTs into Whatnot, displaying them on screen and bringing them in as (static or animated) overlays in the livestream. Users could tap an onscreen NFT to reveal its metadata and learn more about it.</li>
<li>He says there are &#8220;a couple thousand active livestream sellers&#8221; on the platform right now.</li>
<li>The company&#8217;s GMV (the total value of everything sold on the platform) is up 30x since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">Series A back in the beginning of this year</a>. Whatnot takes an 8% cut on each sale.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re in the middle of rolling out a &#8220;pre-bidding&#8221; feature, which will allow users to bid on items they know they want ahead of a livestream — if, for example, the user knows they want a certain thing and want a shot at it, but won&#8217;t be able to watch live. Others could still out-bid them, of course.</li>
<li>The company is soon rolling out a complete rebuild of both its iOS and Android apps, with a new UI meant to make the entire process smoother and easier for both buyers and sellers. Lafontaine expects it to ship to everyone in &#8220;the next week or two.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>This round brings the company&#8217;s total funds raised to $225 million — pretty much all of that in the last year. Meanwhile, competition in the space is heating up; competitors like <a href="https://popshop.live/discovery">Popshop</a> have<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/popshop-live-raises-around-20m-at-a-100m-valuation-for-its-livestream-shopping-platform-for-hipsters/"> been raising millions</a> for their platforms, and Miami&#8217;s <a href="https://loupetheapp.com">Loupe</a> raised $12 million back in June (and is opening a physical retail space soon) with its focus laser-locked on sports cards live sales. Existing giants want in on it too: YouTube is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/youtube-to-pilot-test-shopping-from-livestreams-with-select-creators/">playing with the live shopping concept</a>, and Amazon has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/livestream-e-commerce-why-companies-and-brands-need-to-tune-in/">bringing in influencers to host live sessions</a>. In other words: watch this space. Maybe watch it via livestream.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-products-for-the-next-era-of-personalized-experiences">announcing</a> the launch of new products and features for business owners, following the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-facebook-clash-over-ads-small-businesses-fear-theyll-be-impacted-11618009627">threat</a> to its ad targeting business driven by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">Apple&#8217;s new privacy features</a>, which now allow mobile users to opt out of being tracked across their iOS apps. The social networking giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">has repeatedly argued that Apple&#8217;s changes</a> would impact small businesses that relied on Facebook ads to reach their customers. But it was not successful in getting any of Apple&#8217;s changes halted. Instead, the market is shifting to a new era focused more on user privacy, where personalization and targeting are more of an opt-in experience. That&#8217;s required Facebook to address its business advertiser base in new ways.</p>
<p>As the ability to track consumers declines &#8212; very few consumers are opting into tracking, <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">studies find</a> &#8212; Facebook is rolling out new features that will allow businesses to better position themselves in front of relevant audiences. This includes updates that will let them reach customers, advertise to customers, chat with customers across Facebook apps, generate leads, acquire customers and more.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/new-facebook-tools-for-online-marketing">earlier this year began testing a way</a> for customers to explore businesses from underneath News Feed posts by tapping on topics they were interested in &#8212; like beauty, fitness and clothing, and explore content from other related businesses. The feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/facebook-to-test-new-business-discovery-features-in-u-s-news-feed/">allows people to come across new businesses</a> they may also like, and would allow Facebook to create its own data set of users who like certain types of content. Over time, it could possibly even turn the feature into an ad unit, where businesses could pay for higher placement.</p>
<p>But for the time being, Facebook will expand this feature to more users across the U.S., and launch it in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa and the U.K.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139153" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139153" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139153" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg 2360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=300,255 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=768,653 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=680,579 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1307 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1743 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-15-at-10.23.44-AM.jpg?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139153" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Facebook is also making it easier for businesses to chat with customers. They&#8217;re already able to buy ads that encourage people to message them on Facebook&#8217;s various chat platforms &#8212; Messenger, Instagram Direct or WhatsApp. Now, they&#8217;ll be able to choose all the messaging platforms where they&#8217;re available, and Facebook will default the chat app showcased in the ad based on where the conversation is most likely to happen.</p>

<p>The company will tie WhatsApp to Instagram, as well, as part of this effort. Facebook explains that many businesses market themselves or run shops across Instagram, but rely on WhatsApp to communicate with customers and answer questions. So, Facebook will now allow businesses to add a WhatsApp click-to-chat button to their Instagram profiles.</p>
<p>This change, in particular, represents another move that ties Facebook&#8217;s separate apps more closely together, at a time when <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/19/tech/ftc-facebook-antitrust/index.html">regulators are considering</a> breaking up Facebook over antitrust concerns. Already, Facebook interconnected Facebook&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631832022380000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwiqhJ8za71NRnQ9rygzO2Td7FYQ"> Messenger and Instagram messaging services,</a> which would make such a disassembly more complicated. And more recently, it&#8217;s begun <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/facebook-retools-messaging-again-by-adding-calling-to-main-app?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-23/facebook-retools-messaging-again-by-adding-calling-to-main-app?sref%3Dgni836kR&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631832022380000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMQrrClPG5e5iUh2nwYDsCtUpE2w">integrating</a> Messenger directly into Facebook&#8217;s platform itself.</p>

<p>In a related change, soon businesses will be able to create ads that send users directly to WhatsApp from the Instagram app. (Facebook also already offers ads like this.)</p>
<p>Separately from this news, Facebook<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/whatsapp-business/whatsapp-launches-test-of-in-app-business-directory-idUKL1N2QH0U1"> announced the launch of a new business directory on WhatsApp</a>, allowing consumers to find shops and services on the chat platform, as well.</p>
<p>Another set of changes being introduced involve an update to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/a-faster-and-easier-way-to-manage-your-business-on-facebook-and-instagram/">Facebook Business Suite</a>. Businesses will be able to manage emails through Inbox and send remarketing emails; use a new File Manager for creating, managing and posting content; and access a feature that will allow businesses to test different versions of a post to see which one is most effective.</p>

<p>Other new products include tests of paid and organic lead generation tools on Instagram; quote requests on Messenger, where customers answer a few questions prior to their conversations; and a way for small businesses to access a bundle of tools to get started with Facebook ads, which includes a Facebook ad coupon along with free access to QuickBooks for three months or free access to Canva Pro for three months.</p>

<p>Facebook will also begin testing something called &#8220;Work Accounts,&#8221; which will allow business owners to access their business products, like Business Manager, separately from their personal Facebook account. They&#8217;ll be able to manage these accounts on behalf of employees and use single sign-on integrations.</p>
<p>Work Accounts will be tested through the remainder of the year with a small group of businesses, and Facebook says it expects to expand availability in 2022.</p>
<p>Other efforts it has in store include plans to incorporate more content from creators and local businesses and new features that let users control the content they see, but these changes were not detailed at this time.</p>
<p>Most of the products being announced are either rolling out today or will begin to show up soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford said Thursday it will invest another $250 million and add 450 jobs to increase production capacity of its upcoming F-150 Lightning to 80,000 all-electric trucks annually. The announcement comes after receiving more than 150,000 pre-orders for the all-electric pickup truck.</p>
<p>The additional funds and jobs will be spread out across its new Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center and Rawsonville Components Plant, Ford said.</p>
<p>The announcement was made during an event at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, a 500,000-square-foot facility expansion that was part of Ford&#8217;s $700 million investment in its Rouge Complex. Gas-powered F-Series trucks are also assembled at the Rouge Complex.</p>

<p>Ford also announced that it has started pre-production of the Lightning trucks. These prototypes will be used for real-world testing. The truck will be available to customers in spring 2022.</p>
<p>The all-electric pickup truck is a critical piece of the company&#8217;s $30 billion investment into electrification and one of a trifecta of Ford EV debuts and launches in the next 18 months, including the Mustang Mach-E. The Lightning may be the most meaningful in terms of the bottom line. The Ford F-150 Lightning follows the introduction of the all-electric Mustang Mach-E and the E-Transit, a configurable all-electric cargo van focused on commercial customers.</p>
<p>The F-150 Lightning will be offered in four trims, which includes the base, XLT, Lariat and Platinum series, and two battery options. The truck, which has an aluminum alloy body, is powered by two in-board electric motors, comes standard with four-wheel drive and has an independent rear suspension. The base version will be priced at $39,974 before any federal or state tax credits, while the midseries XLT model will start at $52,974. All of these prices exclude the destination fees and taxes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The art of pitching is perhaps the most important art that a founder learns on their journey to unicorn status and beyond. And like any art, it helps to get some critical feedback along the way from the judges on the other side of the table.</p>
<p>That’s why at every Disrupt, we host Pitch Deck Teardown, a panel of VCs who read and critique several pitch decks in a row to offer feedback on everything from the overarching narrative and story to the mundane details of format, typography and colors.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 next week, I’m excited to be hosting Maren Bannon of January Ventures, Bling Capital’s Ben Ling and Vanessa Larco of NEA for our next iteration of this popular workshopping panel.</p>
<p>If you’re a founder and want to submit your deck for consideration, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6unxbSjKe2dVQxoDyNs95En1R3mzPc6I5D5Gdi7YhgDJPnA/viewform"><strong>head on over to this trusty Google Form</strong></a> and upload a copy of your pitch deck in PDF format. Remember that this will be presented publicly, so make sure it’s appropriate for a live studio audience. We’ll be selecting roughly six of them for inclusion in the event, and we’ll notify by email the founders selected.</p>
<p>Come join us next week! And if you need tickets to Disrupt, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=rightrail">we still have some available</a> for all the virtual excitement across two stages and dozens of fireside chats and panels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://fiberplane.dev">Fiberplane</a>, an Amsterdam-based early-stage startup that is building collaborative notebooks for SREs (site reliability engineers) to collaborate around an incident in a similar manner to group editing in a Google Doc, announced a ​​€7.5 million (approximately $8.8 million USD) seed round today.</p>
<p>The round was co-led by Crane Venture Partners and Notion Capital, with participation from Northzone, System.One and Basecase Capital.</p>
<p>Micha Hernandez van Leuffen (known as Mies) is founder and CEO at Fiberplane. When his previous startup, Werker, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/17/developer-tools-startup-wrecker-has-been-acquired-by-oracle/">was sold to Oracle</a> in 2017, Hernandez van Leuffen became part of a much larger company where he saw people struggling to deal with outages (which happen at every company).</p>
<p>&#8220;We were always going back and forth between metrics, logs and traces, what I always call this sort of treasure hunt, and figuring out what was the underlying root cause of an outage or downtime,&#8221; Hernandez van Leuffen told me.</p>
<p>He said that this experience led to a couple of key insights about incident response: First, you needed a centralized place to pull all the incident data together, and secondly that as a distributed team managing a distributed system you needed to collaborate in real time, often across different time zones.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2j6uuBnH6n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/31/how-you-react-when-your-systems-fail-may-define-your-business/">How you react when your systems fail may define your business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How you react when your systems fail may define your business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/31/how-you-react-when-your-systems-fail-may-define-your-business/embed/#?secret=2j6uuBnH6n" data-secret="2j6uuBnH6n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When he left Oracle in August 2020, he began thinking about the idea of giving DevOps teams and SREs the same kind of group editing capabilities that other teams inside an organization have with tools like Google Docs or Notion and an idea for his new company began to take shape.</p>
<p>What he created with Fiberplane is a collaborative notebook for SRE&#8217;s to pull in the various data types and begin to work together to resolve the incident, while having a natural audit trail of what happened and how they resolved the issue. Different people can participate in this notebook, just as multiple people can edit a Google Doc, fulfilling that original vision.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203799" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203799" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2203799" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Fiberplane incident response notebook with various types of data about the incident." width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203799" class="wp-caption-text">Fiberplane collaborative notebook example with multiple people involved. <strong>Image Credit:</strong> Fiberplane</p></div></p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t plan to stop there though. The longer-term vision is an operational platform for SREs and DevOps teams to deal with every aspect of an outage. &#8220;This is our starting point, but we are planning to expand from there as more I would say an SRE workbench, where you&#8217;re also able to command and control your infrastructure,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Today the company has 13 employees and is growing, and as they do, they are exploring ways to make sure they are building a diverse company, looking at concrete strategies to find more diverse candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;To hire diversely, we’re re-examining our top of the funnel processes. Our efforts include posting our jobs in communities of underrepresented people, running our job descriptions through a gender decoder and facilitating a larger time frame for jobs to remain open,&#8221; Elena Boroda, marketing manager at Fiberplane said.</p>
<p>While Hernandez van Leuffen is based in Amsterdam, the company has been hiring people in the U.K., Berlin, Copenhagen and the U.S., he said. The plan is to have Amsterdam as a central hub when offices reopen as the majority of employees are located there.</p>
