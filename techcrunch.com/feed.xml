										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Massachusetts lawmakers have voted to pass a new police reform bill that will ban police departments and public agencies from using facial recognition technology across the state.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/S2963?=11302020">bill was passed</a> by both the state&#8217;s House and Senate on Tuesday, a day after senior lawmakers announced an agreement that ended months of deadlock.</p>
<p>The police reform bill also bans the use of chokeholds and rubber bullets, and limits the use of chemical agents like tear gas, and also allows police officers to intervene to prevent the use of excessive and unreasonable force. But the bill does not remove qualified immunity for police, a controversial measure that shields serving police from legal action for misconduct, following objections from police groups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lawmakers brought the bill to the state legislature in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-overview/">the killing of George Floyd</a>, an unarmed Black man who was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer, since charged with his murder.</p>
<p>Critics have for years complained that facial recognition technology is flawed, biased, and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facial-recognition-has-always-troubled-people-of-color-everyone-should-listen/">disproportionately misidentifies</a> people and communities of color. But the bill grants police an exception to run facial recognition searches against the state&#8217;s driver&#8217;s license database with a warrant. In granting that exception, the state will have to publish annual transparency figures on the number of searches made by officers.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Senate voted 28-12 to pass, and the House voted 92-67. The bill will now be sent to Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker for his signature.</p>
<p>In the absence of privacy legislation from the federal government, laws curtailing the use of facial recognition are popping up on a state and city level. The patchwork nature of that legislation means that state and city laws have room to experiment, creating an array of blueprints for future laws that can be replicated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Portland, Oregon passed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/">broad ban on facial recognition tech</a> this September. The ban, one of the most aggressive in the nation, blocks city bureaus from using the technology but will also prohibit private companies from deploying facial recognition systems in public spaces. Months of clashes between protesters and aggressive law enforcement in that city raised the stakes on Portland&#8217;s ban.</p>
<p>Earlier bans in Oakland, San Francisco, and Boston focused on forbidding their city governments from using the technology but, like Massachusetts, stopped short of limiting its use by private companies. San Francisco&#8217;s ban <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban/">passed in May of last year</a>, making the international tech hub the first major city to ban the use of facial recognition by city agencies and police departments.</p>
<p>At the same time that cities across the U.S. are acting to limit the creep of biometric surveillance, those same systems are spreading at the federal level. In August, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) signed a contract for access to a facial recognition database <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/clearview-ai-ice-hsi-contract-2020/">created by Clearview AI</a>, a deeply controversial company that scrapes facial images from online sources, including social media sites.</p>
<p>While most activism against facial recognition only pertains to local issues, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/">at least one state law</a> has proven powerful enough to make waves on a national scale. In Illinois, the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) has ensnared major tech companies including Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet for training facial recognition systems on Illinois residents without permission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-galactic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="virgin-galactic">Virgin Galactic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has revealed the flight window for the first rocket-powered flight of its VSS Unity spacecraft from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/look-inside-virgin-galactics-shiny-new-spaceport-america/">shiny new Spaceport America</a> in New Mexico. The ship could be in the air <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-flight-test-program-update-ypreparing-for-first-rocket-powered-flight-from-new-mexico/">as early as December 11</a>.</p>
<p>This flight will be the third for Unity out of the future passenger spaceport, but the last two have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/virgin-galactic-flies-second-spaceshiptwo-test-at-new-mexico-spaceport-clearing-the-way-for-powered-spaceflight/">gliding flights</a>, not propulsive ones. This will be the first time Unity has hit the throttle in nearly two years — back when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/virgin-galactic-touches-the-edge-of-space-with-mach-2-9-test-flight-of-spaceshiptwo/">touched the edge of space at something like Mach 2.9</a>.</p>
<p>Since then the company and its aircraft have moved home, from Mojave, California to the spaceport in New Mexico, where it hopes eventually passengers will come and lounge before taking off on a brief visit to space.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The glides, in which Unity is taken to a high altitude by a carrier craft, the VMS Eve, and let go to perform a controlled descent to Earth, show that everything is bolted on tightly and ready for the more substantial rigors of rocket thrust.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AcHgkr9w7e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/virgin-galactic-flies-second-spaceshiptwo-test-at-new-mexico-spaceport-clearing-the-way-for-powered-spaceflight/">Virgin Galactic flies second SpaceShipTwo test at New Mexico spaceport, clearing the way for powered spaceflight</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Originally this powered flight was intended to happen a bit earlier in the year, but COVID-19-related precautions led to delays. But weather permitting, next week should see Unity flying again.</p>
<p>This flight won&#8217;t be strictly for testing purposes, though: It will be taking up several payloads under NASA&#8217;s Flight Opportunities Program, which contracts with smaller launch providers to perform experiments in and near space. Other aspiring space travel companies, like Blue Origin, have also taken up payloads for brief visits to the edge of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Of course COVID-19 is still a serious issue, so Virgin Galactic is limiting exposure by minimizing people on site: no media or guests, only essential personnel.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>Welcome to an Equity Shot all about the huge, and hugely interesting <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-Slack deal, in which the enterprise social company will be subsumed for the mere price of $27.7 billion.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has notes on the deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">here</a>, and on what Salesforce expects the acquisition will do for its growth rate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-beats-growth-expectations-as-investors-digest-the-slack-acquisition/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the drama, we admit, was removed when the deal was presaged several days ago, but that didn&#8217;t stop the Equity crew from having a lot to say on the matter. Here are some of the topics we discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>How big is this deal, both literally and figuratively?</li>
<li>We talk about the market reception and if the rumors correctly valued the deal</li>
<li>Does Slack deserve snaps or just a simple pat on the back?</li>
<li>What does the deal tells us about vertical SaaS tools?</li>
<li>The COVID-19 effect on remote tools</li>
<li>What does SoftBank have to do with this (and why does SoftBank always have something to do with everything)?</li>
<li>And whole lot of conversation and discussion on Microsoft and its competitor</li>
</ul>
<p>We are back in two days&#8217; time, so don&#8217;t wander too far. Chat soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announces its acquisition of Slack, Amazon brings the Mac mini to the cloud and Google Maps gets a newsfeed. This is your Daily Crunch for December 1, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Salesforce buys <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for $27.7B</strong></p>
<p>The acquisition, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">first reported last month</a>, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">now official</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is a match made in heaven,&#8221; said Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff. &#8220;Together, Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world.&#8221;</p>
<p>This cash-and-stock deal should make Salesforce a more serious competitor in the enterprise communication market. It also seems that Slack (which went public last year) was an obvious target for a takeover, due to an underwhelming stock price and a net loss of $147.6 million during the two quarters ending on July 31 of this year.</p>

It <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2019/lightspeed-pos-ipo-canada/">went public in Canada</a> last year before recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lightspeed-announces-initial-public-offering-in-the-united-states-301126459.html">debuting on the New York Stock Exchange</a> and acquiring another point-of-sale company, ShopKeep, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/lightspeed-to-acquire-point-of-sale-rival-shopkeep-for-440-million/">for $440 million</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/swipely" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="swipely">Upserve <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> acquisition is similarly sized — Lightspeed will pay $123 million in cash, along with stock that will bring the total deal size to around $430 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Upserve was founded back in 2009 as Swipely, one of several startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/05/11/swipely/">encouraging users to share their purchase information with friends</a>. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/21/swipely-series-b/">shifted its offerings</a> to business tools around payments, marketing and loyalty, eventually <a href="https://finovate.com/swipely-rebrands-upserve-focus-serving-restaurants/">rebranding as Upserve</a> as it became increasingly focused on the restaurant market. It also <a href="https://upserve.com/restaurant-insider/upserve-partners-vista-equity-partners-new-strategic-investment-fuel-next-phase-growth/">raised funding from Vista Equity Partners</a>.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, Upserve brought in $40 million in revenue during the 12-month period ending on September 30. The deal is also supposed to grow Lightspeed&#8217;s footprint by 7,000 locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combining forces with Upserve is a strategic next-step in Lightspeed&#8217;s vision of providing the most advanced commerce platform to high-performing businesses around the world,&#8221; said Lightspeed founder and CEO Dax Dasilva in a statement. &#8220;We believe this acquisition will accelerate the product innovation that has enabled Lightspeed customers to tackle the greatest challenge to their industry in decades and will add exceptional leadership to our teams in anticipation of the economic recovery of the global hospitality industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement also claims that the combination of Lightspeed and Upserve&#8217;s teams and technologies will &#8220;enable the industry to more easily navigate the new dining needs made permanent by the COVID-19 pandemic.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk would consider leveraging Tesla&#8217;s mega $554 billion market cap to buy a legacy automaker, but only if it was on friendly terms, the billionaire entrepreneur said Tuesday in a wide-ranging interview with Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner.</p>
<p>Musk, who received an award Tuesday from the media giant, discussed his various interests and businesses, notably SpaceX and Tesla, both of which he leads.</p>
<p>Döpfner noted that Tesla&#8217;s valuation far exceeds the market cap of incumbent automakers like BMW, Daimler and VW, which along with others in the industry once dismissed Musk&#8217;s ability to make electric vehicles mainstream. When asked if it would be a serious option to buy one of the legacy automakers, Musk said it was possible, but only under certain conditions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think we&#8217;re definitely not going to launch a hostile takeover,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;So I suppose if there was a friendly one, if somebody said, &#8216;Hey, we think it would be a good idea to merge with Tesla,&#8217; we certainly could have that conversation. But, you know, we don&#8217;t want it to be a hostile takeover sort of situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla today sits in an enviable position — although Musk said once again that its share price is too high. The company, which will join the S&amp;P 500 Index on December 21, is now the most valuable automaker in the world, surpassing rivals that produce far more vehicles annually.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GGJk0Tv5E5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/tesla-gets-a-spot-on-the-sp-500/">Tesla gets a spot on the S&#038;P 500</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla gets a spot on the S&#038;P 500&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/tesla-gets-a-spot-on-the-sp-500/embed/#?secret=GGJk0Tv5E5" data-secret="GGJk0Tv5E5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Investors have sunk money into Tesla shares largely because they view it more as a technology company than an automaker, even though the vast majority of its revenues today come from car sales.</p>
<p>Musk noted that automakers largely dismissed Tesla in its early days.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first unveiled the Roadster in 2007, I mean, it was just basically, they just said, &#8216;Oh, well, you&#8217;re basically a bunch of fools,&#8217; &#8221; Musk remarked, adding that rivals are now far friendlier than in the past.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://scale.com/">Scale AI</a>, the four-year-old data labeling startup, has discovered that selling the picks and shovels needed to develop and apply artificial intelligence is big business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company, which created a visual data labeling platform that uses software and people to label image, text, voice and video data <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">for companies building machine learning algorithms, has raised another $155 million. The funding round, led by Tiger Global, pushes Scale&#8217;s post-money valuation to more than $3.5 billion. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Importantly, Scale is now a &#8220;break even&#8221; business and is set up to continue to add employees and expand into new markets in a sustainable way, Scale&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Alexandr Wang told TechCrunch. Scale will use the funds to grow its workforce from 200 people to about 350 by the end of next year. (Those employee numbers don&#8217;t include the tens of thousands of contractors it uses to label data.) </span>It&#8217;s also focused on new markets and adding products and platform capabilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Scale got its start by supplying autonomous vehicle companies with the labeled data needed to <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">train machine learning models to develop and deploy robotaxis, self-driving trucks and automated bots used in warehouses and on-demand delivery. Legacy automakers such as General Motors and Toyota, chipmaker Nvidia and a slew of AV startups, including Nuro and Zoox, have used its platform.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More recently, Scale&#8217;s customers have spilled over into government, e-commerce, enterprise automation and robotics. Airbnb, OpenAI, DoorDash and Pinterest are some of its customers. That pace of expansion has accelerated in 2020, according to Wang. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;One thing that we saw, especially in the course of the past year, was that AI is going to be used for so many different things,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re just sort of really at the beginning of this and we want to be prepared for that as it happens.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of that preparation means evolving beyond being just a data labeler. Earlier this year, the company quietly launched Nucleus, an AI development platform that Wang describes as the &#8220;Google Photos for machine learning data sets.&#8221; Nucleus provides customers a way to organize, curate and manage massive data sets, giving companies a means to test their models and measure performance among other tasks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Nucleus is the first product of our future, I would say,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;We definitely see that the next biggest bottleneck for a lot of our customers is, &#8216;how are they going to have the suite of tools and suite of infrastructure that exists today for building out software?&#8217; None of that exists for machine learning.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Eaz63EvMin"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/scale-ai-releases-free-lidar-dataset-to-power-self-driving-car-development/">Scale AI releases free lidar data set to power self-driving car development</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Scale AI releases free lidar data set to power self-driving car development&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/scale-ai-releases-free-lidar-dataset-to-power-self-driving-car-development/embed/#?secret=Eaz63EvMin" data-secret="Eaz63EvMin" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">The plan is to continue to build out Nucleus into a fully integrated platform that helps more companies be able to do AI, Wang said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scale made its first acquisition to support Nucleus with the purchase of a four-person startup called Helia. The team, which has expertise in real-time video and neural network training, will support Nucleus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The one thing that we were noticing across our whole customer base was that more and more customers, even beyond just the self-drive folks were wanting to do AI on real-time video. And so it was becoming this expertise that we knew just wasn&#8217;t going to go away.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Announces-Strong-Third-Quarter-Fiscal-2021-Results/default.aspx">reported</a> its third-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2021, a period that ended October 31, 2020. The CRM giant reported top-line revenue of $5.42 billion, up 20% from the year-ago period. Salesforce also had net income of $1.08 billion and earnings per share of $1.15.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected the company to earn $0.75 per share off revenues of $5.25 billion, according <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRM/analysis?p=CRM">to Yahoo Finance</a>.</p>
<p>Shares of Salesforce were off after-hours, falling around 3.6% at the time of writing. It was not clear if the company&#8217;s share price performance was due to its Q3 results, or its raised Q4 guidance, or its new fiscal 2022 expectations, or the newly announced <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">As TechCrunch reported moments ago</a>, Salesforce will buy Slack for $27.7 billion in a cash and stock deal that was fully priced into shares of the smaller company, which dropped a little over a point on the news, having risen by nearly 50% since the deal&#8217;s existence first leaked.</p>
<p>Holders of Slack will be rewarded for their patience. Now it&#8217;s up to Salesforce leadership to prove that the huge buy will help boost the company&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>Salesforce told investors today that it anticipates Q4 fiscal 2021 revenues of $5.665 billion to $5.675 billion, which works out to growth of around 17% from the year-ago period. The company also anticipates that it will grow around 17% in Q1 of its fiscal 2022.</p>
<p>But Salesforce expects to grow 21% in all of its fiscal 2022. How does it intend to accelerate? Its projections include Slack:</p>
<blockquote><p>Full Year FY22 revenue guidance includes contributions from Slack Technologies, Inc. of approximately $600 million, net of purchase accounting, and assumes a closing date in late Q2 and Acumen Solutions, Inc. of approximately $150 million, net of purchase accounting, and assumes a closing date within Q2.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Salesforce investors, after two anticipated quarters of 17% growth coming up, your company will accelerate up to 21% growth for the next fiscal year. Is that worth $27.7 billion?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Join us virtually while we explore inclusive hiring, access to funding for Black, Latinx and Indigenous people, and workplace tools to foster inclusion and belonging. We’ll also examine the experiences of gig workers and formerly incarcerated people who are often left out of Silicon Valley’s wealth cycle. Rounding out the program will be a discussion about the role of venture capital in creating a more inclusive tech ecosystem. We’ll discuss all of that and more at the second installation of TC Sessions: Justice.</p>

<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s mission is to support early-stage startups, and that’s what TC Early Stage is all about. Designed for founders who are in their early innings, anywhere from pre-seed through Series A, we’re here to give entrepreneurs the info they need to get ahead. With that in mind, the event’s heart is dozens of breakout sessions run by experts and curated by TechCrunch editors focusing on topics like raising a first seed round, landing a Series A, considering your first term sheet, recruiting a fabulous team and how to build a tech stack you won’t regret (to name a few). There is so much how-to content we’re coming to you twice in 2021 over four days total.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

It&#8217;s where hundreds of startups across a variety of categories tell their stories to the 10,000 attendees from all around the world. It&#8217;s the ultimate Silicon Valley experience, where the leaders of the startup world gather to ask questions, make connections and be inspired.</p>

<p>TechCrunch editors will explore all angles of the SaaS market, from generating early market interest, to landing venture checks, to scaling, to selling and selling out. Software as a service has become the de facto startup business model thanks to its inherent revenue durability, and predictability. But how to best build, fund and deliver SaaS products is constantly changing, and the modern founder can’t afford to be left behind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>, the CRM powerhouse that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/how-salesforce-beat-its-own-target-to-reach-20b-run-rate-ahead-of-schedule/">surpassed $20 billion in annual revenue</a>, announced today it is wading deeper into enterprise social by acquiring <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> in a $27.7 billion megadeal. Rumors of a pending deal surfaced last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">causing Slack&#8217;s stock price to spike</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff didn&#8217;t mince words on his latest purchase. &#8220;This is a match made in heaven. Together, Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world,&#8221; Benioff said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO Stewart Butterfield was no less effusive than his future boss. &#8220;As software plays a more and more critical role in the performance of every organization, we share a vision of reduced complexity, increased power and flexibility, and ultimately a greater degree of alignment and organizational agility. Personally, I believe this is the most strategic combination in the history of software, and I can’t wait to get going,&#8221; Butterfield said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Every worker at every company needs to communicate, something that Slack can ably empower. What&#8217;s more, it also facilitates external communication with customers and partners, something that should be quite useful for a company like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and its family of offerings.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5LjnuoNQm4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">Slack’s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Slack’s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/embed/#?secret=5LjnuoNQm4" data-secret="5LjnuoNQm4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ultimately, Slack was ripe for the taking. Entering 2020 it had lost around 40% of its value since it went public. Consider that after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/slacks-earnings-detail-how-covid-19-is-both-a-help-and-a-hindrance-to-cloud-growth/">most recent earnings report</a>, the company lost 16% of its value, and before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">the Salesforce deal leaked</a>, the company was worth only a few dollars per share more than its direct listing reference price. Toss in net losses of $147.6 million during the two quarters ending July 31, 2020, Slack&#8217;s uninspiring public valuation and its winding path to profitability and it was a sitting target for a takeover like this one. The only surprise here is the price.</p>
<p>Slack&#8217;s current valuation, according to both Yahoo and Google Finance, is just over $25 billion, which, given its very modest price change after-hours means that the market priced the company somewhat effectively. Slack is up around 48% from its valuation that preceded the deal becoming known.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The great enterprise chat race&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/18/the-great-enterprise-chat-race/embed/#?secret=vjyU4lan52" data-secret="vjyU4lan52" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new deal also puts Salesforce more on par &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/18/the-great-enterprise-chat-race/">and in competition</a> &#8212; with its arch rival and sometime friend Microsoft, whose Teams product has been<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/stewart-butterfield-says-microsoft-sees-slack-as-existential-threat/"> directly challenging Slack</a> in the market. Microsoft, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/04/source-microsoft-mulled-an-8-billion-bid-for-slack-will-focus-on-skype-instead/">which passed on buying Slack</a> in the past for a fraction of what Salesforce is paying today, has made Teams a key priority in recent quarters, loathe to cede any portion of the enterprise software market to another company.</p>
<p>What really has set Slack apart from the pack, at least initially, was its ability to integrate with other enterprise software. When you combined that with bots, those intelligent digital helpers, the company could potentially provide Salesforce customers with a central place to work without changing focus because everything they need to do can be done in Slack.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s deal comes after Salesforce’s purchase of Quip in 2016 for $750 million. Quip brought to the SaaS giant a way of socially sharing documents, and when paired with the Slack acquisition gives Salesforce a much more robust social story to tell than its internal option Chatter, an early attempt at enterprise social that never really caught on.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Salesforce was interested in Twitter in 2016, the same year that Microsoft was reportedly interested in Slack, but eventually walked away from that deal when shareholders objected, not wanting to deal with the controversial side of the social platform.</p>
<p>Slack was founded in 2013, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/">its origins go back </a>to an online multiplayer game company called Glitch that was founded in 2009. While the game was ultimately a failure, the startup developed an internal messaging system in the process of building that company that later evolved into Slack.</p>
<p>The company’s historic growth helped Slack raise more than $1 billion while private, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/slack-raising/">earning an impressive $7 billion</a> valuation before going public last year. But while the Glitch-to-unicorn story appears simple, Slack has always faced entrenched competition from the likes of not only Microsoft, but also Cisco, Facebook, Google and even Asana and Monday.com.</p>
<p>For Slack, the path to the public markets was fraught with hype and outsized expectation. The company was famous, or as famous as an enterprise software company can be. At the time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/slacks-value-rockets-as-stock-closes-up-48-5-in-public-debut/">it felt like its debut</a> was the start of a long tenure as an indie company. Instead, that public life has been cut short by a huge check. Such is the dog-eat-dog world of tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/elon-musk" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="elon-musk">Elon Musk <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was given an award from media giant Axel Springer on Tuesday, and he sat down to provide a wide-ranging interview that covered topics including space, Tesla, AI and even underpopulation. Musk addressed SpaceX&#8217;s Mars ambitions first, providing current timelines he&#8217;s working toward for reaching the red planet with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Starship, the next-generation spacecraft it hopes to fly in a new high-altitude test sometime later this week.</p>
<p>Musk said that he expects humans will land on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mars" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mars">Mars <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in around six years, and that he&#8217;s &#8220;fairly confident&#8221; in that timeline. That&#8217;s based on the fact that Earth and Mars are in sync in terms of their relative orbits around the sun approximately every 26 months. SpaceX plans to do an uncrewed launch and landing on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mars" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mars">Mars <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> hopefully at the next opportunity in about two years from now. He added that with luck, a first human landing could happen during the next Mars-Earth synchronization after that, in four years instead of six.</p>
<p>Asked when Musk&#8217;s own first trip to orbit would happen, he answered &#8220;possibly two or three years,&#8221; though he qualified that his primary focus is to ensure the technology is in place to enable &#8220;a lot of people to go to Mars and make life interplanetary, and to have a base on the moon,&#8221; downplaying his own personal spaceflight goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He also reiterated his ambition to eventually be buried on Mars (though not due to accidental death on impact in a spacecraft crash) and talked about while he believes that becoming a spacefaring society is existential in his opinion, and will ultimately be necessary for human survival, he also hopes to make it fun, exciting and attractive rather than a necessary risk.</p>
<p>Starship is gearing up for its first big high-altitude flight test, as mentioned. It&#8217;ll be flying at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Texas development facility, and that test launch could happen as early as later this week, though the company still has to conduct a key static engine test fire of its prototype ahead of an actual flight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People are <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-companies-look-same-tiktok-stories-snapchat-spotlight-2dd1da51-cf45-4f6b-a0ab-0db79f6b7793.html">getting frustrated</a> that Stories <a href="https://gizmodo.com/there-are-now-stories-everywhere-even-on-spotify-1845770184">are everywhere now</a>, but Google Maps is keeping it old school. Instead of adding tiny circles to the top of the app&#8217;s screen, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Maps is introducing its own news feed. Technically, Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/discover-more-with-google-maps-community-feed">calls its new feature</a> the &#8220;Community Feed,&#8221; as it includes posts from a local area. However, it&#8217;s organized as any other news feed would be &#8212; a vertically scrollable feed with posts you can &#8220;Like&#8221; by tapping on a little thumbs-up icon.</p>
<p>The feed, which is found with the Explore tab of the Google Maps app, is designed to make it easier to find the most recent news, updates and recommendations from trusted local sources. This includes posts business owners create using Google My Business to alert customers to new deals, menu updates and other offers. At launch, Google says the focus will be on highlighting posts from food and drink businesses.</p>
<p>For years, businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/20/watch-out-facebook-google-maps-on-ios-now-lets-users-track-their-favorite-businesses-too/">have been able to make these sorts of posts</a> using Google&#8217;s tools. But previously, users would have to specifically tap to follow the business&#8217;s profile in order to receive their updates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, these same sort of posts will be surfaced to even those Google Maps users who didn&#8217;t take the additional step of following a particular business. This increased exposure has impacted the posts&#8217; views, Google says. In early tests of Community Feed ahead of its public launch, Google found that businesses&#8217; posts saw more than double the number of views than before the feed existed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081320" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081320" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2081320" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Google_Maps_Community_Feed.gif?w=310" alt="" width="310" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2081320" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to posts from businesses, the new Community Feed will feature content posted by<a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/better-local-recommendations-google-maps/"> Google users you follow</a> as well as recent reviews from <a href="https://maps.google.com/localguides/">Google&#8217;s Local Guides</a> &#8212; the volunteer program where users share their knowledge about local places in order to <a href="https://support.google.com/local-guides/answer/6281793">earn perks</a>, such as profile badges, early access to Google features and more. Select publishers will participate in the Community Feed, too, including The Infatuation and other news sources from Google News, when relevant.</p>
<p>Much of the information found in the Community Feed was available elsewhere in Google Maps before today&#8217;s launch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5W9hym4DvJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/google-maps-adds-street-level-details-in-select-cities-more-colorful-imagery-worldwide/">Google Maps adds street-level details in select cities, more colorful imagery worldwide</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google Maps adds street-level details in select cities, more colorful imagery worldwide&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/google-maps-adds-street-level-details-in-select-cities-more-colorful-imagery-worldwide/embed/#?secret=5W9hym4DvJ" data-secret="5W9hym4DvJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For example, the Google Maps&#8217; Updates tab offered a similar feed that included businesses&#8217; posts along with news, recommendations, stories and other features designed to encourage discovery. Meanwhile, the Explore tab grouped businesses into thematic groupings (e.g. outdoor dining venues, cocktail bars, etc.) at the top of the screen, then allowed users to browse other lists and view area photos.</p>
<p>With the update, those groups of businesses by category will still sit at the top of the screen, but the rest of the tab is dedicated to the scrollable feed. This gives the tab a more distinct feel than it had before. It could even position Google to venture into video posts in the future, given the current popularity of TikTok-style  short-form video feeds that have now been cloned by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Snapchat.</p>

<p>Today, it&#8217;s a more standard feed, however. As you scroll down, you can tap &#8220;Like&#8221; on those posts you find interesting to help better inform your future recommendations. You also can tap &#8220;Follow&#8221; on businesses you want to hear more from, which will send their alerts to your Updates tab, as well. Thankfully, there aren&#8217;t comments.</p>
<p>Google hopes the change will encourage users to visit the app more often in order to find out what&#8217;s happening in their area &#8212; whether that&#8217;s a new post from a business or a review from another user detailing some fun local activity, like a day trip or new hiking spot, for example.</p>
<p>The feature can be used when traveling or researching other areas, too, as the &#8220;Community Feed&#8221; you see is designated not based on where you live or your current location, but rather where you&#8217;re looking on the map.</p>
<p>The feed is the latest in what&#8217;s been a series of updates designed to make Google Maps more of a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> rival. Over the past few years, Google Maps has added features that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/25/google-maps-takes-on-facebook-pages-with-new-follow-feature-for-tracking-businesses/"> allowed users to follow businesses</a>, much like Facebook does, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/google-my-business-app-revamp-challenges-facebook-pages/">message those businesses </a>directly in the app, similar to Messenger. Businesses, meanwhile, have been able to set up their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/google-ramps-up-competition-with-facebook-pages-with-new-tools-for-local-businesses/">own profile in Google Maps,</a> where they could add a logo, a cover photo and pick a short name &#8212; also a lot like Facebook Pages offer today.</p>
<p>With the launch of a news feed-style feature, Google&#8217;s attempt to copy Facebook is even more obvious.</p>
<p>Google says the feature is rolling out globally on Google Maps for iOS and Android.</p>

							<span class="byline__author-name">James Sutcliffe</span>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		James Sutcliffe is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.thefoundingnetwork.com/home-page">The Founding Network</a>, a collaboration platform for high-growth founders. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">If I were to pick one thing that unites the global tech scene in terms of culture I would point to the respect and reverence accorded to startup founders.</p>
<p>After all, creating your own company is an ambition many of us harbor. It can bring with it unparalleled freedom, a lasting legacy, prestige, wealth and the ability to do good. Across social and traditional media the feats of founders big and small are lauded for their genius on a daily basis. Many entrepreneurs go to great lengths to showcase their backbreaking hard work and eye-popping success. An outsider would be forgiven for believing that every founder is living the dream as a result of their talent and toil.</p>
<p>Of course, as with nearly every image projected online, the reality is quite different. There is a seldom talked about price of being a founder — the impact on one&#8217;s mental health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/health-mental-health-5970ebcf42bac6427480e29b8fe5c0ea">A recent study</a> by the National Institute of Mental Health found that 72% of entrepreneurs are directly or indirectly impacted by mental health issues. This compares to 48% of the general population. The damage can also affect loved ones — 23% of entrepreneurs report that they have family members with problems, which is 7% higher than the relations of nonentrepreneurs.</p>
<p>I am in no way a mental health expert. But what I do know from both my own experience and speaking to scores of business owners I work with is that being a founder is an inherently lonely job. Pressure is high and uncertainty pervades every decision. Fear of failure is ever present. Unaddressed, these issues can take a serious toll.</p>
<p>The unpalatable truth is that the situation appears to be getting worse.<a href="https://michaelafreemanmd.com/Research_files/Are%20Entrepreneurs%20Touched%20with%20Fire%20(pre-pub%20n)%204-17-15.pdf"> A similar study conducted in 2015</a> by Dr. Michael A. Freeman found the rate of mental health issues among founders to be lower — at 50%. While comparing different research pieces is inexact, we only need to look at how the global recession has damaged many companies and how working from home has contributed to feelings of isolation, to know that the environment for startups has got harder this year. Added to this mix is how social media continues to promote an unhealthy fetishization of hustle culture and founding myths.</p>
<p>A number of founders have told me that they have constant feelings of inadequacy and guilt when they compare themselves to the startup gurus who celebrate working 24/7, are constantly selling, raising money or making their millions. They feel they should be working harder or be doing better — just like all the people they read about.</p>
<p>So how do we address this? The first step is talking about it. This means having an environment where we can be honest that not everything is always fine. Speaking to a fellow founder, not about commercial concerns, but about personal worries can be revelatory. I’ve seen it happen in our community. It’s like an &#8220;Emperor’s New Clothes&#8221; moment.</p>
<p>The myth of the bulletproof, genius, hustling founder can disappear in a puff of smoke as people suddenly realize they are not alone. They find that the concerns, anxieties and uncertainties they feel are almost universal.</p>
<p>Experienced founders can provide invaluable support to people new to the startup scene. They can share their experiences, both failures and success, and reveal some of their coping mechanisms. I would strongly advise founders who are experiencing some of the worries I’ve outlined to actively seek out advice from both their peers and potential mentors — much in the way they may seek out commercial guidance.</p>
<p>Next, we need to address how we tackle the culture and myths around being a founder. Business owners need to know that many of the extraordinary &#8220;success stories&#8221; they see celebrated online are exactly that — extraordinary.</p>
<p>Similarly, those that promote the principle that working all hours is the only way to be successful are at best talking about what works for them, and are at worst, engaging in a performance to achieve attention. We need to think carefully about how we respond to these posts. There is a fine line between being supportive and enabling unhealthy or damaging behavior and philosophy.</p>
<p>After all, success in the startup scene is all relative. For some owning a small business that makes them a decent income with a good work-life balance is the goal. For others, it is simply being able to do what they love in the way that they want. Very few will get the exit that makes them a millionaire, and an infinitesimally small minority will build the next <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. I cannot stress enough how important it is for founders to keep their aims and ambitions in perspective and ignore the noise they hear online.</p>
<p>More broadly, the industry, including the media, does need to get wiser about how it views and represents founders. For example, a pervasive myth is that some of the biggest tech companies in the world started in garages with no money, then through the genius and sheer bloodymindedness of their founder they were grown into a massive corporation.</p>
<p>The reality is that the vast majority of these tech companies benefited from substantial seed capital from family or connections almost from day one. These founders were also quickly surrounded by highly talented people who did a lot of the heavy lifting and, whisper it, a truckload of good luck. In short, the idea of the superhuman founder perpetuated in the industry is, in nearly all cases, nonsense.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, there are also issues around how we frame success and failure.</p>
<p>Success, as I’ve mentioned earlier, is nearly always couched in the most basic numerical terms. The &#8220;unicorn&#8221; label is bandied about so often that many people fail to realize that it’s simply a valuation that a few investors have given a company. It does not reflect whether the business is actually successful in the traditional sense, i.e., making money. Generally, the startup scene celebrates and idolizes founders who make big exits or achieve &#8220;unicorn status&#8221; — less is spoken about the thousands of SMEs that employ people, develop and patent new tech, make a tidy profit and pay taxes.</p>
<p>With failure, there is an altogether different problem. The startup scene downplays failure as par for the course. It is, on the face of it, one of the industry’s great virtues. It enables people to try without fear of embarrassment. However, in practice, it can actually minimize real-world fears nearly all founders have. Failure cannot just be brushed off if you’ve devoted years of your life, spent a lot of money and have staff who rely on you. By simply thinking of failure as part of the process we cannot address and talk about this real source of concern in an open way. &#8220;Fail fast&#8221; only works for those who can afford it.</p>
<p>Individually, these issues may seem like nothing but white noise and the cure for suffering founders may simply be to get off social media. Unfortunately, it isn’t that simple. Social and traditional media is amplifying startup culture, not creating it. The same tropes are on display at every tech conference and meetup. To fit in, the founder is expected to be a fearless, genius visionary. Deviation from this norm, such as by displaying vulnerability around mental health, is by inference, failure.</p>
<p>Despite its shortcomings in relation to diversity, the startup scene is generally one of the most progressive, collaborative and open industries in the world. These virtues are ideally suited to tackling the reluctance to discuss mental health and creating the network of support that ensures people don’t suffer alone.</p>
<p>To make this happen, we need to dispense with the myths and hagiography around being a founder and be more honest about what the reality of running a business actually entails.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, the early-stage, mission-focused, San Francisco-based venture firm Obvious Ventures released a <a href="https://obvious.com/wpr2020">very readable overview</a> of how each of its portfolio companies is benefiting the world in its own way.</p>
<p>Its report shines a light on the grocery deliver service <a href="https://www.goodeggs.com/sfbay/home">Good Eggs</a>, for example, sharing that roughly 70% of the products sold by the company are grown or produced within 250 miles of its food hub in Oakland, Ca. That matters because fresher food is <a href="https://rodaleinstitute.org/blog/why-local-food-is-better-for-you/">more nutritious</a>. The electric bus company <a href="https://www.proterra.com/">Proterra</a> is meanwhile starting to save cities millions of dollars in diesel fuel costs while also eliminating thousands of tons of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of investing to which more people are gravitating, says Obvious&#8217;s cofounder and managing director <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/james-joaquin" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="james-joaquin">James Joaquin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. We talked with him last week along with one of his firm cofounders, the serial entrepreneur Ev Williams. You can find part of our conversation with Williams <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/talking-techs-exodus-twitters-new-labels-and-mediums-future-with-founder-ev-williams/">here</a>; below, we talked mostly with Joaquin about how Obvious is thinking about 2021 and what the team finds most interesting these days. (Hint, hallucinogens are now in the mix.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: For founders reading this, how many companies is Obvious talking with on a weekly basis right now?</strong></p>
<p>JJ: Annually, we look at or consider about 2,000 investment opportunities. It&#8217;s obviously not completely linear distribution, but in terms of incoming investment opportunities that we track, it&#8217;s a very large number. Most of those get filtered right up front as either being in a geography we don&#8217;t invest in because we&#8217;re focused on North America &#8212; we&#8217;re not focused on Europe or Asia &#8212; or maybe they&#8217;re what we would call world neutral or world negative [so] outside of our thematic areas. But then a subset of those our team will meet with, and the bottom of that funnel is that we make between 10 to 12 investments per year.</p>
<p><strong>TC: At some firms, everyone is a generalist. At Obvious, each partner seems to have a specific focus, like your focus in part on plant startups. Is this correct? </strong></p>
<p>JJ:  That&#8217;s one of the areas that that that I focus on, for sure. I mean, we&#8217;ve got five investing partners in the firm. Within food, I lead our work in plant-based protein and plant-forward food and consumer products companies. Thanks to work that Ev and [Twitter cofounder Biz Stone] did, we were very early investors in <a href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/">Beyond Meat</a>. We&#8217;re also an early lead investor in <a href="https://miyokos.com/">Miyoko&#8217;s Creamery</a>, which is a plant-based butter and cheese company that is one of our fastest-growing portfolio companies right now.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do deals get green-lit?</strong></p>
<p>JJ: The inside baseball is that we tend to form two-person teams on a given deal when it reaches the due diligence stage. So there&#8217;s always a lead partner or managing director who&#8217;s championing the deal, but there&#8217;s a second person from the investment team working on it, too. Then ultimately, a CEO or a management team presents to the full investment committee before we make a decision to to issue a term sheet.</p>
<p>The process isn&#8217;t quite unanimous, but each managing director at the firm has the power of veto, so if someone feels really strongly that Obvious shouldn&#8217;t make that investment, they have that power to stop an investment, but that rarely occurs.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who are you seeing that&#8217;s newer to the table? More firms say they are paying attention to the themes on which you&#8217;ve been focused the start.</strong></p>
<p>JJ: I would say there are a number of new firms that kind of are similar age to us that have also been investing in some of these frontiers. Firms like Lux capital have done a lot of co-investing with us in the computational biology space. Data Collective is a firm that we&#8217;ve co-invested with in some of the full stack healthcare work that we do. S2G Ventures is a great plant-based protein food firm that we&#8217;ve co-invested with,  so those are some of the new faces that we think are part of this world-positive generation of investors trying to solve big problems with startups and with cutting edge tech.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you interested in hallucinogens? </strong></p>
<p>JJ: It&#8217;s absolutely a theme where we&#8217;ve been doing research. I should say we&#8217;re interested in it specifically for medical use, but we think that these former Schedule 1 drugs like ketamine, MDMA [commonly known as ecstasy], and psilocybin have great potential to solve the mental health crisis that not just the US but that the world is seeing ramped to be a top five human health issue. In the early trials around treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, suicidal ideation, these molecules are showing great promise.</p>
<p>We think there&#8217;s an opportunity to create a full-stack healthcare company similar to what we&#8217;ve done with <a href="https://www.virtahealth.com/">Virta Health</a> for [type 2] diabetes, or the work that <a href="https://www.devoted.com/">DevotedHealth</a>, one of our portfolio companies, is doing for seniors in the Medicare space. We think there&#8217;s going to be one or more new mental health companies built around this new kind of drug-assisted therapy that these molecules will enable.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Ev, you&#8217;re an investor in a company that last month announced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/sanity-a-platform-to-build-and-manage-content-flows-on-sites-raises-9-3m-from-ev-williams-threshold-and-more/#:~:text=Sanity%2C%20a%20platform%20to%20build,Williams%2C%20Threshold%20and%20more%20%7C%20TechCrunch"> small seed round</a> called <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sanity" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sanity">Sanity, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a platform that helps users build and manage content flows on sites, which seems like a perfect fit for you. When is a deal an Ev Williams deal versus an Obvious Ventures deal?</strong></p>
<p>EW: That was one of the rare deals that I did separate from the firm. I used to do a bit of angel investing before before we formed Obvious and one of the great reliefs for me has been to just send all my deal flow to James and the team. However, as James described, there&#8217;s a focus at Obvious both in deal size and area that doesn&#8217;t include everything, so Sanity is basically an enterprise product and the reason it was interesting to me is is because of the future infrastructure of how content is [distributed] is super interesting to me for Medium&#8217;s purposes. I liked what Sanity is doing. I was really impressed. It just didn&#8217;t align necessarily with the focus areas of Obvious, so that&#8217;s why I did that deal. But it&#8217;s really rare.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What percentage of the firm&#8217;s deals are inbound versus outbound?</strong></p>
<p>JJ: We make sure we have the bandwidth to do both. We call it hunting and farming. Farming is farming the inbox, [and reviewing] all those introductions from our networks that come in. Probably 60% to 70% of our investment portfolio came from that inbound, but 30% to 40% came from hunting, which is building apoint of view around a theme that we care about,then going out and mapping out who are all the entrepreneurs who are doing work in that area, and who are the angel investors and pre-seed funds that are doing good work in that area, because those are important relationships for us as well.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s your position on Bitcoin?</strong></p>
<p>JJ: We definitely did our research and we tried to answer the question: are there world-positive applications for blockchain writ large and then specifically for Bitcoin as a blockchain cryptocurrency? We haven&#8217;t found any that we&#8217;ve made an investment in yet, but we&#8217;re open to the idea we continue to research that space.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You recently added Tina Hoang-To to the team; she joined you from the late-stage and crossover fund Technology Crossover Ventures. Will Obvious be making more growth-stage investments?</strong></p>
<p>JJ: We&#8217;re known for our early stage work, but from day one, we crafted a barbell strategy where we said, because we&#8217;re thematic, because we want to find the best plant protein companies, find the best electric transportation companies, we knew that some of those companies that we would be hunting might already be at the growth stage. So we architected our funds to be 75% early stage and 25% emerging growth roughly. Now, with the addition of Tina, we&#8217;re basically increasing our horsepower [on that front]. We&#8217;ve got someone better and smarter than us who knows [growth stage companies] really well.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Might we see Obvious form a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, around a growth-stage company?</strong></p>
<p>JJ: Ev, I know you&#8217;ve gotten incoming about SPACs. Our take at Obvious is that we do not have any plans to create an Obvious Ventures SPAC. We tend to stick to our knitting. I will say that a number of our companies that are that are at the growth stage, [meaning in the] $50 million to $100 million dollars [range] of annual revenue where they&#8217;re thinking about public markets, they&#8217;re being approached by a number of SPAC [sponsors] as interesting targets. So we&#8217;re seeing that, and it&#8217;s really up to our founders, not us [if they move forward with these]. But we certainly have a voice on the board and we&#8217;re considering in some cases, our portfolio companies going public via a SPAC</p>
<p>EW: I haven&#8217;t haven&#8217;t looked into [SPACs] seriously yet. I think liquidity can be a good thing, and hopefully many of these SPACs will work out, but I&#8217;m kind of in a wait-and see-mode like a lot of people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IT security software company Ivanti has acquired two security companies: Enterprise mobile security firm MobileIron and corporate virtual network provider Pulse Secure.</p>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday, Ivanti <a href="https://www.ivanti.com/company/press-releases/2020/ivanti-acquires-mobileiron-and-pulse-secure">said</a> it bought MobileIron for $872 million in stock — with 91% of the shareholders voting in favor of the deal — and acquired Pulse Secure from its parent company Siris Capital Group, but did not disclose the buying price.</p>
<p>The deals have now closed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ivanti was founded in 2017 after Clearlake Capital, which owned Heat Software, bought Landesk from private equity firm Thoma Bravo, and <a href="https://www.ivanti.com/company/press-releases/2017/clearlake-capital-to-acquire-landesk-and-combine-w">merged</a> the two companies to form Ivanti. The combined company, headquartered in Salt Lake City, focuses largely on enterprise IT security, including endpoint, asset and supply chain management. Since its founding, Ivanti went on to acquire several other companies, including U.K.-based <a href="https://www.ivanti.com/company/press-releases/2017/ivanti-acquires-concorde">Concorde Solutions</a> and <a href="https://www.ivanti.com/company/press-releases/2017/ivanti-acquires-res">RES Software</a>.</p>
<p>If MobileIron and Pulse Secure seem familiar, both companies have faced their fair share of headlines this year after hackers began exploiting vulnerabilities found in their technologies.</p>
<p>Just last month, the U.K. government&#8217;s National Cyber Security Center <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/alert-multiple-actors-attempt-exploit-mobileiron-vulnerability">published an alert</a> that warned of a remotely executable bug in MobileIron, patched in June, allowing hackers to break into enterprise networks. U.S. Homeland Security&#8217;s cybersecurity advisory unit CISA said that the bug was being <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-283a">actively used</a> by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, typically associated with state-backed hackers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CISA also warned that Pulse Secure was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/enterprise-security-flaws/">one of several corporate VPN providers</a> with vulnerabilities that have since become a favorite among hackers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">particularly ransomware actors</a>, who abuse the bugs to gain access to a network and deploy the file-encrypting ransomware.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A few years ago, building a bottom-up SaaS company – defined as a firm where the average purchasing decision is made without ever speaking to a salesperson – was a novel concept. Today, by our count, at least 30% of the Cloud 100 are now bottom-up.</p>
<p>For the first time, individual employees are influencing the tooling decisions of their companies versus having these decisions mandated by senior executives. Self-serve businesses thrive on this momentum, leveraging individuals as their evangelists, to grow from a single use-case to small teams, and ultimately into whole company deployments.</p>
<p>In a truly self-service model, individual users can sign up and try the product on their own. There is no need to get compliance approval for sensitive data or to get IT support for integrations — everything can be managed by the line-level users themselves. Then that person becomes an internal champion, driving adoption across the organization.</p>
<p>Today, some of the most well-known software companies such as Datadog, MongoDB, Slack and Zoom, to name a few, are built with a primarily bottom-up product-led sales approach.</p>
<p>In this piece, we will take a closer look at this trend — and specifically how it has fundamentally altered pricing — and at a framework for mapping pricing to customer value.</p>
<h2>Aligning value with pricing</h2>
<p>In a bottom-up SaaS world, pricing has to be transparent and standardized (at least for the most part, see below). It’s the only way your product can sell itself. In practice, this means you can no longer experiment as you go, with salespeople using their gut instinct to price each deal. You need a concrete strategy that aligns customer value with pricing.</p>
<p>To do this well, you need to deeply understand your customers and how they use your product. Once you do, you can “MAP” them to help align pricing with value.</p>
<h2>The MAP customer value framework</h2>
<p>The MAP customer value framework requires deeply understanding your customers in order to clearly identify and articulate their needs across <strong>Metrics</strong>, <strong>Activities</strong> and <strong>People</strong>.</p>
<p>Not all elements of MAP should determine your pricing, but chances are that one of them will be the right anchor for your pricing model:</p>
<p><strong>Metrics</strong>: Metrics can include things like minutes, messages, meetings, data and storage. What are the key metrics your customers care about? Is there a threshold of value associated with these metrics? By tracking key metrics early on, you’ll be able to understand if growing a certain metric increases value for the customer. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom — Minutes: Free with a 40-minute time limit on group meetings.</li>
<li>Slack — Messages: Free until 10,000 total messages.</li>
<li>Airtable — Records: Free until 1,200 records.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Activity</strong>: How do your customers really use your product and how do they describe themselves? Are they creators? Are they editors? Do different customers use your product differently? Instead of metrics, a key anchor for pricing may be the different roles users have within an organization and what they want and need in your product. If you choose to anchor on activity, you will need to align feature sets and capabilities with usage patterns (e.g., creators get access to deeper tooling than viewers, or admins get high privileges versus line-level users). For example:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AWS has launched a new hardware device, the <a title="" href="https://aws.amazon.com/panorama">AWS Panorama Appliance</a>, which, alongside the <a title="" href="https://aws.amazon.com/panorama/panorama-device-sdk">AWS Panorama SDK</a>, will transform existing on-premises cameras into computer vision-enabled super-powered surveillance devices.</p>
<p>Pitching the hardware as a new way for customers to inspect parts on manufacturing lines, ensure that safety protocols are being followed, or analyze traffic in retail stores, the new automation service is part of the theme of this AWS re:Invent event &#8212; automate everything.</p>
<p>Along with computer vision models that companies can develop using <a title="" href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">Amazon SageMaker</a>, the new Panorama Appliance can run those models on video feeds from networked or network-enabled cameras.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Soon, AWS expects to have the Panorama SDK that can be used by device manufacturers to build Panorama-enabled devices.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has pitched surveillance technologies to developers and the enterprise before. Back in 2017, the company <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/">unveiled DeepLens</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/13/amazon-starts-shipping-its-249-deeplens-ai-camera-for-developers/">which it began selling one year later</a>. It was a way for developers to build prototype machine learning models and for Amazon to get comfortable with different ways of commercializing computer vision capabilities.</p>
<p>As we wrote in 2018:</p>
<blockquote><p>DeepLens is deeply integrated with the rest of AWS’s services. Those include the AWS IoT service Greengrass, which you use to deploy models to DeepLens, for example, but also SageMaker, Amazon’s newest tool for building machine learning models&#8230; Indeed, if all you want to do is run one of the pre-built samples that AWS provides, it shouldn’t take you more than 10 minutes to set up &#8230; DeepLens and deploy one of these models to the camera. Those project templates include an object detection model that can distinguish between 20 objects (though it had some issues with toy dogs, as you can see in the image above), a style transfer example to render the camera image in the style of van Gogh, a face detection model and a model that can distinguish between cats and dogs and one that can recognize about 30 different actions (like playing guitar, for example). The DeepLens team is also adding a model for tracking head poses. Oh, and there’s also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs">hot dog detection model</a>.</p>

<p>Amazon has had a lot of experience (and controversy) when it comes to the development of machine learning technologies for video. The company&#8217;s Rekognition software sparked protests and pushback, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/using-computer-vision-applications-at-the-edge/">which led to a moratorium on the use of the technology</a>.</p>
<p>And the company has tried to incorporate more machine learning capabilities into its consumer-facing Ring cameras, as well.</p>
<p>Still, enterprises continue to clamor for new machine learning-enabled video recognition technologies for security, safety and quality control. Indeed, as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on, new protocols around building use and occupancy are being adopted to not only adapt to the current epidemic, but plan ahead for spaces and protocols that can help mitigate the severity of the next one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the areas that is often left behind when it comes to cloud computing is the industrial sector. That&#8217;s because these facilities often have older equipment or proprietary systems that aren&#8217;t well-suited to the cloud. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wants to change that, and today the company announced a slew of new services at AWS re:Invent aimed at helping the industrial sector understand their equipment and environments better.</p>
<p>For starters, the company announced <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Monitron, which is designed to monitor equipment and send signals to the engineering team when the equipment could be breaking down. If industrial companies can know when their equipment is breaking, it allows them to repair it on their own terms, rather than waiting until after it breaks down and having the equipment down at what could be an inopportune time.</p>
<p>As AWS CEO Andy Jassy says, an experienced engineer will know when equipment is breaking down by a certain change in sound or a vibration, but if the machine could tell you even before it got that far, it would be a huge boost to these teams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;a lot of companies either don&#8217;t have sensors, they&#8217;re not modern powerful sensors, or they are not consistent and they don&#8217;t know how to take that data from the sensors and send it to the cloud, and they don&#8217;t know how to build machine learning models, and our manufacturing companies we work with are asking [us] just solve this [and] build an end-to-end solution. So I&#8217;m excited to announce today the launch of Amazon Monotron, which is an end-to-end solution for equipment monitoring,&#8221; Jassy said.</p>
<p>The company builds a machine learning model that understands what a normal state looks like, then uses that information to find anomalies and send back to the team in a mobile app information about equipment that needs maintenance now based on the data the model is seeing.</p>
<p>Amazon has something for those companies that may have a more modern system and don&#8217;t need the complete package that Monotron offers. If you have modern sensors, but you don&#8217;t have a sophisticated machine learning model, Amazon can ingest this data and apply its machine learning algorithms to find anomalies just as it can with Monotron.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we have something for this group of customers as well to announce today, which is the launch of Amazon Lookout for Equipment, which does anomaly detection for industrial machinery,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In addition, the company announced the Panorama Appliance for companies using cameras at the edge that want to use more sophisticated computer vision, but might not have the most modern equipment to do that. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to announce today the launch of the AWS Panorama Appliance, which is a new hardware appliance [that allows] organizations to add computer vision to existing on premises smart cameras,&#8221; Jassy told AWS re:Invent today.</p>

<p>In addition, it also announced a Panorama SDK to help hardware vendors build smarter cameras based on Panorama.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AWS today closed out its first re:Invent keynote with a focus on edge computing. The company launched two smaller appliances for its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/">Outposts service</a>, which originally brought AWS as a managed service and appliance right into its customers&#8217; existing data centers in the form of a large rack. Now, the company is launching these smaller versions so that its users can also deploy them in their stores or office locations. These appliances are fully managed by AWS and offer 64 cores of compute, 128GB of memory and 4TB of local NVMe storage.</p>
<p>In addition, the company expanded its set of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-more-aws-local-zones/">Local Zones</a>, which are basically small extensions of existing AWS regions that are more expensive to use but offer low-latency access in metro areas. This service launched in Los Angeles in 2019; starting today it&#8217;s also available in preview in Boston, Houston and Miami. Soon, it&#8217;ll expand to Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland and Seattle. Google, it&#8217;s worth noting, is doing something similar with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/google-cloud-goes-after-the-telco-business-with-anthos-for-telecom-and-its-global-mobile-edge-cloud/">Mobile Edge Cloud</a>.</p>

<p>The general idea here &#8212; and that&#8217;s not dissimilar from what <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Microsoft and others are now doing &#8212; is to bring AWS to the edge and to do so in a variety of form factors.</p>
<p>As AWS CEO Andy Jassy rightly noted, AWS always believed that the vast majority of companies, &#8220;in the fullness of time&#8221; (Jassy&#8217;s favorite phrase from this keynote), would move to the cloud. Because of this, AWS focused on cloud services over hybrid capabilities early on. He argues that AWS watched others try and fail in building their hybrid offerings, in large part because what customers really wanted was to use the same control plane on all edge nodes and in the cloud. None of the existing solutions from other vendors, Jassy argues, got any traction (though AWS competitors would surely deny this) because of this.</p>
<p>The first result of that was <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/vmware" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="vmware">VMware <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Cloud on AWS, which allowed customers to use the same VMware software and tools on AWS they were already familiar with. But at the end of the day, that was really about moving on-premises services to the cloud.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2081166" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-01-104708-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2081166" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2081166 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-01-104708-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="537" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-01-104708-1.png 1290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-01-104708-1.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-01-104708-1.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-01-104708-1.png?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-01-104708-1.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-01-104708-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2081166" class="wp-caption-text">Image: AWS</p></div></p>
<p>With Outposts, AWS launched a fully managed edge solution that can run AWS infrastructure in its customers&#8217; data centers. It&#8217;s been an interesting journey for AWS, but the fact that the company closed out its keynote with this focus on hybrid &#8212; no matter how it wants to define it &#8212; shows that it now understands that there is clearly a need for this kind of service. The AWS way is to extend AWS into the edge &#8212; and I think most of its competitors will agree with that. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tried this early on with Azure Stack and really didn&#8217;t get a lot of traction, as far as I&#8217;m aware, but it has since retooled its efforts around Azure Arc. Google, meanwhile, is betting big on Anthos.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Whether it’s a fun day hike, a car camping excursion or a multi-day backcountry backpacking trip, there’s plenty of great camping and hiking gear that can make life easier for the outdoors person (without going overboard).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch&#8217;s 2020 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We&#8217;re here to help! We&#8217;ll be rolling out gift guides from now through the end of December. </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2020/"><em>You can find our other guides right here.</em></a></p>
<p>Like plenty of others, I dug much deeper into the great outdoors and camping this summer amid social distancing restrictions. It&#8217;s pretty easy to stay COVID-safe when you&#8217;re several days&#8217; wander into the wilderness. Whether it’s a fun day hike, a car-camping excursion or a multi-day backcountry backpacking trip, there’s plenty of great camping and hiking gear that can make life easier for the outdoors person (without going overboard).</p>
<p>I bought a ton of camping gear online this year. I had the fortune of timing a 40-mile backpacking excursion through the Los Padres National Forest with one of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rei" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rei">REI’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> annual sales, a time when the majority of online camping retailers also tend to offer steep discounts on their stuff. Most of my gear was optimized for backpacking and I ended up replacing most of my decade-old gear with some lighter, better-quality stuff. Backpacking leaves room for fewer luxuries, but add a few car-camping trips and you’ll see the fun in bringing in the nice-to-haves to your outdoors gear repertoire.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With camping gear you can almost always find a good sale on any individual item during the year, so stay patient and keep an eye out. Plenty of sites offer one-off discounts for first-time buyers or have pretty reliably timed, wide-ranging seasonal sales, so if you&#8217;re smart about your purchase you can get it at a discount.</p>
<p>One note to hammer home: When buying gear, one of the main things to consider is whether you anticipate getting bit by the backpacking bug. It’s not always easy to tell ahead of time, but if you do think you’ll end up using your gear on backpacking trips, you’ll want to account pretty heavily for the weight of any new gear. You can certainly upgrade later too, but it’s always good to future-proof when you can. If you’re just planning to hop into the car and hit up a nice drive-in campsite, you have a lot less to worry about in terms of size and weight restrictions, which makes things much simpler.</p>

<p>When it comes to camping, light can really expand your options for what you can do at night. I&#8217;ve been one to rely on campfire light during the evenings, but with campfire bans hitting plenty of campsites in California this season, I upped my lighting game this year.</p>
<p>These string lights come in a nicely designed package and are perfect for adding some ambiance and solidly bright light to your campsite. They&#8217;re a bit of a luxury, but they provide a good bit of light on multiple brightness settings. The company now also makes a version with colored lights if you want to get festive.</p>
<p>The lights do suck up a decent amount of power, so they may only last you a night or two on a single charge depending on your usage, but the handy built-in solar charger can help there. Truthfully I&#8217;ve always had mixed success with relying on solar charging, so I might save this one for the car-camping trips where you have easy access to somewhere to charge the light with its integrated USB cable.</p>

<p>Though mobile gear is increasingly gaining waterproof IP ratings, especially when it comes to higher-end camera gear, not everything is friendly with moisture. One purchase I made this year that felt like a no-brainer was a set of small dry bags. They are certainly a more expensive option than the humble zip-locks which I&#8217;ve been using for years, but while a wet roll of toilet paper or map can be a bummer, a wet mirrorless camera is a disaster.</p>
<p>Dry bags keep the wetness out. They&#8217;re also just a nice and functional organizational tool to keep all of your tech gear together and protected from the elements. Earlier this summer I bought this small three-pack which is sized perfectly for the tech gear I tend to bring along. Later I bought a much larger 35L sack to house gear like my sleeping bag and clothes that I really need to keep dry while hiking through river beds or while it&#8217;s raining.</p>
<p>I opted for a set of Sea to Summit bags, which seem to be the gold standard, but if you search for dry bags on the web, you&#8217;ll come across plenty of sets with some good ratings. Just be sure to peruse the reviews to get a sense of their durability, which is the only thing that matters.</p>

<p>I have two big items on my next wish list for backpacking gear upgrades to make before next season. One is a bear can to stuff my food and toiletries into when backpacking through Tahoe&#8217;s Desolation Wilderness, as I soon hope to. The other is the inReach Explorer+. I&#8217;ve relied on friends with handheld GPS units in the past, but Garmin&#8217;s option, which seems to be quite popular, bundles a GPS unit with a phone that operates on a satellite network.</p>
<p>You need a plan for the device to use the satellite network, which you can activate on a monthly basis whenever you need it. That network is good for a couple of things: sending off text messages with GPS points to friends and relatives so they can see your progress and know you&#8217;re safe, while also being able to reach the outside world if you find yourself in an emergency and might need to be rescued. While these evacuations are assuredly going to be a pricey affair, it&#8217;s never worth gambling with your life or opting for a backup plan from which you might not make it back.</p>
<p>Garmin also sells a mini version of the inReach that eschews GPS navigation and a decent screen size for a much smaller footprint, more of a &#8220;don&#8217;t use it unless you absolutely need to&#8221; version. I will also quickly note that satellite phones are actually illegal to have on you in some countries, so be sure to check out whether that&#8217;s the case before you pack one in your bag.</p>

<p>These chairs are probably some of the best things I&#8217;ve ever purchased. Oddly, I actually haven&#8217;t used them that much while backpacking, which seems to be the intent of the product given how light they are, at just over 1 pound, but they&#8217;ve been amazing for tossing in a tote bag for a day at the park.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten so much use out of them partially because I live in a city and don&#8217;t own a car. If I had a car, I might just opt for a larger and cheaper folding chair that I could keep in the trunk. That said, what&#8217;s great about these is that they are light enough to bring backpacking &#8212; though they are definitely still a luxury item to bring along. My one complaint is that these chairs don&#8217;t play so nicely with the sand or mud, so you want to find a fairly hard surface to set them up on if you want to feel fully secure placing your full weight on these tiny chairs.</p>
<p>I got these for about half-off when I bought them, but there are definitely cheaper options than those from Helinox if you can&#8217;t find a deal and don&#8217;t mind an extra pound of weight or so. I have friends who are particularly big fans of the REI versions.</p>
<p>Side note: This year I also found a deal on a lightweight Helinox hard-top table, which has been great for playing board games or setting up a cook station.</p>

<p>One of the big issues with amassing a collection of camping gear is storing it all during those non-camping months. The best solution for this is a big &#8216;ole duffel bag. They&#8217;re great to store your gear in, and it&#8217;s so easy to just toss a duffel in your car when you&#8217;re ready to go camping and not have to deal with a dozen little trips to the car and back.</p>
<p>I ended up buying a 90-liter REI bag during a sale, but I&#8217;ve seen great things on the bags from North Face and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/patagonia" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="patagonia">Patagonia <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as well. This size fits a ton and has the added advantage of being just about the maximum size for a standard checked bag on a flight; anything larger will require an oversized baggage fee. These bags all go on sale pretty often so I wouldn&#8217;t rush into buying, especially if you don&#8217;t need one ASAP.</p>

<p>Cards are great, but sometimes you want to spice up your options for games. For those of you who have just binged through &#8220;The Queen&#8217;s Gambit,&#8221; I&#8217;ll recommend searching for a good travel chess board.</p>
<p>I ended up going for this very random <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WXQQ5RJ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07WXQQ5RJ&amp;linkId=26262a09df36b47c54cd040452c50ec9">travel chess set</a> on Amazon because the magnetic board made me feel confident I wouldn&#8217;t lose all of the pieces immediately. It&#8217;s not the most high-quality-feeling, but the price was right and it strikes a good balance. There are definitely plenty of options that are more robust or more lightweight.</p>

<p>One thing every camper should have in their gear collection is a bunch of different-sized mini Nalgene bottles. These things are great and can hold your soap, shampoo, oil, sauces, booze and other liquids securely and (as long as you&#8217;re religious about tightening the screw-top bottles) can ensure that you won&#8217;t have any accidental spills.</p>
<p>I use these aggressively for meal planning and measure out the various quantities of a liquid or sauce I&#8217;ll need for a given meal and toss them inside a bigger plastic bag with all of the ingredients. As such, I have a few sizes ranging from an ounce to 4 ounces. That&#8217;s not a use case everyone needs when you&#8217;re car-camping and don&#8217;t have the luxury of measuring everything ahead of time, but they&#8217;re also awesome for toiletry kits and I use the 2 ounce bottle for shampoo and soap when I&#8217;m flying and want to bring my own stuff.</p>
<p>One complaint is that these will hold onto the smell of some more pungent liquids even after you wash them, so keep that in mind and maybe be careful to separate the ones you&#8217;re storing your toiletries in from the ones holding sauces.</p>
