										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most big accelerators tend to dedicate some of their resources to dauntingly hard science problems and the companies taking them on&#8230; but for SOSV&#8217;s <a href="https://indiebio.co">IndieBio</a>, it&#8217;s the primary focus.</p>
<p>Last time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/from-improving-cancer-treatments-to-saving-the-bees-these-are-the-companies-in-indiebios-latest-class/">we checked in with IndieBio</a>, their companies were working on everything from lozenges to treat gum disease, to vertical farms for the sustainable production of shrimp, to saving the bees.</p>
<p>While IndieBio&#8217;s next Demo Day is still a few months out, the companies in their next New York batch have been selected and are already chipping away at a whole new set of problems — things like battling opioid addiction, improving crop yields amidst climate change, or making better/safer leather alternatives from stuff we&#8217;d otherwise throw away.</p>
<p>I hopped on a call with IndieBio NY’s Chief Science Officer Julie Wolf, who told me a bit about what each company in this latest New York batch is working on. <strong>Here&#8217;s my understanding of each company in the new class, in alphabetical order:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://ceragengrow.com">Ceragen</a>:</strong> Making a microbe-based &#8220;inoculant&#8221; that improves crop production in hydroponic greenhouses, using beneficial bacteria to help plants increase heat resistance, battle root rot, and more. The team says they&#8217;ve seen yield increases of up to 20% in tomatoes (think more fruit, not bigger fruit.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.helex.bio">HelEx</a>:</strong> Building what they call an &#8220;an intelligent GPS for gene-editing&#8221; to enable faster, safer development of CRISPR-based gene therapies.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://inso.bio">Inso Bio</a>:</strong> Built by a team out of Cornell, Inso is working on dramatically simplifying the process of genomic sequencing and sample processing — taking what Wolf calls a &#8220;multi-step, high touch&#8221; process that &#8220;requires a lot of lab personnel&#8221; (and is thus often backlogged for months within any given lab) and turning it into a piece of hardware that handles it all.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.kinokolabs.com">Kinoko Labs</a>:</strong> Whole cut meat alternatives (think steaks and cutlets instead of nuggets and burger patties) grown/made from fungus, using fungal mycelium to create a meat-alternative with taste/textures more like that of actual meats. The company currently has both chicken and steak prototypes in development.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Kutanios:</strong> Working on a peptide-based product that, when applied topically, would help prevent damage/aging caused by the sun — all while being biodegradable and safe for the environment. One of the founders is Dr. Norman Miller, a scientist best known for co-authoring a 1975 hypothesis on HDL&#8217;s role in protecting against heart disease — in other words, for discovering that there&#8217;s such a thing as &#8220;good&#8221; cholesterol.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://kyomei.co.uk">Kyomei</a>:</strong> Wolf tells me that this team is working on growing meat proteins (myoglobin) within plants at scale, which could be extracted and added to plant-based meat-alternatives to &#8220;give them that umami taste.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pannextherapeutics.com">Pannex Therapeutics</a>:</strong> Looking to combat the ever-worsening opioid epidemic, Pannex is working on what it expects to be a non-addictive painkiller. The company&#8217;s website says its drug (PNX3) &#8220;docks to Pannexin 1 channel and blocks it&#8221; — regulating one of the ways the brain processes excess ATP as pain.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.rizlabhealth.com">RizLab Health</a>:</strong> Antibiotic-resistant &#8220;superbug&#8221; bacterial infections are terrifying, and the overuse of unnecessary antibiotics only makes the situation worse. A spin-off out of Rutgers, RizLab is working on in-office/portable machine for rapid CBC tests that can help a doctor quickly determine if an infection is viral or bacterial — thus, hopefully, halting the tendency to throw antibiotics at everything.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.tomtex.co">TômTex</a>:</strong> Leather alternatives made from seafood waste — they&#8217;re turning things like crab or shrimp shells into chitosan, a biodegradable polymer which they&#8217;re then able to turn into cheaper yet more sustainable alternatives to leather. The team has already won a number of awards from groups including LVHM (the holding co. behind companies like Louis Voitton, Fendi, Christian Dior, etc.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.uprightoats.com">Upright</a>:</strong> Working on &#8220;oatmilk as nutritious as dairy&#8221;, using concentrated oat protein (rather than more commonly used things like pea protein or soy protein) to keep it hypo-allergenic.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The purpose of your company is to sell your solution and generate revenue, but to do that you require customers. So how do you convince someone to bet on you?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New companies face innumerable challenges around fine-tuning their product and constructing the appropriate revenue model. You may be looking ahead to raising some funds and trying to juggle the administrative aspects of running a business, but before all that, the purpose of your company is to sell your solution and generate revenue.</p>
<p>But to do that requires customers, so how do you get someone to take a chance with you?</p>
<p>To answer that question, we convened a panel of three technology industry veterans at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week. The panel included Kate Taylor, head of customer experience at Notion; Pablo Viguera, co-CEO and co-founder of Belvo; and Vineet Jain, CEO and co-founder of Egnyte.</p>
<p>Beyond their body of experience in helping build successful startups, each of these panelists&#8217; companies have taken a very different approach to generating revenue. Egnyte, a content storage and management platform, is more of a straight enterprise sale, while Notion, a collaboration and content organization tool, uses the freemium model and then upsells to paid subscriptions with additional features. Belvo, for its part, is a financial services API provided to developer organizations and is monetized when the API is added to products and people use them.</p>
<p>Viguera says you shouldn&#8217;t try to do too much with the product initially. Get something out the door and get customers to tell you what they think. &#8220;In the early days, the v1 that you&#8217;re shipping, that you&#8217;re building, will hardly be anything like what you have two years down the road or 10 years down the road. So focus on getting a lot of feedback, not only in the early days, but over time. Really build in those feedback loops and be really deliberate about seeking feedback, even if it&#8217;s a complex business,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At the same time, Taylor says, you can&#8217;t let customer feedback push and pull you in too many directions. You have to find a set of committed users and let that core help you guide the product. &#8220;[You have to] manage the distractions, because there are a lot of different ways that you can take the product, and a lot of different feedback that you&#8217;ll hear. So find those engaged voices, and the people you&#8217;re going to bring in the circle that are helping you understand where to grow,&#8221; she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The possibilities of Web3 are fascinating, although I will admit that the notion of public networks where everyone is presumed to be trustworthy is still a bit of a mind-bender.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Web3 is still taking shape, so it is hard to define.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt, Houseparty founder Ben Rubin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/what-is-web3-disrupt-ben-rubin/">emphasized decentralization as Web3’s central feature</a>. In today’s Web 2.0, individuals give money and personal data to network operators in exchange for access to information.</p>
<p>“In Web3 there is a possibility — not saying that it’s going to actually 100% gonna happen — but there is a possibility where the network owns the network,” said Rubin. “And that’s, I think, the simplest way, the shortest way I can explain it.”</p>
<p>In conversation with reporter Taylor Hatmaker, Rubin said NFTs show that individuals can benefit from Web3 adoption, while decentralized finance and cryptocurrency trading are more commercialized forms.</p>

<p>“It’s not going to be perfect, but it’s going to be a better incentive alignment than we have right now. And that will create competition on incentive alignments with their users,” said Rubin.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting discussion that helped me better understand the topic, although I will admit that the notion of public networks where everyone is presumed to be trustworthy is still a bit of a mind-bender.</p>
<p>We have many more Disrupt recaps to come in the next few days, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>On a personal note: I celebrated my second anniversary at TechCrunch yesterday, and I’d like to thank the incredible team I work with for making all of this possible!</p>

<h2>Early Q3 indications show India’s startup ecosystem is going gangbusters</h2>

<p>It’s the beginning of Q4, so Alex Wilhelm couldn’t help but get an early start on parsing Q3 data. For Thursday’s Exchange, he looked at preliminary data out of India and China.</p>
<p>“The trendlines appear clear,” he writes.</p>
<p>“One more great quarter from India and a modest decline in China could see the former dethrone the latter for second place in the global startup market fundraising ranks.”</p>

<p>It’s hard to find actionable, proven advice for scaling startups.</p>
<p>That’s because only 7% of the startups that raise seed rounds are able to grow their companies enough to land a Series C investment, according to a Dealroom study.</p>
<p>To create a framework for founders who are charting a path from $1 million to $25 million in annual revenue, Arthur Nobel, a principal at Knight Capital, conducted 47 interviews with founders and investors who’ve taken startups from Series A to C.</p>
<p>More than an overview, the article offers approaches for navigating the challenges of T2D3 (triple, triple, double, double, double) growth, specific hiring recommendations and other strategic insights.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the post also includes steps and visualizations you can use to create your own scaling roadmap.</p>
<p>“The takeaway is to initially figure out in which stage your company and departments are in and only do what is required for that stage,” writes Nobel.</p>

<p>Startup founders have more options than in years past when it comes to fundraising, thanks in large part to a surplus of liquidity. Besides traditional VC, crowdfunding, venture banks and venture debt funds are all viable options.</p>
<p>In a detailed overview of venture debt options, Andy Weyer, managing director of technology at Runway Growth Capital, shares three use cases depicting how debt capital can benefit borrowers hoping to retain leverage for future rounds or access working capital.</p>
<p>“Think of capital availability as a spectrum, from low risk and low return (venture banks) to high risk and high return (venture capital), with venture debt funds sitting somewhere in the middle,” advises Weyer.</p>

<p>There is no level playing field in capitalism, but it is easier than ever for a scrappy startup to go head-to-head with industry leaders.</p>
<p>Warby Parker is reshaping consumer expectations about eyewear, just as Poshmark and ThredUp made a direct run at eBay and the luxury resale market.</p>
<p>In a world where customers are more loyal to value than branding and 18-month roadmaps are the norm, startups that develop solid competitive plans have an advantage, says Sudheesh Nair, CEO of business intelligence company ThoughtSpot.</p>
<p>“Successful startups will inevitably draw the attention of powerful incumbents in their industry,” he writes for TechCrunch+. “They will fight you, but if you are positioned well for the challenge there has never been a better time to prevail.”</p>

<p>End users and regulators are increasingly unhappy about how tech companies slice and dice our personal data. Many countries and regions have been enforcing new privacy guidelines, and consumers are embracing privacy features that make it harder to track them for targeted advertising and market research.</p>
<p>According to Ted Schlein, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins who focuses on cybersecurity and enterprise software, companies should consider shifting to pattern analysis.</p>
<p>“Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), companies can process and interpret first-party data in real time and develop actionable behavioral intelligence,” he says.</p>
<p>“Real-time analysis can help companies identify patterns of behavior to understand how customers engage, and why — all while protecting their privacy.”</p>

<p>“If you care about the value of private companies and how they are priced, this is for you. If you do not, please read anything else; you are going to be bored out of your socks.”</p>

<p>Roham Gharegozlou has been betting on the potential success of NFTs for years. This year, it happened.</p>
<p>Gharegozlou and the team at his startup, Dapper Labs, shipped the blockchain world’s first popular game, CryptoKitties, back in 2017.</p>
<p>The startup then launched NBA Top Shot late last year, and it promptly caught fire and brought worldwide attention to the crypto collectibles space.</p>
<p>Lucas Matney caught up with the Dapper Labs CEO at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week to discuss the challenges facing the crypto space, the future of Ethereum and how quickly NFTs blew up this year.</p>
<p>“I knew it would be fast, but NBA Top Shot went from 4,000 to 400,000 users in a matter of weeks,” Gharegozlou said.</p>

<p>Two things are true: Edtech companies are looking for ways to grow their valuations, and a strikingly high percentage of employees are dissatisfied in their current jobs and hope to make a change.</p>
<p>“Employers are under fresh pressure to retain talent, which has made some turn to more comprehensive and creative benefits,” writes Natasha Mascarenhas in an article about new offerings from MasterClass and Outschool meant to help workers develop soft skills.</p>
<p>“Think a class on the art of negotiation by Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator, or a lesson on effective and authentic communication by Robin Roberts, a ‘Good Morning America’ anchor,” she reports. “The value proposition, therefore, is more about complementary skills that could develop or upskill a workforce.”</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm takes a look at direct-to-consumer eyewear company Warby Parker, which direct listed this week.</p>
<p>“The company not only listed, but did so at a price point that was above its final private-market valuation, and its shares appreciated rapidly during its first day of trading,” Alex writes.</p>
<p>“For the DTC market, the results partially combat the odor that 2020’s ill-fated Casper IPO left lingering around the startup business model category.”</p>

<p>Following last week’s TechCrunch Disrupt event, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim considered startups’ various options for fundraising beyond venture capital.</p>
<p>They pulled notes from a Disrupt panel on revenue-based financing “to help frame our thinking around venture capital investment, and when startups may want to pursue other methods of funding.”</p>
<p>“With alternative capital concerns like Pipe attracting top talent while expanding to new markets, and Clearbanc rebranding to Clearco while raising $100 million earlier this year, it’s clear that the market for funds outside of traditional venture checks is maturing. Let’s talk about it.”</p>

Thankfully, a fix is here and once you install it, you shouldn&#8217;t have to resort to Face ID (or worse, typing in your passcode) anymore. The latest iOS 15 update (iOS 15.0.1) is here and according to the changelog, it brings bug fixes &#8220;including an issue where some users could not unlock iPhone 13 models with Apple Watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple added the unlock with Watch feature in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-iphone-unlock-macos-tvos-homepod-181749610.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">watchOS 7.4 earlier this year</a> to make it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-14-5-face-id-mask-fitness-plus-developer-beta-182712559.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">easier to get into your iPhone</a> while you&#8217;re out and masked up. This feature later got broken with a subsequent iOS and update and required <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-7-1-apple-watch-unlock-with-iphone-fix-191917256.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">another over-the-air package</a> to fix. Apple recently acknowledged that this was also not working on some iPhone 13 models, and said it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-iphone-13-unlock-bug-fix-174529852.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1">would roll out a solution soon</a>. The iPhone 13 only started being available on September 24th, so this issue was at least caught early. Though it&#8217;s nice that the update is here days later, it&#8217;s interesting to see the trouble the company has had with this feature in the last few months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Blitzscaling itself isn’t the goal," said Hoffman. "Blitzscaling is being inefficient; it’s spending capital inefficiently and hiring inefficiently; it’s being uncertain about your business model; and those are not good things."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner Reid Hoffman first coined the term &#8220;blitzscaling,&#8221; he kept it simple: It’s a concept that encourages entrepreneurs to prioritize speed over efficiency during a period of uncertainty. Years later, founders are navigating a pandemic, perhaps the most uncertain period of their lives, and Hoffman has a clarification to make.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blitzscaling itself isn’t the goal,&#8221; Hoffman said during TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. &#8220;Blitzscaling is being inefficient; it’s spending capital inefficiently and hiring inefficiently; it’s being uncertain about your business model; and those are not good things.&#8221; Instead, he said, blitzscaling is a choice companies may have to make for a set period of time to outpace a competitor or react to a pandemic rather than a route to take from idea to IPO.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean startups should avoid prioritizing breakneck speed, especially in industries like fintech and edtech, where the pandemic spotlighted a lot of potential. Instead, Hoffman thinks the pandemic’s real impact on his definition is that “the benchmark for what you may need to do in order to outpace your competitors to scale in an ecosystem may have changed.”</p>
<h2>A lot of new money</h2>
<p>Hoffman’s broadened view of blitzscaling blends well with his firm’s recent announcement of a <a href="https://greylock.com/firm-news/500m-for-seeds/">$500 million seed fund</a>. The close came weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/andreessen-horowitz-just-rolled-out-a-400-million-fund-thats-expressly-for-seed-deals/">Andreessen Horowitz closed its own $400 million seed fund</a>.</p>
<p>Greylock claims that its new fund is &#8220;the largest pool of venture capital dedicated to backing founders at one,&#8221; and explicitly said that it is &#8220;willing to write large seed checks at lean-in valuations, which gives companies more runway to hit milestones without taking on additional dilution.&#8221; It’s fair to say that Greylock&#8217;s checks could help seed-stage startups afford to blitzscale while still prioritizing runway and other business-oriented resources.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re diagnosed with lazy eye &#8212; otherwise known as amblyopia &#8212; as a child, there are only a few options at your disposal. You can wear an eye patch, you can take eye drops or you can wear corrective lenses. Or, in the future (pending FDA clearance), you could watch TV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the central idea behind Luminopia, a four-person startup headed by Scott Xiao and Dean Travers. Xiao and Travers started Luminopia six years ago as undergrads at Harvard University, and first heard about the condition from a classmate who had struggled with amblyopia as a child. Lazy eye is the most common childhood form of vision loss, and affects about </span><a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/amblyopia-lazy-eye"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three out of every 100 kids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amblyopia can develop early in life when something causes one eye to struggle to keep up with the other. There might be muscle strength imbalances between eyes, which causes one to lag behind, one eye might be far stronger than the other or one eye might be deprived of clear vision, due to a cataract or other obstacle. </span><a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/amblyopia-lazy-eye"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the brain learns to depend upon vision in one eye, while the other gets weaker, eventually, in severe cases, leading to permanent vision loss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common treatments for lazy eye involve eye drops, corrective lenses or eye patching &#8212; which strengthen the weaker eye. Luminopia’s solution is different; kids watch TV through a VR headset with the parameters of the show slightly altered (the company has struck deals with Sesame Workshop, Nickelodeon, DreamWorks and NBC to provide over 100 hours of content). Contrast might be dialed up or dialed down, or parts of each image might be removed to encourage the weaker eye to keep up with the stronger one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re actually altering the image parameters in real time, with the goal of promoting weaker eye usage and encouraging patients’ brains to combine input from both eyes,” says Xiao. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, the company published results of a </span><a href="https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420(21)00682-5/fulltext#secsectitle0100"><span style="font-weight: 400;">randomized controlled trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 105 kids. All the kids wore glasses full-time, but 51 of them also watched one hour of TV shows modified by Luminopia’s software six days per week for 12 weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the kids in the treatment group improved their sight by 1.8 lines on a standard eye chart, compared to .8 lines in the comparison group (though some kids saw improvements of two or more lines at the 12-week follow-up visit). </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study was published in &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ophthalmology.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luminopia is still a small enterprise &#8212; there are just four employees. But the company has raised about $12 million so far with investment from Sesame Ventures (the Sesame Workshop venture capital arm), and angel investors like Robert Langer, a co-founder of Moderna (now Luminopia’s board director), and Jeffrey Dunn, the former president and CEO of Sesame Workshop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has distinguished itself by its unique approach to a common problem in amblyopia, and in healthcare in general: adherence to treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s some evidence that lazy eye treatments are hard to stick with. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3729804/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted in a hospital in Saudi Arabia surveyed 37 families with children who were using eye patches to treat amblyopia. The kids in the study only completed about 66% of the prescribed patching time. Families cited social stigma, discomfort and flat out refusal to wear the patch as some common reasons why they struggled to keep up with eye patching recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One  <a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2127884">2013 study</a> in &#8220;Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science&#8221; analyzed how well 152 kids complied with eye patch treatments, and found that on about 42% of days, kids skip patching altogether. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luminopia’s founders created their treatment for lazy eye by approaching the adherence problem first — a strategy borrowed from the consumer product world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve always seen such a huge gap in the experience of things in the consumer world, where things are so thoughtful and so delightful, and healthcare where so often we see poor experiences that lead to low adherence,” says Travers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for kids, there aren’t much more appealing things to do than watching TV, Xiao notes. And the trial appears to prove that thesis: The kids in the study completed 88% of the minutes of TV watching required of them. And 94% of parents said they were likely or very likely to use the treatment over an eye patch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key, though, is to have the data and FDA approval to prove that these “delightful” treatment experiences actually work and overcome the adherence problem. Luminopia’s most recently published trial follows </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02782117"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a single-arm pilot trial,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which evaluated the technology’s at nine sites, and on a total of 84 participants. In the first phase of that pilot trial, conducted on 10 kids, the team found that children completed 78% of the prescribed minutes of treatment. They also saw improvements in their vision that equated to about three lines on a standard eye chart. Those results were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-65234-3">published</a> in &#8220;Scientific Reports.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luminopia isn’t the first company to start evaluating game- or, for lack of a better word, fun-based treatments for diseases. The FDA has already been somewhat in support of other proposals in this vein. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another company, Akili Interactive, gained FDA approval </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-marketing-first-game-based-digital-therapeutic-improve-attention-function-children-adhd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in June 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the De Novo pathway for a video game used to treat ADHD in kids. That approval marked the first time the agency had approved a video game to treat a disease. In total, Akili Interactive has garnered about $301.1 million in funding,</span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/akili"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akili’s game, called EndeavorRx, does show a pathway to approval that Luminopia might be able to mimic. Luminopia, like EndeavorRx, is a prescription-only therapeutic service that doesn’t have a predecessor. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luminopia, says Xiao, will also follow the De Novo pathway as it seeks FDA approval this year. The data from its most recent pivotal trial was submitted to the FDA last March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are anticipating a decision by the end of the year, and provided it’s a positive decision, we’re looking to launch the product early this year,&#8221; he says. </span></p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over a century ago, the advent of the internal combustion engine took us out of the age of the horse-drawn carriage and into the age of the automobile. With the horse leaving the equation, vehicle designs started to emerge that were oriented around the comfort and safety of drivers.</p>
<p>Since then, society has come to accept a particular kind of car design: gas-powered, inattentive to pedestrians and other road users, and often driven by a distracted human. Today, mobility is undergoing another major transformation, and we are building what comes next: the fully autonomous electric vehicle.</p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) now present a rare opportunity for transformational change by reimagining how vehicles are designed, how they’re used and whom they serve.</p>
<p>To support this transformation, we’re announcing the launch of<a href="https://www.savecoalition.com/"> the Coalition for Safe Autonomous Vehicles and Electrification (SAVE)</a>. SAVE’s founding members — Zoox, Nuro and Local Motors — are united around three core principles: building safe automated driving systems, deploying AVs on fully electric platforms and incorporating new vehicle designs that improve mobility and access for all.</p>
<h2>Traditional vehicle designs will not do enough</h2>
<p>Today, we have congestion driven by single-occupant vehicle trips, pollution from gas-powered cars, inequitable access and <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic">rising traffic fatalities</a>. SAVE will bring policymakers, industry leaders and advocates together to improve our communities with autonomy — and that includes rethinking the car.</p>
<p>After all, building an AV without any changes in vehicle design is like building a cell phone with a rotary dial.</p>
<p>SAVE’s members are designing vehicles for a mobility future that serves everyone. Zoox has developed an autonomous vehicle that is designed to be shared and contains over 100 <a href="https://zoox.com/safety/">safety innovations</a> not featured in conventional cars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nuro is building zero-occupant delivery AVs designed for the safety of people outside the vehicle, which can improve access to groceries in <a href="https://medium.com/nuro/serving-americas-food-deserts-a7442e922053">food deserts</a>.</p>
<p>Local Motors is building a shuttle that provides first- and last-mile connections to transit, with design innovations that can improve <a href="https://localmotors.com/press-release/new-accessibility-features/">accessibility</a> for people with disabilities.</p>
<h2>AVs will lead to vehicle designs that are safer for everyone</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/24-05-2016-scale-of-traffic-deaths-and-injuries-constitutes-a-public-health-crisis-safe-roads-contribute-to-sustainable-development">public health crisis</a> on our roads led to an <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic">estimated</a> 38,680 deaths last year. AVs can help reduce the 94% of fatal crashes in which a critical factor is driver error or choice — drunken driving, speeding and distraction — but if autonomy is paired with new vehicle designs, AVs will help achieve even greater improvements.</p>
<p>Today, our roads are <a href="https://www.ghsa.org/resources/Pedestrians21">more dangerous</a> for pedestrians than they’ve been since 1989. Vehicles have historically been designed for the safety and comfort of drivers, rather than the people outside, which has led to ever-increasing vehicle sizes that are<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212012221000241?dgcid=author"> more deadly</a> for pedestrians and cyclists. Pickups and SUVs now account for approximately 70% of new vehicle sales annually, and are two to three times more likely to kill a pedestrian in collisions.</p>
<p>AVs present an opportunity for a sea change in safety for people outside vehicles, just as seat belts and air bags significantly improved occupant safety. A recent Virginia Tech <a href="https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/102365">study</a> found that zero-occupant delivery AVs can reduce fatal crashes and injuries by about 60%, based on design alone. Additionally, new <a href="https://zoox.com/wp-content/uploads/zoox_safety_report_volume2_2021.pdf">safety innovations</a> like the Zoox vehicle’s external lighting and sound system will enable AVs to communicate with pedestrians and other road users.</p>
<h2>Zero-emissions AVs will reduce emissions, improve efficiency</h2>
<p>The future of transportation must be zero emissions, which is why we’re building AVs from the ground up to be fully electric.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>, the transportation sector is the No. 1 contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and the pollution it causes <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/links-between-air-pollution-and-childhood-asthma">increases</a> the prevalence of life-threatening childhood asthma, disproportionately affecting communities of color.</p>
<p>Yet a congested street filled with single-occupant, gas-powered vehicles looks exactly the same as one with electric vehicles, which is why we also need to fundamentally shift how vehicles are used.</p>
<p>The widespread deployment of electric AVs in shared fleets, combined with transit and active transportation, can lead to an<a href="https://www.itdp.org/2017/05/03/3rs-in-urban-transport/"> 80% reduction</a> in CO2 emissions by 2050. Additionally, by going electric and “batching” deliveries to multiple people, delivery AVs could help <a href="https://www.steergroup.com/projects/economic-impacts-autonomous-delivery-services-us">avoid 407 million tons of CO2 emissions</a> from 2025 to 2035 — effectively offsetting the emissions from powering every home in the four largest cities in the U.S. for a decade.</p>
<h2>AVs should provide accessible, equitable mobility options</h2>
<p>Having access to a vehicle makes a person <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/cityscpe/vol17num2/ch3.pdf">four times more likely</a> to have a job, and access to affordable shared AV services can <a href="https://2uj256fs8px404p3p2l7nvkd-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Fostering-Economic-Opportunity-through-Autonomous-Vehicle-Technology.pdf">significantly reduce</a> household expenses and connect low-income Americans with new job opportunities.</p>
<p>Additionally, delivery AVs can help to improve access to fresh groceries for <a href="https://www.axios.com/autonomous-vehicles-mobility-poverty-795b9113-e279-4111-9aa3-c4a59c6dc192.html">14 million</a>, or 70%, of the 20 million low-income Americans living in food deserts.</p>
<p>Vehicles have traditionally been designed around the able-bodied, limiting the mobility options available to people living with disabilities and older adults. The introduction of AVs gives us another chance to design vehicles that are accessible for the <a href="https://www.bts.gov/travel-patterns-with-disabilities">25.5 million Americans</a> with travel-limiting disabilities, which could lead to an estimated <a href="https://rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Self-Driving-Cars-The-Impact-on-People-with-Disabilities_FINAL.pdf">2 million</a> new employment opportunities for people with disabilities.</p>
<h2>Modernizing regulations will unlock AVs’ full benefits</h2>
<p>This year, Congress is considering a generational reinvestment in our nation’s infrastructure that will fund sorely needed repairs and accelerate consumer adoption of electric vehicles. But using new roads in the same way will not be enough.</p>
<p>Congress must seize the opportunity to modernize federal policies and reimagine how our roads are used. Updating federal vehicle standards, while maintaining their safety intent, would foster the deployment of AVs that deliver on safer roads, expanded access, and a more sustainable and efficient transportation sector.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we’ll find ourselves once again kicking the can down freshly paved roads.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Brands wanting to get into influencer marketing can use ProductWind's platform to set up campaigns with hundreds of influencers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some big brands spend millions of dollars on marketing each year and may only drive thousands of dollars in sales as a result. At the same time, influencers are steering thousands, or even millions, of their followers to certain brands.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.productwind.com/">ProductWind</a> aims to connect brands with influencers in one click. The company is building a platform to enable brands to launch influencer marketing campaigns. Today, it announced $1.67 million in seed funding led by Early Light Ventures.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Jason Kowalski is familiar with the marketing challenges facing brands. He was building Amazon’s self-service marketing platform and saw the disconnect between marketing and sales.</p>
<p>“We want brands to come in and have 100 or 200 influencers working with them,” he said. “Before, you might go on a platform and sort through a list of influencers and find them, but not know who would drive sales the best. It was mostly at the top of the funnel rather than the bottom.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u6tVq59rBF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/5-tips-for-brands-that-want-to-succeed-in-the-new-era-of-influencer-marketing/">5 tips for brands that want to succeed in the new era of influencer marketing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 tips for brands that want to succeed in the new era of influencer marketing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/5-tips-for-brands-that-want-to-succeed-in-the-new-era-of-influencer-marketing/embed/#?secret=u6tVq59rBF" data-secret="u6tVq59rBF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Kowalski brought in former Uber engineer Tom Hirschfeld as his co-founder, and together, applied automation and other proprietary technology to a database of influencers so that brands can join the ProductWind platform, describe what they want to achieve and set up a 100-influencer campaign within minutes versus the traditional weeks.</p>
<p>On the influencer side, they have their own platform and receive notifications when brands want to work with them. Rather than the old way of calling and texting with a brand, the influencer can see a list of available sponsorships, apply and get approved. They can purchase products online, or set up to receive them, and integrate with social media. ProductWind monitors when the posts appear and then pays the influencer through the platform.</p>
<p>As a result, ProductWind is able to generate better return on investment, for example, boosting a product from page 5 to page 1 on Amazon, because the platform creates a flywheel effect: the more value created brings in more sales and more influencers joining the campaign, Hirschfeld said.</p>
<p>For the company’s first 18 months, Kowalski and Hirschfeld bootstrapped the company, which was profitable from the first day, Kowalski said. During this period, revenue increased 10 times. The new funding will be invested in hiring more technology and sales employees to join ProductWind’s 15-person workforce.</p>
<p>“Profitability is key for us because we are producing big campaigns,” Kowalski added. “We are driving marketing and sales, and we want to be the next paradigm shifter.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Early Light principal Mike Leffer said the company’s profitability came as a result of not only Kowalski and Hirschfeld being scrappy, but also due to Kowalski attracting some of ProductWind’s early customers by walking through a trade floor and talking to companies even before there was a finished product.</p>
<p>The status quo in influencer marketing is slow, but ProductWind is able to unlock influencer sales predictions. When speaking to customers and potential customers, Leffer said they were already seeing value and ROI. On the influencer side, the company is able to democratize access to the creator economy so that the opportunities aren’t just limited to professionals, he added.</p>
<p>“The company was in the right place at the right time and bootstrapped from nothing to a lot of revenue,” Leffer said. “They hit upon a need in the market where brands are knocking on their door to launch campaigns and then a space for the creator economy where anyone can be an influencer.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the e-commerce aggregator market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/e-commerce-aggregator-rainforest-raises-20m-just-months-after-its-last-funding/">continues to heat up</a>, the U.S. e-commerce industry is on track for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/u-s-e-commerce-on-track-for-its-first-1-trillion-year-by-2022-due-to-lasting-pandemic-impacts/">first $1 trillion year by 2022</a>. At the same time, marketing channels are getting expensive: Amazon ad costs are up <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-ads-are-getting-more-expensive">30% since the beginning of the year</a>.</p>
<p>Joining Early Light Ventures in the round was Ben Narasin, who recently spun out of NEA to launch Tenacity Fund, and Broom Ventures.</p>
<p>Narasin says the influencer market is huge and considers ProductWind the “DoubleClick of influencer marketing.” He explained via email that the company reminds him of what he saw during the start of the internet in the early 1990s when DoubleClick allowed brands to aggregate relevant sites across a diverse and cluttered landscape with one relationship. Similarly, “ProductWind does that for the ‘wild west’ of influencer marketing,” he added.</p>

<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">May</a> the EU&#8217;s executive said it would be strengthening the (still) voluntary code which is aimed at driving joined-up industry action to counter the spread of harmful disinformation online.</p>
<p>It called on smaller digital services and adtech firms to sign up &#8212; saying it particularly wanted broader participation, not just the usual platform giants (some of whom were among the first group of signatories).</p>
<p>Facebook, Google, Twitter and Mozilla were among the first clutch of tech platforms to sign up to the EU disinformation code back in 2018, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/tiktok-joins-the-eus-code-of-practice-on-disinformation/">TikTok joined last summer</a>.</p>
<p>Eight newbies are said to be preparing to agree to the beefed-up code now.</p>
<p>In addition to the three aforementioned startups, the Commission said organisations that provide specific expertise and technical solutions to fight disinformation, such as Avaaz, Globsec, Logically, NewsGuard and WhoTargetsMe, are also preparing to join.</p>
<p>&#8220;Substantial additional efforts are needed to reduce the flow of harmful disinformation, as illustrated by recent electoral campaigns and by the signatories&#8217; reports on the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/covid-19-disinformation-monitoring">COVID-19 disinformation monitoring program</a>,&#8221; the EC writes in a press release.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among the shortcomings the Commission has said it wants the revised code to address are: Inconsistent and incomplete application of the Code across platforms and Member States; gaps in the coverage of the Code&#8217;s commitments; a lack of appropriate monitoring mechanism, including key performance indicators; a lack of commitments on access to platforms&#8217; data for research on disinformation; and limited participation from stakeholders, in particular from the advertising sector.</p>
<p>So quite the laundry list, then.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU lawmakers say it&#8217;s time to go further on tackling disinformation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/eu-lawmakers-say-its-time-to-go-further-on-tackling-disinformation/embed/#?secret=iGtiTjLf7q" data-secret="iGtiTjLf7q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the intention is to beef up the code, it will remain self-regulated. So whether it will become a &#8220;strong EU instrument&#8221;, as the Commission puts it &#8212; without having any real legal teeth &#8212; remains to be seen.</p>
<p>For large internet platforms there will be, if not literal fangs then some threatening growling as compliance with the beefed-up code will be taken into consideration under wider, incoming digital regulations &#8212; aka, the bloc&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">Digital Services Act</a> &#8212; which seeks to increase internet companies&#8217; accountability across a number of areas.</p>
<p>And if self-regulation still fails to move the needle on harmful online disinformation like bogus information about COVID-19 vaccines or election interference the Commission could still propose legislation. However it seems reluctant to do that in such a subjective and controversial area given the risks of being accused of censoring free speech.</p>
<p>Pan-EU <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">rules for political ads transparency</a> are slated for introduction next year, in one targeted piece of planned legislation.</p>
<p>In a statement on the eight new &#8220;prospective signatories&#8221;, who have joined in the revision process as a beefed-up version of the disinformation code is drafted, Věra Jourová, the VP for values and transparency, said: “I am pleased to see new actors from relevant sectors answering our call and engaging in the overhaul of the Code of Practice. I encourage others, including platforms, messaging services and actors in the online advertising ecosystem, to join as soon as possible to co-shape the process.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The strengthened Code cannot fall short of the expectations we have set out in our Guidance from May,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Online players have a special responsibility regarding spreading and monetising disinformation. They must become more transparent, accountable and safe by design.”</p>
<p>Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner for the internal market, added: “I welcome the fact that more and more online platforms, technology providers, civil society and expert organisations are formally committing to fighting disinformation. The private sector should be ambitious and anticipate the new EU rules on digital services (DSA). Now is the time to show they walk the talk.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith wasted no time responding to allegations of a hostile work environment, sending an internal letter to employees Thursday encouraging staff to speak to him directly or via an in-house anonymous hotline with their concerns. Of course, it&#8217;s standard practice for companies like Blue Origin to prefer handling complaints internally rather than in the public arena.</p>
<p>The letter from Smith, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/blue-origin-ceo-bob-smith-email-response-to-toxic-workplace-essay.html">which was first obtained by CNBC</a>, comes on the heels of an essay jointly <a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past">composed by 21 current and former Blue Origin employees</a> detailing serious concerns regarding safety and sexual harassment at the company.</p>
<p>Alexandra Abrams, former head of employee communications, is the sole named author of the essay. She told TechCrunch in a new interview that she decided to go public with her identity because she felt a sense of responsibility for other employees.</p>
<p>“I really felt like I had compromised my integrity at Blue Origin,” she said. “I did my best, but I was Bob&#8217;s executive communicator and helped make him look good.”</p>
<p>The essay details two instances of alleged sexual harassment by senior executives, including one instances of a senior leader being let go after groping a female employee — notably, Abrams said, only five of the 21 people who contributed to the essay are men. The essay also alleges that safety at Blue Origin took a backseat to speed of execution, with leadership insisting on a breakneck pace that wasn’t supported by adequate staffing or resources.</p>
<p>“SpaceX has always been much better staffed than Blue Origin,” Abrams said.</p>

<p>Blue Origin said in a statement that Abrams was dismissed “for cause two years ago after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations.” However, Abrams said she never received any warnings, verbal or written, from management regarding issues related to federal export control regulations.</p>
<p>Instead, she says her termination came after initiating a project to develop an internal employee app. Two weeks after that app, called Voyager, went live, it was discovered that part of its architecture was not secure — this is a major concern in the aerospace industry, as all communications tools must be compliant with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), a set of regulations governing tech related to defense and space.</p>
<p>Abrams says she immediately escalated the issue. While senior management conducted an investigation and found no export violations occurred, senior executives reportedly told her that “she could no longer be trusted” and fired her.</p>
<p>“As a communications professional, and part of the non-technical staff, I was not responsible for certifying or approving any compliance of any third-party software architecture. And to-date, as far as I’m aware, the software in question is still used by Blue Origin and Amazon,” she added.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Federal Aviation Administration said it was “reviewing the information” detailed in the essay. Abrams said that the agency has not reached out to her, but that she would “very much welcome” that.</p>
<p>“I feel like I&#8217;m fulfilling my job description as employee communications for the first time.”</p>
<p>Bob Smith&#8217;s full internal team email on Abram&#8217;s letter follows below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Team Blue,</p>
<p>Today, you may have seen that some claims were made against our team.</p>
<p>As with any criticism, whether personal or professional, and whether the criticism is fair or baseless, it is never easy to hear. It requires reflection and humility to sort through what is useful and what is not.</p>
<p>It is particularly difficult and painful, for me, to hear claims being levied that attempt to characterize our entire team in a way that doesn’t align with the character and capability that I see at Blue Origin every day.</p>
<p>Yet, one of our Blue Leadership Principles states that “Leaders are sincerely open-minded, and examine their own strongest convictions with humility. They value diversity, in all of its forms, since different viewpoints result in novel ideas. Their openness enables them to trust those around them — and to earn the trust of others in turn.”</p>
<p>We wrote and published that principle, and others, and will today, and always, be self-critical and hold ourselves to the highest standard.</p>
<p>While we reflect on what we can learn and improve, I do want to reassure the team on a few points.</p>
<p>First, the New Shepard team went through a methodical and pain-staking process to certify our vehicle for First Human Flight. Anyone that claims otherwise is uninformed and simply incorrect. That team is appropriately proud of the work they’ve done and we should be as well.</p>
<p>It should also be emphatically stated that we have no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind. We provide numerous avenues including a 24/7 anonymous hotline for employees, we investigate and act on any findings, and we will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct. As always, I welcome and encourage any member of Team Blue to speak directly with me if they have any concerns on any topic at any time.</p>
<p>Finally, it should never be doubted that we have an amazing team that is doing amazing work.</p>
<p>Our team is comprised of the best and brightest professionals in the aerospace industry. People who are dedicated, work hard and are passionate about our mission.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to rapidly grow that talented team, stay focused on our efforts and support each other. And, step by step, we will make even greater strides.</p>
<p>Gradatim Ferociter,</p>
<p>Bob</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former Vice President Al Gore has invested $600 million of equity into U.K. energy startup <a href="https://octopusenergy.group/">Octopus Energy Group</a> via his <a href="https://www.generationim.com/">Generation Investment Management</a> vehicle, taking a stake of approximately 13% in the business. The investment means Octopus has attained a valuation of around $4.6 billion.</p>
<p>Octopus has made a name for itself in energy circles largely because of its &#8220;Kraken&#8221; technology platform, which it claims is able to reroute energy from renewable sources around a network far more efficiently than competitors. Octopus is now managing 17 million energy accounts in 12 countries in this manner.</p>
<p>Generation is a $36 billion fund management business with a specific remit to back sustainable businesses.  Octopus will use the proceeds of Generation’s strategic investment to push further into the U.S. market, where it already has a toe-hold in Texas.</p>
<p>The Generation investment follows an earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/ai-driven-energy-startup-octopus-hits-2bn-mark-after-200m-investment-from-tokyo-gas/">equity investment from Origin Energy</a>, Tokyo Gas and the acquisition of Upside Energy, specialists in smart grid technology. Octopus’s retail businesses are now in the U.K., U.S., Germany, Spain and New Zealand, plus it has licensing agreements with Good Energy, Hanwha Corporation, Origin Energy, Power and E.ON.</p>

<p>Octopus has also earlier launched Electric Juice, an electric vehicle &#8220;roaming network&#8221; of 100,000 charge points across Europe that allows users to charge their personal Octopus Energy account when they charge their EVs. It’s also partnered with Tesla to launch Tesla Power in the U.K. and Germany.</p>
<p>Speaking for Octopus Energy, founder and CEO, Greg Jackson said: “Whilst the U.K. energy market is currently in a tough state, it’s highlighted the need for investment in renewables and technologies to end our reliance on fossil fuels. So we are delighted to announce our agreement with Generation Investment Management, created to back sustainable companies changing the world for the better.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We run 300 stress tests, twice a week. For us, as a tech company, it’s just algorithmic. For rival companies, they&#8217;re … doing it on spreadsheets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking for Generation Investment Management, Tom Hodges, partner in the long-term equity strategy, said: “Octopus Energy has an extraordinarily good fit with Generation’s mission of investing over the long term to support system and climate-positive companies. The world is at the early stages of an unprecedented energy transition which is essential to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. This can be done in a way that is better for the environment and consumers.”</p>
<p>In an interview via Zoom, Jackson told me that there are two parts to the current global energy crisis: “One is the energy wholesale price crisis. Global gas prices have trebled or quadrupled in the last year. That&#8217;s not only causing gas to be expensive but because a lot of electricity comes from gas it’s pushing up electricity prices. I think this is really revealing the extent to which companies have been selling long and buying short. So companies that are currently folding are larger ones which had sold a one-year contract, but only bought six months worth of energy and they were keeping their fingers crossed for the rest of it.”</p>
<p>He said Octopus has “always been 100% hedged. For us, energy retail is just one of our businesses. And we&#8217;ve got 13 businesses in the group. What we&#8217;ve always sought to do is serve an outstanding service and a really, really risk-managed back end. We run 300 stress tests, twice a week on our hedging position. For us, as a tech company, it’s just algorithmic. For rival companies, they&#8217;re either not doing that or they are doing it on spreadsheets and it just doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>“The reality is this crisis is entirely a fossil-fuel crisis. And if we&#8217;d been using renewables as a primary source and then gas as a backup we wouldn&#8217;t be in this situation,” he added.</p>
<p>He said Octopus is an owner-operator of wind, solar and biomass renewable energy sources, with £3.5 billion in generation assets and plans to 10x that over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>The generation deal consists of a $300 million immediate investment, with $300 million to follow by June 2022, subject to certain further funding conditions.</p>
<p>Octopus has also established the <a href="https://www.centrefornetzero.org/">Centre for Net Zero</a>, an independent London-based research facility that is taking the fight against climate change to the government level and also invested £10 million into an R&amp;D and Training Centre for Decarbonisation of Heat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All good things must come to an end, and this proverb totally applies to our early-bird price on passes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=lastdayebsalespost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=lastdayebsalespost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>. Today’s the final day you can save $100 on the price of admission, folks. Join the global SaaS community to connect, inspire, network and learn how to build a stronger startup — without reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=lastdayebsalespost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=lastdayebsalespost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your TC Sessions: SaaS pass</a> by <strong>11:59 pm (PT) tonight</strong> to score the early-bird price and save $100.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from and engage with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#ab40f8e4-b236-4c11-8767-8fd7d75a618c">top leaders</a> in a sector that’s both evolving and expanding at a rapid pace. These presentations and breakout sessions are interactive, so bring your questions and opinions (we know you have plenty of both) and shape the conversation as you learn more about the direction of the next generation of SaaS products, platforms and technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">The TC Sessions: SaaS agenda</a> covers a range of topics. This discussion on open source is just one great example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Future Is Wide Open:</strong> Many startups today have an open source component, and it’s no wonder. It builds an audience and helps drive sales. We’ll talk with Abby Kearns from Puppet, Augusto “Aghi” Marietti from Kong and Jason Warner, an investor at Redpoint, about why open source is such a popular way to build a business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Automation is an essential SaaS element, and these two panel discussions take a deep dive into the role it plays now and in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now:</strong> One thing we learned during the pandemic is the importance of automation, and that’s only likely to be more pronounced as we move forward. We’ll talk with UiPath CEO Daniel Dines, Laela Sturdy, an investor at CapitalG, and Dave Wright from ServiceNow about why this is automation’s moment.</li>
<li><strong>Future Forward — How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches Are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation:</strong> Digital transformation efforts in a number of industries have driven massive adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) over the past decade. The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle, with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving — too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, AKASA co-founder and CTO, will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries.

					<description><![CDATA[AutoLeap is bringing the auto repair shop into the 21st century by digitizing their workflow and reducing the manual double-entry shop owners are used to doing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nine months after announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/autoleap-thinks-it-will-turn-chaotic-repair-shop-experiences-into-seamless-ones/">$5 million seed round</a>, Toronto auto repair software company AutoLeap is back with $18 million in Series A funding, this time led by Bain Capital Ventures.</p>
<p>Joining Bain in the round is existing investor Threshold Ventures, which led the seed round, to give the company $23 million in total funding.</p>
<p>Co-CEO Steve Lau told TechCrunch that AutoLeap is bringing the auto repair shop into the 21st century by reducing the double- or triple-entry shop owners typically have to do through the digitization of their workflow — customer quoting, invoices and job estimates — and the processing of all of that in the backend accounting. It also provides a sales and marketing component via customer relationship management, scheduling via app, customer texting or emails and online reviews.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AutoLeap says it will repair your lousy relationship with car shops&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/autoleap-thinks-it-will-turn-chaotic-repair-shop-experiences-into-seamless-ones/embed/#?secret=YU3HKrgDEe" data-secret="YU3HKrgDEe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since the seed round and launching last year, the company has grown “well beyond expectations, Lau said. From a team perspective, the company has grown five times and increased 10 times in customer base. Revenue also continues to grow month over month.</p>
<p>“We are more convinced about the market opportunity and our fit in it,” he added. “One of our first customers also recently shared that in the first 10 months of using AutoLeap, his shop doubled its revenue. This is having a real impact in their lives.”</p>
<p>Growing a business is second nature to Lau, who with co-CEO Rameez Ansari spent four years as the co-CEOs of FieldEdge, a SaaS company that helps contractors run their small businesses. They grew the company to 200 employees in over three years, which allowed them to hit the ground running with AutoLeap, Lau said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s team is spread out in Canada, the U.S. and Pakistan. Most of its customers are in the U.S. — 85% — with the rest in Canada.</p>
<p>Lau estimates that the automotive aftermarket is a $700 billion industry, with 1 million technicians and 300,000 shops.</p>
<p>“We are only in the second inning of this market transitioning from pen to digital,” he said. “A  lot of the new capital will be used to capture that market opportunity and hire a world-class team to help us put out a better product and customer service.”</p>
<p>He expects to triple AutoLeap’s workforce in the next 12 months and will be focusing on creating a diverse employee base.</p>
<p>Ajay Agarwal, partner at Bain Capital Ventures, said via email that “small businesses are the backbone of our economy” and as seen in other sectors, like consumer brands, restaurants and retail, business owners are seeking modern cloud software that enables them to remain competitive and deliver a better experience for customers.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t be more excited to partner with Steve and Rameez as they tackle the enormous opportunity of helping the 300,000 independent auto repair shops move their businesses into the digital age,” Agarwal added. “AutoLeap is bringing a combination of a comprehensive SAAS platform with embedded payments and a marketplace to auto repair shops, one of the last verticals yet to make the leap to the cloud.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA['It’s easier to raise and harder to spend these days, because there’s such a high demand for talent.']]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market today has a lot of activation energy, even as the pandemic continues to play out. We&#8217;re seeing ample capital, a focus on distributed investing, more first-check investors than ever before, and, fittingly, a parade of new startups.</p>
<p>That said, momentum has a way of overwhelming even the most ambitious. For founders at the earliest stages of building a company, it’s imperative to spend in a balanced yet growth-focused manner. At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week, Harlem Capital’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hpierrejacques">Henri Pierre-Jacques</a> and BBG Ventures’ <a href="https://twitter.com/Nish67">Nisha Dua</a> explained how founders should allocate their recently raised dollars in today’s environment.</p>
<p>Personal finance — even for founders — varies for everyone, but the investors drew from their experience with their portfolio companies and their own ethos to give general advice on everything from the importance of an emergency-day fund to how much energy to actually put into hiring new talent.</p>
<h2>Hiring 101</h2>
<p>Dua addressed the elephant in the room right away: Hiring. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/21/how-to-hire-is-the-new-how-to-conserve-runway/">As we’ve seen</a>, hiring has always been hard for startups, which are more strapped for resources than, say, a Facebook that can offer an engineer a $1 million signing bonus without blinking an eye. Founders and investors tell me that hiring is only getting harder as an increasing number of well-capitalized startups are rising up with impressive valuations.</p>
<p>Dua feels it&#8217;s right for hiring to be at the top of every founder’s list, but she urged those listening to start by thinking backward.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s easier to raise and harder to spend these days, because there’s such a high demand for talent. The answer for where to spend is going to be different for every company across many different industries.</p>
<p>I think a lot of us would admit that we&#8217;re not really great at planning or budgeting in our own lives. But we have to be great at that for our companies to succeed, to grow and to get to profitability. And so what we like to sort of challenge founders on is, ‘Can you articulate your North Star? And then what is your plan? And is that plan executable to get to that North Star?’ That’s really where the plan for how to spend comes in. You&#8217;re not going to reach that North Star in the first 18 months after your first check, obviously, but you&#8217;re going to have a set of milestones that get you to the first hurdle.</p>
<p>[So, think about] the things that are going to make this company most successful in the pursuit of achieving that greater North Star? Hiring is certainly going to be at the top of that list.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pierre-Jacques drew from his portfolio company, Miami-based Pangea, which recently raised a $70 million Series B, to illustrate one way he&#8217;s seen entrepreneurs navigate the talent wars. In short, founders should permit themselves to step away from the hiring process.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The capital market for startups has perhaps never been more attractive than it is today. Not only are venture capitalists <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2021/07/venture-pulse-q2-2021.pdf">raising more capital than ever</a>, but new methods of financing startup activity are maturing. The result is a capital market that is increasingly competitive for startup attention, and business, which may lead to better prices for founders and their startups.</p>
<p>Venture debt is not new, but twists on this model are taking new prominence in how startups pay for their growth, for example.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>The expanding value of what young technology companies create could be helping change the market for how they are financed: Many tech startups build software, and the value of software revenues has grown in recent quarters. This means that when startups grow their revenues, they generate more value than in times past. In turn, that bolsters the value of shares in the company more rapidly than in previous market cycles.</p>
<p>Selling equity, then, is more costly than before. That fact may lead to startups not wanting to pursue equity-only transactions when possible. Why? Because if a company can borrow capital at rock-bottom effective rates, it will nearly always prove more inexpensive over the long term than selling shares in its business that have essentially uncapped upside.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/videos/?video=2206216">held a panel on revenue-based financing at Disrupt the other week</a>, from which we’ve pulled a number of quotes to help frame our thinking around venture capital investment and when startups may want to pursue other methods of funding.</p>
<p>With alternative capital concerns <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/pipe-snaps-up-former-stripe-and-hubspot-execs/">like Pipe attracting top talent while expanding to new markets</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">Clearbanc rebranding to Clearco while raising $100 million earlier this year</a>, it’s clear that the market for funds outside of traditional venture checks is maturing. Let’s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Not just SaaS</h2>
<p>While we tend to view the larger startup market through the prism of software, the recent Warby Parker public offering makes it clear that venture-level returns are possible for companies with a number of business models. <div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Twitter classifies anyone who uses Twitter for work as a professional &#8212; to qualify for a professional account, users must have no repeated history of violating guidelines, and they must be authentic, with an account name, bio and profile picture. That means no fictional characters, parody accounts or pet accounts allowed (but some pets do have enough of a social following to make their owners money, in which case&#8230; is the dog a professional? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>
<p>Not all users have the capability to switch to a professional account just yet. But, when it&#8217;s available, users will be able to find a Twitter for Professionals tab by swiping open the sidebar from the Home timeline on the app. A &#8220;Switch to Professional&#8221; tab will also appear under profile settings. Then, select the most accurate category and either a business or creator account type. Once you&#8217;ve converted to a professional account, you will be prompted to follow topics, promote a tweet in an ad campaign, or customize your profile with modules. These include an about module, a shop module and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/twitter-is-testing-a-feature-that-puts-users-revue-newsletters-on-their-profiles/">newsletter module</a> for users on Revue, the newsletter service Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">acquired</a> early this year.</p>

<p>If you decide that maybe you&#8217;re more of an amateur tweeter than a professional, it&#8217;s possible to switch your account back by navigating to edit profile, then edit professional profile, then switch account type. You also can toggle between whether you&#8217;re a business or a creator account, because at this point, sometimes it&#8217;s hard to tell! Twitter also wrote in its <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/account-setup/professional-accounts.html">FAQ</a> that you can only convert an existing Twitter account to a professional account (you can&#8217;t make a new account professional to begin with), and as of now, Twitter doesn&#8217;t have plans to allow for ads targeting professional accounts specifically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vareto.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vareto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup aiming to help companies conduct more forward-looking financial planning and analysis, is coming out of stealth today with $24 million in total funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GV (formerly Google Ventures) led its $20 million Series A this year, and Menlo Ventures led its $4.2 million seed financing in the summer of 2020. Menlo also put money in the company’s latest round, in addition to 40 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">angel investors, including tech unicorn founders and chief financial officers. The angels who either backed the company in its seed or Series A round are a high-profile bunch, and include Asana COO <span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Anne Raimondi&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:1317825,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;10&quot;:1,&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:1136076},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;21&quot;:1,&quot;23&quot;:1}" data-sheets-hyperlink="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anneraimondi/">Anne Raimondi, Salesforce President and ex-CFO Mark Hawkins, Splunk CFO Jason Child, Facebook CFO Dave Wehner, Affirm CFO Michael Linford, Egnyte CEO and co-founder Vineet Jain, Microsoft CVP Manik Gupta and Hippo Insurance&#8217;s VP of Finance Roy Hefer. Talk about validation.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its own words, Mountain View-based Vareto is developing a new platform for FP&amp;A (financial planning &amp; analysis) teams with the goal of “building the future of financial planning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things that stands out about Vareto &#8212; besides its impressive list of early investors of course &#8212; is its founding team. Before stints as an investor, CEO </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katorekhova/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kat Orekhova</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was head of product at Ironclad and held a variety of roles at Facebook, including head of forecasting and analytics. While at the social media giant, Orekhova says she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">built Facebook&#8217;s “first-ever” data science team within FP&amp;A. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">President </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ls17/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lalit Singh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the former COO of Udacity and essentially led that company to being cash flow positive after being on the verge of shutting down. Prior to joining Udacity, he spent several years at Hewlett-Packard Enterprises where he did things such as lead that company’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital transformation of HPE’s $3 billion software business and serve as COO of its $2 billion Cloud business and VP of operational performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair teamed up in 2020 to come up with a platform that would give FP&amp;A teams the ability to “seamlessly” work across planning and reporting cycles. In other words, it wants to help such teams be more proactive and look toward the future instead of reactive and “looking in the rearview mirror.” Their goal was to create a strategic finance platform for the enterprise that had the look and feel of a consumer offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Orekhova, Vareto’s aim is perhaps even more simple &#8212; to h</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">elp companies run better with an integrated planning and reporting tool that aims to streamline the entire FP&amp;A process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Questions such as ‘How are we doing as a business and how could we be doing even better? are hard to answer today,” she said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the teams tasked with answering these questions (FP&amp;A) are the ones trying to set business targets. So those teams are the main focus of Vareto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For example,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we spoke to a hardware company whose team takes four weeks to put together the business summary for the prior month,” Orekhova explained. “So this means they&#8217;re always a month behind in the visibility into their business performance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s particularly difficult, she added. To understand how a business is doing, especially a very large enterprise business with many acquired companies across different business lines and different geographies, “you have to pull data from many different systems, you have to talk to many stakeholders” to understand what&#8217;s going on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And so assembling this view of your business is actually really hard today, and planning is even worse,” Orekhova added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of planning on average takes five months for a large company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So as you can imagine, by the time this process ends, the plan is very much out of date,” she told TechCrunch. “And that&#8217;s really why we started Vareto &#8212; because we saw this incredible lag between understanding how your business is doing, and actually being able to make an operational change to make things better.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211013" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211013" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2211013 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vareto-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211013" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vareto</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B SaaS startup thus aims to become a command center for the finance and executive teams to see how a business is doing in real time and to be able to make necessary operational changes faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you see a gap in an opportunity, you can immediately put resources toward that in days, not months,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time running HP’s cloud business, Singh recalls getting “three different answers from three different teams” about customer churn, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would be confused, which answers should I believe?” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Singh ended up assembling a 10-person “shadow finance and ops team” to get “the right information at the right time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later when he joined Udacity, he struggled with getting a forecast for a given year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have multiple systems and multiple businesses and getting information from them, and putting the right layer of information, just takes tons of time,” he said. “At both companies, I didn’t have the luxury of having a solution like we are building.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, the startup declined to reveal any hard revenue figures, saying only that its customers span different industries such as sales enablement, security and property tech and include Mindtickle and Landing, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vareto’s investors are naturally bullish on what the startup is doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naomi Pilosof Ionita, partner at Menlo Ventures, led Vareto’s seed round last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She saw an authenticity in the founding team that appealed to her. In addition, she said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">she loved how Vareto “marries financial metrics with operating metrics”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Often, these are composite metrics and the underlying levers are worth understanding,” Pilosof Ionita told TechCrunch. “Forecasting can’t be an ivory tower process. It’s a collaborative exercise with executives across the business who own the various inputs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VC says she experienced that firsthand when running product growth and monetization at Invoice2go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Regarding established incumbents in this space, we hear from their users that a lot of analyses and forecasts still default to Excel files being emailed back and forth,” she added. “FP&amp;A teams need a more modern platform that’s collaboration first and handles data interoperability well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyson Clark, general partner at GV, said he was not only impressed with the founding team and their combined experience, but also the ease of use of the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s clean and easy to learn and use,” he told TechCrunch. In fact, he was so taken with the platform, he backed the company at the Series A stage &#8212; a departure from his usual investing at B and C stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping companies make business better decisions continues to attract investor dollars at an increasingly rapid pace. Earlier this week, we reported on Sisu Data </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/sisu-data-raises-62m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising $62 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">eal-time Decision Intelligence Engine, which aims to give analysts and business leaders a way to analyze their cloud data to not only understand what’s happening in their business, but why it’s happening and what actions to take in response.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are all the rage at the moment. We’re seeing explosive growth in this sector as people experiment with building companies on top of tokens and smart contracts. And where new organization types bloom, so does the need for infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.utopialabs.io/">Utopia Labs</a> is a team of four founders who met on Discord and Twitter over the past few months &#8212; a story that is getting increasingly familiar in the crypto-driven web3 space where everything is moving incredibly fast at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/0xkaito">Kaito Cunningham</a> recently worked at crypto firm M31 and is in the On Deck Catalyst program. Utopia’s co-founders <a href="https://twitter.com/pryceandstuff">Pryce Adade Yebesi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alexanderwu2000">Alexander Wu</a> and Jason Chong also have held a scattering of tech builder background gigs, from Facebook internships to LunchClub to Microsoft. The collective interest in DAOs, though, was what brought them together to begin chatting and eventually building for the space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re not familiar with the DAO explosion happening, what we’re seeing is communities come together around a thesis that in the past may have required an LLC or C-corp structure in order to execute instead turning to blockchain solutions. Basically, company structure governed by a smart contract instead of legacy legal structures. Some current estimates put the value governed by DAO </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/03/biggest-daos-now-hold-6b-worth-of-digital-assets-consensys/#:~:text=The%2020%20largest%20decentralized%20autonomous,ConsenSys%2C%20an%20Ethereum%20software%20company."><span style="font-weight: 400;">treasuries at over $6 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, up from $1 billion earlier this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you plot the curve, you’ll see the potential for growth is pretty enormous. And with the vast majority of DAOs operating across international boundaries on a global scale, there is a big need for infrastructure build out that takes over where the contract ends, namely in areas like payroll, expenses, token distribution and HR management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utopia Labs is building out a stack of infrastructure tools for DAOs and they’re starting with the payments bit. They’ve raised $1.5 million from a group of investors to begin hiring a </span><a href="https://utopia-labs.notion.site/47eac0e68b9a461c8daf473d0f61ca06#8839ae25306b473ea0f1bdcaf61e4d6a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full stack engineer and front-end engineer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round was led by Kindred Ventures, which has invested in other bleeding-edge crypto </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/crypto-driven-marketplace-zora-raises-2m-to-build-a-sustainable-creator-economy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">platforms like Zora</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Bitski. Other investors participating include Syndica DAO, 4th Revolution Capital Ascend Venture Capital and angels like Trevor McFedries at Brud, Alex Zhang at Friends With Benefits (another major DAO), Tyson Battistella from Zora, Anirudh Pai at On Deck, Colin Goltra at Binance, Gabby Dizon from YGG, Jason Choi from Spartan Fund, Jeff Weinstein from Stripe, Junaid Hassan and several others.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2211232" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="642" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png 1662w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=768,482 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=680,426 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=1536,963 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-01-at-9.17.01-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all of this sounds incredibly bleeding edge, it is. The team literally founded the company earlier in September &#8212; yes, the month that we are at the end of currently. They saw the opportunity to build out in this space that has energized the web3 space and dove in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many DAOs pay members in their own tokens, increasing ownership stakes to provide members with an opportunity for greater rewards down the line or immediate liquidity. Utopia is building right on top of Gnosis SAFE, the financial core of most DAOs. The V1 product is focused on member payments and invoice workflows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vast majority of DAOs are operating token distribution and payments based on raw dumps of data. As the saying goes, where you see a CSV, there’s a business opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team says they’ve built invoices and reimbursements workflows so that DAOs can receive, pay out and manage invoices and reimbursement requests. They’ve also built all-in-one transactions to allow DAOs to batch payments in one transaction across multiple people and coins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up is financial analysis and accounting to attach labels and metadata to payments in order to avoid manual accounting via Etherscan dump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The forward-looking roadmap includes traditional fiat currency services, cross-chain DAOs, real-world compliance workflows and DAO ecosystem partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world of DAOs is currently on fire, with dozens of viable organizations that have significant momentum &#8212; but not nearly enough infrastructure to make them truly efficient. It&#8217;s a truly interesting and diverse landscape that has come a long way since The DAO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/the-only-thing-that-really-worried-me-was-the-ether/">nearly derailed Ethereum</a> back in 2016. Today&#8217;s DAOs are more company scale than network scale but are moving faster and building cooler things than containers for money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;On-chain payroll make DAOs truly crypto-native,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa">Cooper Turley</a>, a co-founder of <a href="https://twitter.com/fwbtweets">FWB</a> and full-time DAO explorer. “In a world where dozens of members are contributing from every corner of the world, automating salaries, incentives and bounties are the only way in which DAOs can scale.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to what Utopia Labs is doing, Multisafe, Commonwealth, Parcel and Colony are all names to watch in the DAO infrastructure space. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann </a>and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> were all aboard this week under the guidance of <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a>, meaning that we were running full-strength for our roundup of this <em>super</em> busy week.</p>
<p>Before we hop into the topics, you can follow the show on Twitter &#8212; all the cool kids do! &#8212; and keep in mind that on Mondays Equity provides a short kickoff to the week, we chat a single topic on Wednesdays and Fridays are when we go through the full week. Make sense? Hell yeah:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiveable landed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/fiveable-lands-10m-series-a-to-become-the-hallways-of-the-educational-internet/">$10 million Series A to become the digital hallways of the educational internet</a>. It&#8217;s their words, not ours, and Mary Ann had some fair questions on how they&#8217;ll differentiate from other competitors.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/cobalt-launches-from-beta-with-a-2-8m-seed-to-help-creators-launch-products/">Cobalt raised $2.8 million</a> to help creators build and sell more stuff. As part of our continuing focus on creators more broadly, we had a few questions!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/weight-health-startup-found-comes-out-of-stealth-with-32m-in-funding-former-bumble-exec-as-new-ceo/">Found came out of stealth</a> with $32 million in total funding from GV, Atomic and Define Ventures. The startup is focused on &#8220;weight care management&#8221; and it&#8217;s notable that the co-founder of Atomic, which incubated this company, also co-founded hims and hers &#8212; which also has a telehealth component. Found&#8217;s new CEO is the former COO of Bumble, who drafted its S-1 while getting chemo treatment for stage 3 breast cancer.</li>
<li>From there we dug into trends! First up was the trend of startups going full-stack, which we kicked off with a look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/angellist-stack-founder/">AngelList&#8217;s new Stack &#8212; har har &#8212; product</a>. The suite screams Carta and Stripe, but then again, doesn&#8217;t everything compete with each other these days?</li>
<li>Next up was consolidation, which echoed our first conversation. Discussing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/rpa-industry-consolidation-continues-with-sale-of-blue-prism-to-vista-for-1-095b/">recent deal in the RPA space</a>, the Equity team made predictions about which sectors in the startup world are the most likely to see consolidation in the coming quarters.</li>
<li>And we closed with climate tech, a startup niche that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech/">could bring a small sliver of hope to our heating planet</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this, and we still managed to sneak a Froyo metaphor into the running for best Official Equity comment of all time.</p>
