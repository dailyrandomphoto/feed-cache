										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/19/facebooks-tracking-of-non-users-ruled-illegal-again/">long running privacy fight</a> between Belgium&#8217;s data protection authority and Facebook &#8212; over the latter&#8217;s use of online trackers like pixels and social plug-ins to snoop on web users &#8212; has culminated in a <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=FC1B570EC8016A36873DB5D55DBDB12A?text=&amp;docid=236410&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=779232">ruling</a> by Europe&#8217;s top court today that could have wider significance on how cross-border cases against tech giants are enforced in the region.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice of the European Union has affirmed that, in certain circumstances, national DPAs can pursue action even when they are not the lead data supervisor under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism (OSS) &#8212; opening up the possibility of litigation by watchdogs in Member States which aren&#8217;t the lead regulator for a particular company but where the local agency believes there is an urgent need to act.</p>
<p>The OSS was included in the GDPR with the idea of simplifying enforcement for businesses operating in more than one EU market &#8212; which would only need to deal directly with one &#8216;lead&#8217; data protection authority. However the mechanism has been criticized for contributing to a bottleneck effect whereby multiple GDPR complaints are stacking up on the desks of a couple of DPAs (most notably Ireland and Luxembourg) &#8212; EU Member States which attract large numbers of multinationals (typically for tax reasons, such as Ireland&#8217;s 12.5% corporate tax rate).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Enforcement of the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection regime against tech giant has thus been hampered by a perception of &#8216;forum shopping&#8217; &#8212; whereby a handful of EU DPAs have a disproportionately large number of major, cross-border cases to deal with vs the (inevitably limited) resources provided for them by their national governments. The resulting bottleneck looks convenient for those companies that face delayed GDPR enforcement.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lack of big tech GDPR decisions looms large in EU watchdog&#8217;s annual report&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/lack-of-big-tech-gdpr-decisions-looms-large-in-eu-watchdogs-annual-report/embed/#?secret=kCkpXAvuCS" data-secret="kCkpXAvuCS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Some EU DPAs are also considered more active in enforcement of the bloc&#8217;s privacy rules than others &#8212; and it&#8217;s fair to say that Ireland is not among them. (Albeit, it defends the pace of its investigations and enforcement record by saying that it must do due diligence to ensure decisions stand up to any legal challenges.)</p>
<p>Indeed, Ireland has been criticized for (among other things) the length of time it&#8217;s taken to investigate GDPR complaints; for procedural issues (how it&#8217;s gone about investigating or indeed not investigating complaints); and for its enforcement record against tech giants &#8212; which to date is limited to just one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">$550k penalty issued against Twitter</a> issued at the end of last year.</p>
<p>The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) had originally wanted to give Twitter an even lower fine but other EU DPAs disputed its draft decision &#8212; forcing it to increase the penalty slightly.</p>
<p>As it stands, scores of cases remain open on the DPC&#8217;s desk, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">major complaints against Facebook and Google</a> &#8212; which are now over three years old.</p>
<p>This has led to calls for the Commission to step in and take action over Ireland&#8217;s perceived inaction. Although, for now, the EU&#8217;s executive has limited its intervention to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-up-to-catch-big-tech-report-warns/">a few words</a> urging Ireland to, essentially, hurry up and get on with the job.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GDPR&#8217;s two-year review flags lack of &#8216;vigorous&#8217; enforcement&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/embed/#?secret=AAK8pIhAbR" data-secret="AAK8pIhAbR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s CJEU ruling may alleviate a little of the blockage around GDPR enforcement &#8212; in some narrow situations &#8212; by enabling national DPAs to take up the baton to litigate over users&#8217; rights when a lead agency isn&#8217;t acting on complaints.</p>
<p>However the ruling does not look set to completely unblock the OSS mechanism, per Luca Tosoni, a research fellow at the Norwegian Research Center for Computers and Law at the University of Oslo who has been following the case closely &#8212; and whose work was cited by the CJEU&#8217;s advocate general in an earlier opinion on the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Court has essentially confirmed the views that the Advocate General had expressed in his opinion: Under the GDPR’ one-stop-shop system, those data protection authorities that are not the ‘lead authority’ may start enforcement actions against big tech companies only in very limited circumstances, including in case of urgency,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, unfortunately, the Court’s ruling does not elaborate on the criteria to be followed to assess the urgency of an enforcement action. In particular, the Court has not expressly seconded the advocate general’s view that a failure to act promptly from the part of the lead authority may justify the adoption of interim urgent measures by other data protection authorities. Thus, this important point remains partially unclear, and further litigation might be necessary to clarify this issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, today’s ruling is unlikely to completely settle the &#8216;Irish issue&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Article 56 of the GDPR allows for non-lead DPAs to pursue action at a national level in the case of complaints that relate to an issue that substantially affects only users under their jurisdiction, and where they believe there is a need to act urgently (as a lead authority has not). So it does seem fairly narrow.</p>
<p>One recent example of a non-lead DPA intervention is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death/">Italian DPA&#8217;s emergency action against TikTok</a> &#8212; related to child safety on the platform after the death of a local girl who had been reported to have participated in a challenge on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;An authority’s wish to adopt a ‘go-it-alone’ approach&#8230; with regard to the (judicial) enforcement of the GDPR, without cooperating with the other authorities, cannot be reconciled with either the letter or the spirit of that regulation,&#8221; runs one paragraph of today&#8217;s judgement, underlining the court&#8217;s view that the GDPR requires careful and balanced joint-working between DPAs.</p>
<p>The ruling does go into some detailed discussion of the &#8220;dangers&#8221; of under-enforcement of the GDPR &#8212; as the concern was raised with the CJEU &#8212; but the court takes the view that it&#8217;s too soon to say whether such a concern affects the regulation or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;If, however, [under-enforcement were to] be evidenced by facts and robust arguments – then I do not believe that the Court would turn a blind eye to any gap which might thereby emerge in the protection of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter and their effective enforcement by the competent regulators,&#8221; the CJEU goes on. &#8220;Whether that would then still be an issue for a Charter-conform interpretation of provisions of secondary law, or an issue of validity of the relevant provisions, or even sections of a secondary law instrument, is a question for another case.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ruling, while narrow, may at least unblock the Belgian DPA&#8217;s long-running litigation against Facebook&#8217;s tracking of non-users via cookies and social plug-ins which was the route for the referral of questions over the scope of the OSS to the CJEU.</p>
<p>Although the court also notes that it will be for a Belgian court to determine whether the DPA&#8217;s intervention meets the GDPR&#8217;s bar for starting such proceedings or not.</p>
<p>Contacted for comment on the CJEU judgement, Facebook welcomed the ruling.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that the CJEU has upheld the value and principles of the one-stop-shop mechanism, and highlighted its importance in ensuring the efficient and consistent application of GDPR across the EU,” said Jack Gilbert, associate general counsel at Facebook in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/thumbtack-acquires-setter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making an acquisition</a> in December of home management startup Setter, <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thumbtack</a> &#8212; one of the pioneers in the home services gig economy &#8212; has raised a big round to double down on the model. The company has raised a fresh $275 million, money that the company plans to use to built out a home management and maintenance business alongside its network of home services professionals. Co-founder and CEO Marco Zappacosta confirmed that the round values Thumbtack at $3.2 billion.</p>
<p>For some context, this is nearly double the valuation Thumbtack had when it last raised money, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/thumbtack-raises-150-million-for-its-local-services-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$150 million round led by Sequoia in 2019</a>. It also comes on the heels of a strong 2020, where its revenue grew more than 50%. Thumbtack&#8217;s gross revenue (what&#8217;s paid in service fees, not Thumbtack&#8217;s cut) is now on track, it says, to cross $2 billion this year.</p>
<p>This latest funding is being led by the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), with participation also from Blackstone Alternative Asset Management (BAAM) as well as G Squared. Previous backers Ballie Gifford, CapitalG, Founders Circle Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Tiger Global Management also invested.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding and shifting focus of the company underscore some of the changes we have seen among consumers in the last year.</p>
<p>In large part, because of Covid-19, most of us have been staying home &#8212; which has often included also moving to new homes to accommodate spending so much more time in them &#8212; and, as Thumbtack sees it, that has led many more people to paying more attention to how to make those homes better places, and to keep them in better shape overall. This is partly why it sees a big opportunity &#8212; alongside being a marketplace to find pro&#8217;s for one-off jobs you might need done around the house &#8212; in providing a &#8220;home management&#8221; platform to cater to that new attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty wild that people&#8217;s homes their biggest assets, the most complicated thing you&#8217;re responsible for, but it doesn&#8217;t come with a manual,&#8221; Zappacosta said in an interview. &#8220;When you think about your car, you need to do regular service. Otherwise, you may have to pay a big emergency bill [to fix something]. That same concept applies to the home. But there&#8217;s never been an easy way to know what you should do, how much to pay for it, and then easily get it done. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The services include emergency repairs of electrics in the home, plus preventative maintenance that you may need to do to on your property, he said. They don&#8217;t include contractors to refit bathrooms or other elective work.</p>
<p>The move into home management is an interesting turn for another reason, too. It&#8217;s a sign of how Thumbtack is playing into a bigger change in how many consumers engage with services overall: by way of subscriptions.</p>
<p>That is to say, while many of us will still go out and shop for items, or go to a cinema every now and then, we are all also subscribing to at least one video-on-demand service, many of us may well also have Prime accounts to get Amazon&#8217;s various perks, and so on. If we are subscribing for everything and everywhere else, why not throw home maintenance into the mix?</p>
<p>Thumbtack, now over ten years old, is thought by many as one of the earliest movers in the gig economy space to focus on home services. That has not come without challenges, however. As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/thumbtack-series-h/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported back in 2019</a>, the last round was a tough one for the company and looked like it might come in at a flat valuation. That was on the heels of many others in the space &#8212; competitors of Thumbtack&#8217;s that included not just other startups but also heavy hitters like Amazon and Google &#8212; fizzling out in their own efforts in home services.</p>
<p>And Covid-19 proved to be a huge challenge for Thumbtack, too, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/thumbtack-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off 250 people</a> in March last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, look, it was a roller coaster of a year,&#8221; Zappacosta said when I asked him about that. &#8220;In the early phases of COVID, there was so much fear that many just shut it all down. People said, &#8216;I&#8217;m not going to have anybody in my home.&#8217; And so those months were really scary &#8212; March, April &#8212; because it was unclear how long that was going to last. And so we made adjustments to ensure that we sort of would stand the test of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, that appeared to change later in the year, he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once people began getting more comfortable with masking up, and all the precautions, you know, demand did start to come back. And so by June, July, we saw ot get back to normal levels. And then you know, what happened is the big investments that we&#8217;ve been making in the platform in the last few years to make the hiring experience, much more e-commerce, like really began to pay more and more dividends.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that 2020 was Thumbtack&#8217;s third year of accelerating growth, &#8220;which is sort of surprising given that Covid was in the middle of that. And so the momentum that we&#8217;re carrying out, is we&#8217;ve never been in a stronger position.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company now is focusing on where it might best use technology to get the upper hand with its platform, which competes not just with other home services provider marketplaces, but also a growing number of upstart and incumbent &#8220;home management&#8221; providers like Super, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/super-raises-50m-to-cover-home-repairs-and-maintenance-via-a-subscription-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which raised $50 million last month</a>.</p>
<p>One interesting idea that Zappacosta described to me, which may well be part of a later phase of development, involved providing a way for customers to &#8220;tour&#8221; their homes so that Thumbtack could get a better idea of the space and what needs attention to better personalize its home management to the home and user in question.</p>
<p>That will keep the company working also in the U.S. he said, rather than expanding internationally. Globally the home services and repair market is estimated to be worth some $500 billion annually, and amazingly the U.S. represents a massive 40% of that value.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://klaxoon.com/fr/home">Klaxoon</a> is announcing a product update for its whiteboard collaboration platform as well as a new hardware product. With Hybridity, the company is going to sell ready-to-use conference rooms that optimize hybrid meetings between people currently in the office and people on the go.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the software update. Last year, the company unveiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/klaxoon-launches-board-an-interactive-meeting-product-for-video-calls/">Board</a>, a visual interface that lets you work together during a video call. It lets you share ideas and collaborate using a whiteboard interface. You can create sticky notes, add text, insert images, move things around and start a video call from there.</p>
<p>Other people on the calls are represented through tiny thumbnails so that you can remain focused on the digital whiteboard. You can also connect Board with your existing video-conferencing tool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, the company is updating Board and renaming it to Board Hybrid. “It’s the new version of Board that isn’t only designed for remote work, but also for hybrid work,” founder and CEO Matthieu Beucher said in a press conference.</p>
<p>Board Hybrid users can now add any type of file to their whiteboard. This way, they don’t have to upload files to a shared drive, create a link and paste the link in the whiteboard. Users can preview PowerPoint presentations, Word files, spreadsheets and more directly from Klaxoon’s interface.</p>
<p>There are some new drawing tools including some new connectors. For instance, you can create mindmaps from there. You can now also share your screen from Klaxoon’s own video-conferencing solution.</p>

<p>The new product is something quite different — it’s a meeting room called Hybridity. It looks like a hexagon-shaped space capsule. There’s no window and it feels like a black box from the outside.</p>
<p>Inside, you’ll find three seats, three screens, three cameras and three <a href="https://klaxoon.com/fr/klaxoon-box">Klaxoon Box</a> devices. “Everyone can see everyone perfectly well and everybody can immerse themselves in content,” Beucher said.</p>
<p>If you’ve joined a hybrid meeting from your home, you’re well aware of the issues involved with that setup. Part of the team is sitting in the same room. They look like tiny action figures and you can’t figure out who’s talking.</p>
<p>With this setup, Klaxoon hopes it’ll be easier to run meetings with people in the office and people at home. A Klaxoon Hybridity conference room requires 5 square meters. You can put it down in a corner and move it to another location a couple of years later. It’s not secured in the ground.</p>
<p>Pre-orders will start this week. The company expects to sell Hybridity with a subscription model with prices starting at €2,000 per month. It’s going to be interesting to see whether Klaxoon has found a new revenue stream of it it’s just a fun experiment. But it could replace those tiny phone booths in your office.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G2 Venture Partners, a firm that spun out of Kleiner and Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, has raised $500 million to support entrepreneurs that aim to make existing industries more efficient, environmentally friendly and socially responsible.  </span></p>
<p>With Fund II, G2 is most bullish about technologies in transportation, logistics, manufacturing, agriculture and energy, with an increasing focus on sustainability, according to a spokesperson for the firm.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The launch of our second fund expands our ability to work with companies that are moving the needle to redefine and revolutionize their respective industries,” said G2VP founding partner David Mount in a statement. “We will continue to partner with technology companies that are pushing the future of industry forward, driving economic growth with reduced resource intensity.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors in the new fund include Shell Ventures, Mitsui &amp; Co., Daimler AG, ABB Switzerland Ltd. and The McKnight Foundation, a G2 spokesperson told TechCrunch. John Doerr, famed investor and VC at Kleiner, also personally invested in the fund. </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180615075230/https://fortune.com/2018/06/12/kleiner-perkins-g2vp-350-million-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doerr invested in G2VP’s initial $350 million fund back in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he’s known for delivering an </span><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/john_doerr_salvation_and_profit_in_greentech"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emotional TED Talk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which he argued for increased investments in clean energy.</span></p>
<p>The firm has already led rounds in AVEVA-acquired industrial data management platform OSIsoft, Oracle-acquired utility customer engagement platform Opower and solar energy company Enphase. Kleiner led Enphase&#8217;s past fundraising rounds <a href="https://www.appliedmaterials.com/en-sg/company/news/press-releases/2010/06/enphase-energy-completes-financing-round-of-63-million">back in 2010</a>, and in 2017, <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/silicon-valleys-john-doerr-and-tj-rodgers-invest-10m-in-enphases-microin">Doerr stepped back in</a> to help the financially struggling company with another $10 million alongside T.J. Rodgers. G2 would not provide names of portfolio companies for this newest fund yet, but a spokesperson did say Fund II will be investing in a new set of companies. Any follow-on investments in companies from Fund I will be made out of that fund.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm invested in 15 late-stage companies in Fund I and expects to invest in a similar number of companies in Fund II. G2VC typically invests $10 million to $50 million in each company. Past portfolio companies include lidar manufacturer Luminar, EV tech company Proterra, computer vision solutions provider Scandit, autonomous robot company Seegrid and agricultural supply chain platform ProducePay, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This team has consistently shown vision and taken action that is ahead of the curve on many aspects of the digital industrial transition the world is in the midst of,” said Robert Linck, chief investment officer of Shell Ventures, a limited partner in G2’s first and second funds, in a statement. “The brain trust at this firm will be a significant asset to the new generation of technology leaders and path breakers that is emerging today.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kai-Fu Lee&#8217;s Sinovation Ventures has its eyes on a niche market targeting software developers. In April, the venture capital fund led a $10 million angel round in <a href="https://en.jingos.com/">Jingling</a>, a Chinese startup developing Linux-based tablets and laptops, TechCrunch has learned. Other investors in the round included private equity firm Trustbridge Partners.</p>
<p>Jingling was founded only in June 2020 but has quickly assembled a team of 80 employees hailing from the likes of Aliyun OS, Alibaba&#8217;s Linux distribution, Thunder Software, a Chinese operating system solution provider, and China&#8217;s open source community.</p>
<p>The majority of the startup&#8217;s staff are working on its Linux-based operating system called JingOS in Beijing, with the rest developing hardware in Shenzhen, where its supply chain is located.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Operating systems are a highly worthwhile field for investment,&#8221; Peter Fang, a partner at Sinovation Ventures, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the best product iteration for work and entertainment through the combination of iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard, but no tablet maker has delivered a superior user experience for the Android system so far, so we decided to back JingOS.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The investment is also in line with Sinovation&#8217;s recognition and prediction in ARM powering more mobile and desktop devices in the future,&#8221; the investor added.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/byEN1AnLC4o?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Jingling&#8217;s first device, the JingPad A1 tablet based on the ARM architecture, has already shipped over 500 units in a pre-sale and is ramping up interest through a <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jingpad-world-s-first-consumer-level-linux-tablet">crowdfunding campaign</a>. Jingling currently uses processors from Tsinghua Unigroup but is looking into Qualcomm and MediaTek chipsets for future production, according to Liu.</p>
<p>On the software end, JingOS, which is <a href="https://github.com/JingOS-team/JingOS">open sourced on GitHub</a>, has accumulated over 50,000 downloads from users around the world, most of whom are in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>But how many people want a Linux tablet or laptop? Liu Chengcheng, who launched Jingling with Zhu Rui, said the demand is big enough from the developer community to sustain the startup&#8217;s early-phase growth. Liu is known for founding China&#8217;s leading startup news site 36Kr and Zhu is an operating system expert and a veteran of Motorola and Lenovo.</p>
<p>Targeting the Linux community is step one for Jingling, for &#8220;it&#8217;s difficult to gain a foothold by starting out in the [general] consumer market,&#8221; said Liu.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Linux market is too small for tech giants but too hard for small startups to tackle&#8230; aside from Jingling, Huawei is the only other company in China building a mobile operating system, but HarmonyOS focuses more on IoTs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launching a new operating system is surely an audacious move and has been done before. Linux laptops <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/20/laptop-week-review-the-dell-xps-13-developers-edition-with-ubuntu/">have been around for years</a>, but Jingling wanted to offer something different by enabling both desktop and mobile experiences on one device. That&#8217;s why Jingling made JingOS compatible with both Linux desktop software like WPS Office and Terminal as well as the usual Android apps on smartphones. The JingPad A1 tablet comes with a detachable keyboard that immediately turns itself into a laptop, a setup similar to Apple&#8217;s Magic Keyboard for iPad.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a gift to programmers, who can use it to code in the Linux system but also use Android mobile apps on the run,&#8221; said Liu.</p>
<p>Jingling aspires to widen its user base and seize the Chromebook market about two from now, Liu said. The success of Chromebooks, which comprised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/chromebooks-had-a-banner-2020/">10.8% of the PC market in 2020</a> and have been increasingly eating into Microsoft&#8217;s dominance,<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> is indicative of the slowing demand for Windows personal computers, the founder observed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The JingPad A1 is sold at a starting price of $549, compared to Chrome&#8217;s wide price range roughly between $200 and $550 depending on the specs and hardware providers. Tablets, along with PCs, got a bump in sales during the pandemic, thanks to more people working and learning remotely, but in the long term, Jingling will have to get its pricing right and pin down where it sits in the market.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Self-expression for many consumers today comes in the form of social media and apps. But if you&#8217;re a larger business, even if you can&#8217;t ignore platforms like Facebook, a website still remains central part of your digital equation. Today, <a href="https://www.duda.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duda</a> &#8212; which has built a platform for larger businesses, and typically the agencies they employ, to build those websites &#8212; is announcing a round of growth funding of $50 million to expand its business.</p>
<p>This is a Series D, and it&#8217;s being led by Claridge IL with past investors Susquehanna Growth Equity and Vintage Investment Partners also participating. Itai Sadan, Duda&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Amir Glatt, would not disclose the valuation, except to say that it has tripled since its last round. (It didn&#8217;t disclose then, either.) It has now raised $100 million and Sadan believes that the longer-term step will be an IPO in two or three years.</p>
<p>This latest round in the meantime is Duda&#8217;s biggest funding round to date, and it comes on the back of a predictably big year &#8212; one in which online presence for many became their <em>only</em> presence.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Duda has now crossed 1 million published websites from a community of 17,000 developers building on its platform. As a point of comparison, when we covered the company&#8217;s previous round &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/duda-nabs-25m-to-take-on-wordpress-with-a-web-development-platform-aimed-at-agencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$25 million in September 2019</a> &#8212; Duda had crossed 560,000 websites and a community of 6,000 web professionals.</p>
<p>For some further context, these numbers may pale in comparison to WordPress overall, which today says it powers some 41% of the whole of the web (including, disclosure, TechCrunch.com itself) with tens of millions of websites created on its platform.</p>
<p>But Duda is not aiming to directly compete with all of WordPress, or SquareSpace, or Wix, or the wider field of web-building platforms: it describes itself as a &#8220;professional web site builder&#8221; and it specifically creates tools to handle not just large amounts of content, larger audiences, and larger processes (such as mass e-commerce transactions), but also a larger number of people who might need to engage with the site while it&#8217;s being constructed, and after it is built.</p>
<p>Having said that, in the area where it&#8217;s more directly competing &#8212; WordPress and others also provide tools to website building professionals and agencies &#8212; Sadan notes that some 60% of its customers are migrating from WordPress, according to the agencies that Duda has surveyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issues include security and, you know, plugins breaking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The analogy I like to use is that it&#8217;s like Android versus iPhone,&#8221; he added, which to him means  &#8220;you get everything from one vendor: we do the hosting, provide a website builder, the templates, the widgets. And and you have a support team that you can actually call and talk to if you have any problems. That&#8217;s the guarantee that we give to our customers.&#8221; If the customer in question is an agency running tens or hundreds, or even thousands of sites, that is the kind of customer Duda handles.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s more recent turn, he said, has been into SaaS: that is, websites that provide tools on their platforms that others in turn can use, whether those are travel planning tools, or e-commerce platforms, and so on. SaaS was an area Duda entered into back in 2019 and it now accounts for about half of its business, Sadan said.</p>
<p>Within, that, unsurprisingly, e-commerce has been one of the standout areas, growing 65% and now accounting for about 20% of all of Duda&#8217;s business. &#8220;Part of this raise is to double down on that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>“We look forward to partnering with Duda and its existing shareholders in further cementing Duda’s leadership in its space, as well as fulfilling its vision of making web design easy and scalable for web professionals serving clients across all industries,&#8221; said Oded Tal, Claridge IL’s founding managing partner, said in a statement. &#8220;The company has built an incredible product that is highly regarded by web professionals and operates in a truly massive, high growth market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tests are king in many school systems and other educational environments: they are seen as an efficient way to assess what knowledge students have retained, and how well they do on a level playing field where everyone has the same exam to take.</p>
<p>Some, however, believe that system is flawed, and today a startup that&#8217;s built a platform to provide another way of assessing and teaching is announcing a big round of funding on the heels of strong growth for its approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://goformative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formative</a> &#8212; a platform for K-12 teachers to provision assignments from other digital sources and learning platforms, assess how students handle them, help them based on those results, and then use progressive assignments to build a bigger picture and how that student is acquiring knowledge &#8212; has picked up $70 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding the reach of its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by Summit Partners previous investors Fika Ventures, Mac Ventures and Rethink Education also participating, among others. Formative is not disclosing its valuation but this is being described as a minority investment.</p>
<p>More significantly, it&#8217;s a major step up for the startup, which was founded in Santa Monica, CA, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/23/imagine-k12s-2011-startup-class-aims-to-invigorate-education-with-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2011</a> and had raised less than $7 million before now.</p>
<p>The funding however matches how well the startup has been doing. On the back of a major surge of interest in digital learning tools &#8212; spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, the subsequent closure of physical schools, and a huge shift to remote learning &#8212; Formative says that its platform is already in the majority of U.S. school districts (specifically 92% of all U.S. school districts have at least one teacher signed up); that more than four million students have engaged with &#8220;Formatives&#8221; (as the assignments are casually called); and that it is delivering annual recurring revenue growth of around 700%.</p>
<p>And in keeping with that momentum, Formative has a lot of ambitious plans for the funding. They include building more analytical tools for teachers and administrators as well as parents and students; taking Formative to more international markets (it&#8217;s currently most active in English-speaking countries); and more generally (and perhaps most importantly) building technology that&#8217;s helping the system rethink what a quality education might look like, what form that should take.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our big goals in the future is to really help be a gateway to evaluate the rigor and effectiveness of different curriculum streams,&#8221; said Craig Jones, the CEO who co-founded Formative with Kevin McFarland (the COO), in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re using all the data that we&#8217;ve collected, the billions of student responses to facilitate a bigger picture, insights on student learning, to the necessary stakeholders. That can spin off into a lot of different things that we can help our schools and teachers and parents use that data to ultimately drive additional learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones and McFarland came up with the idea for Formative the startup while working on education PhDs at UCLA, where they were looking at how different pedagogic approaches might prove to work better than traditional methods for learning. Formative the startup takes its name from the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formative_assessment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">formative evaluation</a>, where teachers provide regular, sustained assessment to check on students and modify how they are teaching to help them learn. In many ways it sits in opposition to an over-reliance on summative assessment, or the idea of wrapping up learning, and evaluating, based on a final test, although in practice even a shift to more formative can still help a student better prepare for those final summative assessments.</p>
<p>While the idea behind formative assessments has been around for a while, the breakthrough that Jones and McFarland had was to realize that the concept could be truly scaled and expanded if it was digitized, since that would enable efficient assignment delivery, and much more data collation, visualization, communication and analytics.</p>
<p>That concept, of course, took on a whole new profile in the last year and a half: schools and teachers that had already invested in the idea of using more digital tools, and possibly even Formative itself, ramped up their engagement; and they were joined by a new wave of educators scrambling to fill the big gap created by schools closing to slow down the spread of Covid-19, who might have previously had a very tenuous engagement with online learning. That had a big impact on a lot of the edtech sector, with online learning companies like Kahoot also seeing a big rise in use (and taking a bigger initiative into learning management by acquiring tools like Clever), as well as a plethora of other providers.</p>
<p>Formative too seized the moment and set up something it called the Covid-19 Assistance Program, providing free access to its platform &#8212; which is normally <a href="https://goformative.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">priced in different tiers</a>, starting at free for a basic service, then increasing to $12 and $17 or &#8216;contact us&#8217; based on numbers of teachers using the platform that allows for more integrations, more analytics and so on. Some 5,000 teachers and schools signed up for the free service, Jones said, and McFarland noted that as schools reopened, it&#8217;s continued through in what has definitely been an evolving engagement with technology for many in the classroom. (And not all are so quick to shift: my kids&#8217; secondary school in London still strictly forbids people using &#8220;screens&#8221; at school and in classrooms.)</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a really big shift in the U.S., where there are more devices in classrooms now than there are students,&#8221; said McFarland, who said that many are taking a hybrid approach of saying, effectively, &#8216;If we want to utilize this, we can utilize it but not necessarily rely on it every single day.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll see a lot of flexibility,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;They&#8217;re using a device, not a toy. We try to work a lot in that flexible hybrid environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>The approach it has taken is to make its system work in as seamless a way as possible for teachers, by not only integrating with all the learning materials that are &#8220;native&#8221; to digital platforms, but also making digitized versions of the most popular publications, and those that they are using as part of their curriculum, also something the teachers can call up and assign through Formative. In that regard, it&#8217;s not a learning content company, but more of a channel for making the content that is there, more accessible and more useful. It also links up with other tools like learning management systems when they are used to create a more efficient process overall.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a model that has resonated with both educators and investors.</p>
<p>“Formative helps to accelerate learning for students, save time for teachers and quantify results for school and district administrators,” said Tom Jennings, an MD at Summit Partners, in a statement. “We believe Formative has a rare combination of rapid, capital-efficient growth, innovative products, delighted customers and a humble, mission-driven team. We admire how Craig, Kevin and the team have built the business and expect our partnership to help Formative accelerate product enhancements and the continued global expansion of the business.” Jennings is joining Formative’s board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is looking at adding new features that could help users who are facing abusive situations on its platform as a result of unwanted attention pile-ons, such as when a tweet goes viral for a reason they didn&#8217;t expect and a full firehose of counter tweets get blasted their way.</p>
<p>Racist abuse also remains a major problem on Twitter&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>The social media giant says it&#8217;s toying with providing users with more controls over the @mention feature to help people &#8220;control unwanted attention&#8221; as privacy engineer, Dominic Camozzi, puts it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The issue is that Twitter&#8217;s notification system will alert a user when they&#8217;ve been directly tagged in a tweet &#8212; drawing their attention to the contents. That&#8217;s great if the tweet is nice or interesting. But if the contents is abusive it&#8217;s a shortcut to scale hateful cyberbullying.</p>
<p>Twitter is badged these latest anti-abuse ideas as &#8220;early concepts&#8221; &#8212; and encouraging users to submit feedback as it considers what changes it might make.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sometimes you want to talk, and sometimes you just &#8230; don&#39;t.</p>
<p>Check out these early concepts that could help control unwanted attention on Twitter.</p>
<p>Feedback, especially at this beginning stage, is invited (and wanted)! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/6SpzqiwFlL">pic.twitter.com/6SpzqiwFlL</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Dominic Camozzi (@_dcrc_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_dcrc_/status/1404578211309056006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Potential features it&#8217;s considering include letting users &#8216;unmention&#8217; themselves &#8212; i.e. remove their name from another&#8217;s tweet so they&#8217;re no longer tagged in it (and any ongoing chatter around it won&#8217;t keep appearing in their mentions feed).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also considering making an unmention action more powerful in instances where an account that a user doesn&#8217;t follow mentions them &#8212; by providing a special notification to &#8220;highlight potential unwanted situations&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the user then goes ahead and unmentions themselves Twitter envisages removing the ability of the tweet-composer to tag them again in future &#8212; which looks like it could be a strong tool <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">against strangers who abuse @mentions. </span></p>
<p>Twitter is also considering adding settings that would let users restrict certain accounts from mentioning them entirely. Which sounds like it would have come in pretty handy when president Trump was on the platform (assuming the setting could be deployed against public figures).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2pBR78VZ6n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">Twitter permanently bans President Trump</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter permanently bans President Trump&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/embed/#?secret=2pBR78VZ6n" data-secret="2pBR78VZ6n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Twitter also says it&#8217;s looking at adding a switch that can be flipped to prevent <em>anyone</em> on the platform from @-ing you &#8212; for a period of one day; three days; or seven days. So basically a &#8216;total peace and quiet&#8217; mode.</p>
<p>It says it wants to make changes in this area that can work together to help users by stopping &#8220;the situation from escalating further&#8221; &#8212; such as by providing users with notifications when they&#8217;re getting lots of mentions, combined with the ability to easily review the tweets in question and change their settings to shield themselves (e.g. by blocking all mentions for a day or longer).</p>
<p>The known problem of online troll armies coordinating targeted attacks against Twitter users means it can take disproportionate effort for the object of a hate pile-on to shield themselves from the abuse of so many strangers.</p>
<p>Individually blocking abusive accounts or muting specific tweets does not scale in instances when there may be hundreds &#8212; or even thousands &#8212; of accounts and tweets involved in the targeted abuse.</p>
<p>For now, it remains to be seen whether or not Twitter will move forward and implement the exact features it&#8217;s showing off via Camozzi&#8217;s thread.</p>
<p>A Twitter spokeswoman confirmed the concepts are &#8220;a design mock&#8221; and &#8220;still in the early stages of design and research&#8221;. But she added: &#8220;We&#8217;re excited about community feedback even at this early stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company will need to consider whether the proposed features might introduce wider complications on the service. (Such as, for example, what would happen to automatically scheduled tweets that include the Twitter handle of someone who subsequently flips the &#8216;block all mentions&#8217; setting; does that prevent the tweet from going out entirely or just have it tweet out but without the person&#8217;s handle, potentially lacking core context?)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, those are small details and it&#8217;s very welcome that Twitter is looking at ways to expand the utility of the tools users can use to protect themselves from abuse &#8212; i.e. beyond the existing, still fairly blunt, anti-abuse features (like block, mute and report tweet).</p>
<p>Co-ordinated trolling attacks have, for years, been an unwanted &#8216;feature&#8217; of Twitter&#8217;s platform and the company has frequently been criticized for not doing enough to prevent harassment and abuse.</p>
<p>The simple fact that Twitter is still looking for ways to provide users with better tools to prevent hate pile-ons &#8212; here in mid 2021 &#8212; is a tacit acknowledgment of its wider failure to clear abusers off its platform. Despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/12/twitters-abuse-problem-is-absolutely-a-failure-of-leadership/">repeated calls</a> for it to act.</p>
<p>A Google search for &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=*+leaves+twitter+after+abuse&amp;client=opera&amp;hs=o3m&amp;ei=8F7IYPuWBcGca-GZq5gP&amp;oq=*+leaves+twitter+after+abuse&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQghEKABOgcIABBHELADOggIIRAWEB0QHlCiiwpYwI4KYMiPCmgCcAJ4AIABgwGIAc4EkgEDNC4ymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBBsABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7zovVlpnxAhVBzhoKHeHMCvMQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5">* leaves Twitter after abuse</a>&#8221; returns numerous examples of high profile Twitter users quitting the platform after feeling unable to deal with waves of abuse &#8212; several from this year alone (including a number of footballers targeted with racist tweets).</p>
<p>Other examples date back as long ago as 2013, underlining how Twitter has repeatedly failed to get a handle on its abuse problem, leaving users to suffer at the hands of trolls for well over a decade (or, well, just quit the service entirely).</p>
<p>One recent high profile exit was the model Chrissy Teigen &#8212; who had been a long time Twitter user, spending ten years on the platform &#8212; but who <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chrissy-teigen-exits-twitter-after-10-years-deactivates-account/">pulled the plug on her account in March</a>, writing in her final tweets that she was &#8220;deeply bruised&#8221; and that the platform &#8220;no longer serves me positively as it serves me negatively&#8221;.</p>
<p>A number of soccer players in the UK have also been campaigning against racism on social media this year &#8212; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/sports/soccer/soccer-racism-boycott.html">organizing a boycott of services</a> to amp up pressure on companies like Twitter to deal with racist abusers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">At least 70 racial slurs on my social accounts counted so far. For those working to make me feel any worse than I already do, good luck trying <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f44d-1f3fe.png" alt="👍🏾" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While public figures who use social media may be more likely to face higher levels of abusive online trolling than other types of users, it&#8217;s a problem that isn&#8217;t limited to users with a public profile. Racist abuse, for example, remains a general problem on Twitter. And the examples of celebrity users quitting over abuse that are visible via Google are certainly just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that it&#8217;s terrible for Twitter&#8217;s business if highly engaged users feel forced to abandon the service in despair.</p>
<p>The company knows it has a problem. As far back as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/30/twitter-turns-to-academics-to-improve-conversational-health-on-the-platform/">2018</a> it said it was looking for ways to improve &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/30/twitter-turns-to-academics-to-improve-conversational-health-on-the-platform/">conversational health</a>&#8221; on its platform &#8212; as well as, more recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/twitter-bans-hate-speech-around-age-disability-and-in-the-wake-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-disease/">expanding its policies</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/twitter-claims-increased-enforcement-of-hate-speech-and-abuse-policies-in-last-half-of-2019/">enforcement</a> around hateful and abusive tweets.</p>
<p>It has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/twitter-retweet-changes-quote-tweet-election-misinformation/">added some strategic friction</a> to try to nudge users to be more thoughtful and take some of the heat out of outrage cycles &#8212; such as encouraging users to read an article before directly retweeting it.</p>
<p>Perhaps most notably it has banned some high profile abusers of its service &#8212; including, at long last, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">president <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">troll</span> Trump himself earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>A number of other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/twitter-finally-bans-milo-yiannopoulos-one-of-its-most-notorious-trolls/">notorious trolls</a> have also been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/19/katie-hopkins-permanently-removed-from-twitter">booted over the years</a>, although typically only after Twitter had allowed them to carry on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/leslie-jones-twitter-harassment/?_ga=2.113856263.1805774279.1623657354-1757155993.1533833482">coordinating abuse of others via its service</a>, failing to promptly and vigorously enforce its policies against hateful conduct &#8212; letting the trolls get away with seeing how far they could push their luck &#8212; until the last.</p>
<p>By failing to get a proper handle on abusive use of its platform for so long, Twitter has created a toxic legacy out of its own mismanagement &#8212; one that continues to land it unwanted attention from high profile users who might otherwise be key ambassadors for its service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber and Kia Europe are teaming up to offer drivers in 20 European markets deals on buying, leasing, financing or renting Kia’s e-Niro and e-Soul, the latest move by the ride-hailing giant to achieve its emissions goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber has committed to being a zero-emission mobility platform across Europe by 2030, and hopes to get up to 30,000 Uber drivers into Kia’s BEV range by the same year. Kia is the latest in Uber&#8217;s collection of automakers offerings its drivers discounted rates on electric cars. In May, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/uber-and-arrival-partner-to-create-an-ev-for-ride-hail-drivers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber also announced a partnership with EV manufacturer Arrival</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create a purpose-built electric car for ride-hail drivers, and in September 2020, </span><a href="https://plants.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/sep/0908-uber.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber partnered with GM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give Canadian and American drivers discounts to the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent legislation adopted by the European Union aims to </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56828383"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut carbon emissions by at least 55% by 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, compared to 1990 levels. Uber&#8217;s partnership with Kia anticipates increasingly strict emissions regulations around the continent. To keep up, Uber is also targeting to have more than 100,000 electric vehicles across its European platform by 2025 and 50% of miles driven in Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Lisbon, London, Madrid and Paris to be in zero-emissions vehicles. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Kia hopes to use this partnership to popularize its BEVs as it prepares to launch 11 new electric models by 2026. The e-Niro crossover has 239 miles of range and a lithium-ion battery that charges in 54 minutes up to 80% on a DC fast charger. The e-Soul subcompact crossover, with a cute and boxy exterior, offers up to 243 miles of range on a full charge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even with the discounts, the Kia models that are currently on offer on </span><a href="https://www.uber-vs.com/gb/en/locations/london/#kia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PartnerPoint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Uber’s portal for London-based drivers shopping around for EVs, are still quite pricey. Kia is giving drivers a discount of around 8% on its vehicles to finance, as opposed to an average of 13% from Nissan and even 22% with Hyundai. That means Kia&#8217;s vehicles a cost between £29,877.40 ($42,15432) and £36,471.40 ($51,457.86), which is around the same price as, if not more than a </span><a href="https://uk.talent.com/salary?job=uber+driver#:~:text=The%20average%20uber%20driver%20salary%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20is,to%20%C2%A355%2C900%20per%20year."><span style="font-weight: 400;">London driver’s annual salary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Despite this, it seems drivers are taking advantage of the discounts and other incentives, like 5% financing interest rates and the <span style="font-weight: 400;">the <a href="https://www.uber.com/gb/en/u/ride-journey-to-electric/">Clean Air Fee</a>, which collects 3 pence (4 cents) per ride to put towards the cost of an EV and has saved London drivers an average of £3,000 ($4,233), according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In London, more than 3.5 million trips have taken place in fully electric vehicles since the launch of the Clean Air Plan in 2019, according to Uber. Some 50% of new cars joining the platform in London are now fully electric, compared to 8% of new vehicles in wider markets. Over the past year, the number of EVs on Uber’s platform has jumped from 700 to 2,100, and Uber wants to double that by the end of the year.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this announcement, Uber also said it plans to continue expansion of Uber Green, which allows riders to request a lower emissions vehicle and drivers to get a reduced 15% service fee for each Uber Green trip, across Europe to 60 cities by the end of the year. This feature is currently only available for any London rider starting their trip inside Zone 1, but Uber says now is a good time for drivers to take advantage of lower running costs and greater earning potential through the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber drivers in Europe can find information about EV offers through the driver app, direct mail and driver webinars, the company said. Prices for vehicles won’t vary depending on driver location. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the gig economy came the need for ID verification, thus startups like OnFido (raised $188.8 million) appeared, alongside several others. But this sector is by no means ‘done’ yet.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://ocrlabs.com/">OCR Labs</a>, which emerged from Australia, has announced a €12.5M / $15 million Series A funding round led by Turkish investors Oyak Group, to expand its services and team to the UK, Turkey and Europe. Halkin Ventures invested in its seed round. The startup specializes in digital ID verification, customer onboarding, identity fraud, and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>OCR Labs, founded in 2018 by Daniel Aiello and Matthew Adams, says its technology uses &#8220;five proprietary technologies in one solution, including identity document optical character recognition (OCR), document fraud assessment, liveness detection, video fraud assessment, and face matching”. This supports AML and KYC regulations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Daniel Aiello, Co-Founder, and CPO of OCR Labs, commented, “The need for digital verification is growing exponentially. This past year we’ve seen more demand from new sectors as they try to navigate the pandemic and an inability to operate in person&#8230;No one wants to spend hours trying to prove who they are, whether it’s for a job or for a bank account, and we also want to know we’re protected against identity theft and fraud. Digital ID verification has a key role to play, but this year we’ve also seen the limitations if hybrid models are used. People are a barrier and a risk, but fully automated technology can have a huge impact on many industries and privacy. OCR Labs is built to be secure, frictionless and fast, and capable of recognizing ID documents the world over.”</p>
<p>OCR Labs is used by recruitment business REED in the UK. Russ Cohn, an early member of the Google UK leadership team, has been appointed OCR&#8217;s General Manager of International Operations, based out of London.</p>
<p>Cohn commented: “The technology that Matt and Dan have created is completely automated, so it doesn&#8217;t rely on any humans behind the scenes. That&#8217;s very key at the moment. We’ve seen how COVID has impacted having that hybrid solution, so automation increases the speed and delivery of the technology to our users… A lot of competitors outsource and use different vendors to put together a solution.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the pandemic’s economic impact, Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem has proven to be very resilient. In fact, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lhxlufo5lQaAtSOrzwWz5986e0L1eIJz/view">new report</a> from investment firm Golden Gate Ventures predicts a record number of exits will happen in the region over the next couple of years, thanks to factors like a maturing ecosystem, more secondary buyers and the emergence of SPACs.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s comprehensive <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lhxlufo5lQaAtSOrzwWz5986e0L1eIJz/view">“Southeast Asia Exit Landscape Report 2.0,”</a> is a followup to a <a href="https://www.insead.edu/sites/default/files/assets/dept/centres/gpei/docs/golden-gate-ventures-insead-sea-exit-landscape.pdf">previous report </a>published in 2019.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights from the latest report, along with additional insight from Golden Gate Ventures partner Michael Lints, its lead author. For both reports, Golden Gate Ventures partnered with business school INSEAD to survey general and limited partners in the region. It also draws on Golden Gate Ventures’ proprietary database, which dates back to 2012 and tracks information like the time between funding rounds and fundraising success rates, as well as public databases, reports and expert commentary from the New York Stock Exchange.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The overall exit landscape</h2>
<p>Despite the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact, tech proved to be resilient globally (for example, there were a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/as-tech-stocks-rally-bring-on-the-ipos">number of initial public offers</a> in the United States at record prices). While Southeast Asia’s tech ecosystem is relatively younger, Lints told TechCrunch its resiliency was driven by companies founded years ago that suddenly saw an increase in demand for their services because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’ve built infrastructure over the past eight to nine years, when it comes to e-commerce, logistics, some on the healthcare side as well, and when the pandemic happened, people were suddenly stuck at home,” Lints said. He added “If you look at the pickup for most of the e-commerce companies, they at least doubled their revenue. For last-mile logistics companies, they’ve increased their revenue. There was a lot of pickup on the digital healthcare side as well.”</p>
<p>While tech fared well compare to many other industries, one downside was that the COVID-19 pandemic caused overall global venture capital investment to decline. Southeast Asia’s startup ecosystem was not immune, and had less exits, but it still did relatively well, with $8.2 billion invested in 2020, according to a report by Cento Ventures and Tech In Asia.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Grab to go public in the US following $40 billion SPAC deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/grab-to-go-public-in-the-us-following-40-billion-spac-deal/embed/#?secret=v54wnBFI5R" data-secret="v54wnBFI5R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It’s important to note that more than half of that funding was raised in very large rounds by unicorns like Grab, Go-jek and Traveloka, but Cento Ventures found there was also an increase in investments between $50 million to $100 million for other startups. These are usually Series B and C rounds, which Golden Gate Ventures says creates a strong pipeline for potential exits over the next three to four years.</p>
<p>“If you go back even just two years, the amount of B rounds that are happening now, I’ve never seen that number before. It’s a definite increase,” said Lints.</p>
<p>Investments are also continuing to flow into Southeast Asia. According to the report, there was $6 billion of funding in just the first quarter of 2021 (based on data from DealStreet Asia, PWC and Genesis Ventures), making it the strongest start to a year in the region’s history.</p>
<p>This bodes well for the possibility of mergers and acquisitions in 2021. The report found that there were less exits in 2019 and 2020 than in 2018, but not just because of the pandemic—many startups wanted to remain venture-backed for longer. Golden Gate Ventures expects M&amp;A activity will pick up again. In 2021, it forecasts acquisition deals worth more than $30 million, large mergers and an increase in SPACs.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s in the pipeline</h2>
<p>Golden Gate Ventures predicts that a total of 468 startup exits will happen between 2020 and 2022, compared to the 412 forecast in the previous edition of its report. This is due to more late-stage private equity investors, including secondary buyers, SPACs and a welcoming public market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6oEXfjMQ3x"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-roadmap-to-startup-consolidation-in-southeast-asia-is-becoming-clearer/">The roadmap to startup consolidation in Southeast Asia is becoming clearer</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The roadmap to startup consolidation in Southeast Asia is becoming clearer&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/the-roadmap-to-startup-consolidation-in-southeast-asia-is-becoming-clearer/embed/#?secret=6oEXfjMQ3x" data-secret="6oEXfjMQ3x" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lints said secondary buyers will include a mix of family offices, conglomerates and venture funds that want a higher allocation in a company or to pre-empt a forthcoming round.</p>
<p>“What I think is interesting is some of the later-stage funds, so private equity funds, and not only ones that are in Southeast Asia, but even foreign ones, are now looking to get a position in companies that they assume will be able to raise a Series D or Series E over the next few years. That’s something I haven’t seen before, it’s relatively new in the market,” he added.</p>
<p>Golden Gate Ventures expects M&amp;A activity to continue being the main way Southeast Asian startups exit, potentially accounting for up to 80% of deals, followed by secondary sales (15%) and IPOs (5%).</p>
<p>In fact, there was a record number of M&amp;A deals in 2020, despite the pandemic. Golden Gate Ventures estimates that 45 deals happened, especially in e-commerce, fintech, media, adtech and social networking, as larger companies acquired startups to grow their tech stacks.</p>
<p>More companies going public will create a cascading effect through Southeast Asia’s ecosystem. The report forecasts that companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/02/grab-buys-kudo/)Grab, (https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/18/gojek-coins-ph-philippines/">Gojek</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/singapore-based-retail-analytics-company-trax-raises-640m-series-e-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2-and-blackrock">Trax</a>, who have already made several high-profile acquisitions, will continue buying startups if they list publicly and have more liquidity.</p>
<h2>Series B and C deals</h2>
<p>While there will be more exits, there are also more opportunities for companies to raise larger later-stage rounds to stay private, if they want to—a sign of Southeast Asia’s maturing ecosystem, said Lints.</p>
<p>As the pandemic unfolded in 2020, the number of pre-seed and seed deals fell. On the other hand, the report found that it became quicker for startups to raise Series B or C rounds, or less than 21 months on average.</p>
<p>“If you look at typical exits between 2015 to 2017, you could argue that some of those exits might have been too early because the company was still in a growth trajectory, but there was hardly any follow-on funding for them to expand to a new country, for instance, or build out a new product,” said Lints. “So their only revenue to raise money was to be acquired by a larger company so they could keep building the product.”</p>
<p>“I think now you’re able to raise that Series C round, which allows you to expand the company and stay private, as opposed to having to drive towards an exit,” he added. “I think that shows the maturity of the ecosystem now and, again, it’s a huge advantage because founders have these amazing things they want to build, and now actually have the capital to do so and to really try to compete, and that has definitely been a big change.”</p>
<p>Another good thing is that the increase in later-stage funding does not appear to be creating a pre-seed and seed funding gap. This is partly because early employees from mature companies that have raised massive rounds often branch out and become founders themselves. As they launch startups, they have the benefit of being familiar with how fundraising works and a network. For example, a significant number of alumni from <a href="https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/alumni-of-tech-companies-pushing-southeast-asias-next-wave-of-entrepreneurship">Grab, Gojek and Lazada have gone on to found companies</a>.</p>
<p>“They seem to be raising a lot faster, and I think the second thing that’s happening across the board is we’re seeing more scouts putting really early checks into companies,” said Lints. “My assumption is if you look at the Series A pipeline, which is still pretty long, that has to come from a large number of pre-seed and seed deals.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Singapore is poised to become Asia&#8217;s Silicon Valley&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/singapore-is-poised-to-become-asias-silicon-valley/embed/#?secret=0a2b5HcCBq" data-secret="0a2b5HcCBq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Funds want to cash out</h2>
<p>Another factor that may drive an increase in exits—especially M&amp;A deals—are funds that have reached the point where they want to cash out. Golden Gate Ventures’ 2019 report forecast that the first batch of institutional venture funds launched in 2010 to 2012 will start reaching the end of their lifecycle in 2020. This means the general partners of these funds are exploring exit opportunities for their portfolios, leading to an increase in secondary and M&amp;A deals.</p>
<p>This in turn will increase the number of secondary markets, which have typically been low in Southeast Asia. The original investors won’t necessarily push for portfolio companies to sell themselves, but instead look at secondary buyers who might be keen on mergers and M&amp;A deals.</p>
<p>“The thing we’ve seen over the last 18 months is there’s been a larger pickup in the secondary markets, where later-stage investors, in some cases family-owned businesses or family offices, are looking to get access to deals that were started eight, nine or 10 years ago. You’ll see the cap tables of these companies change, and that does mean the founders will have different shareholders,” said Lints.</p>
<p>“These are typically for companies that are performing well, where you can foresee that they will be able to fundraise within the next 12 months. For the ones that are in a more difficult position, I think it’s going to be tricky,” he added. “When you have a portfolio of companies as a fund, that doesn’t necessarily mean that you can sell all 20 of them, so I think for some founders, the impact will be that they will need to make a decision to continue the business and buy back the shares their investors are holding, or are they going to liquidate the business or look for a trade sale.”</p>
<h2>SPAC opportunities</h2>
<p>The biggest SPAC news in Southeast Asia was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/grab-to-go-public-in-the-us-following-40-billion-spac-deal/"> Grab’s announcement it will go public in the United States following a $40 billion SPAC deal</a>. Lints expects more Southeast Asian companies to take the SPAC route when going public. Not only does the process give them more flexibility, but for startups that want to list in the U.S., working with a SPAC can help them.</p>
<p>“My guess is with New York allowing direct listings, I think more and more people will shy away from the traditional IPO route and look at what is the fastest and most flexible way to list on a stock exchange. For Southeast Asia, listing has never been easy, so I think SPACs will definitely open the floodgates,” said Lints.</p>
<p>Barriers not only include regulatory filings, pre-IPO roadshows and high costs, but also “concern whether the international retail investor or public markets actually understand these companies in Southeast Asia,” he added. “If you have a very strong sponsor team that is running the SPAC, they can be super helpful in positioning the company, doing the marketing and getting interest from the market as well.”</p>
<p>Both the <a href="https://www.sgx.com/regulation/public-consultations/20210331-consultation-paper-proposed-listing-framework-special">Singapore Exchange</a> and<a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2021/03/07/idx-to-allow-spacs-hopes-indonesian-unicorns-will-go-public-locally.html"> Indonesian Stock Exchange</a> are preparing to allow SPACs in an effort to attract more tech listings.</p>
<p>Lints said this will allow companies to consider a dual listing in Southeast Asia and the U.S. for larger returns. “A dual listing would be an amazing option and I think through the avenue of SPACs, that makes a lot of sense.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://upflow.io">Upflow</a> has raised a $15 million Series A round. The company wants to help you chase late payments. It optimizes how you collect payments from your customers in order to improve your cash-cycle.</p>
<p>Investors in today’s funding round include 9yards Capital, existing investor eFounders, as well as N26 co-founder Maximilian Tayenthal, Uber SVP of Delivery Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, auxmoney co-founder and CEO Raffael Johnen.</p>
<p>People who run a business often tell you that getting paid is a consuming task. When you create an invoice, chances are your customer will wait a few weeks before paying you. Most companies end up with a backlog of outstanding invoices sitting in an Excel spreadsheet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They keep an eye on their bank account to manually reconcile those payments. And, of course, they often have to send an email or call a customer to tell them that now is the time.</p>
<p>Upflow acts as the central repository to see all your invoices, track payments, communicate with your team and send reminders. But Upflow doesn’t want to replace your existing tools. Instead, the company has built integrations with popular business tools that you’re already using.</p>
<p>For instance, you can connect your Upflow account with QuickBooks, Xero, Netsuite, Chargebee and Stripe Billing. You can charge your clients from your existing invoicing platform. Upflow imports your invoices, clients and payments. When Upflow notices a late payment, you receive a notification and can start sending automated or personalized emails.</p>
<p>The startup also thinks current B2B payment methods are outdated. In the U.S., too many companies still rely on paper checks. In France, copying IBAN information from an email to your bank account can be cumbersome.</p>
<p>When you send an invoice using Upflow, customers get a link with several payment methods. You can connect your Upflow account with Stripe Payments to enable card payments for instance. And the startup is slowly building a network of companies that have used Upflow at some point. 1.5 million companies have interacted with the product — it represents over $1 billion in payments.</p>
<p>“We are on a mission to revolutionize the way that companies get paid. At Upflow, we provide a solution that adds connectivity and clarity to a company&#39;s payment and invoicing stack. Where systems were previously closed and disconnected, Upflow&#39;s platform enables smooth and clear processes,” co-founder and CEO Alexandre Louisy said in a statement.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to the U.S. Upflow already has a few customers there, such as Lattice, Front and Adikteev, but it’s just a start. The startup will open an office in New York.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jaguar Land Rover is developing a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle based on the new Defender SUV and plans to begin testing the prototype next year.</p>
<p>The prototype program, known as Project Zeus, is part of JLR&#8217;s larger aim to only produce zero-tailpipe emissions vehicles by 20236. JLR has also made a commitment to have zero carbon emissions across its supply chain, products and operations by 2039.</p>
<p>Project Zeus is partially funded by the UK government-backed Advanced Propulsion Center. The automaker has also tapped AVL, Delta Motorsport, Marelli Automotive Systems and the UK Battery Industrialization Center to help develop the prototype. The testing program is designed to help engineers understand how a hydrogen powertrain can be developed that would meet the performance and capability (like towing and off roading) standards that Land Rover customers expect.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity without combustion. The electricity generated from hydrogen is used to power an electric motor. Some automakers, researchers and policymakers have advocated for the technology because hydrogen-powered FCEVs can be refueled quickly, have a high-energy density and don&#8217;t lose as much range in cold temperatures. The combination means EVs that can travel longer distances.</p>

<p>Few fuel cell EVs, otherwise known as FCEVs, are on the market today in part because of a lack of refueling stations. The Toyota Mirai is one example.</p>
<p>Data from the International Energy Agency and recent commitments by automakers suggests that might be changing. Last month, BMW Chairman Oliver Zipse said the automaker plans to produce a small number of <a href="https://www.bmw.com/en/innovation/how-hydrogen-fuel-cell-cars-work.html">hydrogen fuel-cell powered</a> X5 SUVs next year.</p>
<p>The number of FCEVs in the world nearly doubled to 25,210 units in 2019 from the previous year, the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/hydrogen">latest data from the IEA shows</a>. The United States has been the leader in sales, although there was a dip in 2019, followed by China, Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>Japan has been a leader on the infrastructure end as it aims to have 200,000 FCEVs on the road by 2025. The country had installed 113 stations as of 2019, nearly twice as many as the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know hydrogen has a role to play in the future powertrain mix across the whole transport industry, and alongside battery electric vehicles, it offers another zero tailpipe emission solution for the specific capabilities and requirements of Jaguar Land Rover&#8217;s world class line-up of vehicles,&#8221; Ralph Clague, the head of hydrogen and fuel cells for Jaguar Land Rover said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://carro.sg/">Carro</a>, one of the largest automotive marketplaces in Southeast Asia, announced it has hit unicorn valuation after raising a $360 million Series C led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Other participants include insurance giant MSIG and Indonesian-based funds like EV Growth. About 90% of vehicles sold through Carro are secondhand, and it offers services that cover the entire lifecycle of a car, from maintenance to when it is broken down and recycled for parts.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015, Carro started as an online marketplace for cars, before expanding into more verticals. Co-founder and chief executive officer Aaron Tan told TechCrunch that, roughly speaking, the company&#8217;s operations are divided into three sections: wholesale, retail and fintech. Its wholesale business works with car dealers who want to purchase inventory, while its retail side sells to consumers. Its fintech operation offers products for both, including B2C car loans, auto insurance and B2B working capital loans.</p>
<p>Carro’s last funding announcement was in August 2019, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/carro-jualo-series-b-extended/">said it had extended its Series B to $90 million</a>. The company’s latest funding will be used to fund acquisitions, expand its financial services portfolio and develop its AI capabilities, which Carro uses to showcase cars online, develop pricing models and determine how much to charge insurance policyholders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It also plans to expand retail services in its main markets: Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. Carro currently employs about 1,000 people across the four countries and claims its revenue grew more than 2.5x during the financial year ending March 2021.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic helped Carro’s business because people wanted their own vehicles to avoid public transportation and became more receptive to shopping for cars online. Those factors also helped competitors like OLX Autos and Carsome<a href="https://thelowdown.momentum.asia/how-are-olx-autos-carro-and-carsome-faring-amidst-the-covid-19-pandemic/"> fare well during the pandemic</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Used car marketplace Carsome gets $30 million Series D for its Southeast Asia growth plans&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/used-car-marketplace-carsome-gets-30-million-series-d-for-its-southeast-asia-expansion/embed/#?secret=ywR74lOb7B" data-secret="ywR74lOb7B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The adoption of electric vehicles across Southeast Asia has resulted in a new tailwind for Carro, because people who buy an EV usually want to sell off their combustion engine vehicles. Carro is currently talking to some of the largest electric vehicle companies in the world that want to launch in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>“For every car someone typically buys in Southeast Asia, there’s always a trade-in. Where do cars go, right? We are a marketplace, but on a very high level, what we’re doing is reusing and recycling. That’s a big part in the environmental sustainability of the business, and something that sets us apart of other players in the region,&#8221; Tan said.</p>
<p>Cars typically stay in Carro’s inventory for less than 60 days. Its platform uses computer vision and sound technology to replicate the experience of inspecting a vehicle in-person. When someone clicks on a Carro listing, an AI bot automatically engages with them, providing more details about the cost of the car and answering questions. They also see a 360-degree view of the vehicle, its interior and can virtually start the engine to see how it sounds. Listings also provide information about defects and inspection reports.</p>
<p>Since many customers still want to get an in-person look before finalizing a purchase, Carro recently launched a beta product called Showroom Anywhere. Currently available in Singapore, it allows people to unlock Carro cars parked throughout the city, using QR codes, so they can inspect it at any time of the day, without a salesperson around. The company plans to add test driving to Showroom Anywhere.</p>
<p>“As a tech company, our job is to make sure we automate everything we can,” said Tan. “That’s the goal of the company and you can only assume that our cost structure and our revenue structure will get better along the years. We expect greater margin improvement and a lot more in cost reduction.”</p>
<p>Pricing is fixed, so shoppers don’t have to engage in haggling. Carro determines prices by using machine-learning models that look at details about a vehicle, including its make, model and mileage, and data from Carro’s transactions as well as market information (for example, how much of a particular vehicle is currently available for sale). Carro’s prices are typically in the middle of the market’s range.</p>
<p>Cars come with a three or seven-day moneyback guarantee and 30-day warranty. Once a customer decides to buy a car, they can opt to apply for loans and insurance through Carro’s fintech platform. Tan said Carro’s loan book is about five years old, almost as old as the startup itself, and is currently about $200 million.</p>
<p>Carro’s insurance is priced based on the policyholders driving behavior as tracked by sensors placed in their cars. This allows Carro to build a profile of how someone drives and the likelihood that they have an accident or other incident. For example, someone will get better pricing if they typically stick to speed limits.</p>
<p>“It sounds a bit futuristic,” said Tan. “But it’s something that’s been done in the United States for many years, like GEICO and a whole bunch of other insurers,” including Root Insurance, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/root-targets-6b-valuation-in-pending-ipo-a-boon-for-insurtech-startups/">recently went public</a>.</p>
<p>Tan said MSIG’s investment in Carro is a “statement that we are really trying to triple down in insurance, because an insurer has so much linkage with what we do. The reason that MSIG is a good partner is that, like ourselves, they believe a lot in data and the difference in what we call ‘new age’ insurance, or data-driven insurance.”</p>
<p>Carro is also expanding its after-sale services, including Carro Care, in all four of its markets. Its after-sale services reach to the very end of a vehicle’s lifecycle and its customers include workshops around the world. For example, if a Toyota Corolla breaks down in Singapore, but its engine is still usable, it might be extracted and shipped to a repair shop in Nairobi, and the rest of its parts recycled.</p>
<p>“One thing I always ask in management meetings, is tell me where do cars go to die in Indonesia? Where do cars go to die in Thailand? There has to be a way, so if there is no way, we’re going to find a way,” said Tan.</p>
<p>In a statement, SoftBank Investment Advisers managing partner Greg Moon said, “Powered by AI, Carro’s technology platform provides consumers with full-stack services and transparency throughout the car ownership process. We are delighted to partner with Aaron and the Carro team to support their ambition to expand into new markets and use AI-powered technology to make the car buying process smarter, simpler and safer.”</p>

<h2>How contrarian hires and a pitch deck started Nubank’s $30 billion fintech empire</h2>
<p>Founded in 2013 and based in São Paulo, Brazil, Nubank serves more than 34 million customers, making it Latin America&#8217;s largest neobank.</p>
<p>Reporter Marcella McCarthy spoke to CEO David Velez to learn about his efforts to connect with consumers and overcome entrenched opposition from established players who were friendly with regulators.</p>
<p>In the first of a series of stories, she interviewed Velez about his early fundraising efforts. For a balanced perspective, she also spoke to early Nubank investors at Sequoia and Kaszek Ventures, Latin America&#8217;s largest venture fund, to find out why they funded the startup while it was still pre-product.</p>
<p>“There are people you come across in life that within the first hour of meeting with them, you know you want to work with them,” said Doug Leone, a global managing partner at Sequoia who&#8217;d recruited Velez after he graduated from grad school at Stanford.</p>
<p>Marcella also interviewed members of Nubank&#8217;s founding team to better understand why they decided to take a chance on a startup that faced such long odds of success.</p>
<p>“I left banking to make a fifth of my salary, and back then, about $5,000 in equity,” said Vitor Olivier, Nubank&#8217;s VP of operations and platforms.</p>
<p>“Financially, it didn’t really make sense, so I really had to believe that it was really going to work, and that it would be big.”</p>

<p><em>This week, we talk to Anna Rubanova. A comedy writer-turned podcast producer, she&#8217;s worked on myriad podcasts, including &#8220;The Thrilling Adventure Hour&#8221; and &#8220;Election Profit Makers&#8221; (featuring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/how-i-podcast-election-profit-makers-david-rees/">recent How I Podcaster, David Rees</a>). Rubanova serves as an executive producer at Forever Dog and has hosted programs for WNYC Studios and Stitcher Premium. She co-produces and hosts the narrative sketch comedy show &#8220;<a href="http://www.lefthandedradio.com/">Left Handed Radio</a>&#8221; with Adam Bozarth. </em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I use my phone a lot. I used to write down ideas for sketches and would inevitably forget what made them good. &#8220;When I win the lottery, I’m gonna teach a fish how to smoke.&#8221; That&#8217;s in one of my notes and I have no idea what it&#8217;s referring to. With a voice memo, I can capture the feel of the bit immediately. The recording can serve as a jumping off point for a fully written sketch, maybe a prompt for improv. I might re-record it using a better mic or, screw it, use it as is. I go with whatever is funniest or, sometimes, good enough. You can always justify it later with context. With enough music, restoration or SFX, the worst-quality audio sounds intentional. Plus, there&#8217;s no point in doing something &#8220;correctly&#8221; in podcasting. It&#8217;s like trying to make the perfect sandwich. Anyone who thinks there&#8217;s one way to podcast or do radio or utilize two slices of bread is a fraud or a solipsist.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165863" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165863" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2165863" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRDesk.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165863" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Anna Rubanova</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of podcast perfection, Left Handed Radio is my everything. It&#8217;s a portfolio, creative outlet, comedy scrapbook and excuse to play with my best friend and partner in all things, Adam Bozarth. We make sketches, stream-of-consciousness monologues, anything that strikes us as funny or interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, we&#8217;ve accumulated a good deal of recording equipment. Nothing fancy: a couple of Zooms, two AudioTechnica 2020 USB mics, and a Rhode shotgun. Most of what we have was meant for DIY filmmaking. There was a post-YouTube short-form comedy boom about a decade ago. When all those branded content sites went down, we stopped messing with video and leaned harder into animation and podcasting. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165861" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165861" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2165861" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRMic.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRMic.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRMic.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRMic.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRMic.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRMic.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRMic.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRMic.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LHRMic.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165861" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Anna Rubanova</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narrative audio is my passion. Podcasting is my job. Like I said, we don&#8217;t collect equipment but, as producers of up to 12 shows at a time, we needed to invest in plug-ins and software. The easiest DAW for dialogue has to be Audition. Logic is great for building out soundscapes and, obviously, music. We record remote calls to Audition and mark edit points like we would in a studio. (Thank you, Loopback!) Two years ago, I dropped a whopping $1,000 on restoration software. In the pandemic, that software has saved me hours of work. When everyone is recording from home, literally anything can go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days when clipping and plosives were our biggest concern. One time, a podcaster (i.e. someone with their own podcast) called into a show I was producing from a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rooftop party</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By the time I finished restoring the recording, nobody could tell. (Thank you, RX-7; I wish I could afford RX-8.) Plug-ins aren&#8217;t just useful, they can be delightful. We have one that can make audio sound like it&#8217;s coming from a loudspeaker underneath a woolen blanket. Have I found a good use for it? No, not yet. But I can imagine the possibilities.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, Google&#8217;s in-house incubator Area 120 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/google-launches-a-work-tracking-tool-and-airtable-rival-tables/">introduced</a> a new work-tracking tool called <a href="https://tables.area120.google.com/about">Tables</a>, an AirTable rival that allows for tracking projects more efficiently using automation. Today, Google says Tables will officially &#8220;graduate&#8221; from Area 120 to become an official Google product by joining Google Cloud, which it expects to complete in the next year.</p>
<p>The Tables project was started by long-time Google employee, now Tables&#8217; GM, Tim Gleason, who spent 10 years at the company and many more before that in the tech industry. He said he was inspired to work on Tables because he always had a difficult time tracking projects, as teams shared notes and tasks across different documents, which quickly got out of date.</p>
<p>Instead of tracking those sorts of notes and tasks associated with a project across various documents that have to be manually updated by team members, Tables uses bots to help take on some of the administrative duties involved in guiding team members through a project &#8212; like scheduling recurring email reminders when tasks are overdue, messaging a chat room when new forms are received, moving tasks to other people&#8217;s work queues, or updating tasks when schedules are changed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The team saw Tables as a potential solution for a variety of use cases, including of course project management, as well as IT operations, customer service tracking, CRM, recruiting, product development and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2049986" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2049986" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2049986" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=1536,1040 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Inline-2000x1337-1.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2049986" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The service was launched last September to test product market fit, Google says, and quickly found traction.</p>
<p>According to VP/GM and Head of Platform for Google Cloud <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitzavery/">Amit Zavery</a>, early customer feedback was positive and the team saw customers adopting the service for multiple projects &#8212; another strong signal for its potential growth. He declined to say how many customers were already using the service, however.</p>
<p>The pandemic also likely played a role in Tables&#8217; adoption, Zavery noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you saw what happened with COVID, I think work-tracking became a pretty big area of interest for many customers who we&#8217;re speaking to,&#8221; he says, explaining that everyone was trying to quickly digitize.</p>
<p>Popular use cases included inventory management, healthcare supply tracking and use in mortgage-lending workflows. However, the team found Tables was adopted across a variety of industries beyond these, as hoped. On average, customers would use Tables in a department with around 30 to 40 people, they found.</p>
<p>Most customers were abandoning more manual processes to use Tables instead, not coming from a rival service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things were very fragmented in different documents or with different people, so using technologies like this really seems to have resonated very well,&#8221; Zavery says. &#8220;Now you had one central place for structured information you can access and do things on top of it versus trying to have 15 different sheets and figuring out how they are related because there&#8217;s no structure behind each of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another factor that prompted Tables&#8217; adoption was how quickly people could be productive, thanks in part to its ability to integrate with existing data warehouses and other services. Currently, Tables supports Office 365, Microsoft Access, Google Sheets, Slack, Salesforce, Box and Dropbox, for example.</p>
<p>Tables was one of only a few Area 120 projects to launch with a paid business model, along with ticket seller Fundo, conversational ads platform AdLingo and Google’s recently launched Orion WiFi. During its beta, an individual could use Tables for free, with support for up to 100 tables and 1,000 rows. The paid plan was supposed to cost $10 per user per month, with support for up to 1,000 tables and 10,000 rows. This plan also included support for larger attachments, more actions and advanced history, sharing, forms, automation and views.</p>
<p>However, Google never began charging for its paid tier during the beta, it says.</p>
<p>As Tables graduates into Google Cloud&#8217;s lineup, it will be integrated with Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-acquires-appsheet-to-bring-no-code-development-to-google-cloud/">no-code app building platform</a>, <a href="https://www.appsheet.com/">AppSheet</a>, which has a free tier, allowing the freemium model to continue. Users who want additional features will be able to upgrade to a premium plan. It will also be offered as a standalone product, for those who want that experience.</p>
<p>Google will leverage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone/">Workspace</a> to get Tables in front of more users, as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Lwu4WVpwPK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/google-opens-workspace-to-everyone/">Google opens Workspace to everyone</a></p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;it&#8217;s going to be delivered through Workspace integration, because that&#8217;s a very large community of users who expect some similar kind of functionality,&#8221; Zavery says. &#8220;That will be a big differentiator, when you talk about the breadth of things we can do &#8212; because of having that community of users on Sheets, the things they do with Drive, and the data they collect &#8212; we can automatically add this and augment their experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>The project taps into the growing interest in no-code, spreadsheet-powered database platforms &#8212; like AirTable, for example, which had<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/airtable-raises-185m-and-launches-new-low-code-and-automation-features/"> closed on $185 million</a> in Series D funding in the days before Tables&#8217; release, valuing its business at $2.585 billion, post-money.</p>
<p>As Tables transitions to Google Cloud, the Tables beta version will remain free until a fully supported Cloud product becomes available in the next year. At that point, users will migrate to the new service.</p>
<p>Over time, Tables plans to add more functionality as it ties in with AppSheet, to make using the service more seamless &#8212; so people don&#8217;t have to hop around from one product to another to accomplish tasks. It will also work to provide better ease of use, mobile support and connectivity with more backend systems.</p>
<p>Official pricing hasn&#8217;t been finalized but shouldn&#8217;t be very different from the beta version.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automattic is expanding its lineup of online writing platforms with its acquisition of<a href="https://dayoneapp.com/"> Day One,</a> a popular journaling app for Mac and Apple mobile devices. The app has been downloaded more than 15 million times since its <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/a-message-to-day-one-users">March 2011 launch</a> on the Mac and iTunes App Store, offering users a private place to share their thoughts. Since then, it&#8217;s been awarded the App Store Editor’s Choice, App of the Year and the Apple Design Award, along with praise from various reviewers.</p>
<p>Deal terms are not being disclosed. Day One had been bootstrapped and self-funded for ten years.</p>
<p>The addition makes for an interesting expansion of Automattic&#8217;s now growing collection of online writing tools, which today include blogging platforms WordPress.com and Tumblr &#8212; the latter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/verizon-is-selling-tumblr-to-wordpress-parent-automattic/">as of 2019</a>, when Automattic took the aging social blogging network off parent company Verizon&#8217;s hands for a fraction of its earlier $1 billion acquisition price. (Verizon still owns TechCrunch, too&#8230;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">for now</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike WordPress and Tumblr, which tend to focus on publishing to a public audience, Day One&#8217;s focus has been on privacy. The app offers end-to-end encryption for all your journal entries, which can include text, media and even audio recordings. It has also offered advanced features like automatic backups, auto-import of Instagram posts, voice transcriptions, templates, rich text formatting, location history and optional printed books, as well as integrations with other platforms like Spotify, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and more.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Private equity firm Apollo to buy Verizon Media assets for $5B, will rename business &#8216;Yahoo&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/embed/#?secret=hH4MmT4gNq" data-secret="hH4MmT4gNq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With its addition to Automattic, Day One will allow users to choose to publish select journal entries to WordPress.com and Tumblr, and, soon, import content from either platform back into Day One, too. The app may also make sense as a way for existing Tumblr users to sync their private entries over to a more protected and backed-up writing tool &#8212; instead of accidentally publishing them to their main blog.</p>
<p>Automattic, <a href="https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/06/14/day-one-the-journaling-app-joins-automattic/">in an announcement</a>, notes Day One CEO Paul Mayne will continue to lead the development of Day One following the acquisition. The team of 12 will also remain intact.</p>
<p>“We are working hard and making sure that their teams are smoothly integrated, and together we can continue to build a collective and robust culture,” Maybe told TechCrunch. He said there will be no transition process for current customers — everything will continue to work as usual.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://dayoneapp.com/blog/day-one-at-automattic"> in a blog post</a>, Mayne hints at why he sold the app, noting the deal will allow Day One access to the same technological, financial and security benefits that help power WordPress.com and Tumblr.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is incredibly exciting news. For the past 10 years since I started Day One, I’ve worked to not only create the best digital journaling experience in the world, but one that will last,&#8221; shares Mayne. &#8220;By joining Automattic, I’m now more confident than ever that the preservation and longevity of Day One is sure,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Mayne also noted there were no current plans to change the private nature of Day One, but the app would integrate with other Automattic products going forward, while continuing to sustain itself via a subscription model. Existing customers will see no changes to pricing, we’re told.</p>
<p><em>Updated, 6/14/21, 9:43 PM ET with additional details from Mayne. </em></p>

<p>But it&#8217;s 2021 and there are no IRL events coming up, so we&#8217;re bringing back the live show, but on <a href="https://hopin.com/events/tc-equity-live">Hopin</a>. That means that no matter where you are, you can swing by, talk a little shit with us, troll Danny in the comments, and generally have a good time as we try to remember how to be charismatic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And you will be able to see the show recorded before Chris and Grace cut out all the awkward mistakes, ums, pauses, and other shenanigans that you miss in the finished versions that we send out.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every day in the United States, more than 100 people die because of a car crash. Some are teenagers, like the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-30/writer-michael-lewis-tabitha-soren-daughter-dies-in-crash">daughter of writer Michael Lewis and Tabitha Soren, and her boyfriend</a>, who died in a wrong-way crash. Some are well known, like Kevin Clark, who played the drummer in “School of Rock,” who was <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2021/5/26/22454359/kevin-clark-dies-school-of-rock-crash-avondale-western-chicago">hit and killed by a driver while bikin<span style="text-decoration: underline;">g</span></a>. Others are not household names, like <a href="https://www.kob.com/albuquerque-news/police-charge-26-year-old-woman-in-connection-to-fatal-dwi-related-crash/6125812/">Janell Katesigwa, who was killed by a drunk driver in Albuquerque, New Mexico,</a> and left behind four children.</p>
<p>Something else happens every day, too: a lack of congressional urgency to require available technology to prevent the next tragedy.</p>
<p>Sadly, what is stopping advanced technology from preventing these deaths is business as usual in Washington, which means a lot of talk about saving lives, but little action.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

		<blockquote>
			Vehicle safety is based on using layers of protection that have led to a five-fold reduction in the occurrence of car crash deaths in the United States over the last 50 years.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Existing advanced vehicle safety technology, such as driver monitoring systems, automatic emergency braking and lane-departure warnings, can dramatically reduce crashes like the three described above &#8212; and the thousands of others that are a result of drunk, drugged, drowsy and distracted driving.</p>
<p>But only if the technology becomes standard equipment in new vehicles. When technology &#8212; underwritten by standards, bolstered by oversight and backstopped by accountability &#8212; can annually spare tens of thousands of families from tragedy, our federal government must act.</p>
<p>Over the coming weeks and months, Congress will debate the future of motor vehicles in the United States. The debate will be focused on renewing the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act, which is also referred to as the “highway bill.”</p>
<p>But make no mistake: While issues such as the future of the gas tax and arcane parliamentary procedures will grab headlines, vital decisions will be made about whether the growing and preventable public health crisis of car crash deaths will be prioritized or once again considered non-essential.</p>
<p>Despite the estimated <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic">38,680 highway fatalities</a> last year, which represented a 7.2% increase over 2019, some federal policymakers have failed to focus on available remedies that would result in fewer funerals and a reduction in lifelong debilitating injuries.</p>
<p>Perhaps the delay is a result of too many in Congress who believe the only available solution is rushing unsupervised driverless vehicles into the marketplace. Even if a green light for mass driverless vehicle production were given today, it would be decades before they could make a significant impact on improving overall safety. This single-minded focus on a unicorn to fix all transportation issues misunderstands the technical challenges and misreads the public mood.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/aaa-survey-finds-86-of-drivers-afraid-to-ride-in-automated-vehicles/">AAA survey found 86% of respondents</a> would not trust riding in driverless vehicles, <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2021/05/drivers-should-know-if-they-are-sharing-the-road-with-self-driving-test-vehicles/">while another found consumers do not feel comfortable sharing the road with them</a>. The technology industry’s habit of beta-testing unproven software on the public, combined with car companies’ track record of delaying safety in exchange for profit, will not increase consumer trust of the safety, inclusivity and equity of driverless technology.</p>
<p>Vehicle safety is based on using layers of protection that have led to a five-fold reduction in the occurrence of car crash deaths in the United States over the last 50 years. Seatbelts and airbags protect you when you crash. Electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes help you avoid rolling over. Regulations provide minimum levels of performance and recalls serve as a backstop to provide oversight when there is a defect.</p>
<p>It is hard to remember, but there was once a time when dual braking systems, intended to provide a safe stop even in the event of a catastrophic failure of one braking system, were considered revolutionary. Now such a layer of protection is standard.</p>
<p>At a time when the promise of automated vehicle technology could make or break America’s place atop the automobile industry, many in Congress want to ignore history and cut away layers of protection to rush driverless vehicles into the marketplace. One Senate proposal creates a fast track for manufacturers to sell tens of thousands of automated vehicles based on a flimsy promise that their vehicle is as safe as the least safe vehicle meeting current minimum standards. No one should forget that the Ford Pinto met all the minimum standards when it was recalled for exploding upon impact when hit from behind. Driverless vehicles should be held to a higher standard than the minimum.</p>
<p>Congress has an opportunity to help build public trust in the safety of driverless technology by requiring existing innovations that will be the building blocks of driverless vehicles into cars right away, with immediate benefits. For example, in the future, automated vehicles will need driver monitoring systems to make smooth handoffs between machine and driver, automated braking to avoid crashes and lane-keeping technology to keep vehicles where they belong. Today these systems, when working correctly, can help limit crashes by assisting human drivers, just as someday these features may assist computer drivers. Using technology to save lives now does not preclude saving more lives later.</p>
<p>As Congress begins to actively debate the future of the automobile industry, there is a lot of talk about upgrading roads, encouraging electric battery-powered vehicles and accelerating the introduction of driverless cars. Yet, there is not nearly enough talk about what is needed to make us all safer sooner.</p>
<p>There have been a variety of reasonable bills introduced to help the U.S. catch up to the rest of the developed world when it comes to vehicle safety and safeguarding pedestrians. They include improving the safety of our back-seat passengers in crashes, better recall procedures, and more robust and transparent data collection, along with requiring advanced safety features now common around the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have a long way to go and no time to waste. The European Union, despite a larger population and an almost identical number of vehicles and land size, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/road/news/2021-04-20-road-safety_en">had under 19,000 crash deaths last year</a>, less than half of the U.S. death toll. Further, the EU’s record-low vehicle-related deaths came without a single driverless vehicle on the road, but with robust consumer information and a regulatory scheme that mandates safety.</p>
<p>In the U.S., however, car manufacturers concerned about challenges from new market entrants &#8212; foreign and domestic &#8212; are lobbying for looser regulations and immunity from responsibility for automated vehicle crashes. Congress must push the industry to move quickly to protect lives before profits and stand behind their products when things inevitably go wrong. The best time to appropriately assign accountability regarding who will be held responsible if a car with a computer driver kills your loved ones, or a systemwide defect impacts an entire driverless fleet, is before the crash.</p>
<p>Moreover, history demonstrates that thoughtful requirements for all vehicles, crafted in a way to keep pace with major innovations in the automobile industry, have always been necessary to ensure vehicle safety is not reserved for the rich alone.</p>
<p>Federal legislation requiring objective performance standards based on data collected from driverless cars being tested on public streets can provide a path to this future. Yet Congress seems poised to do little, or nothing, once again. It is time for policy makers to reconcile the notion that the long-term viability of the driverless vehicle industry and keeping public roads safer now with incremental improvements, federal oversight and legal responsibility are not opposing ideas but necessary partners.</p>
<p>There is no question the U.S. can lead in the coming era of vehicle innovation while improving safety for all drivers, passengers and pedestrians. Success in this ambitious task will require moving forward quickly with existing safety technology and dispensing with the idea that innovations, safety and accountability are incompatible when, in fact, each is integral to the long-term success of the other.</p>
