										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thelivekindlyco.com/">LIVEKINDLY Collective</a>, the shouty parent company behind a family of plant-based food brands, has snagged cash from the global impact investing arm of $103 billion dollar investment firm TPG to close its latest round of funding at $335 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s fundraising shows that investors still have high hopes for plant-based food brands and that despite the money that&#8217;s flowed to companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods &#8212; and the resurgence of older brands in the category like Quorn or Kelloggs&#8217; Morningstar Farms &#8212;  there&#8217;s still a healthy appetite among investors for more brands.</p>
<p>LIVEKINDLY was founded by some heavy hitters from the food industry including Kees Kruythoff, the former president of Unilever North America; Roger Lienhard, the founder of Blue Horizon Corp; and Jodi Monelle, the chief executive and founder of LIVEKINDLY Media. Food industry veterans like Mick Van Ettinger, a former Unilever employee and Aldo Uva, a former Nestle employee round out the team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded as a rollup for a number of different vegetarian and alternative protein food brands, the LIVEKINDLY collective is now one of the largest plant-based food companies, by funding.</p>
<p>The company said it would use the money to expand into the U.S. and China and to power additional acquisitions, partnerships and investments in plant-based foods.</p>
<p>The company raised money previously from S2G Ventures and Rabo Corporate Investments, the investment arm f the giant Dutch financial services firm, Rabobank.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, the founding investors behind LIVEKINDLY believe that the technology has a long way to go before it matures. And it&#8217;s likely that this latest round will be LIVEKINDLY&#8217;s last before an initial public offering of its own. </span></p>
<p>“We are building a global pureplay in plant-based alternatives – which we believe is the future of food,” said Roger Lienhard, Founder and Executive Chairman of Blue Horizon Group and Founder of LIVEKINDLY Collective. “In just one year, we have raised a significant amount of capital, which testifies to the urgency of our mission and the enormous investment opportunity it represents. We believe the momentum behind plant-based living will continue to grow in both the private and public markets.”</p>
<p>As a result of <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">its investment, Steve Ellis, Co-Managing Partner of The Rise Fund, has joined the LIVEKINDLY Collective Board of Directors, effective March 1, 2021.</span></p>
<p>“We are excited to work with LIVEKINDLY Collective and its ecosystem of innovative companies and world-class leaders to meet the growing global demand for healthy, plant-based, clean-label options,” said Ellis. “The company’s unique, mission-driven model operates across the entire value chain, from seed to fork, to drive worldwide adoption of plant-based alternatives and create a healthier planet for all.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, a Utah-based software company that provides corporate spend management software, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/divvy-raises-165m-as-the-spend-management-space-stays-red-hot/">a $165 million round at a $1.6 billion valuation</a>. It followed its competitor <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> to unicorn-status as the market for financial services software and corporate payment solutions stayed red-hot in 2021 after a blockbuster 2020.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, a competitor to both Divvy and Brex, is looking to raise new capital from Stripe and D1 Capital Partners at a valuation that could top $1 billion. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripe-invests-in-brex-rival-ramp-at-1-6-billion-valuation">first reported the news</a>, which TechCrunch confirmed with a source familiar with the transactions.</p>
<p>Ramp also competes with startups like <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a> and <a href="https://www.teampay.co/">Teampay</a>, each providing software designed to help companies allow, administer and track corporate cash outflows. The startup category is perhaps best known for its concept of providing company cards to startups and other SMBs, though its market has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/corp-card-startup-ramp-launches-expense-management-software/">matured into financial software designed</a> to provide a central node for internal expense controls.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pace of investment into startup cohorts has been aggressive. Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/brex-brings-on-150m-in-new-cash-in-case-of-an-extended-recession/">raised $150 million</a> after the pandemic set in, while Ramp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">raised several</a> times <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/">last year</a> before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/ramp-secures-150m-debt-line-from-goldman-sachs-as-the-corporate-spend-market-grows/">adding a debt facility earlier this year</a> to its financial backstop. Airbase also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/spend-control-focused-airbase-adds-23-5m-to-its-series-a-as-it-posts-quick-growth/">raised last year</a>, sharing growth metrics as 2020 came to a close. Teampay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/">added $5 million</a> to its 2019-era Series A last year as well.</p>
<p>And in a sign that the model of fintech startups building corporate spend software could prove popular in other markets, a Latin American-focused startup in the space called <a href="https://www.clara.cc/">Clara</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">raised $3.5 million earlier this month</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiss automation and technology company ABB has <a href="https://new.abb.com/news/detail/76179/abb-and-amazon-web-services-steer-fleets-to-an-all-electric-future">announced a collaboration</a> with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create a cloud-based EV fleet management platform that it hopes will hasten the electrification of fleets. The platform, which the company says will help operators maintain business continuity as they switch to electric, will roll out in the second half of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This announcement comes after a wave of major delivery companies pledged to electrify their fleets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon already has a number of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rivian-sourced electric delivery vans on the streets of California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to have 10,000 more operational by this year; UPS ordered 10,000 electric vans from Arrival for its fleet; 20% of DHL’s fleet is already electric; and FedEx plans to electrify its entire fleet by 2040. A </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/charging-electric-vehicle-fleets-how-to-seize-the-emerging-opportunity#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 McKinsey report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> predicted commercial and passenger fleets in the U.S. could include as many as eight million EVs by 2030, compared with fewer than 5,000 in 2018. That’s about 10-15% of all fleet vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make EV adoption easier and more scalable for fleets,” Frank Muehlon, president of ABB’s e-mobility division, told TechCrunch. “To power progress, the industry must bring together the best minds and adopt an entrepreneurial approach to product development.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABB brings to the table experience in e-mobility solutions, energy management and charging technology, which will combine with AWS’s cloud and software to make a single-view platform that can be tailored to whichever company is using it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies will be able to monitor things like charge planning, EV maintenance status and route optimization based on the time of day, weather and use patterns. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muehlon said they’ll work with customers to explore ways to use existing data from fleets for faster implementation.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DkyssVdHU6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/">10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/embed/#?secret=DkyssVdHU6" data-secret="DkyssVdHU6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The platform will be hosted on the AWS cloud, which means that it can scale anywhere AWS is available, which so far includes in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">25 regions globally</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform will be hardware-agnostic, meaning any type of EV or charger can work with it. Integration of software into specific EV fleets will depend on the fleet&#8217;s level of access to third-party asset management systems and onboard EV telematics, but the platform will support a layered feature approach, wherein each layer provides more accurate vehicle data. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muehlon says this makes for a more seamless interface than existing third-party charging management software, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t have the technology or the flexibility to work with the total breadth of EV models and charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not only do fleet managers have to contend with the speed of development in charging technology, but they also need real-time vehicle and charging status information, access to charging infrastructures and information for hands-on maintenance,&#8221; said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Muehlon. &#8220;This new real-time EV fleet management solution will set new standards in the world of electric mobility for global fleet operators and help them realize improved operations.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Oh hello. What’s this then? A Niantic-branded AR headset? Perhaps? John Hanke, CEO of the Pokémon GO developer teased what could be a first-party head-mounted wearable, as the company makes a more aggressive push into augmented reality.</p>
<p>“Exciting to see the progress we’re making to enable new kinds of devices that leverage our platform,” the executive noted in the text accompanying an image of eyeglasses temples sporting the Niantic name in bright orange.</p>
<p>Niantic has been a fairly active investor in the augmented reality hardware space, so there is also the possibility that they&#8217;ve done a branding partnership with a startup on a project, but this cryptic image crop is certainly making it look like they&#8217;re showcasing a device with first-party branding. There&#8217;s also the potential that this is a product in the &#8220;smart glasses&#8221; category that doesn&#8217;t include a display but focuses on building audio or camera functionality into a pair of glasses. Niantic has previously announced that they&#8217;ve been working with Qualcomm to help define their reference design for their XR hardware platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Niantic for additional comment.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; John Hanke (@johnhanke) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnhanke/status/1376624749787242499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Notably, the Twitter teaser also follows Niantic’s posting of a job listing for a Head of AR OS Engineering.</p>
<p>“We are on an ambitious mission to turn the world into an Augmented Reality canvas which games and other applications can paint on top of,” the listing states. “This future is fully realized on AR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). Niantic’s Engineering Team is seeking an inspirational leader to oversee the engineering direction to help build an AR operating system for HMDs and enable applications for millions of Niantic players.”</p>

<p>The image arrives amid a recent flurry of activity for the one-time Google spin-out. Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/niantic-announces-partnership-with-nintendo-on-new-augmented-reality-pikmin-title/">the company announced an AR title based on Pikmin</a>, another Nintendo collaboration following its wildly successful Pokémon title. Earlier this month, it showed off a proof-of-concept version of Pokémon GO running on Microsoft’s HoloLens 2.</p>
<p>Niantic&#8217;s AR platform has stayed under wraps for the most part as the company seems to wait for a more active moment in augmented reality development to make a major push. Part of that activity may ultimately be defined by a broader AR hardware ecosystem, and as Apple and Facebook compete to release their own devices, I would imagine that there is some concern among players like Niantic that those early devices will focus on first-party software initially and leave fewer platform opportunities for third-parties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing number of companies have emerged over the last few years determined to reduce waste in the electric vehicle battery market. Chief among these is recycling firm Redwood Materials, which has quickly expanded since its launch in 2017 by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel to become the largest lithium-ion battery recycler in North America. Now the firm is teaming up with electric commercial vehicle manufacturer Proterra in a deal that may help boost the domestic battery supply chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first publicly announced partnership between Redwood and an automaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the agreement, all Proterra batteries will be sent to Redwood’s facilities for recycling in Carson City, Nevada. The two companies entered the agreement in January, but have been in discussion since last summer, when Proterra reached out to learn more about Redwood’s recycling process. That led to a trip out to Redwood’s facilities in Nevada to see if the recycler could process Proterra battery packs.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That went really well,” Proterra CTO Dustin Grace told TechCrunch. Grace worked for Straubel for around nine years at Tesla. “We were super excited to see their operation. From there, we started work on our master supply agreement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proterra has sent around 26,000 pounds of battery material to Nevada for recycling since entering the partnership, though this does not represent the pace of future deliveries. Overall, Redwood receives 60 tons per day, or 20,000 tons of batteries per year.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="H8PwT7U0lp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/">10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/embed/#?secret=H8PwT7U0lp" data-secret="H8PwT7U0lp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The batteries that power Proterra’s fleets are designed to last the lifespan of the vehicle, but the company offers a battery leasing program that guarantees replacement after six years &#8212; which means plenty of useful life will remain in the battery, as much as 80-90% charging capacity. To exploit the remainder of this capacity, Proterra has plans to reuse the batteries in second-life applications &#8212; such as in stationary storage systems hooked up to Proterra charging hardware &#8212; before they head to Nevada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First the grading of the battery will occur at Proterra by our remanufacturing engineering team. If the battery is deemed ready for second-life, it will go into one of those applications; if it’s not, it gets recycled,” Grace said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only once all this useful life is exhausted will the batteries be sent to Redwood, where the waste will be reprocessed into valuable raw material. And with the transit EV market poised to reach 50% of all annual sales by 2025, there will be plenty of batteries that will need reprocessing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news comes just weeks after Redwood announced it was teaming up with e-bike manufacturer Specialized to recycle its batteries. Redwood already has arrangements to process scrap from Panasonic’s battery cell production at the Nevada Tesla Gigafactory, and with Amazon to recycle EV batteries and other waste. Through these business-to-business partnerships Redwood aims to develop a circular battery supply chain, supplying the raw materials back to the manufacturer. The company also accepts electronics and batteries</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/recycling-startup-redwood-materials-is-now-accepting-your-old-smartphones/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from everyday consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which can be mailed to Redwood via a mailing address posted on its website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership is a sign that both companies are thinking large-scale and long-term. A spokesperson for Redwood said in a statement to TechCrunch that the recycler is focused on “developing the solution for a fully closed-loop recycling for EV batteries.” That means finding truly sustainable, long-term sources of materials like cobalt, lithium and copper to eventually move beyond terrestrial mining. And Straubel</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/why-amazon-and-panasonic-are-betting-on-this-battery-recycling-startup/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has been vocal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past about his ambition to grow Redwood into one of the world’s largest battery materials companies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more battery-grade raw materials become available in the United States, Proterra sees an opportunity to eventually expand into domestic battery-cell manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s still early days but we’re trying to set ourselves up for the future state of this market at scale. That’s really the primary benefit of this partnership existing today,” Grace said. “The way we see it, domestic cell production for Proterra is a very, very important part of our roadmap here in the coming years. The idea of generating more battery-grade raw materials on North American soil directly supports the expansion of that battery manufacturing concept within the U.S. So I think this starting now absolutely aids our plans for domestic cell manufacturing in the near future.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another proptech is considering raising capital through the public arena.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.knock.com">Knock</a> confirmed Monday that it is considering going public, although CEO Sean Black did not specify whether the company would do so via a traditional IPO, SPAC merger or direct listing.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are considering all of our options,&#8221; Black told TechCrunch. &#8220;We pioneered the real estate transaction revolution over five years ago and our priority is to build a war chest to dramatically widen the already cavernous gap between us and any unoriginal knock-offs.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/property-tech-startup-knock-hires-goldman-sachs-to-go-public?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported earlier today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the company had hired Goldman Sachs to advise on such a bid, which Knock also confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bloomberg, Knock is potentially seeking to raise $400 million to $500 million through an IPO, according to “people familiar with the matter,” at a valuation of about $2 billion. The company declined to comment on valuation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black and Knock COO Jamie Glenn are no strangers to the proptech game, having both been on the founding team of Trulia, which went public in 2012 and was acquired by Zillow for $3.5 billion in 2014. The pair started Knock in 2015, and have since raised over $430 million in venture funding and another $170 million or so in debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock started out as a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> real estate brokerage business until last July, when the company announced a major shift in strategy and said it was becoming a lender. At the time, Knock unveiled its Home Swap program, under which Knock serves as the lender to help a homeowner buy a new home before selling their old house. It previously worked with lending partners but has now become a licensed lender itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the company now offers integrated financing &#8212; the mortgage and an interest-free bridge loan &#8212; with the goal of helping consumers make strong non-contingent offers on a new home before repairing and listing their old home for sale on the open market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that move, Knock eliminated its Home Trade-In program, where it helped consumers buy before selling by using its own money to purchase the new home on behalf of the consumer before prepping and listing the consumer’s old house on the open market. Under that trade-in model, the homeowner used the proceeds from selling their old home to buy the new home from Knock and pay the company back for any repairs it did to prep the house for sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, Black told me that Knock had decided to move away from its trade-in program in part because it was capital-intensive and required the closing of a house to take place twice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It added friction to the experience,” he said. “And now, especially during COVID, it can be inconvenient to try and sell a house at the same time as buying one. This is about making something possible that isn’t possible with any other traditional lender. We’re able to lend some money before an owner’s [old] house is even listed on the market.” </span></p>
<p>To sum up what Knock does today, Black said the company aims to offer a full service technology platform that includes everything &#8220;from pre-funding the homebuyers to make non-contingent offers and win bidding wars, to getting their old home ready for market with our contractor network to selling their old home quickly at the highest price and empowers them to have their own agent working with them in the app through the entire process.&#8221;</p>

<p>Demand for the Home Swap, he added, has &#8220;exceeded all expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock is headquartered in New York and San Francisco. The company launched the Home Swap in three markets in July 2020, and today it is in 27 markets in nine states, including Texas, California and North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our original plan was to be in 21 markets by the end of 2021,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;At our current growth rate, we expect to end the year at 45 markets and be in 100 by 2023.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Knock began 2021 with 100 employees and now has 150. Its plan is to have at least 400 employees by year&#8217;s end.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities traditionally have been bustling hubs where people live, work and play. When the pandemic hit, some people fled major metropolitan markets for smaller towns — raising questions about the future validity of cities. It’s true that we’re still months away from broader reopenings and herd immunity via current vaccination efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, those who predicted that COVID-19 would destroy major urban communities might want to stop shorting the resilience of these municipalities and start going long on what the post-pandemic future looks like.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.N. </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/40b530ac84ab4931874e1f7efb4f1a22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that by 2030, two-thirds of the world’s population will reside in cities, communities that are the epicenters of culture, innovation, wealth, education and tourism, to mention just a few benefits. They are not only worth saving — they’re also ripe for rebirth, precisely why many municipal leaders in the U.S. anticipate the Biden administration will allocate substantial monetary resources to rebuilding legacy infrastructure (and doing so in a way that prioritizes equitable access). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this emphasis on inclusivity and social innovation, the tech community has the ability to address a range of lifestyle and well-being issues: infrastructure, transportation and mobility, law enforcement, environmental monitoring, and energy allocation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this time of reset for cities, what smart city technologies will transform how we live our lives? What kinds of technology will make the biggest impact on cities in the next 12 months? Which smart cities are ahead of the curve? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To unpack these questions and more, we conducted the SmartCityX Survey of industry experts — including smart city investors, corporate and municipal thought leaders, members of academia, and startups on the front lines of urban innovation — to help provide valuable insights into where we’re heading. Below you’ll find some key takeaways:</span></p>
<h2><b>Infrastructure is the most crucial issue for cities</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical infrastructure topped the list of most prominent issues facing today’s cities, followed closely by traffic and transportation. Cisco may have </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cisco-turns-off-lights-on-smart-city-push-11609178895"><span style="font-weight: 400;">left the party too soon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but others, including countless startups, are lining up and capitalizing on future growth opportunities in the space. A couple of recent data points that support this trend — particularly as it relates to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">infrastructure rebuilding, IoT and open toolkits to connect fragmented technologies — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">include the following:  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bentley Systems, fresh off a September IPO, </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/bentley-systems-touchdown-ventures-set-up-100m-corporate-venture-capital-fund-61222293"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced a $100 million corporate venture capital fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2020/12/09/qualcomm-announces-qualcomm-iot-services-suite-aimed-enable-digital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualcomm announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its IoT Services Suite, comprising leading solutions ranging from wireless connectivity, hardware, software and data analytics to platform integration.   </span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Smart Infrastructure is paramount to Smart City success. It&#8217;s crucial that this infrastructure be ‘architected’ as opposed to just connected. This is the only way to truly achieve seamless interoperability while ensuring scalability, reliability, security and privacy. Technology companies that offer robust architectural components and/or platforms stand to deliver tremendous stakeholder value and outsized returns to investors.&#8221; &#8211; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sue Stash, &#8211; &#8212; <em>General Partner, Pandemic Impact Fund</em></span></p></blockquote>
<h2><b>What’s driving change in cities?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what will accelerate innovation and change in cities, an overwhelming majority cited COVID-19 as the primary factor, followed by remote work, which has accelerated the adoption of online collaboration tools and forced legacy companies to complete multi-year digital transformation projects in a matter of months. The biggest opportunity is to build cities back better and smarter, focusing on new infrastructures that do more with less, and for most of us, that begins and ends at home.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are trending hotter than pogs right now, and the number of articles published on the subject in the last few weeks has ballooned into the thousands. So a pardon must be begged at the outset here, but the overlooked potential of token economies is simply too important to let slip away.</p>
<p>NFTs are but one small <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/nfts-are-changing-cultural-value-creation/">part of a much larger development</a> in the world of finance capital. What leaves some scratching their heads and chuckling could, within a decade, completely transform the model of investment that has been in place since the rise of Silicon Valley.</p>
<h2>Non-fungible what?</h2>
<p>NFTs have had a strange first step into the spotlight, bringing wealth to a very small group of people and making most people simply perplexed. Before NFTs are written off as a flash in the pan, it might be worth considering that NFTs were never designed to be very useful in traditional investment frameworks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			It can be hard to imagine how this might all play out, but we are already seeing the outlines of this new economy begin to poke through the dried-out skin of the old model.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>An auction house selling a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/daily-crunch-nft-artwork-sells-for-69m/">$69 million JPEG</a> is akin to a horse-and-buggy driver strapping a small nuclear reactor to the top of the cab and declaring, “This is an <em>atomic </em>buggy!” as the horse continues to chug along, doing all the work. You’ll get the attention of bystanders, but nothing has fundamentally changed here.</p>
<p>Each of the headline-grabbing NFT sales seen recently are instances of exactly this kind of backward thinking. And the bystanders criticizing the buggy driver and saying, “nuclear reactors are hype,” are not really seeing the long-term implications, or they just don’t like horses.</p>
<h2>Whales, dogs and unicorns</h2>
<p>From early conceptions of investment as a way to fund transoceanic ship voyages, to the rise of venture capital as we know it today, the entire cosmos of finance capital has remained an elite sport. This is because the current model is based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">big investors getting big wins</a>.</p>
<p>Almost the entire world of finance capital is structured on big whales and unicorns, mythical creatures that mere mortals consider themselves lucky to have glimpsed. The word “structured” is chosen here carefully, as the “big-dog” theory of capital is literally built on powerful intermediaries that facilitate the will of these top investors.</p>
<p>The invention of bitcoin is an epochal event in the development of finance. Bitcoin itself has crystallized into merely another playground of power, but the technological tremors it left in its wake are starting to emerge as the real game-changers. Primarily, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) &#8212; of which blockchain is but one instance &#8212; are a breakthrough on par with being able to send a message instantaneously to a person on the other side of the world.</p>
<p>DLTs mean that finance capital no longer has a need for powerful intermediaries &#8212; or intermediaries of any kind. Middlemen are currently very necessary in order for parties to establish trust in transactions, trades contracts or investments. Paying for the services of these middlemen can be written off as the cost of doing business for large companies and wealthy individuals, but these expenses remain prohibitive barriers for many.</p>
<p>DLTs break down these barriers because trust is established by and built into the very architecture of the network itself. With DLTs, anybody with an internet connection can do big-dog-style business deals at whatever level they can afford, and the way that these deals are transacted is through tokens.</p>
<h2>Token economies will be transformative</h2>
<p>DLT economies are going to be adopted by all of the major investment players in the next few years as the advantages of decentralizing investment are too numerous to ignore &#8212; lower friction for transactions due to automation, much quicker (real-time) results and analysis of market conditions, greater security through transparency, and a higher level of customization for financial products and services. The adoption of decentralized finance by major players will have a net-positive impact for everyone else.</p>
<p>Tokens are the lifeblood of this new system, and non-fungible tokens are just one type of token. In this emerging model, there are payment tokens that behave like money, security tokens that are comparable to stocks, utility tokens that provide functions like space or bandwidth and hybrid tokens that mix these tokens into new forms. If it sounds a bit confusing and exciting, that’s because it is.</p>
<p>The main takeaway to understand here is that tokens are going to replace not just stocks and other investment products but also the entire idea of having middlemen between you and your purchases, whether that middleman is an investment broker, a credit card company, a platform provider or a bank. The decentralized economy is going to be a much more open and direct kind of market.</p>
<h2>The rubber hits the road like this</h2>
<p>It can be hard to imagine how this might all play out, but we are already seeing the outlines of this new economy begin to poke through the dried-out skin of the old model. These protrusions are most apparent where economic reality doesn’t really make sense.</p>
<p>Think of the emerging gig economy, where nobody really seems to have a steady job anymore, where each of us is some kind of professional mercenary, moving from gig to gig. Think of the huge number of subscriptions that most of us carry like millstones around our necks. Think of the paradoxically frustrating relationship of musicians to streaming platforms, or artists to galleries. Think about the amount of crushing poverty that still remains on our planet.</p>
<p>These are all instances of models of living and working not really fitting into old containers. We can all sense that these aspects of our lives aren’t really functioning optimally, but we can’t quite say why and we certainly don’t know what the solution might look like. Decentralized, tokenized economies have the potential to erase all of these pain points, paradoxes and kludges and replace them with something much more intuitive and elegant.</p>
<p>This new reality is easy to imagine in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/why-the-next-cryptokitties-mania-wont-be-about-collectables/">some of its attributes</a>: Instead of nine different subscriptions, you can just pay directly for the content that you want, when you want it. Instead of artists giving up half of their earnings to galleries or musicians giving, well, all of their earnings to streaming platforms, they now just take direct payment for their work through fluid networks built by and for this type of content. Instead of paying brokers to facilitate your investments, you can now just invest directly in the enterprises that interest you, including formerly out-of-reach sectors like real estate investment. Instead of crushing poverty and fiercely protected borders between classes, we break down barriers and give everyone access to value.</p>
<p>Many of the other developments in a token economy have yet to be imagined, and this is probably the most exciting aspect of all. When we distribute the economy globally, in a way that allows anyone with an internet connection the ability to interact and contribute in a meaningful way, we are unlocking the value of untapped assets that are worth literally trillions of dollars. So what is holding us back, and how do we get there as soon as possible?</p>
<h2>The work ahead is very clear</h2>
<p>The hardest part of unlocking this new economy has already been achieved &#8212; we have the technological understanding of how to distribute and decentralize a system of consensus that combines with a system of digitizing assets for trade and investment.</p>
<p>The remaining work that will actually bring this system online is fairly obvious &#8212; first and foremost, we need to take a look at the ecological impacts that this new system has had in its infancy. We should absolutely outlaw mining farms or set the strictest limits for how much of their energy comes from nonrenewables. If the backbone of this new economy is destroying the planet, we need to shut it down before it grows, full stop. The system needs to be ecologically sustainable.</p>
<p>The second most immediate concern is that there are currently no standards, no common network, that the multitude of different cryptocurrencies and tokens agree on. It’s astounding and absolutely frustrating that the various cryptos are hardly even talking about this.</p>
<p>It’s as if we have a bunch of different companies not only inventing the light bulb but also inventing their own light sockets and wiring protocols, and each one is insisting that they are the best and they will win out in the end. Light bulbs are great, but can we please agree on one socket? This beautiful new economy will never get off the ground unless we build a neutral, interoperable network, and this network needs to be feeless and scalable.</p>
<p>The last cause of immediate concern is regulation and legal frameworks. There are too many people still in crypto that have some kind of anarchist’s deathwish to just be completely left outside, and this is not serving the long-term goals of our communities.</p>
<p>I’m all for knocking intermediaries out of the value chain, but this doesn’t automatically entail the establishment of a never-never land that no regulatory agencies are invited to. Legal frameworks for decentralized economies go hand in hand with our ethos of open-source, community-building, transparent operations. We all need to be advocates for thorough and precise regulation of our nascent technology.</p>
<p>With ecology, interoperability and regulation as our watchwords, we can begin work on building the actual apps and other infrastructure that will allow users to leverage the power of a new economy. The uses are limitless, from selling excess electricity to your regional smart power grid, to investing in your favorite artists’ network, to accepting direct payment for your own labor, to &#8212; yes &#8212; buying NFTs, which will make a lot more sense in the new economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/">The non-fungible token (NFT) mania</a> has inspired Ethereum fans to spend more than <a href="https://www.duneanalytics.com/rchen8/opensea">$224 million</a> on crypto collectibles so far in 2021 through marketplaces OpenSea and Rarible, but many buyers may not understand what they actually own.</p>
<p>“An NFT is not that different from any other crypto purchase in that you are buying control over information in an entry in a ledger,” said attorney Nelson Rosario, one of the founders of <a href="https://smoroslaw.com/">Smolinski Rosario Law</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

<p>NFT buyers don’t actually own the media files associated with their blockchain receipts, whether those files are JPEGs or GIFS or MP3s. The best way to know which aspects of the NFT craze will outlast this trendy boom is to look at the history of comparable assets. As it turns out, people have been making crypto collectibles for nearly seven years.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zebedeeio">Zebedee </a>co-founder Christian Moss, who has been working on blockchain-based games since 2014, said he stopped making Bitcoin-based collectibles because transaction fees shot up. To make matters worse, some buyers viewed tokens as investments instead of as toys.</p>
<p>“They were tokens on Bitcoin,” Moss said. “A lot of developers ended up trying to pump their tokens and prices. … It felt like people who played those games felt like they were investors on the board. I don’t want my game to be an investment vehicle. Then players might try to sue me if they lost their tokens. It changed the dynamic of the game.”</p>
<p>These days, Moss helps people earn small amounts of bitcoin by playing mainstream video games like <a href="https://twitter.com/zebedeeio/status/1371136734965215232">Counter-Strike</a>. That way, there’s no confusion about how to value virtual assets; cryptocurrency is money and in-game assets are toys.</p>
<p>“NFTs aren’t game items at all; they are receipts,” Moss said. “If you have the receipt, you might be able to get an item in a game, but they can’t allow a Zelda sword NFT [in Counter-Strike], for example, because that might be copyright infringement. There are legal implications there.”</p>
<p>Indeed, legal implications are the crux of the NFT trend. Whether a court would protect the receipt-holder&#8217;s ownership over a given file depends on a variety of factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s great if the artist intends to transfer any copyright for a work of art to an NFT purchaser, but can that be perfected to the point where a court of law or copyright office would recognize that transfer? That gets into additional questions of jurisdiction,&#8221; Rosario said. “Brands and platforms need to make sure they have the right agreements in place to govern these relationships.”</p>
<p>With regard to NFT sellers who take screenshots of other people’s content and profit from a corresponding NFT, Rosario said it’s hard to say whether that violates any laws.</p>
<p>“You probably start by looking at Twitter’s terms of service and begin the investigation there. It really depends,” he said, adding that impersonation or stealing someone’s passwords are different issues entirely.</p>
<p>And there are still open questions beyond copyright issues and fraud, such as <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/cryptocurrency-and-ofac-beware-of-the-34002/">sanctions</a> and porn regulations.</p>
<h2><b>Finding a space for adult content</b></h2>
<p>A growing number of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/crypto-nft-sex-workers-porn-performers-1142030/">adult content creators</a> are selling erotic NFTs on platforms like Rarible, often earning <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/aella">hundreds of dollars</a> per photo. One such artist, <a href="https://rarible.com/polyannie">PolyAnnie</a>, said she has earned more from selling NFTs on Rarible alone than her average annual earnings <a href="https://allmylinks.com/polyannie01">across platforms</a> like OnlyFans, Patreon and ManyVids combined.</p>
<p>“I sold 90 NFTs, bringing in 10.11 ETH in five months,” she said. “I purchased 18 NFTs from other creators, too.”</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/07/french-parliament-passes-porn-age-verification-legislation/">age-verification requirements</a> for platforms with adult content, while other jurisdictions make platforms <a href="https://www.rstreet.org/2020/04/08/the-lessons-of-fosta-sesta-from-a-former-content-moderator/">potentially liable</a> for child porn or revenge porn if the platforms don’t heavily moderate explicit content. As such, platform providers tend to be conservative about their terms of service.</p>
<p>“A lot of these NFT platforms don’t want to deal with the risks of sexually oriented content,” PolyAnnie said.</p>
<p>That’s why some <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/42525">sex workers</a> have had their content <a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5:42525">censored </a>by platforms like Rarible. As for the most popular NFT platform, OpenSea, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">which raised a Series A round from a16z earlier this month</a>, CEO Devin Finzer said his team moderates the platform and limits search results for adult content, so those NFTs can only be found by someone going directly to the creator’s profile.</p>
<p>“We haven’t exactly nailed it down, but one option is a separate section of our site for that type of content,” Finzer said.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coming wave of electric vehicles will require more than thousands of charging stations. In addition to being installed, they also need to work — and today, that isn&#8217;t happening.</p>
<p>If a station doesn&#8217;t send out an error or a driver doesn&#8217;t report it, network providers might never know there&#8217;s even a problem. Kameale C. Terry, who co-founded <a href="https://www.chargerhelp.com">ChargerHelp!</a>, an on-demand repair app for electric vehicle charging stations, has seen these issues firsthand.</p>
<p>One customer assumed that poor usage rates at a particular station was due to a lack of EVs in the area, Terry recalled in a recent interview. That wasn&#8217;t the problem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There was an abandoned vehicle parked there and the station was surrounded by mud,&#8221; said Terry who is CEO and co-founded the company with Evette Ellis.</p>
<p>Demand for ChargerHelp&#8217;s service has attracted customers and investors. The company said it has raised $2.75 million from investors Trucks VC, Kapor Capital, JFF, Energy Impact Partners and The Fund. This round values the startup, which was founded in January 2020, at $11 million post-money.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to build out its platform, hire beyond its 27-person workforce and expand its service area. ChargerHelp works directly with the charging manufacturers and network providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today when a station goes down there&#8217;s really no troubleshooting guidance,&#8221; said Terry, noting that it takes getting someone out into the field to run diagnostics on the station to understand the specific problem. After an onsite visit, a technician then typically shares data with the customer, and then steps are taken to order the correct and specific part — a practice that often doesn&#8217;t happen today.</p>
<p>While ChargerHelp is couched as an on-demand repair app, it is also acts as a preventative maintenance service for its customers.</p>
<h2>Powering up</h2>
<p>The idea for ChargerHelp came from Terry&#8217;s experience working at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/electric-vehicle-charging-software-ev-connect-raises-12-million/">EV Connect</a>, where she held a number of roles, including head of customer experience and director of programs. During her time there, she worked with 12 manufacturers, which gave her knowledge into inner workings and common problems with the chargers.</p>
<p>It was here that she spotted a gap in the EV charging market.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the stations went down we really couldn&#8217;t get anyone on site because most of the issues were communication issues, vandalism, firmware updates or swapping out a part — all things that were not electrical,&#8221; Terry said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YvX6vjL7uC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/embed/#?secret=YvX6vjL7uC" data-secret="YvX6vjL7uC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And yet, the general practice was to use electrical contractors to fix issues at the charging stations. Terry said it could take as long as 30 days to get an electrical contractor on site to repair these non-electrical problems.</p>
<p>Terry often took matters in her own hands if issues arose with stations located in Los Angeles, where she is based.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there was a part that needed to be swapped out, I would just go do it myself,&#8221; Terry said, adding she didn&#8217;t have a background in software or repairs. &#8220;I thought, if I can figure this stuff out, then anyone can.&#8221;</p>
<p>In January 2020, Terry quit her job and started ChargerHelp. The newly minted founder joined the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/los-angeles-cleantech-incubator-reboots-its-incubation-program-with-16-member-cohort/"> Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator</a>, where she developed a curriculum to teach people how to repair EV chargers. It was here that she met Ellis, a career coach at LACI who also worked at the Long Beach Job Corp Center. Ellis is now the chief workforce officer at ChargerHelp.</p>
<p>Since then, Terry and Ellis were accepted into Elemental Excelerator&#8217;s <a href="https://elementalexcelerator.com/">startup incubator</a>, raised about $400,000 in grant money, launched a pilot program with Tellus Power focused on preventative maintenance and landed contracts with EV charging networks and manufacturers such as EV Connect, ABB and SparkCharge. Terry said they have also hired their core team of seven employees and trained their first tranche of technicians.</p>
<h2>Hiring approach</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2131300" style="width: 7962px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131300" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2131300 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg" alt="ChargerHelp-07886" width="7952" height="5304" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg 7952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ChargerHelp-07886.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 7952px) 100vw, 7952px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131300" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ChargerHelp</p></div></p>
<p>ChargerHelp takes a workforce-development approach to finding employees. The company only hires in cohorts, or groups, of employees.</p>
<p>The company received more than 1,600 applications in its first recruitment round for electric vehicle service technicians, according to Terry. Of those, 20 were picked to go through training and 18 were ultimately hired to service contracts across six states, including California, Oregon, Washington, New York and Texas. Everyone picked to go through training is paid a stipend and earn two safety licenses.</p>
<p>The startup will begin its second recruitment round in April. All workers are full-time with a guaranteed wage of $30 an hour and are being given shares in the startup, Terry said. The company is working directly with workforce development centers in the areas where ChargerHelp needs technicians.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://bunch.ai/">Bunch</a> announced that it has closed a total of $4.4 million in seed capital, including a new $1 million infusion this week. The company&#8217;s product, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1500872908?mt=8">a mobile app</a>, focuses on teaching leadership skills to the younger generations more accustomed to learning in smaller chunks, often on the go.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t roll your eyes, all ye who attended business school. The concept has traction.</p>
<p>Earlier this month TechCrunch covered <a href="https://www.arist.co/">Arist</a>, for example, a startup that provides corporate training delivered to end-users via text. That company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/arist-adds-2m-to-its-seed-round-to-grow-its-sms-based-training-service/">added $2 million to its prior raise</a>, bringing its round to a total of $3.9 million. To see Bunch pick up some extra cash is therefore not too surprising.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Bunch CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/darjagutnick">Darja Gutnick</a> and M13 partner and Bunch-backer <a href="https://twitter.com/kalomarnyc?lang=en">Karl Alomar</a> to chat about the round and what the startup is up to.</p>
<p>Bunch claims to be an &#8220;AI coach&#8221; that provides users with daily, short-form tips and tricks to become a better leader. Given that we have all either worked for a manager who could have used some more training, or been that manager ourselves, the idea isn&#8217;t a bad one.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="P47LQW60We"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/arist-adds-2m-to-its-seed-round-to-grow-its-sms-based-training-service/">Arist adds $2M to its seed round to grow its SMS-based training service</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Arist adds $2M to its seed round to grow its SMS-based training service&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/arist-adds-2m-to-its-seed-round-to-grow-its-sms-based-training-service/embed/#?secret=P47LQW60We" data-secret="P47LQW60We" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you would expect, Bunch tailors itself to individual users. Gutnick told TechCrunch that her company has partnered with academics to detail different leadership style &#8220;archetypes&#8221; as part of its foundation. The Bunch system also molds its out to a user&#8217;s style and leadership goals.</p>
<p>Notably when TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/29/bunch-ai/">last covered Bunch</a>, it was working on something a bit different. Back in 2017, the company was building what we described as &#8220;Google Analytics for company culture.&#8221; Since then the startup has shifted its focus to individuals instead of companies.</p>
<p>Bunch&#8217;s service launched in November, leading to around 13,000 signups by the start of the year. The startup now claims nearly 20,000. And it has big product plans for the next few months. That&#8217;s why the company raised more money, and why Alomar and his firm were willing to put more capital into the startup.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ahead that got M13 sufficiently excited that it put more capital into Bunch? Alomar said that community and peer-review features are coming. It was a good time, he explained, to put more money into Gutnick&#8217;s company so that it can build, and then raise more capital later on after it gets some more work done.</p>
<p>The company plans to make money via a freemium offering. Gutnick told TechCrunch that related apps in her category tend to struggle with retention, so they charge up front and then don&#8217;t mind limited usage later on. She wants to flip that.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s more to come from Bunch, like other categories of content. But the startup wants to focus and get its first niche done right. It now has another million dollars to prove that its early traction isn&#8217;t just that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://eqtventures.com/">EQT Ventures</a>, an investment firm based in Europe that has raised more than €1.2 billion ($1.4 billion USD), announced that it has promoted Laura Yao to partner. At the same time, the firm announced it recently hired Anne Raimondi, former SVP of Operations at Zendesk, as operating partner.</p>
<p>The company is based in Stockholm, with offices in London, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam and Luxembourg. Yao is based in the U.S. office in San Francisco, where she has been working for three years prior to her recent promotion to partner. She says that the company tends to hire people with operator experience because they relate well to the founders of startups in which they invest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to partner with the most ambitious and boldest founders in Europe and the U.S. and kind of be the investors that we all wish we&#8217;d had when we were on the other side of the table,&#8221; Yao told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yao&#8217;s background includes co-founding a startup called The PhenomList in 2011.</p>
<p>While she is responsible for looking for new investments, Raimondi works with the existing portfolio of companies, particularly B2B SaaS companies, helping them with practical aspects of building a startup like go-to-market strategy, organizational design, hiring executives and other components of company building.</p>
<p>&#8220;I joined earlier this year as an operating partner, so I&#8217;m not on the investing side but actually focused on working with existing portfolio company founders as they grow and scale,&#8221; Raimondi said.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, female partners like Yao and Raimondi remain a rarity in most venture firms with a <a href="https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/business-investment-to-women/#:~:text=Only%2012%20percent%20of%20venture,t%20have%20any%20female%20partners.">Crunchbase report</a> from last April finding that just 3% of investors are women, and that over two-thirds of firms don&#8217;t have a single woman as a partner.</p>
<p>EQT has a 50/50 male to female employee ratio, although the partners were all male until Yao was promoted and Raimondi hired. That makes two of six as the company attempts to make the investment team reflect the rest of the company and the population at large.</p>
<p>Part of Raimondi&#8217;s job is talking to startups about building diverse and equitable organizations and she and Yao know the company needs to model that. She says that thriving startups understand on the product side that to build a successful product, they start with a hypothesis, then develop targets and metrics to test, learn and then iterate.</p>

<p>She says that they need to do the same thing to build a diverse and inclusive company. That starts with defining what diversity and inclusion looks like and setting up metrics to measure their progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;You evaluate [your diversity goals] and hold [the company] accountable to what you&#8217;ve signed up for. If you don&#8217;t meet them, [you look at] what can you do to improve them. Then you look at how you keep iterating, and then constantly measuring the employee experience across many dimensions, including not only diversity, but the important part of belonging,&#8221; Raimondi said.</p>
<p>Both women say their company does a good job at this, and their hiring/promotion proves that. Yao says that the organization as a whole has created a comfortable and inclusive culture. &#8220;It&#8217;s very collaborative and egalitarian. Anyone can say whatever&#8217;s on their mind. It&#8217;s very non-hierarchical and a comfortable place for a woman to work. I felt immediately welcomed and that my ideas were welcome immediately,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company portfolio includes startups in the U.S. and Europe and the firm sees itself as a bridge between the two locations. Among the companies EQT has invested in include bug bounty startup HackerOne, website building technology Netlify and quantum computing startup Seeqc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the fact that capital is abundant and dozens of startups get funding every day, the process of raising institutional capital is anything but simple.</p>
<p>From getting an investor&#8217;s attention to nailing your virtual pitch meeting to the legal aspects of your term sheet, there is plenty to navigate.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> is bringing together some of the biggest VCs to share how to manage the process proactively and successfully secure capital from the right VCs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just take a look at the fundraising sessions going down at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage</a>, which takes place later this week on April 1 &#8211; 2.</p>
<h3>How to Get an Investor&#8217;s Attention &#8211; Marlon Nichols, MaC Venture Capital</h3>
<p><em>Marlon Nichols is an expert in early-stage investments, having invested in countless successful ventures such as Gimlet Media, MongoDB, Thrive Market, PlayVS, Fair, Wonderschool and Finesse. Right now, there is more seed-stage fundraising than ever before, and Marlon will speak on how to get noticed by investors, how to grow your business and how to survive in the crowded, competitive space of tech startups. He will provide insights on how to network, craft a great pitch and target the best investors for your success.</em></p>
<h3>How to Nail Your Virtual Pitch Meeting &#8211; Melissa Bradley, Ureeka</h3>
<p><em>The rules of the pitch meeting have changed. Instead of traveling across the country, wasting time in planes, trains and automobiles, founders can take upwards of 30 meetings in a day from the comfort of their home. Entrepreneur and VC Melissa Bradley will outline how to make the most of that half hour on Zoom and lock in the next one.</em></p>
<h3>How to Kick the 10 Worst Startup Habits &#8211; Leah Solivan, Fuel Capital</h3>
<p><em>With voices across the internet giving their two-cents on how to run a great business, Fuel Capital&#8217;s Leah Solivan will share a list of things that a founder should NOT do. Avoid the pitfalls that could break your momentum, or worst case, your company, and ask Solivan your own questions.</em></p>
<h3>Bootstrapping and the Power of Product-Led Growth &#8211; Tope Awotona, Calendly and Blake Bartlett, OpenView</h3>
<p><em>Building a bootstrapped company forces you to be creative. For Calendly, it pointed the company toward a product-led growth model built on virality. Hear from Calendly’s Tope Awotona and OpenView’s Blake Bartlett as they cover pro tips on bootstrapping, PLG and when a profitable company should consider raising capital.</em></p>
<h3>Four Things to Think About Before Raising a Series A &#8211; Bucky Moore, Kleiner Perkins</h3>
<p><em>Founders looking to raise Series A capital know that it&#8217;s an entirely different ball game than seed-stage funding. Hear Kleiner Perkins partner Bucky Moore outline the most important ways to mentally prepare for heading into Series A fundraising.</em></p>
<h3>Fundraising Terms That Affect Your Business &#8211; Dawn Belt, Fenwick &amp; West</h3>
<p><em>With each funding round, there is an exciting opportunity for growth, but it’s important to fully understand the implications of those terms. Fenwick partner Dawn Belt will discuss the key legal terms to focus on in your seed and Series A rounds and how they affect the control and operational freedom of your company.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage</a> takes place on April 1 &#8211; 2 and is jam-packed with breakout sessions led by tech leaders, from VCs to operators.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payment card network Visa <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005171/en/Visa-Becomes-First-Major-Payments-Network-to-Settle-Transactions-in-USD-Coin-USDC">has announced</a> that transactions can be settled using USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin powered by the Ethereum blockchain. <a href="https://crypto.com/cards">Crypto.com</a> is the first company to test the new capability with its own Visa-branded cards.</p>
<p>USDC is a stablecoin co-founded by Circle and Coinbase and by managed the <a href="https://www.centre.io">Centre</a> consortium. As the name suggests, USDC is a cryptocurrency that follows the value of USD. One USDC is always worth one USD — hence the name stablecoin.</p>
<p>In order to make sure that the value of USDC remains stable, USDC partners keep USD on bank accounts every time they issue new tokens. Those accounts are audited to make sure that there are as many USDC in circulation as there are USD in those accounts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So why do stablecoins exist even though money is mostly digital these days? Like other crypto assets, stablecoins present some flexibility when it comes to sending, receiving and storing value. You don’t need a bank account and everything can be easily programmable. And you don’t need to support legacy systems, integrate with banks and pay transaction fees to other financial institutions.</p>
<p>While USDC originally started as a token on top of the Ethereum blockchain, USDC also supports two other blockchains — Algorand and Stellar. Visa has chosen to focus on the Ethereum variant of USDC for now.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crypto company Anchorage raises $80 million after getting federal banking charter&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/crypto-company-anchorage-raises-80-million-after-getting-federal-banking-charter/embed/#?secret=eRisAcXSob" data-secret="eRisAcXSob" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The payment company already supports 160 currencies across the globe. That’s why you can seamlessly use your Visa card when you travel abroad. You’ll see a card transaction in your home currency on your card statement, but the merchant gets paid in their own local currency.</p>
<p>Thanks to a partnership with <a href="https://anchorage.com">Anchorage</a>, Visa is adding support for its first digital currency. Anchorage recently received a federal banking charter and is positioning itself as a digital asset bank. Visa was probably looking for a trustworthy partner for this program. As Anchorage got a thumbs-up from regulators, the partnership makes sense.</p>
<p>For Crypto.com, it means that it can send USDC directly to Visa. For instance, if a Crypto.com customer holds USDC in their wallet and makes a card transaction, Crypto.com doesn’t have to first convert USDC tokens to USD.</p>
<p>It can send USDC to Visa’s Ethereum wallet address at Anchorage to settle the transaction. The merchant then gets paid by Visa in their own currency. Visa says there will be more partners down the road in addition to Crypto.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government has cut trade ties to Myanmar, two months after the country&#8217;s military staged a coup overthrowing the country&#8217;s president and also its de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and killed at least 200 protesters resulting from its offensive.</p>
<p>In a statement, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the trade suspension would be &#8220;effective immediately&#8221; and will remain in place &#8220;until the return of a democratically elected government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States supports the people of Burma in their efforts to restore a democratically elected government, which has been the foundation of Burma’s economic growth and reform,&#8221; said Tai. &#8220;The United States strongly condemns the Burmese security forces&#8217; brutal violence against civilians. The killing of peaceful protestors, students, workers, labor leaders, medics, and children has shocked the conscience of the international community. These actions are a direct assault on the country&#8217;s transition to democracy and the efforts of the Burmese people to achieve a peaceful and prosperous future,&#8221; the statement read.</p>
<p>Myanmar (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16000467">also known as Burma</a>) and the U.S. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16000467">began trading in 2013</a> following the easing of U.S. sanctions a year earlier after elections saw Suu Kyi&#8217;s party win by a landslide.</p>
<p>The trade suspension is designed to target the ruling military junta, but leaves millions of internet users across Myanmar in uncertainty as U.S. cloud and internet companies wrangle with the U.S. government order, at a time where protesters are struggling to stay online <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/myanmar-military-government-is-now-blocking-twitter/">amid government-ordered internet shutdowns</a> across the country.</p>

<p>Sanctions are designed to prevent the shipping of goods, money and certain services to other countries. Companies operating in the U.S. have to follow U.S. sanctions or face <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/syria-sanctions-fine/update-1-dubai-firm-fined-2-8-million-for-shipping-blue-coat-monitoring-gear-to-syria-idUSL6N0DC4W120130425">heavy financial penalties</a>. ZTE <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/zte-doj-plea-deal/">pleaded guilty</a> in 2017 to violating U.S. sanctions against Iran by knowingly shipping products to the country, and agreed to pay a near-$1 billion fine.</p>
<p>But cloud companies fall into a gray area and have <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/internet-businesses-are-targeted-by-64834/">different interpretations</a> of the rules. Quartz <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/why-large-parts-internet-suddenly-093017286.html">reported in 2016</a> that internet users across Syria, Cuba, and Iran — all subject to U.S. trade sanctions — couldn&#8217;t access sites hosted by IBM because the U.S. cloud host blocked visitors from those countries from accessing its services. Rackspace and Linode, two other large cloud providers, do not block internet traffic to users in embargoed countries but instead prevented users from those countries from signing up for their service.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Can the market hold up the optimism that many SPAC-led debuts are implying in their pricing? I do not know. But there are a lot of wagers being made in the market today that are giving me pause.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that U.K.-based used car seller Cazoo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/uks-cazoo-will-list-on-the-nyse-by-way-of-a-spac-valuing-it-at-7b-and-raising-1-6b/">intends to list</a> in the United States via a SPAC is not surprising. After all, the SPAC boom we&#8217;ve seen in recent quarters means that there are a host of American blank-check companies in the market looking for deals &#8212; why would they stop at domestic borders?</p>
<p>But the Cazoo deal is not a surprise for other reasons as well. We&#8217;ve seen the value of related American company Carvana spike in recent years after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/28/auto-site-carvana-tumbles-26-in-stock-market-debut/">its 2017 IPO</a>, for example. And Carvana has shown the sort of gross-margin improvement that Cazoo intends to manage in the coming years, so there&#8217;s precedent for its sales model to show economic improvements over time.</p>

<p>But coming at the same time as a <a href="https://www.cazoo.co.uk/static/docs/Cazoo%20-%20Investor%20Presentation.pdf">sunny investor deck</a> detailing why the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210328005028/en/Cazoo-to-Become-Listed-on-NYSE-through-7.0-Billion-Business-Combination-with-AJAX-I">Cazoo-AJAX I deal</a> is a good idea are a number of public-market trembles that could indicate uncertain risk tolerance among public investors. We can see this in the slack debut of several Chinese companies, as well as the downward pressure on the public offering for Deliveroo, a food-delivery platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/28/uks-cazoo-will-list-on-the-nyse-by-way-of-a-spac-valuing-it-at-7b-and-raising-1-6b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cazoo is picking up significant capital today</a> by teaming up with a SPAC in the U.S. at a $7 billion valuation, but another big used-car play is consolidating operations. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that Berlin-based <a href="https://www.frontiercargroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frontier Car Group</a>, which builds used-car marketplaces with a focus on emerging markets, is shutting down its operations in the city. The move will see 100 jobs transferred from Berlin to India, the company said.</p>
<p>Its majority owner OLX Group, a division of Prosus (the tech holdings of Naspers that is now listed as a separate entity), said that it wants to refocus on more local operations in Latin America and Asia under its OLX Autos brand, into which it will fold in the remaining FCG operations. OLX Autos&#8217; CEO Gautam Thakar, who was <a href="https://www.olxgroup.com/press/olx-group-appoints-gautam-thakar-global-ceo-olx-autos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appointed in February</a>, is based out of Gurgaon, India.</p>
<p>The company currently has operations in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Peru. OLX Autos independently also had three other brands: CarFirst brand in Pakistan, Cars45 in Nigeria, and <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.webuyanycarusa.com%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Csarah.ryan%40prosus.com%7Cfbe9858e65f94e04f30008d8f2c11c5d%7Ccefec05ccd1a44f38657e7e2744d40b0%7C1%7C0%7C637526258510352630%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=pu5japuZ7trycEJyn5SPaO3TtUj%2BfvOKpfrCikhVI1I%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.webuyanycarusa.com%252F%26data%3D04%257C01%257Csarah.ryan%2540prosus.com%257Cfbe9858e65f94e04f30008d8f2c11c5d%257Ccefec05ccd1a44f38657e7e2744d40b0%257C1%257C0%257C637526258510352630%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%253D%257C1000%26sdata%3Dpu5japuZ7trycEJyn5SPaO3TtUj%252BfvOKpfrCikhVI1I%253D%26reserved%3D0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617115809061000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCPEQI03owkuFWtV3CdnoCwyj1dQ">webuyanycar.com</a> in the US.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>OLX took a controlling stake in Frontier as a result of an investment of about $400 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/olx-group-invests-up-to-400m-in-used-car-marketplace-frontier-car-group-at-700m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late 2019</a>, valuing Frontier at around $700 million at the time. There was no official announcement of the move, but we saw the news in passing on Twitter, and a Prosus spokesperson confirmed the details to TechCrunch in a statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;OLX Group can confirm the closure of the FCG Germany GmbH entity based in Berlin over the coming months,&#8221; said the spokesperson. &#8220;This entity represents a subset of the OLX Group workforce in Berlin &#8211; other OLX Group employees in Berlin were not impacted by this entity closure, and those operations are ongoing. This decision to close FCG Germany GmbH was not taken lightly. The decision reflects the evolution of the OLX Autos strategy to focus more strongly on the LatAm and Asia markets. In order to have our development teams closer to our customers, we will shift core product development operations to India, a key market for OLX Autos. OLX Group is committed to taking care of our people in such a difficult situation and has offered a financial runway beyond what is compulsory, to allow time and flexibility to find new roles. Effected employees are being encouraged to apply for open roles within our other entities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>About 100 people are being impacted by the news &#8212; jobs that were based in Berlin that are being relocated to India. No other operations were active in other markets in Europe. If you navigate to FCG&#8217;s site, it automatically redirects to OLX.</p>
<p>Although it was founded and headquartered in Berlin, Frontier Car Group had always focused on emerging markets and taking the used-car marketplace model to those countries.</p>
<p>Inspired by Cazoo rival Auto1 &#8212; another Berlin-based used-car marketplace that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/auto1-ipo-idUSL8N2KA2LE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went public via a listing in Germany in February</a> and is now valued at $12.6 billion (likely an encouraging comparison for Cazoo investors) &#8212; Frontier founders Sujay Tyle, Peter Lindholm and André Kussmann thought they could take that model to less developed markets for a bigger opportunity.</p>
<p>“I fell in love with the Auto1 model,” Tyle told TechCrunch back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/frontier-car-group-raises-another-58m-for-its-used-car-marketplace-for-emerging-economies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018</a>. “I could see how it could be applied to emerging markets. Emerging markets represent nascency.” Tyle himself is a whizz-kid who hails from the U.S. and was in his early 20s when he co-founded Frontier. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">He left it in August 2020 and now lives in Mexico City, building a new e-commerce investor there called Merama.</span></p>
<p>Frontier, in part because of the success of Auto1 (which took hundreds of millions of dollars in investment from the likes of Sequoia, SoftBank and others), became a part of the guard of exciting new tech startups building businesses out of Berlin.</p>
<p>That focus on emerging markets linked up Naspers&#8217; global expansion strategy, and so OLX, a classifieds operation that had an interest in automotive marketplaces, became a strategic investor in Frontier, first with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/frontier-car-group-raises-another-58m-for-its-used-car-marketplace-for-emerging-economies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">smaller stake</a>, and eventually taking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/olx-group-invests-up-to-400m-in-used-car-marketplace-frontier-car-group-at-700m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority ownership and control of the operation</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why OLX decided to wind down the Frontier brand and to double down OLX Autos but notably, over the last year it looks like OLX was restructuring in other markets, including with the <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/olx-india-lays-off-250-employees-set-to-renew-focus-on-2-verticals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoff of 250 people in its operations in India</a> after shutting down marketplaces focused on real estate and used goods.</p>
<p>While some companies like Cazoo have apparently seen a strong surge of business in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the health crisis has hit a number of economies, economic sectors and specific companies harder than others, leading to tightening costs. Overall, we&#8217;ve seen big slumps in new car sales in different markets around the world.</p>
<p>A Prosus spokesperson said that both OLX and OLX Autos were<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> impacted at the start of Covid-19 but have since recovered. </span>Prosus has <a href="https://www.prosus.com/getattachment/Investors/Overview/Prosus-press-statement,-Sep20.pdf.aspx?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remained</a> profitable in what has been a turbulent year, but <a href="https://simplywall.st/stocks/nl/retail/ams-prx/prosus-shares/news/were-not-counting-on-prosus-amsprx-to-sustain-its-statutory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some</a> have pointed out that those profits have declined. (It will next update its financials in June.)</p>
<p>Updated to make clear that OLX is folding FCG&#8217;s remaining operations into its OLX Autos business, not shutting it down altogether.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>This morning was a fun mix of news, including some early-stage and late-stage startups entries, along with the latest from the public markets and the great IPO game. Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>ServiceTitan&#8217;s vertical SaaS success was enshrined in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/27/with-an-arr-topping-250-million-las-vertical-saas-superstar-servicetitan-is-now-worth-8-3-billion/">recent funding round and valuation</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IBM today <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2021/03/quantum-developer-certification/">announced</a> the launch of its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/certify/exam?id=C1000-112">first developer certification</a> for programming quantum computers.</p>
<p>While quantum computing may still be in its infancy, most pundits in the industry will tell you that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/why-now-is-the-time-to-get-ready-for-quantum-computing/">now is the time to learn the basic concepts</a>. And while there is little that&#8217;s immediately intuitive on the hardware side of quantum computing, the actual software tools that most players in the industry are developing today should feel somewhat familiar to virtually any developer.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the &#8220;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/certify/exam?id=C1000-112">IBM Quantum Developer Certification</a>,&#8221; as it&#8217;s officially called, focuses on IBM&#8217;s own software tools and especially <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a>, its SDK for working with quantum computers. Qiskit has already proven quite popular, with more than 600,000 installs, and when IBM Quantum and the Qiskit team hosted a quantum summer school last year, almost 5,000 developers participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But on top of knowing their way around the basics of Qiskit (think defining and executing quantum circuits) developers also need to learn some of the basics of quantum computing itself. Once you know your way around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere">Bloch spheres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices">Pauli matrices</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state">Bell states</a>, you&#8217;ll probably be in good shape for taking the certification exam, which will be administered on the <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/ibm">Pearson VUE platform</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why now is the time to get ready for quantum computing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/why-now-is-the-time-to-get-ready-for-quantum-computing/embed/#?secret=4OLnSxMVKZ" data-secret="4OLnSxMVKZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Abe Asfaw, the global lead for Quantum Education and Open Science at IBM, told me that this is just the first of a series of planned quantum certifications.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve built is a multi-tiered developer certification,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;The first tier is what we&#8217;re releasing in this announcement and that tier gets developers introduced to how to work with quantum circuits. How do you use Qiskit [&#8230;] to build out a quantum circuit and how do you run it on a quantum computer? And once you run it on a quantum computer, how do you look at the results and how do you interpret the results? This sets the stage for the next series of certifications that we&#8217;re developing, which are then going to be attached to use cases that are being explored in optimization, chemistry and finance. All of these can now be sort of integrated into the developer workflow once we have enabled someone to show that they can work with quantum circuits.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131113" style="width: 647px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131113" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png" alt="" width="637" height="213" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quantum_cert.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> IBM</p></div></p>
<p>Asfaw stressed that IBM has focused on educating developers about quantum computing for quite a while now, in part because it takes some time to develop the skills and intuition to build quantum circuits. He also noted that the open-source Qiskit SDK has integrated a lot of the tools that developers need to work at both the circuit level &#8212; which is a bit closer to writing in C or maybe even assembly in the classical computing world &#8212; and at the application level, where a lot of that is abstracted away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to make it easy for someone who is currently developing, whether it&#8217;s in the cloud, whether it&#8217;s using Python, to be able to run these tools and integrate quantum computing into their workflow,&#8221; Asfaw said. &#8220;I think the hardest part, to be very honest, is just giving someone the comfort to know that quantum computing is real today and that you can work with quantum computers. It&#8217;s as easy as opening up a Jupyter notebook and writing some code in Python.&#8221;</p>
<div>He noted that IBM already often helps upskill developers (from its partner companies) who are interested in quantum computing. So far, though, this has been a very ad hoc process. With the new certification program, developers can now formally demonstrate their skills and show that they are in a position to utilize quantum computing in their workflow.</div>
