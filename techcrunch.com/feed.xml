										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commercial real estate industry is facing its share of challenges, considering the fact that so many people are working from home (and not in offices) and retail is riding a slippery slope as more people shop online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from downturns, opportunity emerges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter <a href="https://www.optiolend.com">OptioLend</a>, a new startup that wants to help individual investors take advantage of opportunities in commercial real estate by connecting them with “the best possible” lenders. The Columbus, Ohio-based company launched its marketplace Tuesday after months of operating in private beta.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new platform uses an AI-powered algorithm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a database of more than 9,500 capital sources</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help prospective real estate borrowers in search of debt financing find lenders “with the best terms.” In other words, the company’s self-proclaimed mission is to become the “LendingTree for commercial real estate.” (For the unacquainted, Charlotte, North Carolina-based LendingTree is an online marketplace that provides c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">onsumers multiple offers from several lenders for things like mortgage, student and personal loans.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Lowery, a former LendingTree executive who built the back end of that company’s platform, helped build out the OptioLend portal serving in a technical advisor capacity along with former data scientists at IBM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once an investor applies for a loan, OptioLend identifies up to 20 lenders best suited for that application based on recent lending history and other criteria. Borrowers and brokers can negotiate and close deals from within the company’s platform via the mostly automated process, the company claims. But it’s also launching “with a concierge service of experienced capital advisors” to help guide users who need help during the loan procurement process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get off the ground, OptioLend last year raised about $1 million in seed funding led by the <a href="http://www.schottycapital.com">Schottenstein Family Office</a> with participation from Loud Capital and MLG Ventures. For context, the Schottenstein family is one of the largest private real estate owners in the country.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Valon closes on $50M a16z-led Series A to grow mobile-first mortgage servicing platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/valon-closes-on-50m-a16z-led-series-a-to-grow-mobile-first-mortgage-servicing-platform/embed/#?secret=QUhcBaBI9R" data-secret="QUhcBaBI9R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Richard Geisenfeld said there’s a plethora of lenders that can lend at that price point, whereas there is “a relatively small pool of capital sources” that focus on deals above $10 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Capital markets are experiencing a 50% surge in refis and new loans as the markets start to rebound from COVID,” he said. “And as existing loans start coming due, we think we’re in a perfect timing to roll out. Properties are going to be repurposed, and are already starting to be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while OptioLend can work with institutions and individual investors, it’s more focused on the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions have a lot of choices,” Geisenfeld said. “Individual investors do not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geisenfeld said he comes from a family of developers and himself has closed about $1.7 billion worth of transactions in 44 states as founder of Capital Commercial Partners. He’d been representing the Schottenstein family for nearly 20 years before the concept behind OptioLend emerged.</span></p>
<p>As an experiment prior to the formation of OptioLend, the family office had reached out to more than 50 lenders in an effort to finance the purchase of a small single tenant, triple net portfolio. They were surprised to discover that the interest rates varied as much as a full percentage point.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every time we did a deal with them, we’d hear anecdotally there were better [loan] rates out there and they agreed that we needed to create some kind of efficiency and automation,” Geisenfeld told TechCrunch. “So I went to one of my colleagues and asked ‘how do we change the paradigm from the traditional methodology?’ And that’s the problem we’re out to solve &#8212; by increasing an investor’s access to capital by 10 times in 10 minutes.”</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GBAkbba9vD"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/vc-investment-in-proptech-can-yield-profits-and-change-lives/">VC investment in proptech can yield profits and change lives</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says it not only helps investors with new loan applications, but it can also help them refinance existing assets. Its sweet spot is on transactions in the middle market &#8212; in the $1 million to $10 million range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OptioLend will work with commercial real estate and mortgage brokers alike either by allowing them to use the platform directly or to refer property owners to it. Their incentive for referrals is earning up to 50% of the original fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Schottenstein, principal of Schottenstein Family Office, noted in a written statement that in today’s market, borrowers with limited access to capital sources sometimes sign onto loan terms with interest rates “as much as 100 basis points higher than they have to.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;OptioLend’s ability to get deals in front of multiple lenders quickly helps ensure that borrowers are getting the best terms possible,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora has reached a deal with Toyota and auto-parts supplier Denso to develop and test vehicles equipped with the self-driving startup&#8217;s technology, beginning with a fleet of Toyota Sienna minivans.</p>
<p>Engineering teams from Aurora and Toyota will work together to design and build the self-driving Sienna minivans with an aim to start testing a fleet by the end of 2021, the companies said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The announcement follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">Aurora&#8217;s acquisition</a> of Uber Advanced Technologies Group, which spun out from Uber in 2019 after the unit raised $1 billion in funding from Toyota, Denso and SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund. The acquisition, which closed January 20, was a complex deal in which Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. Uber now holds a 26% stake in the combined company. Toyota also has a minority stake in Aurora as a result of the acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership announced Tuesday is similar &#8212; at least in part &#8212; to an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/27/toyota-invests-500-million-into-uber/">agreement reached in 2018</a> between Toyota and Uber to bring an on-demand autonomous ride-hailing service to market. Under that deal, which included a $500 million investment by Toyota, the companies agreed to integrate Uber ATG&#8217;s self-driving technology into the Sienna minivans for use in Uber&#8217;s ride-hailing network. The vehicles later could be owned and operated by third-party fleet managers, Toyota and Uber ATG said at the time.</p>
<p>Aurora co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson emphasized that this is a new partnership and not just an extension of Toyota&#8217;s agreement with Uber ATG.</p>
<p>Toyota and Aurora declined to disclose details such as the size of the team or whether there were financial incentives tied to the deal, making it difficult to determine the scope of the collaboration.</p>
<p>However, Aurora describes this as a long-term strategic deal and laid out an ambitious vision for a partnership that extends far beyond testing. Aurora said that the joint development work in 2021 will lay the groundwork for the mass production and launch of these vehicles with Toyota on ride-hailing networks, including Uber&#8217;s. Aurora said it will also explore mass production of autonomous driving components with Denso and the creation of a services platform with Toyota that could manage financing, insurance and maintenance of the self-driving vehicles.</p>
<p>Anderson noted that the development of these commercial downstream services such as fleet management has become increasingly important for the company following its agreement with trucking firm PACCAR and now Toyota.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need a vehicle, we need a driver and we need support services,&#8221; Anderson said in a recent interview. &#8220;One of the areas that we&#8217;re exploring with Toyota as part of this, is the scaled deployment of Toyota-built vehicles, powered by the Aurora driver, supported by a combination of Aurora&#8217;s support services as well as Toyota&#8217;s network. This is one of the areas where Toyota&#8217;s scale becomes so significant to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The path from testing to commercialization is a long one, riddled with potential speed bumps, including technical and regulatory challenges, competing with rivals over skilled workers and raising enough capital. Achieving these doesn&#8217;t always equate to success as operating an autonomous ride-hailing network has its own set of hurdles. The upshot: Aurora&#8217;s partnership with Toyota is no guarantee.</p>
<p>Still, locking in a partnership with a large automaker is still important for Aurora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toyota has an unparalleled legacy, engineering expertise, leadership, and ability to deliver high-quality, affordable, and reliable vehicles,&#8221; Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson wrote in a blog post Tuesday. &#8220;They&#8217;re also the preferred vehicle brand for transporting riders on ride-hailing networks, so we&#8217;re excited and honored to work with them to unlock driverless mobility services with the Aurora Driver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urmson added that Aurora&#8217;s development work on highway driving to support its first commercial product, a driverless truck, &#8220;will also be critical for safely moving people, as a significant fraction of ride-share bookings today require the ability to drive over 50 mph.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify this morning confirmed it&#8217;s testing a new, synced lyrics feature in the U.S. market, following a report from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-live-lyrics-united-states-test-ios-android-140045159.html">Engadget</a>. Though the streaming music service today offers live lyrics in a number of markets &#8212; 27, in fact, including its <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-01/spotify-launches-in-south-korea/">recent launch</a> in South Korea &#8212; it has not offered lyrics in the U.S. for many years. Instead, Spotify here runs the &#8220;Behind the Lyrics&#8221; feature provided in partnership with Genius, which offers a combination of lyrics and trivia about the song being played.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Spotify said the new Lyrics feature rolled out as a test for some users in the U.S. starting today.</p>
<p>“We can confirm we’re currently testing our lyrics feature to a select number of users in the U.S.,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience. Some of those tests end up paving the way for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company declined to share additional details about its plans, but did note that its U.S. partner on the new Lyrics feature is <a href="https://www.musixmatch.com/">Musixmatch</a> &#8212; a service that already powers Spotify&#8217;s lyrics feature in various non-U.S. markets.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Spotify has run a lyrics feature in the U.S., to be clear. The streaming service had originally worked with Musixmatch from 2011 through 2016, before <a href="https://blog.musixmatch.com/i-know-its-over-a-parting-of-ways-and-it-s-done-but-didn-t-we-have-fun-8bb27193494d#.fzcobucji">ending that relationship</a> to instead partner with Genius. But despite ongoing user demand for lyrics&#8217; return, Spotify never brought the feature back to the U.S.</p>
<p>In more recent years, however, Spotify rekindled its relationship with Musixmatch. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/in-a-significant-expansion-spotify-to-launch-real-time-lyrics-in-26-markets/">it announced the launch of real-time lyrics</a> in, then, 26 worldwide markets across Southeast Asia, India and Latin America. This had been the first time lyrics were offered in 22 of these 26 markets, as only Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico had some form of prior lyrics support via other providers.</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s ongoing lack of support for lyrics in the U.S. has given its streaming music competitors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/15/spotify-is-falling-behind-on-lyrics-and-voice/">an advantage</a>. Amazon Music, for example, allowed users to <a href="https://www.popsci.com/best-tips-for-amazon-music-unlimited/">view lyrics</a> as songs played and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/24/amazon-musics-app-adds-hands-free-listening-courtesy-of-alexa/">tied the feature</a> to its Alexa voice platform, so consumers could ask Alexa to search for songs by lyrics. Meanwhile, the updated version of Apple Music that <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/05/apple-music-in-ios-12-adds-song-search-by-lyrics-new-artist-pages">rolled out with iOS 12</a> in 2018 included a way to search by lyrics, instead of just artist, album or song title. It <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/3430316/how-to-use-synchronized-lyrics-in-apple-music-on-your-iphone-ipad-or-apple-tv.html">later added</a> live, synced lyrics with the launch of iOS 13. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208279">Siri can also respond to commands</a> that involve lyrics.</p>
<p>Musixmatch additionally confirmed it has partnered with Spotify on the new U.S. test.</p>
<p>&#8220;Musixmatch is keeping growing at a fast pace thanks to our continued investment we&#8217;ve made [over] a decade. We&#8217;re focused now on bringing more data to continue enriching the audio experience globally,&#8221; Musixmatch CEO and founder Max Ciocciola told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Because the lyrics feature is only a test, you may not see it yourself in the Spotify app, due to its limited availability. Spotify has not said if or when the test may be expanded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once upon a time, the idea of 3D-printed homes felt like a thing of the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as housing gets less and less affordable &#8212; especially in ultra-expensive markets such as the Bay Area &#8212; companies are getting creative in their quest to build more affordable homes using technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those companies, Oakland-based <a href="http://mightybuildings.com/">Mighty Buildings</a>, just raised $40 million in Series B funding for its quest to create homes that it says are “beautiful, sustainable and affordable” using 3D printing, robotics and automation. It claims to be able to 3D print structures “two times as quickly with 95% less labor </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hours </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and 10-times less waste” than conventional construction. For example, it says it can 3D print a 350-square-foot studio apartment in just 24 hours.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four-year-old startup’s efforts caught the eye of Khosla Ventures, which co-led the financing along with Zeno Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryno Blignaut, an operating partner at Khosla, believes that Mighty Buildings &#8212; which launched out of stealth </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/05/2073089/0/en/Mighty-Buildings-Launches-to-Accelerate-Homebuilding-with-3D-Printing-and-Automation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; has the potential to cut both the cost and carbon footprint of home construction “by 50% or more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company takes a hybrid approach to home construction, combining 3D printing and prefab (meaning built offsite) building, according to co-founder and COO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexey Dubov</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It has invented a proprietary thermoset composite material called Light Stone Material (LSM) as part of its effort to reduce the home construction industry’s reliance on concrete and steel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The material can be 3D printed and hardens almost immediately, according to the company, while also maintaining cohesion between layers to create a monolithic structure. Mighty Buildings can then 3D print elements like overhangs or ceilings without the need for additional supporting formwork. That way, it’s able to fully print a structure and not just the walls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robotic arms can post-process the composite, which combined with the company’s ability to automate the pouring of insulation and the 3D printing gives Mighty Buildings the ability to automate up to 80% of the construction process, the company claims.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khosla was drawn to the Mighty Buildings’ innovative approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe in dematerializing buildings and non-linearly reducing the amount of cement and steel used, thereby reducing the cost of construction in order to increase affordable access to housing together with improved sustainability,” Blignaut wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Building&#8217;s use of 3D printing, advanced manufacturing techniques, modern robotics and “new lighter and stronger materials” gives it an edge, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch, the company has produced and installed a number of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and is now taking orders for Mighty Houses &#8212; its newest product line that will range from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">864 to 1,440 square feet at an estimated cost of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$304,000 to $420,500</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Similarly sized houses in some parts of the Bay Area can sell for upwards of $1 million).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The units are created with a 3D-printed exterior panelized shell while certain elements &#8212; such as bathrooms for example &#8212; are prefabricated in the company’s 79,000-square-foot production facility in Oakland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company is only building in California, but Dubov says it’s open to exploring other markets as its factory can be replicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, Mighty Buildings plans this year to market its Mighty Kit System and a new fiber-reinforced material for multi-story projects as part of a </span><a href="https://b2b.mightybuildings.com/developers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planned B2B platform for developers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, the company already has secured contracts with developers for its single family housing product line. It also plans to use the new capital in part to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">scale its production capacity with increased automation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, Mighty Building&#8217;s vision is to provide production-as-a-service, with builders and architects designing their own structures and then developers using Mighty Factories to produce them at scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mighty Buildings is not the only startup doing 3D-printed homes. Last August, Austin-based ICON</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://finledger.com/2020/08/19/icon-raises-35-million-for-3d-printed-homes/"> raised $35 million in Series A funding</a>. The company also aims to reinvent building affordable homes with the use of 3D printers, robotics and advanced materials. The biggest difference between the two companies, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubov, is that ICON does primarily onsite construction while Mighty Buildings prefabricates in a factory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a dozen other investors also participated in Mighty Building&#8217;s latest round, including returning backers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bold Capital Partners, Core Innovation Capital and Foundamental and new investors including ArcTern Ventures, Abies Ventures, Modern Venture Partners, MicroVentures, One Way Ventures, Polyvalent Capital and others. Mighty Buildings was also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">included in </span><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y Combinator’s Top companies </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">list, all of which have valuations over $150 million (although the company declined to reveal its current valuation). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Khosla’s Blignaut believes that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">buildings are “a big part of our urban landscape and a large consumer of resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Construction and building account for more carbon emissions in the U.S. than transportation or industry,” he said. Other portfolio companies addressing such challenges include Ori Living, Vicarious, Katerra and Arevo.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://justo.mx/">Jüsto</a>, an online supermarket based in Mexico City, announced Tuesday it has raised $65 million in a Series A round led by General Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount is sizable for a Series A in general, but supersized for a LatAm startup. In fact, according to PitchBook data cited by General Atlantic, the round represents the largest Series A raised in Latin America in the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers also participated in the round, including Foundation Capital and Mountain Nazca.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ricardo Weder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, former president of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cabify </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a large ridesharing company operating in Latin America, Spain and Portugal) founded </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jüsto </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2019 with a mission to “disrupt the Latin American grocery industry.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It claims to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first supermarket in Mexico with no physical store. Customers can buy their groceries directly from the website or via the app and Jüsto delivers the order to the customer’s location of choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept is clearly resonating with consumers as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jüsto </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw impressive growth in 2020 with a 16-fold increase in revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jüsto prides itself on working directly with fresh produce suppliers so that it can offer “the freshest” fruits, vegetables, meats and fish in the market. It also offers a variety of products such as pantry staples, personal hygiene and beauty, home and cleaning, drinks and pet-related items.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mexico City&#8217;s Jüsto raises a $12 million bridge round for its delivery-only grocery stores&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/mexico-citys-justo-raises-a-12-million-bridge-round-for-its-delivery-only-grocery-stores/embed/#?secret=FAOd08haxf" data-secret="FAOd08haxf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup only sells items from local suppliers, with whom it prides itself on developing fair trade agreements (“Jüsto” means fair in Spanish). It also uses artificial intelligence to forecast demand and to try to reduce food waste at its micro-fulfillment centers. The company’s approach results in “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">competitive prices, lower transaction costs, and improved convenience to consumers by eliminating intermediaries in the supply chain,” according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Jüsto plans to use its new capital to expand across Mexico and Latin America as a whole, enhancing its last-mile logistics infrastructure and marketing initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luis Cervantes, managing director and head of Mexico City for General Atlantic, believes Mexico is at an inflection point in its transition to a digital economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see Jüsto as leading the way in the high-growth online grocery space with its technology-centric, mission-driven approach,” he said in a written statement. “Under Ricardo’s leadership, we believe Jüsto is positioned for significant expansion as it disrupts and transforms the legacy grocery value chain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jüsto marks General Atlantic’s fifth investment in Mexico since 2014. Since then, General Atlantic has invested nearly USD $1 billion in what it describes as “high-growth” Mexican companies.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing brings Jüsto’s total raised to over $100 million. Other investors include FEMSA Ventures, S7V, Elevar Equity, Bimbo Ventures, Quiet Capital, Sweet Capital, H2O Capital and SV LatAm Capital, among others.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.askzeta.com/">Zeta</a> co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditishekar">Aditi Shekar</a> has spent the past three years <a href="https://www.askzeta.com/money-manager/?utm_medium=press_release_Feb_9&amp;utm_source=press-release-Feb-9&amp;utm_campaign=press-release-feb-9">tracking the ways</a> couples share and manage their finances, from each card swipe to every split bill. Her effort led to tens of thousands of couples signing up for a free budgeting app experiment. Today, those learnings have been formed into a venture-backed startup.</p>
<p>Zeta is a new fintech platform that helps couples join their finances. Zeta isn’t creating the concept of joint accounts; it’s simply trying to rebuild them for the modern family. Currently, joint accounts lack transparency or the option to add multiple users that come from different relationships in your life. Many standard joint accounts just give every user entire access to other users’ finances, versus tiered ways to spend.</p>
<p>Shekar, who started the company after experiencing the stress of dividing and dealing with money in her own relationship, says the goal of Zeta is to take the “cognitive load” of dealing with money off of people in a relationship.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Off that vision, Shekar and her co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlhopkins">Kevin Hopkins</a> have raised $1.5 million in a round co-led by Deciens Capital and Precursor with participation from executives from Chime, Square, PayPal, Venmo, Google, Facebook and Weight Watchers. Shekar says that 57% of its cap table is women or people of color.</p>
<p>“In some ways, we see ourselves as part of a replacement for Venmo,” Shekar said. “We saw couples Venmoing back and forth to each other sometimes six times a day&#8230;we want to take over your money chores.” While Zeta is entering the market as a tool for couples, Shekar sees the startup’s moonshot as being the go-to operational account for any modern household.</p>
<p>A tool like Zeta is trying to give already existent transactions &#8212; begging for a rent check, splitting the grocery bill, going halfsies on dinner, giving allowance &#8212; an easier way to be completed.</p>
<p>In reality, the startup works as a First Republic or Chase replacement, providing a digital layer of banking services that can integrate with pre-existing bank accounts. Couples who download Zeta will each get a Zeta joint card and a joint account to layer atop their finances. The joint card will serve as the way that couples can spend from the same account.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Venmo to gain crypto, budgeting, savings and Honey integrations this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/venmo-to-gain-crypto-budgeting-bill-pay-and-honey-integrations-this-year/embed/#?secret=5S056sV4cm" data-secret="5S056sV4cm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>So far, users use their Zeta account in two main ways: have it take over standing bills such as rent or mortgage, or have it serve as a savings account for mutual goals, such as a post-COVID trip or big shared purchase like a car or home. Users can direct-deposit as much money as they want from their main bank accounts into Zeta, and then use the Zeta debit card to swipe couple money instead of individual money.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of fintechs that will go after the direct deposit,” Shekar said. “But we really thought about Zeta as the layer on top of existing accounts so you don’t have to move everything over.”</p>
<p>Similar to Chime, Zeta makes money from interchange fees, the cost it takes for a merchant to process your payment, on card transactions. A portion of the interchange fee is paid to Zeta, and a portion goes to your bank.</p>
<p>“If you and your partner wanted to share rent and pay bills together we’d be the natural place to plug into,” she said.</p>
<p>“Frankly, institutions have treated people as single-player games,” Shekar said. “Fintech is way more social than we realize.”</p>
<p>The success of Zeta hinges on the idea that people want to share their finances in an ongoing and meaningful way, and that the world of finance is ready to shift from individualism to collectivism earlier and louder. It sounds daunting, but we already know that social finance is big, as shown by apps like Venmo and Splitwise, and phenomena like the GameStop saga from just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Other startups have taken notice too, entering the world of multiplayer fintech, a term that categorizes socially focused and consumer-friendly financial services. Braid, a group-financing platform, is trying to make transactions work for various entities, from shared households to side hustles to creative projects.</p>
<p>Braid founder Amanda Payton breaks down the concept of multi-player, social finance into two phases: if 1.0 was Venmo, then 2.0 will “enable sharing money at the account and transaction level,” she says.</p>
<p>“I think about it this way: The current set of mainstream financial products supports my money and your money. Social finance 2.0 will be all about our money,” Peyton said.</p>
<p>“Banks have historically prioritized growing their own customer base. They haven&#8217;t invested a lot in products that promote sharing money, regardless of where your primary checking account lives&#8230;Zelle is a noticeable exception here,” she said. “And it&#8217;s not hard to see why, there&#8217;s little tangible benefit for them to do so.”</p>
<p>Zeta differentiates from Braid in that it is solely focused on couples and families, which lets it do things like pay bills and save money to plan for the financial future. Shekar says that it plans to support families in broader ways over time, such as being part of taxes or prenuptial agreements. That said, Zeta currently only supports two people per account, while Braid already has the capability to add multiple parties to its joint account.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="B7MhslUU4N"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/15/zelle-forecast-to-overtake-venmo-this-year/">Zelle forecast to overtake Venmo this year</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zelle forecast to overtake Venmo this year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/15/zelle-forecast-to-overtake-venmo-this-year/embed/#?secret=B7MhslUU4N" data-secret="B7MhslUU4N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The biggest hurdle for Zeta is if people trust each other enough to get into operational accounts with each other to do it. Individualism isn’t just a lazy reaction to lack of tooling out there; for many people, keeping your money to yourself is a preference. Of course, the flip-side of shared finances is dealing with the repercussions of ending that relationship if life gets in the way.</p>

<p>“Break-up was the first feature we ever built,” Shekar said. Right now, there are no clear ways that Zeta can define what happens to the money in the shared account if people break up (no, there’s no clause that requires you to split money down the middle).</p>
<p>The startup is thinking about adding a feature during on-boarding that asks users what they prefer happens “in the event of a closure.”</p>
<p>“The psychology you need to have to open an account together is that you really trust your partner,” she said. “If you don’t trust your partner you might not be ready for this.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new study from Mount Sinai researchers published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medical Internet Research found that wearable hardware, and specifically the Apple Watch, can effectively predict a positive COVID-19 diagnosis up to a week before current PCR-based nasal swab tests.</p>
<p>The investigation dubbed the <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/covid19/warrior-watch-study">&#8216;Warrior Watch Study,</a>&#8216; used a dedicated Apple Watch and iPhone app and included participants from Mount Sinai staff. It required participants to use the app for health data monitoring and collection, and also asked that they fill out a day survey to provide direct feedback about their potential COVID-19 symptoms, and other factor including stress.</p>
<p>During the course of the study, the research team enlisted &#8220;several hundred health care workers&#8221; to participate, and collected data over several months, between April and September. The primary biometric signal that the study&#8217;s authors were watching was heart rate variability (HRV), which is a key indicator of strain on a person&#8217;s nervous system. This information was combined with information around reported symptoms associated with COVID-19, including fever, aches, dry cough, gastrointestinal issues, loss of taste and smell, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Warrior Watch Study was not only able to predict infections up to a week before tests provided confirmed diagnoses, but also revealed that participants&#8217; HRV patterns normalized fairly quickly after their diagnosis, returning to normal roughly one to two weeks following their positive tests.</p>
<p>As to what the study could lead to in terms of actual interventions, the study&#8217;s authors note that it can help anticipate outcomes and isolate individuals from others who are at risk. Most importantly, it provides a means for doing so remotely, allowing caregivers to anticipate or detect a COVID-19 case without even doing a physical exam or a administering a nasal swab test, which can help take precautionary measures in high-risk situations when cases are suspected, possibly preventing any spread before someone is highly contagious.</p>
<p>The study is ongoing, and will expand to examine what else wearables like the Apple Watch and their onboard sensors can tell us about other impacts of COVID-19 on the health of care workers, including what factors like sleep and physical activity can have in association with the disease.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Seed rounds are up!” “Seed rounds are higher valued than ever!” “There were 10% less VCs investing in seed rounds last year!” !!!!!!!!1</p>
<p>We’ve all seen these stories, and we’re fine connoisseurs of them here at TechCrunch, for sure. Trend data about VC investing are always enticing to startup founders and investors, since they affect so much of the strategy and planning of building a company. If seed rounds are becoming more elusive, maybe skip on that last hire, extend the runway, and try to gain some revenues. If Series A is the new bottleneck, well, invest more in product and growth so you don’t slam into the capital wall. If money is raining down from the sky, double the team, double growth marketing spend, and go blitzscale.</p>
<p>It’s key market intelligence, and important. Which is why it is so frustrating that the aggregate data on VC rounds is so, goddamn bad.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s a friendly reminder: there are no comprehensive datasets on VC rounds, at least in the United States) And the data quality has only gotten worse over time, particularly at the seed stage.</p>
<p>It’s a theme I have been harping on for years now. SEC Form D filings, which form the backbone of most trend data of VC investment rounds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/the-disappearing-form-d/">have been disappearing for years now</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="q0v1lPIFdJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/the-disappearing-form-d/">The disappearing Form D</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The disappearing Form D&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/07/the-disappearing-form-d/embed/#?secret=q0v1lPIFdJ" data-secret="q0v1lPIFdJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As I described in my analysis from way back in 2018, the biggest reason is also one that isn’t very visible: a transformation in the culture among lawyers from a culture of “always file” to a culture of avoiding filings if at all possible.</p>
<p>That cultural change has been driven by founders and investors who want to keep their startups stealthy and their competitors in the dark about where their finances are. Plus, founders can avoid the spectacle of salespeople beating down their door when they find out the startup has cash in the coffers.</p>
<p>When I talked to lawyers about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-to-delay-your-form-ds/">how to delay filing a Form D</a>, all gave the standard perfunctory response about the necessity of filing — until we went off-the-record. Then, lawyers opened up about how much they skirt around SEC securities regulations. As one lawyer essentially put it, there’s what the law says is required, and then what the SEC ever bothers to enforce. No one in Silicon Valley has ever been charged with a crime related to skipping out on a Form D filing, or even paid a fine that anyone seems to have any memory of.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="szraIzS3UP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-to-delay-your-form-ds/">How to delay your Form Ds (or not file them at all)</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to delay your Form Ds (or not file them at all)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/28/how-to-delay-your-form-ds/embed/#?secret=szraIzS3UP" data-secret="szraIzS3UP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One lawyer at the time described to me a prototypical conversation he has with founders. He doesn’t tell them not to file their Form Ds. Instead, he says that almost none of their peer founders will file securities paperwork, and thus, if they <i>do</i> follow the law, they would be at a competitive disadvantage. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of founders follow the directed course.</p>
<p>While it might seem like the law is the law, what’s far more important than what is written in the law or SEC regulations is how the law is interpreted, which is really about the sociology of attorneys. Years ago, I was talking to a securities attorney about company valuations. He was describing to me how East Coast-based securities lawyers at the time would blanche at some of the valuation tricks that West Coast / Silicon Valley lawyers would use with startups. You can follow the law closely, and you can follow the law loosely — and neither group is altogether breaking the law.</p>
<p>A change in legal culture driven by founders is one aspect of the dilemma facing VC investment trend surveyors. Another, particularly at the seed stage, is the complexity of rounds today.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/">As my colleague Alex Wilhelm wrote this morning in The Exchange newsletter</a>, alternative investment models are having a large effect on aggregate VC data. Rolling rounds, convertible notes, SaaS securitization products, crowdfunding, and other mechanisms have massively transformed the seed-stage investing world from the ol’ write-a-check-and-buy-equity approach. While some of these forms of investment trigger filings requirements, many of these models are so new that lawyers have been willing to skip filings given the paucity of case law associated with the regulations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="W8ugW1WpnJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/">Are SAFEs obscuring today&#8217;s seed volume?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Are SAFEs obscuring today&#8217;s seed volume?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/are-safes-obscuring-todays-seed-volume/embed/#?secret=W8ugW1WpnJ" data-secret="W8ugW1WpnJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Finally, you can generally avoid a Form D by filing in the relevant state jurisdictions of the company and its investors. As much as securities law may seem federal (we talk about the SEC a heck of a lot more than the California Department of Financial Protection &amp; Innovation), the reality is that much of securities law is still practiced at the state level. What that means is that startups can use state filings in lieu of federal filings, and those are essentially invisible since literally no one besides me and a few other journalists in the world read state securities filings.</p>
<p>Take for instance a cool company I covered a little while back called Hebbia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/hebbia-wants-to-make-ctrl-f-or-command-f-actually-useful-through-better-ai/">which is reinventing search on the desktop</a>. They raised a $1.1 million pre-seed round led by Floodgate with a lot of other great investors. Now, go to the SEC search page and look for the Form D. Nothing. But if you go to the California DFPI, you will find three filings submitted on September 21, 2020 for a $1.2 million total round. There’s your filing.</p>
<p>Even late-stage companies can mostly go without any Form D filings. Take DoorDash, for instance, which just had a monster IPO last year. If you search through the SEC database for “DoorDash Inc,” you will find nary a Form D filing for any of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doordash/company_financials">the company’s 11 venture rounds that Crunchbase identifies</a>. The first filings with the SEC are for its originally confidential Draft Registration Statement to go IPO in early 2020. Now, if you head over to California’s database again, you will find filings going back to 2016, which I presume is the five-year limit for the site’s search function.</p>
<p>Using state filings is not wrong, illegal, or unethical — it’s just the standard way to do business today. But few industry datasets go beyond federal Form D filings to take into account every state’s database for securities filings. There are 50 states, and many of them (looking at you Florida) are all but impenetrable to researchers and investigators.</p>
<p>So if the legal culture around filings has changed, more rounds are using alternative investment models, and startups aren’t filing federally, what are analysts supposed to do?</p>
<p>Well, they try to compensate for this sparsity by augmenting the dataset they have with publicly reported information from sites like TechCrunch, Twitter conversations, self-reported data from startups, surveys of lawyers and accountants and more to attempt to statistically estimate how many rounds were actually conducted given the limited information they have on hand. For example, if lawyers report a 15% uptick in rounds, we can guesstimate roughly how many rounds took place in a given year.</p>
<p>At least, that’s the idea. Unfortunately, there really is no way to measure the inaccuracy of this approach, since there is no administrative dataset to compare our estimations to.</p>
<p>What percentage of rounds go undisclosed? It’s impossible to count something we can’t count, but my guess covering the industry is something on the order of 50-60% of seed rounds, a third of Series A/B rounds, and a declining percentage the later a company goes (at a certain point, Form Ds solve <i>a lot</i> of problems for companies when it comes to securities paperwork and mitigating legal risk).</p>
<p>Even the government doesn’t have data better than us. Take a story from last week in the Wall Street Journal about how <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-swat-team-is-reviewing-past-startup-deals-tied-to-chinese-investors-11612094401">the Department of Justice is investigating startups that took money from Chinese investors</a>. The DoJ isn’t taking advantage of some secret database to identify all the investors that are hidden from the general public. They don’t know themselves! From the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Startup investments are exempt from many of the disclosures required from public companies. Last year, Cfius launched a new confidential tip line to help surface deals. In some cases, companies have alerted Cfius to a rival’s connections with foreign investors, said startup executives and lawyers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, VC investment trend data is interesting and key market intelligence, and it might be — at a very high level — directionally right. There are just huge constraints on the ability of market researchers and data companies to comprehensively analyze the market in an accurate way. Everyone tries their best, but the reality is that if startups don’t have to disclose their investor data, there’s literally no other source for the information.</p>

<p>The responsibility lies with all of us to empower this community to unleash their entrepreneurial growth mindset and ensure more people have the opportunity to create a sustainable future for all. I’m calling on my colleagues, our industry, our governments and more to join me in supporting a new wave of developer-led activism and renew efforts to collectively close the skills gap that exists today.</p>
<p>From the COVID-19 pandemic, to climate change, to racial injustice, developers are playing a crucial role in creating new technologies to help people navigate today’s volatile world. Many of these developers are working on social problems on their own time, using open-source software that they can share globally. This work is helping to save lives and going forward, will help millions more.</p>
<p>The international research community acted early to share data and genetic sequences with one another in <a href="https://nextstrain.org/">open-source projects</a> that helped advance our early understanding of coronavirus and how to mobilize efforts to stop it. The ability for researchers to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55388846">track genetic codes</a> around the world in near real-time is crucial to our response.</p>
<p>St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital was able to <a href="https://thenewstack.io/why-covid-19-is-ushering-in-innovation-with-citizen-developers/">digitize its contract signature process</a> in just 10 days during this critical time. A team of four developers hailing from Taiwan, Brazil, Mongolia and India <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/agrolly/">helped farmers</a> navigate climate change by using weather data to make more informed crop management decisions.</p>
<p>From the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1950s and 1960s through the recent rallies supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, people have used passion and protests to shape the conversations that lead to a better future. Now, this rich history of people-powered action has an important new set of tools: The data, software and tech know-how that’s needed to mount a coordinated global and local response to our greatest challenges.</p>
<p>Today’s software developers are akin to civil engineers in the 1940s and 1950s who designed bridges and roads, creating an infrastructure that paved the path for enormous widespread progress.</p>
<p>The open-source code community already collaborates and shares, producing innovations that belong to everyone, focusing on progress over perfection. If a hurricane is about to create havoc in your community, don’t just fill sandbags, hit your keyboard and use open-source technologies to not only help your community, but to scale solutions to help others. <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/droneaid-is-now-open-source/">DroneAID</a>, for example, is an open-source tool that uses visual recognition to detect and count SOS icons on the ground from drones flying overhead, and then automatically plots emergency needs on a map for first responders.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">recent GitHub study </a>shows that open-source project creation is up 25% since April of last year. Developers are signing on to contribute to open-source communities and virtual hackathons during their downtime, using their skills to create a more sustainable world.</p>
<p>In 2018, I helped found <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/">Call for Code</a> with IBM, David Clark Cause and United Nations Human Rights to empower the global developer community, and a big part of our mission was to create the infrastructure needed to shepherd big ideas into real-world deployments. For our part, IBM provides the 24-million-person developer community access to the same technology being used by our enterprise clients, including our open hybrid cloud platform, AI, blockchain and quantum computing.</p>
<p>One winner, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-kq18qV3AE">Prometeo</a>, with a team including a firefighter, nurse and developers, created a system that uses artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things to safeguard firefighters as they battle blazes and has been tested in multiple regions in Spain. We’ve seen developers help teachers share virtual information for homeschooling; measure the carbon footprint impact of consumer purchases; update small businesses with COVID-19 policies; help farmers navigate climate change; and improve the way businesses manage lines amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>This past year, <a href="https://devpost.com/">Devpost</a> partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) and <a href="https://covid-global-hackathon.devpost.com/">challenged developers to create COVID-19 mitigation solutions</a> in categories including health, vulnerable populations and education. The Ford Foundation and Mozilla led <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/introducing-our-10-newest-mozilla-fellows/">a fellowship program</a> to connect technologists, activists, journalists and scientists, and strengthen organizations working at the convergence of technology and social justice. <a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/">The U.S. Digital Response (USDR)</a> connected pro-bono technologists to work with government and organizations responding to crisis.</p>
<p>The most complex global and societal issues can be broken down into smaller solvable tech challenges. But to solve our most complex problems, we need the brains of every country, every class, every gender. The skills-gap crisis is a global phenomenon, making it critical that we equip the next generation of problem solvers with the training and resources they need to turn great ideas into impactful solutions.</p>
<p>This year, we can expect to see a newly energized community of developers working across the boundaries of companies, states and countries to take on some of the world’s biggest problems.</p>
<p>But they can’t do it alone. These developer activists need our support, encouragement and help pinpointing the most crucial problems to address, and they need the tools to bring solutions to every corner of the world.</p>
<p>The true power of technology lies with those who want to change the world for good. To ensure anyone who wants to create change has the tools, resources and skillsets to do so, we must renew our focus on closing the skills gap and addressing deep inequalities in our society.</p>
<p>Our future depends on getting this right.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I have a confession to make: my company fell short of its DEI goal in 2020.</p>
<p>Heading into the year, our goal was to build a workforce that’s 44% women and 14% Underrepresented People (URP). We made some strides, but currently those figures are 43% and 13%, respectively.</p>
<p>Here’s why these goals are important to me: I immigrated to America at 17 with my mother and brother from Nicaragua. I was promised a land where anything is possible with some know-how and hard work. Yet, growing up, I can’t recall ever seeing a business leader, an elected official, or even a school principal who looked like me. There was never a Black Marc Benioff or a Latino Steve Jobs in the press to make that kind of accomplishment feel possible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Things have changed at the very highest levels, beginning with the election of President Obama in 2008, which can’t be understated for its impact on people of color. Now, as a new administration takes power, President Biden is doing something well overdue in building a cabinet that “represents the diversity of our nation.”</p>
<p>His team is highlighted by influential voices from the Black and Latinx communities, including Ambassador to the United Nations nominee Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Department of Homeland Security Secretary nominee Alejandro Mayorkas.</p>
<p>I thought back to how a 17-year-old me would have felt seeing a former refugee steering the future of our country and how differently my worldview might have developed. I became more motivated to double down on our commitment. After all, if the public sector is able to make this commitment, then surely it should be possible for businesses to do the same.</p>
<p>Every business should have a DEI game plan in 2021. Here’s ours:</p>
<h2>Skip the board and tap employees for ideas</h2>
<p>While the board room is becoming a <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/06/18/u-s-board-diversity-trends-in-2019/">more diverse place</a>, ultimately, this isn’t where progress is made. Rather, progress is made when employees feel empowered to combine their skills with their passions.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happened in our company this year.</p>
<p>Watching the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/18/us/coronavirus-Black-owned-small-business.html">outsized impact</a> that the coronavirus pandemic has had on Black-owned businesses, several employees came to us with an idea: they wanted to find a way to use our products to help Black-owned businesses outlast the shutdowns. They started by working with William Murrell, owner of <a href="https://Blackboston.com/">BlackBoston.com</a> to understand his needs–and how we could help him connect with website visitors. By working with William’s network, we became more aware of the barriers that deter Black-owned businesses from adopting technology and created a repeatable process to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>These decisions, and the resulting initiative weren’t made in a boardroom–where so much time is spent determining the path to profitability–but rather among employees that wanted to improve their community and saw a way how.</p>
<p>To make these efforts more commonplace, we’ve hired a diversity-focused recruiter to make sure our teams better reflect our communities. We&#8217;ve also created processes like Balanced Hiring, to help underrepresented groups get to the interview stage and reduce bias in the hiring decision. On the other side of the coin, we also aim to learn from our leavers–so we understand areas for improvement and can help them thrive beyond our company.</p>
<h2>Don’t let remote work hinder expression and belonging</h2>
<p>Right now, people are not working normal hours; they are juggling childcare, remote work and more; for leaders, understanding and relating to that trauma is an essential. To date, we announced that we moved our fiscal year-end to January. This way, our sales and go-to-market teams could spend the holidays recharging with family, rather than scrambling to hit year-end goals.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are empowering and expanding the role of our employee-led Employee Resource Groups (ERG) to create safe spaces for expression among peers. Belonging is essential in any business, and as founders who have often found themselves a token in a boardroom, we know the value in having an outlet for employees to express themselves and encourage the sharing of learnings from individual successes, and mishaps.</p>
<p>These steps alone will not directly improve diversity, but they will go a long way toward building trust.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t stop at race or gender: embrace diverse perspectives</h2>
<p>The final consideration we are making is acknowledging that diversity is not solely inclusive of outward appearance. Rather, diversity of thought and background are critical factors to how teams collaborate to reach a unified goal.</p>
<p>After all, building a <a href="https://qz.com/work/1915278/five-percent-of-coinbase-staff-rejected-its-apolitical-future/">culture</a> where differences aren’t acknowledged only seeks to push minorities further to the outskirts of organizational structure. Part of our focus on DEI will encourage diversity of thought as much as it does ethnic diversity–and hold ourselves accountable to employees that will speak up when it matters.</p>
<p>2020 was a year of trauma, and one where every person was alike in sharing the same fears and anxieties. Thankfully, we have a light at the end of the tunnel with two promising vaccines, and an incoming administration that knows the value in encouraging equal representation across gender and ethnic borders.</p>
<p>Regardless of these positive developments, our focus toward empowering diverse communities must remain steadfast. After all, the systemic issue of low representation of URPs in tech will not be ended because of these efforts alone, but through sustained attention toward addressing the issue and learning each day. We might have missed our mark in 2020, but now we will take the President’s lead and build equity within our offices in 2021, wherever they might be.</p>
<p>I encourage all business owners to make this same commitment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SAFEs have effectively pushed a lot of public signal regarding seed deals, and even smaller rounds, underground.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just over a year ago in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/three-takeaways-from-the-2019-venture-capital-market/">coverage of the 2019 venture capital market</a>,  we noted that &#8220;United States-demarcated angel and seed deals dipped in 2019.&#8221; Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/vc-activity-goes-upside-down-as-seed-deals-fall-and-mega-rounds-rise/">reporting concerning the Q1 2020 venture capital market</a> had a similar tone, noting that &#8220;domestic seed rounds, in slow decline since peaks in 2017, have sharply fallen since Q3 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same theme <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/second-quarter-vc-investing-totals-appear-lackluster/">continued in the second quarter</a>. Widening our lens to global seed data, own we wrote that &#8220;global seed and angel deals [&#8230;] were down from 4,256 rounds in Q2 2019 worth $3.7 billion to 1,791 rounds worth just $2.3 billion in Q2 2020.&#8221;</p>

<hr />
<p>Of course, the second quarter of 2020 was the middle of the storm when it came to the temporary decline in venture capital confidence. So, what about Q3? One source noted, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/late-stage-deals-made-q3-2020-a-standout-vc-quarter-for-us-based-startups/">we wrote at the time</a>, that the &#8220;percentage of U.S. VC deals that were for rounds of $5 million or less was the lowest since at least 2010.&#8221; Another data source showed a slight rebound in domestic seed rounds, but it was a rare positive data point.</p>
<p>Then came Q4 2020 data and a full-year look at the market. We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/in-2020-vcs-invested-428m-into-us-based-startups-every-day">wrote that in</a> &#8220;the U.S., seed deal count was high in 2020, around 5,227,&#8221; per that day&#8217;s data source.</p>
<p>Weird, right?</p>

I&#8217;m not citing individual sources in the above (you can find them at the links) to avoid appearing to be cross with any particular entity; that&#8217;s not my goal.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;m curious how we can have so many different seed data signals in the same year. This is a question I&#8217;ve had for some time, as whenever I&#8217;d report that seed deal volume in any particular part of the world was looking light &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/how-vcs-invested-in-asia-and-europe-in-2020/">Europe, for example</a> &#8212; investors would tell me, in polite tones or with sheer incredulity, that the seed data in question did not match their lived realities.</p>
<p>Investors were seeing a hot seed market, while data often showed a flat-to-down seed market. So, what&#8217;s going on?</p>
<h2>SAFEs could be to blame</h2>
<p>Thanks to angel investor and Twitter bon vivant <a href="https://twitter.com/Trace_Cohen">Trace Cohen</a>, I think we have a good idea of what&#8217;s to blame for discrepant data and reality when it comes to seed and earlier dealmaking. Per Cohen, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1358536771869569030">could SAFEs be to blame</a>?</p>
<p>SAFEs, or <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/"><em>Simple Agreements for Future Equity</em></a>, are a method of raising capital that is quick and cheap. Y Combinator invented them back in 2013, and they&#8217;ve become rather popular amongst seed deals over time.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During a small gathering of journalists in China, Ren Zhengfei made his first public remarks since Joe Biden was inaugurated at the 46th President of the United States. The Huawei CEO struck a hopeful tone for those gathered around the table, in comments reported <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-welcome-phone-call-from-us-president-biden.html">by CNBC among others</a>.</p>
<p>“I would welcome such phone calls and the message is around joint development and shared success,” the executive said, noting a readiness to speak with the new administration in translated remarks. “The U.S. wants to have economic growth and China wants to have economic growth as well.”</p>
<p>Huawei’s future in the U.S. has been a major question mark hanging over the new administration. Under Trump, a number of high profile Chinese companies were added to the Commerce Department’s so-called “entity list” to various effects. Huawei has been among the hardest hit by the moves.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In addition to blocking sales in the world’s third-largest smartphone market, the company has been unable to work with key U.S. companies, including Google. That, in turn, has blocked access to key technologies, including the Android ecosystem and left Huawei scrambling. The company’s support among consumers has increased within China, but the move has been a big blow to the smartphone maker’s bottom line.</p>
<p>The incoming Biden administration has mostly been quiet on the matter. Though, facing mounting criticism from Republican lawmaker, Commerce Secretary nominee Gina Raimondo has since added that, “I currently have no reason to believe that entities on those lists should not be there. If confirmed, I look forward to a briefing on these entities and others of concern.”</p>
<p>While there haven’t been many positive signs for Huawei thus far, the company’s Chief understandably would prefer to make nice with the new administration.</p>
<p>“If Huawei’s production capacity can be expanded, that would mean more opportunities for U.S. companies to supply too,” Ren said in the translated comments. “I believe that’s going to be mutually beneficially. I believe that (the) new administration would bear in mind such business interests as they are about to decide their new policy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://eniac.vc/">Eniac Ventures</a>, a seed firm with a focus on New York startups, is announcing its fifth fund totaling $125 million.</p>
<p>Eniac&#8217;s four general partners — Hadley Harris, Nihal Mehta, Vic Singh and Tim Young — have been making seed investments together for more than a decade, and they&#8217;ve known each other for even longer, having first met at the University of Pennsylvania. Singh described the firm as &#8220;one of the OGs&#8221; in seed investing, while Mehta said, &#8220;Consistency has been our superpower.&#8221;</p>
<p>The size of Eniac&#8217;s funds has grown dramatically over the past decade, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/01/eniac-ventures-launches-1-6-million-seed-fund-to-invest-in-mobile-startups/">its $1.6 million first fund</a> in 2010 to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/13/eniac-ventures-closes-100-million-fund/">its $100 million fourth fund</a> in 2017. However, Mehta said the team approached the latest fund with $125 million as both a goal and a &#8220;hard cap.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The larger funds allow Eniac to make more investments, and to lead rounds as the definition of a seed deal has expanded. (<a href="https://eniacvc.medium.com/a792b07b2da9">The firm says</a> it can invest anywhere from $350,000 to $3 million in a single round.) At the same time, GP Hadley Harris emphasized that Eniac will remain focused on seed deals rather than Series As, and that it wants to remain &#8220;really collaborative, so that we never need to take more than half the round.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eniac&#8217;s general partners usually only two or three investments each per year, which Harris said is &#8220;quite a bit less than average seed fund.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We always want to be the investor of record in the companies that we invest in, leading or co-leading these rounds,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;And we want to have the bandwidth to be partners with them in the early stages of their journey. We think the only way to do that is concentration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eniac&#8217;s <a href="https://eniac.vc/companies/">portfolio</a> now includes more than 120 companies, with 50-plus exits. Recent successes include mobile messaging company Attentive (which <a href="https://www.attentivemobile.com/2020/09/23/attentive-raises-230-million-series-d-investment-led-by-coatue/">raised a $230 million Series D last fall</a>), podcasting startup Anchor (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">acquired by Spotify</a>) and online retailer Boxed (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/boxed-asia-expansion/">recently partnered</a> with one of Asia&#8217;s largest brick-and-mortar companies, Aeon).</p>
<p>While Eniac initially billed itself as a mobile-focused firm, it now invests across software-as-a-service, developer platforms, consumer and deeptech. Harris said they&#8217;re not pointing to any specific industries or trends that they&#8217;re focused on because, &#8220;We want to be balanced between thesis-driven and opportunistic &#8230; The theses that we tend to focus on tend to be on a per-partner basis and change pretty quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The firm is headquartered in New York, with an office in San Francisco. Hadley said New York-based startups remain a priority, while at the same time, &#8220;We also believe that great founders can be anywhere and we&#8217;re more and more interested in distributed teams.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AxNOTXBm3R"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/lunchbox-and-eniac-launch-a-website-for-supporting-local-businesses/">Lunchbox and Eniac launch a website for supporting local businesses</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Singh added that despite the hype around other emerging startup hubs, &#8220;A lot of the founders we partner with in New York are staying in New York. They have not left.&#8221;</p>
<p>They might hire team members elsewhere, he said, but there&#8217;s a high bar for remote employees. And if a startup wants to be fully distributed, &#8220;You have to be fully remote and distributed first. You can’t go distributed later; you have to very intentionally build the organization in that way from the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the team&#8217;s longevity, I noted that it also has a potential downside from a diversity perspective, especially since all four of the founding GPs are men. However, the firm has recently promoted two other team members — Vice President of Finance and Operations Anna Nitschke and Investor Kristin McDonald — who Singh noted &#8220;votes on deals with us&#8221; and &#8220;feels as if she has an equal say in how the firm is run.&#8221; And the firm plans to hire <a href="https://eniacvc.medium.com/a792b07b2da9">six new team members</a> this year.</p>
<p>If you want to hear more from the firm&#8217;s partners, I&#8217;ll be <a href="https://superpeer.com/eniac/event/eniac-extras-5-big-news-from-eniac">interviewing them on Superpeer</a> (another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/superpeer-funding/">recent Eniac investment</a>) tomorrow, February 10, at 2:30pm Eastern.</p>

<p>Founded by Carolyn Mooney and Ryan O’Neil, nextmv simplifies the process of optimizing and testing logistics-focused decision models. Consider a company like GrubHub, where the duo worked previously. GrubHub has to weigh a wide variety of priorities each time an order comes through on the platform, from speed of delivery to mileage on the drivers&#8217; cars to overall efficiency.</p>
<p>It takes an immense amount of resources, and personnel talent, to optimize the algorithm running those platforms based on the company&#8217;s key performance indicators, or KPIs. And if those KPIs change, or tweaks to the algorithm need to be made, it takes even more resources to test those modifications.</p>
<p>And you would need a simulated environment to test the changes, something that nextmv has provided since its launch.</p>
<p>On the heels of this latest round, nextmv is working to simplify its product. The company has launched nextmv Cloud to allow developers, not just operations researchers, to use its software. nextmv Cloud has quick start models in the routing and delivery space to allow developers to automate decision-making, with plans to launch into new verticals in the coming months.</p>
<p>Before nextmv, it could take an entire team of operations researchers to optimize decision-making models and simulate test environments. When nextmv launched, a team still needed to have at least one operations researcher to use the product. Now, developers can hop on the platform and get started.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are hundreds of thousands of operations researchers, like my cofounder, out there that are trying to solve these problems in a research capacity or in very specialized groups within companies,&#8221; said Mooney. &#8220;But there are millions of developers out there. Why can&#8217;t this be a superpower that every developer has in their pocket. It&#8217;s the same way that Twilio made it so that every every engineer could be a messaging engineer.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110733" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110733" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2110733" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/nextmv-cloud-fleet-model-demo-11.gif?w=680" alt="nextmv" width="680" height="342" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110733" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> nextmv</p></div></p>
<p>A good chunk of the funding is going toward building out that Cloud platform to productize and distribute the nextmv technology and increase accessibility, but the company is also using funding to ramp up a content arm to help users explore the software.</p>
<p>Eventually, nextmv wants to build out a community arm of the platform, letting developers show each other how they&#8217;re automating decisions, not unlike Figma Community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shopify announced this morning it&#8217;s partnered with Facebook to expand its payment option, <a href="https://shop.app/what-shop-does">Shop Pay</a>, to all Shopify merchants selling across both Facebook and Instagram. This is the first time Shop Pay will be made available outside of Shopify&#8217;s own platform, and represents a significant expansion for the e-commerce platform&#8217;s payments technology.</p>
<p>The company tells TechCrunch Shop Pay will first become available to all Shopify merchants using checkout on Instagram in the U.S., and will then be rolled out to Facebook in the weeks that follow.</p>
<p>Prior to this launch, Facebook&#8217;s platform has been one of Shopify&#8217;s most popular sales and marketing channels for merchants, Shopify says. At the beginning of the pandemic last year (March through April 2020), marketing on Facebook and Instagram via Shopify&#8217;s channel integration saw 36% growth in monthly active users, and that trend continues to rise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today, Shop Pay&#8217;s payment option is used by a number of top direct-to-consumer and newer brands, including Allbirds, Kith, Beyond Yoga, Kylie Cosmetics, Jonathan Adler, Loeffler Randall, Blueland and others. <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/shop-pay-checkout">Over 40 million buyers</a> now regularly use Shop Pay at these merchants and others on Shopify&#8217;s platform to complete their purchases.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110742" style="width: 411px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110742" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2110742" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?w=401" alt="" width="401" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg 872w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?resize=88,150 88w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?resize=768,1302 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?resize=401,680 401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.51.50-AM.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110742" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shopify</p></div></p>
<p>Through the course of 2020, Shop Pay helped buyers complete 137 million orders. And by the end of the year, Shop Pay had facilitated nearly $20 billion in cumulative GMV since its launch in 2017. Through its <a href="https://shop.app/carbon-offsetting">carbon offsetting feature</a>, this also represented 75,000 tons of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>In addition to the carbon offsets, Shopify claims Shop Pay on its own platform is 70% faster with a conversion rate that&#8217;s 1.72x higher than a typical checkout. It also includes order tracking and management, which, to date, have tracked over 430 million orders across over 450 million miles.</p>
<p>Once available on Instagram, consumers will be able to find tagged products from Shopify merchants in the app, then add them to their in-app cart. At checkout, they can then select Shop Pay as their preferred payment option from among credit card, debit card, and PayPal. The consumer will receive a confirmation code to their phone, then enter the code to complete the order without leaving Instagram. A similar experience will be available on Facebook.</p>
<p>These orders can also be tracked via Shopify&#8217;s Shop app, the same as those processed on Shopify itself.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110743" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110743" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2110743" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?w=392" alt="" width="392" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg 858w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?resize=768,1334 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?resize=392,680 392w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-09-at-9.52.07-AM.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110743" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shopify</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;People are embracing social platforms not only for connection, but for commerce,&#8221; said Carl Rivera, General Manager of Shop, in a statement. &#8220;Making Shop Pay available outside of Shopify for the first time means even more shoppers can use the fastest and best checkout on the Internet. And there’s more to come; we’ll continue to work with Facebook to bring a number of Shopify services and products to these platforms to make social selling so much better.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not the first third-party payment option integrated into Facebook&#8217;s shopping platforms, as PayPal is also accepted. But it is a notable addition, given how heavily Facebook has pushed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/facebook-shops/">own &#8220;shops&#8221; platform</a>, which encourages merchants to sell and transact within its own apps &#8212; an even more critical source of revenue now that Apple&#8217;s privacy changes will<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/01/22/apple-privacy-change-may-cost-facebook-google-25-billion-over-next-12-months/?sh=2c874eaa5695"> impact Facebook&#8217;s ads business</a> to the tune of billions of dollars. But likely, working with a third-party like Shopify is allowing the company to spin up a new revenue stream.</p>
<p>Shopify, however, declined to discuss its financial arrangement with Facebook.</p>
<p>Shopify isn&#8217;t limiting itself to Facebook in an effort to expand its e-commerce business. Last fall, it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">partnered</a> with TikTok on social commerce, allowing merchants to publish their marketing ads directly to the video platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/">Monte Carlo</a>, a startup focused on helping other companies better monitor their data inflows, announced that it has closed a $25 million Series B.</p>
<p>The round, which was co-led by <a href="https://www.ggvc.com/">GGV</a> and <a href="https://www.redpoint.com/">Redpoint</a>, comes mere months after its <a href="https://www.montecarlodata.com/monte-carlo-raises-16m-to-build-the-worlds-first-data-reliability-platform/">September Series A that was worth $15 million</a>. <a href="https://accel.com/">Accel</a> led the company&#8217;s Series A and Seed deals, participating in its Series B as well.</p>
<p>The round caught our attention not only for the speed at which it was raised following Monte Carlo&#8217;s preceding investment, but also because your humble servant had no idea what data observability, the startup&#8217;s niche, really was.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So we got Monte Carlo co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/bm_datadowntime?lang=en">Barr Moses</a> on a call to explain both her company&#8217;s space, and how it managed to attract so much more capital so quickly.</p>
<h2>Data inflows</h2>
<p>Big data was the jam a while back, but it turned out to be merely one piece in the broader data puzzle. We can see evidence of that in recent revenue growth at Databricks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">which reached $425 million ARR</a> in 2020 by building an analytics and AI service that sits on top of companies&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Monte Carlo is another bet on the data space, sitting a bit earlier in the data lifecycle. Think of it this way: Snowflake can hold all your data, and Databricks can help you analyze it. But what&#8217;s checking to make sure that data flowing <em>into</em> your repositories is, you know, not bullshit?</p>
<p>Figuring out if data inflows are healthy and not bunk is what Monte Carlo does.</p>
<p>According to Moses, companies now have myriad data sources. That&#8217;s great in theory as more data is usually a good thing. But if one or two of those sources goes haywire, figuring that out before you collect, store, and analyze the bad information is pretty important.</p>
<p>So Monte Carlo sits upstream from the other data companies that are hot these days, keeping tabs on inbound data sources across a number of parameters to make sure that what&#8217;s actually arriving in your data lake is legit.</p>
<p>The startup does that, Moses said, by checking data freshness (how recent, or tardy the data in question is), volume (is there too little, too much?), schema (the data&#8217;s structure itself, to see if things have changed that could matter, or break downstream services), distribution (if data points suddenly jump from say, the single digits to the millions), and lineage, which can help find breakpoints in data inflows.</p>
<p>Hearing that Monte Carlo learns from a company&#8217;s particular data pipes to figure out what could be non-standard data inflow made me curious how long it takes to get the startup&#8217;s software set up and running; not long, per Barr, an hour to fire it up in many cases, and a week to learn.</p>
<h2>A growing sector</h2>
<p>Monte Carlo&#8217;s product is neat enough to warrant our attention by itself. But, fitting neatly inside the growth of the broader data space, and especially data tooling that isn&#8217;t directly concerning storage, makes it all the more worth considering.</p>
<p>And now with $25 million more, Monte Carlo can expand its current staff of 25, and keep attacking its mid-market and enterprise customer target. Let&#8217;s see how quickly it can scale, and how soon we can start squeezing the startup for growth numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Polish video game maker CD Projekt, which makes <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>The Witcher</em>, has confirmed it was hit by a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>In a statement posted <a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660">to its Twitter account</a>, the company said it will &#8220;not give in nor negotiate&#8221; with the hackers, saying it has backups in place. &#8220;We have already secured our IT infrastructure and begun restoring data,&#8221; the company <a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1359048125403590660">said</a>.</p>
<p>According to the ransom note, the hackers said they would release the company&#8217;s stolen source code and other internal files if it did not pay the ransom, since the company would &#8220;most likely recover from backups.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the company said for now that no personal data was taken. &#8220;We are still investigating the incident, however at this time we can confirm that — to our best knowledge — the compromised systems did not contain any personal data of our players or users of our services.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/maze-ransomware-group-shutting-down/">an increasingly hostile tactic</a> used by ransomware actors: Hackers target high-value businesses and companies with file-encrypting malware and hold the files for a ransom. But since many companies have backups, some ransomware groups threaten to publish the stolen files unless the ransom is paid.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red did not immediately respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s questions, including what kind of ransomware was used to attack its systems.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s thought to be the second time in recent years that the company has been hit by ransomware. The game maker <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywz3ny/witcher-developer-says-hackers-have-compromised-its-next-big-game">confirmed in 2017</a> that a hack resulted in the compromising of early work related to the <em>Cyberpunk 2077. </em>Weeks following the game&#8217;s launch Sony and Microsoft offered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/sony-pulls-cyberpunk-2077-from-playstation-store-after-bugs-complaints-offers-refund/">gamers refunds</a>, citing bugs and poor performance on older consoles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the original startups that set out to create a low-Earth orbit satellite constellation to provide a data network here on Earth is now open for business: <a href="https://swarm.space">Swarm</a>, which now operates 81 of its sandwich-sized satellites on orbit, announced today that its network service is live and available to commercial customers.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 by CEO Sara Spangelo and CTO Ben Longmier, Swarm has accomplished a lot in a relatively short time, culminating in its recent launch of 36 of its smalll satellites during SpaceX&#8217;s first ride-sharing rocket launch late last month. Now that those are all online and operational, Swarm is able to provide full global network coverage, with the ability to check in with connected devices on its network up to multiple times per day.</p>
<p>Swarm&#8217;s offering uses embedded modems also designed and built by the company – the Swarm Tile, a tiny, low-powered modem that&#8217;s designed for maximum compatibility. The network is low-power and low-bandwidth, meaning it&#8217;s ideally suited for situations that require relatively low amounts of data transfer, but on a regular frequency over very long durations. That describes a wide range of use cases, including in shipping in logistics, agriculture, and other Internet of Things (IoT ) deployments. The breadth of their customer base has actually been a surprise, and far outstripped the early vision for the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We actually started with the containership use case [&#8230;] we talked a lot about how many containers there are in the world, how many ship there are in the world,&#8221; Spangelo told me in an interview. &#8220;We also knew that logistics, trucks, and agriculture would probably be interesting markets. But I&#8217;m frankly surprised not only how many verticals, this applies to – there&#8217;s a lot more in ag and global development and maritime than I probably ever anticipated – but also just the number of use cases within those industries.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110669" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110669" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2110669" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg" alt="Swarm's sandwich-sized IoT network satellites." width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Swarm-Satellites.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110669" class="wp-caption-text">Swarm&#8217;s sandwich-sized IoT network satellites.</p></div></p>
<p>Spangelo is referring to the depth of the need for monitoring across the industries Swarm serves. So a client in green power wouldn&#8217;t want to just monitor the amount of power being generated by their turbines, but also to monitor the grid for power outgoing and power inbound. And in agriculture, industrial farms might want to monitor soil moisture levels, but also integrate Swarm connectivity in every single truck and tractor in operation in order to monitor their assets and their location. She also told me that vertically, she was surprised to discover just how many opportunities exist for low-bandwidth networks in construction, mining and in defense.</p>
<p>Swarm&#8217;s focus at this stage is strictly commercial, but Spangelo said that people have even approached the company to see if they can purchase a Swarm Tile and use it with an app with their phone for providing basic emergency connectivity while hiking. She says &#8220;they&#8217;re not quite&#8221; at the point where they have a commercially available product for consumers, but it&#8217;s an idea they&#8217;re working on.</p>
<p>One key aspect of Swarm&#8217;s business model is affordability: Its service is available for just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/swarm-prices-out-its-orbital-iot-networks-hardware-and-services/">$5 per month per connected device (with a one-time cost of $119 for each Swarm Tile itself)</a>, which is far below any other satellite service available today. Spangelo says that has meant they are seeing new customers not only in the form of switchers from other satellite network providers, but also from businesses entirely new to satellite connectivity – and for some of those, it&#8217;s changing what&#8217;s possible at a fundamental level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take wineries – it&#8217;s a high-yield type of crop,&#8221; she said. &#8220;People want to monitor very accurately the moisture and soil. Traditionally, they&#8217;ve only been able to do that within cell range. So think of like Sonoma and Napa, cell connectivity is actually is really bad, because of the rolling hills. So now with Swarm you can have connectivity in those regions outside of cell, and provide that value, and much better knowledge and user data analytics to make much more informed business decisions, save water, save energy, save all those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of these new use cases include projects like more finite weather and climate monitor to try to assist with efforts to control and contain wildfires, as well as providing detailed tracking of the cold storage chain required to safely and effectively transport COVID-19 vaccines. Spangelo says this is one of the most exciting aspects of Swarm reaching this commercialization stage – seeing what new opportunities are possible that just couldn&#8217;t be done before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Discovery and research of new molecular compounds is an expensive business, with development costs <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060115/how-much-drug-companys-spending-allocated-research-and-development-average.asp">exceeding $10 billion per substance</a> in some cases. Part of that comes from the need to closely examine every relevant molecule, studying its chemical composition and interactions as well as its physical structure at the atomic level. Despite advances in software to help model these compounds and molecules, there are still challenges in fully understanding their shapes through a two-dimensional computer screen.</p>
<p>San Diego-based startup <a href="https://nanome.ai/">Nanome uses virtual reality to solve that problem</a>. The idea for Nanome came out of CEO and Founder Steve McCloskey’s time in the nanoengineering program at UC San Diego, where he saw a need for a better understanding of three-dimensional molecular structures.</p>
<p>“Understanding structure empowers our users to understand how their designs function,” he wrote in an email. “Yet, the R&amp;D process for drug discovery relies on 2D monitors, keyboard, and mouse, which limits the understanding of complex 3D structures or interactions and contributes to massive R&amp;D costs averaging $2.5B per drug.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nanome recently closed a funding round led by <a href="https://www.bullpencap.com/">Bullpen Capital</a> for $3 million to establish new business partnerships, build up the company’s brand, and expand their science and engineering team. “Nanome is reimagining the way we interact with science at a time when innovation in collaboration is more important than ever before,” said Bullpen Capital General Partner Ann Lai in a press release. <a href="https://formic.vc/">Formic Ventures</a>, led by Oculus co-founder Michael Antonov, also took part in the round.</p>

<p>McCloskey thinks that Nanome’s platform has become even more relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic, as researchers might be forced to work remotely on occasion, limiting their access to in-lab technology and software.</p>
<p>“Nanome helps scientists get on the same page quicker,” he wrote in an email. “Traditionally scientists working with molecules use screenshots or screen sharing, and rely on the mouse cursor and Zoom to communicate their insights and ask for feedback from other team members.” Nanome streamlines this process by bringing researchers to the same virtual reality space to work on molecule development together.</p>
<p>So far, Nanome has worked largely on projects with companies in the food and beverage industry, as well as another to develop more sustainable batteries. But they have plans to use this new funding to expand into pharmaceutical chemistry, synthetic biology, and even education. Their next product update will feature what McCloskey calls &#8216;Spatial Recording,&#8217; that will allow users to record their work for later review – basically a screen recording but with a VR experience. “This is not only an amazing feature for asynchronous collaboration among researchers, it is also useful for producing lectures and lessons,” he wrote in an email.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Emergency response services have been one of the unsung heroes of the last chaotic year, providing essential and urgent medical and other assistance during a period that has faced not just the usual run of natural and man-made disasters, but a global health pandemic to boot.</p>
<p>Today, a startup that is building tools to make it easier for emergency response teams to do their jobs by providing them with more immediate data about callers and their circumstances, is announcing a big round of funding as it continues to grow.</p>
<p><a href="http://rapidsos.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RapidSOS</a>, which has built a data platform for emergency response services, has closed a Series C of $85 million, money that it will be using to build in more integrations to provide its customers with better and bigger data sets, and to continue expanding its operations after providing data to assist in addressing some 150 million emergencies in 2020 &#8212; which works out to some 400,000 emergencies per day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These included not just responses to sudden downturns for Covid-19-stricken people, but also natural disasters and helping in related situations when other problems arose. For example, RapidSOS stepped in to provide data when the Nashville bombing took out a portion of 911 infrastructure on Christmas Day, affecting 300 agencies.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Insight, with other unnamed investors participating. Valuation is not being disclosed, CEO and co-founder Michael Martin said, but it has now raised $200 million.</p>
<p>The round comes also on the heels of the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/rapidsos-raises-21m-to-continue-expanding-its-data-platform-for-first-responders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raising $21 million</a> just in June of last year.</p>
<p>Founded in New York, RapidSOS has expanded in the last year to operations in Mexico, where it now covers some 70% of consumers working alongside first responders and partnerships with Google and Uber (which provide location and ride sharing data).</p>
<p>To add to that, today it is formally opening for business in the U.K., in partnership with MedicAlert, which has been working with the company quietly in the past year.</p>
<p>The opportunity it&#8217;s tackling in the U.K. is similar to what RapidSOS identified and built on in the U.S.</p>
<p>As in RapidSOS&#8217;s home country, the average U.K. home has 9 connected devices &#8212; from smartphones, smart watches and smart speakers, through to smart locks, alarm systems and more &#8212; and the idea will be to bring more of the data that these amass about a user&#8217;s location, medical statistics, and other data to provide a basic level of data so that when people call 999 (the U.K.&#8217;s equivalent of 911) for an urgent service, the conversation can quickly progress to finer details in what is a very fragmented market for emergency information.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally, you are going from a world where 911 didn’t even know your name, so giving responders a name or location can shave critical seconds off response times,&#8221; said Martin.</p>
<p>In the U.S., RapidSOS now works with over 4,800 emergency communications centers, which together cover some 92% of the population, integrating with whatever software those centers happen to use to manage their services. (Case in point: we covered one of RapidSOS&#8217;s partners recently, Carbyne, which itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/carbyne-raises-25m-for-a-next-generation-platform-to-improve-emergency-911-responses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised $25 million last month</a>.)</p>
<p>On the other end of its ingestion engine, the startup&#8217;s platform currently brings in and consolidates data from some 350 million connected devices.</p>
<p>Martin likes to compare the challenge that RapidSOS is setting out to tackle to that of an hour glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ere are now close to 20 billion devices out there with critical information, and at the bottom is advanced software systems to work with that, but between is the 1960s voice infrastructure,&#8221; he said, holding up a giant blue sand hourglass in our video call. &#8220;So the challenge is to get between one and the other, but also to be able to get on the phone with someone in need and have a coherent conversation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">His startup sits where the sand normally gets squeezed, and essentially provides an avenue not just to expand that opening but theoretically organise the sand to run through it in a more orderly way.</span></p>
<p>Indeed, the company is doing more than just connecting providers with data: it&#8217;s also trying to build a platform to make it easier for more of the companies holding data to contribute it in a more effective and useful way &#8212; a need that arose, Martin said, in the last year as companies approached RapidSOS asking how they could help.</p>
<p>That led to the startup working with the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross and Direct Relief, to launch the <a href="http://emergencyprofile.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergency Health Profile</a>, which will allow people (starting in the U.S.) to opt into sharing more background health information to first responders by creating a profile associated with a person’s mobile number.</p>
<p>This complement&#8217;s RapidSOS’s existing business model and sources of real-time diagnostic data, with the aim to provide a more complete picture of a person and his or her problems. As we have said before, this is something of a Holy Grail in the medical world: it provides obvious benefits but also many challenges in terms of data protection and privacy longer term, one of the reasons why it has remained so elusive &#8212; and may indeed pose a challenge to RapidSOS and its partners in the longer term.</p>
<p>That, however, is the kind of problem that precisely can be attacked (if not necessarily completely vanquished) by technology, one reason why VCs have been knocking.</p>
<p>“Insight has a history of backing category-defining companies, and RapidSOS has all the makings of one in the emergency response space,” said Nikitas Koutoupes, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “We are excited to have our team of software ScaleUp and platform experts help drive RapidSOS’ mission.”</p>
