Back then, the company expected to debut the car sometime last year. 2020 came and went without Tesla sharing much information on the supercar. Then, at the start of the year, Musk said production on the Roadster <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-roadster-delayed-until-2022-091648834.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">would start in 2022</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.panoramaed.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panorama Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has built out a K-12 education software platform, has raised $60 million in a Series C round of funding led by General Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing backers Owl Ventures, Emerson Collective, Uncork Capital, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Tao Capital Partners also participated in the financing, which brings the Boston-based company’s total raised since its 2012 inception to $105 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panorama declined to reveal at what valuation the Series C was raised, nor did it provide any specific financial growth metrics. CEO and co-founder Aaron Feuer did say the company now serves 13 million students in 23,000 schools across the United States, which means that 25% of American students are enrolled in a district served by Panorama today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50 of the largest 100 school districts and state agencies in the country use its platform. In total, more than 1,500 school districts are among its customers. Clients include the New York City Department of Education, Clark County School District in Nevada, Dallas ISD in Texas and the Hawaii Department of Education, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since March 2020, Panorama has added 700 school districts to its customer base, nearly doubling the 800 it served just 18 months prior, according to Feuer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just what does Panorama do exactly? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the SaaS business surveys students, parents and teachers to collect actionable data. Former Yale graduate students Feuer and Xan Tanner started the company in an effort to figure out the best way for schools to collect and understand feedback from their students.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Panorama Raises $12 Million To Help Schools Understand Their Students&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/04/panorama-raises-12-million-to-help-schools-understand-their-students/embed/#?secret=zk1a4GvtEq" data-secret="zk1a4GvtEq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the COVID-19 pandemic leading to many students attending school virtually, the need to address students’ social and emotional needs has probably never been more paramount. Many children and teenagers have suffered depression and anxiety due to being isolated from their peers, and some believe the impact on their mental health has been even greater than any negative academic repercussions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students, for example, are asked questions to determine how safe they feel at school, how much they trust their teachers and how much potential they think they have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We help schools survey students, teachers and parents to understand the environment and experiences of the school,” Feuer told TechCrunch. “And then we help schools measure social and emotional development so that in the same way you might have rigorous data on math, you can now get information about social emotional learning and well-being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past year, for example, 25 million people across the country have taken a Panorama survey, which has resulted in quite a bit of information. The company is able to integrate with all of a district’s existing data systems so that it can pull together a “panorama” of its data, plus the information about a student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s really powerful because a teacher can then log in and see everything about a student in one place,” Feuer said. “But most importantly, we give teachers the tools to plan actions for a student.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that by using its software, districts can see benefits such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">improved graduation rates, fewer behavior referrals, more time engaged in learning and students building “stronger supportive relationships with adults and peers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Panorama plans to use its new capital toward continued product development, further deepening its district partnerships and naturally, toward hiring. Panorama currently has about 250 employees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Panorama had not raised capital in a couple of years simply because, according to Feuer, it did not need the money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We met General Atlantic and realized the opportunity to reach the next level of impact for our schools,” he told TechCrunch. “But it was important to me that we didn’t need to raise the money. We chose to because we want to be able to invest in the business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanzeen Syed, managing director at General Atlantic, said edtech has been an important area of focus for this firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">looked at the U.S. education system, we thought that there was a massive opportunity and that we&#8217;re in the very early innings of using software and technology to really enhance the student experience,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to Panorama, he believes “it’s not just a business” for the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They truly and deeply care about providing students and administrators with the tools to make the student experience better,” Syed told TechCrunch. “And they&#8217;re maniacally focused on developing the sort of product to allow them to do that. In addition to that, we spoke with a lot of schools and districts and the feedback came back consistently positive.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Their newest collaboration is the Box app for Zoom, a new type of in-product integration that allows users to bring apps into a Zoom meeting to provide the full Box experience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the past 18 months is any indication, the nature of the workplace is changing. And while Box and Zoom already have integrations together, it makes sense for them to continue to work more closely.</p>
<p>Their newest collaboration is the Box app for Zoom, a new type of in-product integration that allows users to bring apps into a Zoom meeting to provide the full Box experience.</p>
<p>While in Zoom, users can securely and directly access Box to browse, preview and share files from Zoom — even if they are not taking part in an active meeting. This new feature follows a Zoom integration Box launched last year with its “Recommended Apps” section that enables access to Zoom from Box so that workflows aren’t disrupted.</p>
<p>The companies’ chief product officers, Diego Dugatkin with Box and Oded Gal with Zoom, discussed with TechCrunch why seamless partnerships like these are a solution for the changing workplace.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sKjtHwnfzQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/the-zoom-five9-deal-is-a-big-bet-for-the-video-conferencing-company/">The Zoom-Five9 deal is a big bet for the video conferencing company</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Zoom-Five9 deal is a big bet for the video conferencing company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/the-zoom-five9-deal-is-a-big-bet-for-the-video-conferencing-company/embed/#?secret=sKjtHwnfzQ" data-secret="sKjtHwnfzQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With digitization happening everywhere, an integration of “best-in-breed” products for collaboration is essential, Dugatkin said. Not only that, people don’t want to be moving from app to app, instead wanting to stay in one environment.</p>
<p>“It’s access to content while never having to leave the Zoom platform,” he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s also access to content and contacts in different situations. When everyone was in an office, meeting at a moment’s notice internally was not a challenge. Now, more people are understanding the value of flexibility, and both Gal and Dugatkin expect that spending some time at home and some time in the office will not change anytime soon.</p>
<p>As a result, across the spectrum of a company, there is an increasing need for allowing and even empowering people to work from anywhere, Dugatkin said. That then leads to a conversation about sharing documents in a secure way for companies, which this collaboration enables.</p>
<p>The new Box and Zoom integration enables meeting in a hybrid workplace: chat, video, audio, computers or mobile devices, and also being able to access content from all of those methods, Gal said.</p>
<p>“Companies need to be dynamic as people make the decision of how they want to work,” he added. “The digital world is providing that flexibility.”</p>
<p>This long-term partnership is just scratching the surface of the continuous improvement the companies have planned, Dugatkin said.</p>
<p>Dugatkin and Gal expect to continue offering seamless integration before, during and after meetings: utilizing Box’s cloud storage, while also offering the ability for offline communication between people so that they can keep the workflow going.</p>
<p>“As Diego said about digitization, we are seeing continuous collaboration enhanced with the communication aspect of meetings day in and day out,” Gal added. “Being able to connect between asynchronous and synchronous with Zoom is addressing the future of work and how it is shaping where we go in the future.”</p>

(The newsletter will go out Saturday as always.) Also, Alex is off next week. Anna is taking on next week’s newsletter and may have a column or two on deck as well.</p>
<p>But before we slow down for a few days, let’s chat about the most recent Y Combinator Demo Day in thematic detail.</p>
<p>If you caught the last few <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity episodes</a>, some of this will be familiar, but we wanted to put a flag in the ground for later reference as we cover startups for the rest of the year.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>

<p>What follows is a roundup of trends among Y Combinator startups and how they squared with our expectations.</p>

<p>In a group of nearly 400 startups, you might think it&#8217;d be hard to find a category that felt overrepresented, but we’ve managed.</p>
<p>To start, we were surprised by the sheer number of startups in the cohort that were pursuing software models that incorporated no-code and low-code techniques. We expected some, surely, but not the nearly 20 that we compiled this morning.</p>
<p>Startups in the YC batch are building no-code and low-code tools to help developers build faster internal workflows (<a href="https://www.tantl.com/">Tantl</a>), build branded real estate portals (<a href="https://noloco.io">Noloco</a>), sync data between other no-code tools (<a href="https://www.whalesync.com">Whalesync</a>), automate HR (<a href="https://zazos.com/en">Zazos</a>), and more. Also in the mix were <a href="https://hello.brightreps.com/">BrightReps</a>, <a href="https://beau.to">Beau</a>, <a href="https://getalchemy.app/">Alchemy</a>, <a href="https://hyperseed.com">Hyperseed</a>, <a href="https://enso.org">Enso</a>, <a href="https://www.hitpayapp.com/">HitPay</a>, <a href="https://whaly.io/">Whaly</a>, <a href="https://www.muse.place/">Muse</a>, Abstra, <a href="https://www.getlago.com/">Lago</a>, <a href="https://www.inai.io/">Inai</a> and <a href="http://www.breadcrumbs.io/">Breadcrumbs.io</a>.</p>
<p>At least 18 companies in the group name-dropped no- and low-code in their pitches. They are taking on a host of industries, from finance and real estate to sales and HR. In short, no- and low-code tools are cropping up in what feels like every sector. It appears that the startup world has decided that helping non-developers build their own tools, workflows and apps is a trend here to stay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://explosion.ai/">Explosion</a>, a company that has combined an open source machine learning library with a set of commercial developer tools, announced a $6 million Series A today on a $120 million valuation. The round was led by SignalFire, and the company reported that today&#8217;s investment represents 5% of its value.</p>
<p>Oana Olteanu from SignalFire will be joining the board under the terms of the deal, which includes warrants of $12 million in additional investment at the same price.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, Explosion is a software company and we build developer tools for AI and machine learning and natural language processing. So our goal is to make developers more productive and more focused on their natural language processing, so basically understanding large volumes of text, and training machine learning models to help with that and automate some processes,&#8221; company co-founder and CEO Ines Montani told me.</p>
<p>The company started in 2016 when Montani met her co-founder, Matthew Honnibal in Berlin where he was working on the <a href="http://spaCy.io">spaCy</a> open source machine learning library. Since then, that open source project has been downloaded over 40 million times.</p>
<p>In 2017, they added <a href="https://prodi.gy/">Prodigy</a>, a commercial product for generating data for the machine learning model. &#8220;Machine learning is code plus data, so to really get the most out of the technologies you almost always want to train your models and build custom systems because what&#8217;s really most valuable are problems that are super specific to you and your business and what you&#8217;re trying to find out, and so we saw that the area of creating training data, training these machine learning models, was something that people didn&#8217;t pay very much attention to at all,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The next step is a product called Prodigy Teams, which is a big reason the company is taking on this investment. &#8220;Prodigy Teams  is [a hosted service that] adds user management and collaboration features to Prodigy, and you can run it in the cloud without compromising on what people love most about Prodigy, which is the data privacy, so no data ever needs to get seen by our servers,&#8221; she said. They do this by letting the data sit on the customer&#8217;s private cluster in a private cloud, and then use Prodigy Team&#8217;s management features in the public cloud service.</p>
<p>Today, they have 500 companies using Prodigy including Microsoft and Bayer in addition to the huge community of millions of open source users. They&#8217;ve built all this with just 6 early employees, a number that has grown to 17 recently and they hope to reach 20 by year&#8217;s end.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She believes if you&#8217;re thinking too much about diversity in your hiring process, you probably have a problem already. &#8220;If you go into hiring and you&#8217;re thinking like, oh, how can I make sure that the way I&#8217;m hiring is diverse, I think that already shows that there&#8217;s maybe a problem,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a company, and it&#8217;s 50 dudes in their 20s, it&#8217;s not surprising that you might have problems attracting people who are not white dudes in their 20s. But in our case, our strategy is to hire good people and good people are often very diverse people, and again if you play by the [startup] playbook, you could be limited in a lot of other ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said that they have never seen themselves as a traditional startup following some conventional playbook. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t raise any investment money [until now]. We grew the team organically, and we focused on being profitable and independent [before we got outside investment],&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But more than the money, Montani says that they needed to find an investor that would understand and support the open source side of the business, even while they got capital to expand all parts of the company. &#8220;Open source is a community of users, customers and employees. They are real people, and [they are not] pawns in [some] startup game, and it&#8217;s not a game. It&#8217;s real, and these are real people,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They deserve more than just my eyeballs and grand promises. [&#8230;] And so it&#8217;s very important that even if we&#8217;re selling a small stake in our company for some capital [to build our next] product [that open source remains at] the core of our company and that&#8217;s something we don&#8217;t want to compromise on,&#8221; Montani said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Federal Trade Commission has unanimously voted to ban the spyware maker SpyFone and its chief executive Scott Zuckerman from the surveillance industry, the first order of its kind, after the agency accused the company of harvesting mobile data on thousands of people and leaving it on the open internet.</p>
<p>The agency said SpyFone &#8220;secretly harvested and shared data on people’s physical movements, phone use, and online activities through a hidden device hack,&#8221; allowing the spyware purchaser to &#8220;see the device’s live location and view the device user’s emails and video chats.&#8221;</p>
<p>SpyFone is one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">many so-called &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; apps</a> that are marketed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/stalkerware-apps-google-ads/">under the guise of parental control</a> but are often used by spouses to spy on their partners. The spyware works by being surreptitiously installed on someone&#8217;s phone, often without their permission, to steal their messages, photos, web browsing history, and real-time location data. The FTC also charged that the spyware maker exposed victims to additional security risks because the spyware runs at the &#8220;root&#8221; level of the phone, which allows the spyware to access off-limits parts of the device&#8217;s operating system. A premium version of the app included a keylogger and &#8220;live screen viewing,&#8221; the FTC says.</p>
<p>But the FTC said that SpyFone&#8217;s &#8220;lack of basic security&#8221; exposed those victims&#8217; data, because of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kmj4v/spyware-company-spyfone-terabytes-data-exposed-online-leak">an unsecured Amazon cloud storage server</a> that was spilling the data its spyware was collecting from more than 2,000 victims&#8217; phones. SpyFone said it partnered with a cybersecurity firm and law enforcement to investigate, but the FTC says it never did.</p>
<p>Practically, the ban means SpyFone and its CEO Zuckerman are banned from &#8220;offering, promoting, selling, or advertising any surveillance app, service, or business,&#8221; making it harder for the company to operate. But FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a separate statement that stalkerware makers should also face criminal sanctions under U.S. computer hacking and wiretap laws.</p>
<p>The FTC has also ordered the company to delete all the data it &#8220;illegally&#8221; collected, and, also for the first time, notify victims that the app had been secretly installed on their devices.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/09/ftc-bans-spyfone-and-ceo-from-surveillance-business">a statement</a>, the FTC&#8217;s consumer protection chief Samuel Levine said: &#8220;This case is an important reminder that surveillance-based businesses pose a significant threat to our safety and security.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EFF, which launched the Coalition Against Stalkerware two years ago, a coalition of companies that detects, combats and raises awareness of stalkerware, praised the FTC&#8217;s order. &#8220;With the FTC now turning its focus to this industry, victims of stalkerware can begin to find solace in the fact that regulators are beginning to take their concerns seriously,&#8221; said EFF&#8217;s Eva Galperin and Bill Budington in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/victory-federal-trade-commission-bans-stalkerware-company-conducting-business">a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>This is the FTC&#8217;s second order against a stalkerware maker. In 2019, the FTC settled with Retina-X after the company was hacked several times and eventually <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/neqgn8/retina-x-spyware-shuts-down-apps">shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Over the years, several other stalkerware makers were either hacked or inadvertently exposed their own systems, including mSpy, Mobistealth, and Flexispy. Another stalkerware maker, ClevGuard, left thousands of hacked victims&#8217; phone data on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">an exposed cloud server</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger bank <a href="https://www.point.app">Point</a> has raised a $46.5 million Series B funding round. The company offers an account associated with a debit card. And the startup positions itself as a premium debit card company and tries to offer credit card rewards with debit cards.</p>
<p>Existing investor Peter Thiel&#39;s Valar Ventures is investing more money in the company and leading the Series B round. Other investors include Breyer Capital, YC Continuity and Human Capital. The company raised a $10.5 million Series A round 18 months ago and a seed round before that, which means that Point has raised $60 million in total.</p>
<p>Point wants to build the anti-credit card. The company tries to keep what’s best about credit cards but leave behind what’s not so good. Many people think credit cards are a slippery slope. If you spend too much money without realizing that you’re not going to be able to make ends meet, you’ll pay interests. Those interests can even make it harder to pay back your credit card debt.</p>
<p>That’s why credit card incentives are both attractive and scary. If you have enough savings or if you earn a lot of money, paying your credit card bill is not going to be an issue. But that’s not always the case.</p>
<p>Point tells you that you should ditch your credit card altogether. When you open a Point account, you can top it up with another debit card or set up direct deposits with your employer. Opening a Point account currently costs $49 per year. You get two free ATM withdrawals per month and you don’t pay any foreign transaction fees.</p>
<p>After that, you can safely spend money with your Point card. You know that you have enough money to pay for your purchases as it’s a debit card. Every time you want to buy something expensive, you have to top up your account first.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Point users earn points with every purchase. You get 5x points on subscriptions, such as Spotify and Netflix, 3x points on food deliveries and ride sharing, and 1x points on everything else. If you pay with your Point card, you also get trip cancellation insurance, car rental insurance, global travel assistance, phone insurance and new purchase insurance.</p>
<p>You can control the Point card from the Point app —&nbsp;you can lock it and unlock it whenever you want and you can choose to receive notifications whenever you want. The Point debit card also works with Apple Pay and Google Pay.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to hire more people, launch new features and introduce new products. In other words, don’t expect any major changes. But the company now has more money to expand more rapidly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paris-based startup megacampus <a href="https://stationf.co">Station F</a> is announcing a new program for early-stage startups looking for opportunities to join the Station F community — the FemTech Program. With this new program, the Station F team wants to put a spotlight on FemTech startups and make it easier to start a FemTech startup.</p>
<p>Station F is a massive building that used to be a rail freight depot. It has been completely renovated and it now acts as a flagship entity for the tech community in France. In addition to VC firms and public administrations, the startup campus has partnered with companies and universities so that they can run their own incubator at Station F.</p>
<p>And Station F also has its own programs operated by the Station F team. There’s the Fighters Program designed specifically for entrepreneurs coming from underprivileged backgrounds. And there’s the Founders Program for companies that are just getting started.</p>
<p>With the FemTech Program, Station F is adding a third in-house program. As the name suggests, the startup campus is looking for companies working on female health, women&#39;s sexual health and more.</p>
<p>“When we looked at the topic, we thought it was both an opportunity and that startups urgently needed some help,” Station F director Roxanne Varza told me. “It’s still a little-known category, it’s still a taboo subject.”</p>
<p>While there are huge market opportunities when you build a FemTech startup, entrepreneurs quickly realize that they have to overcome two obstacles. First, people in the tech ecosystem — and investors in particular — are still mostly men. They tend to overlook female-focused products and services.</p>
<p>Second, when VC firms raise money from bigger funds, limited partners usually have a set of vice clauses in their investment contracts. It means that most VC firms can’t invest in companies related to sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Startups tell us about their problems. We would like to do some lobbying for those startups,” Roxanne Varza told me. “The idea is really to create a community first. That was the major pain point, making sure that those startups can get together.”</p>
<p>Station F will also provide workshops, facilitate introductions with potential partners in the tech community at large and provide office hours. For instance, the founders of <a href="https://helloclue.com">Clue</a> and <a href="https://www.avawomen.com">Ava</a> will participate in upcoming workshops.</p>
<p>During the first half of 2021, Station F already selected a handful of FemTech startups to try out its program. Startups included <a href="https://www.intimately.co">Intimately</a>, <a href="https://talq-univers.com">TalQ</a>, <a href="https://puissante.co">Puissante</a> and <a href="https://www.sonio.ai">Sonio</a>. Applications for the first official batch start today on Station F’s <a href="https://stationf.co/apply/femtech">website</a> and will remain open for a month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.homelight.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeLight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which operates a real estate technology platform, announced today that it has secured $100 million in a Series D round of funding and $263 million in debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Return backer Zeev Ventures led the equity round, which also included participation from Group 11, Stereo Capital, Menlo Ventures and Lydia Jett of the SoftBank Vision Fund. The financings bring the San Francisco-based company’s total raised since its 2012 inception to $530 million. The equity financing brings HomeLight’s valuation to $1.6 billion, which is about triple of what it was when it raised its $109 million in debt and equity in a Series C that was announced in November of 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zeev Ventures led that funding round, as well as its Series A in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest capital comes ahead of projected “3x” year-over-year growth, according to HomeLight founder and CEO Drew Uher, who projects that the company&#8217;s annual revenue will triple to over $300 million in 2021. Doing basic math, we can deduce that the company saw around $100 million in revenue in 2020.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, like many other real estate tech platforms, HomeLight has evolved its model. HomeLight’s initial product focused on using artificial intelligence to match consumers and real estate investors to agents. Since then, the company has expanded to also </span><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/homelight-launches-agent-services-to-help-agents-thrive-1028577713"><span style="font-weight: 400;">providing title and escrow services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to agents and home sellers and matching sellers with iBuyers. In July 2019, HomeLight </span><a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49530-homelight-acquires-digital-mortgage-startup-eave-expands-into-mortgage-lending/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired Eave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an entry into the (increasingly crowded) mortgage lending space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to remove as much friction as possible from the process of buying or selling a home,” Uher said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2020, HomeLight launched its flagship financial products, HomeLight Trade-In and HomeLight Cash Offer. Since then, it has grown those products by over 700%, Uher said, in part fueled by the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeLight’s Trade-In product gives its clients greater control over the timeline of their move and ability to transact, and Cash Offer gives people a way to make all cash offers on homes, “even if they need a mortgage,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pandemic only highlighted many of the pain points in the real estate transaction process that we’ve been focused on solving since our founding,” Uher told TechCrunch. &#8220;Between the real estate industry’s historic information asymmetry, outdated processes and unreasonable costs &#8212; not to mention today’s record-low inventory and all-time high bidding wars &#8212; buying or selling a home can be an incredibly difficult process, even without the challenges put in place by a global pandemic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197292" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197292" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197292 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HomeLight2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197292" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HomeLight</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in August 2020, the company acquired Disclosures.io and launched HomeLight Listing Management, with the goal of making it easier for agents to share property information, monitor buyer interest and manage offers in one place. </span></p>
<p>In June of 2021, HomeLight appointed Lyft chairman and former Trulia CFO Sean Aggarwal to its board.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uher founded HomeLight after he and his wife felt the pain of trying to buy a home in the competitive Bay Area market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process of buying a home in San Francisco was so frustrating it made me want to bang my head against the wall,” Uher told me at the time of HomeLight’s Series C. “I realized there were so many things wrong with the real estate industry. I went through a few real estate agents before finding the right match. So when I did find one, it made me feel empowered to compete and win against the other buyers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started HomeLight with a single product, its agent matching platform, which uses “proprietary machine-learning algorithms” to analyze millions of real estate transactions and agent profiles. It claims to connect a client to a real estate agent on average “every 90 seconds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Uher said that hundreds of thousands of agents have applied to be a part of the HomeLight agent network and that it has worked with over 1 million homebuyers and sellers in the U.S. Today, the company works closely with the top 28,000 of those agents across the country. HomeLight maintains that it is not trying to replace real estate agents, but instead work more collaboratively with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uher said the company plans to use its new capital in part toward expanding to new markets its Trade-In and Cash Offer operations. HomeLight Trade-In and Cash Offer are currently available in California, Texas and, more recently, in Colorado.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We plan to expand as quickly as we can across the entire country,” Uher said. “We also plan to hire aggressively in 2021 and beyond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeLight presently has over 500 employees, up from about 350 at the end of last year. The company has offices in Scottsdale, Arizona, San Francisco, New York, Seattle and Tampa, and plans to open new sites throughout the U.S. in the coming months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oren Zeev, founding partner at Zeev Ventures, said he believes that HomeLIght is better positioned than any other proptech company “to reinvent the transaction experience” for agents and their clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the onset of iBuyers and other technology introduced in the past decade, many proptech companies are building products to cut agents out of the transaction process entirely,” Zeev wrote via email. &#8220;This is where HomeLight uniquely differs &#8212; and excels &#8212; from its competitors&#8230;They’re in the perfect position to revolutionize the industry.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://youtravel.me/en/">YouTravel.Me</a> is the latest startup to grab some venture capital dollars as the travel industry gets back on its feet amid the global pandemic.</p>
<p>Over the past month, we’ve seen companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/thatch-using-3m-round-to-put-travel-creators-on-the-map/">Thatch raise $3 million</a> for its platform aimed at travel creators, travel tech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/hopper-raises-170m-on-3-5b-valuation-as-travel-surges-and-its-fintech-tools-help-offset-variant-concerns/">Hopper bring in $175 million</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/wheel-the-world-raises-2m-to-provide-unlimited-experiences-for-travelers-with-limited-accessibility/">Wheel the World grab $2 million</a> for its disability-friendly vacation planner, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/elude-raises-2-1m-to-show-spontaneous-travelers-the-best-destinations-for-their-budgets/">Elude raise $2.1 million</a> to bring spontaneous travel back to a hard-hit industry and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/general-catalyst-abstract-back-wanderlogs-1-5m-round-for-collaborative-travel/">Wanderlog</a> bag $1.5 million for its free travel itinerary platform.</p>
<p>Today YouTravel.Me joins them after raising $1 million to continue developing its online platform designed for matching like-minded travelers to small-group adventures organized by travel experts. Starta VC led the round and was joined by Liqvest.com, Mission Gate and a group of individual investors like Bas Godska, general partner at Acrobator Ventures.</p>
<p>Olga Bortnikova, her husband Ivan Bortnikov and Ivan Mikheev founded the company in Europe three years ago. The idea for the company came to Bortnikova and Bortnikov when a trip to China went awry after a tour operator sold them a package where excursions turned out to be trips to souvenir shops. One delayed flight and other mishaps along the way, and the pair went looking for better travel experiences and a way to share them with others. When they couldn’t find what they were looking for, they decided to create it themselves.</p>
<p>“It’s hard for adults to make friends, but when you are on a two-week trip with just 15 people in a group, you form a deep connection, share the same language and experiences,” Bortnikova told TechCrunch. “That’s our secret sauce — we want to make a connection.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ORFTO3OL73"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/wheel-the-world-raises-2m-to-provide-unlimited-experiences-for-travelers-with-limited-accessibility/">Wheel the World raises $2M to provide unlimited experiences for travelers with limited accessibility</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wheel the World raises $2M to provide unlimited experiences for travelers with limited accessibility&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/wheel-the-world-raises-2m-to-provide-unlimited-experiences-for-travelers-with-limited-accessibility/embed/#?secret=ORFTO3OL73" data-secret="ORFTO3OL73" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Much like a dating app, the YouTravel.Me’s algorithms connect travelers to trips and getaways based on their interests, values and past experiences. Matched individuals can connect with each via chat or voice, work with a travel expert and complete their reservations. They also have a BeGuide offering for travel experts to do research and create itineraries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since 2018, CEO Bortnikova said that YouTravel.Me has become the top travel marketplace in Eastern Europe, amassing over 15,900 tours in 130 countries and attracting over 10,000 travelers and 4,200 travel experts to the platform. It was starting to branch out to international sales in 2020 when the global pandemic hit.</p>
<p>“Sales and tourism crashed down, and we didn’t know what to do,” she said. “We found that we have more than 4,000 travel experts on our site and they feel lonely because the pandemic was a test of the industry. We understood that and built a community and educational product for them on how to build and scale their business.”</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/travel%20logistics%20and%20infrastructure/our%20insights/the%20travel%20industry%20turned%20upside%20down%20insights%20analysis%20and%20actions%20for%20travel%20executives/the-travel-industry-turned-upside-down-insights-analysis-and-actions-for-travel-executives.pdf">McKinsey study</a> showed that adventure travel was recovering faster than other sectors of the industry, the founders decided to go after that market, becoming part of 500 Startups at the end of 2020. As a result, YouTravel.Me doubled its revenue while still a bootstrapped company, but wanted to enter the North American market.</p>
<p>The new funding will be deployed into marketing in the U.S., hiring and attracting more travel experts, technology and product development and increasing gross merchandise value to $2.7 million per month by the end of 2021, Bortnikov said. The goal is to grow the number of trips to 20,000 and its travel experts to 6,000 by the beginning of next year.</p>
<p>Godska, also an angel investor, learned about YouTravel.Me from a mutual friend. It happened that it was the same time that he was vacationing in Sri Lanka where he was one of very few tourists. Godska was previously involved in online travel before as part of Orbitz in Europe and in Russia selling tour packages before setting up a venture capital fund.</p>
<p>“I was sitting there in the jungle with a bad internet connection, and it sparked my interest,” he said. “When I spoke with them, I felt the innovation and this bright vibe of how they are doing this. It instantly attracted me to help support them. The whole curated thing is a very interesting move. Independent travelers that want to travel in groups are not touched much by the traditional sector.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">3D printing has garnered a lot of hype, much of it for good reason: the technology has unlocked new kinds of object shapes and geometries, and it uses materials that tend to be much lighter weight than their traditionally manufactured counterparts. But there remain high barriers to entry for many companies that either don’t have training in additive manufacturing, or that need to use materials that aren’t suitable for a traditional 3D printer.</p>
<p>3D printing startup AON3D wants to remove both of those barriers by increasing automation and, crucially, making more materials 3D-printable, and it has raised a $11.5 million Series A to get there.</p>
<p>The company manufactures industrial 3D printers for thermoplastics. What distinguishes AON3D&#8217;s platform is that it’s materials-agnostic, co-founder Kevin Han explained, meaning the printers are able to accept the more than 70,000 commercially available thermoplastic composites or even a custom blend. That&#8217;s the company’s real breakthrough, according to its founders: the ability to turn existing materials already used by clients, 3D-printing ready.</p>
<p>“The real big innovation beyond just the hardware cost is on the material side,” co-founder Randeep Singh explained to TechCrunch in a recent interview. “We can take in a new material from a big company […] we take that material that a customer may need to use for a specific reason, run a bunch of tests and turn it into a 3d printable process.”</p>
<p>By doing so, AON3D says it also opens up additive manufacturing to many more companies, who may want to pursue 3D printing but are unable to fundamentally change their materials to get there. With AON3D&#8217;s process, they don’t have to, Han explained.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Han, Singh, and Andrew Walker, who met while studying materials engineering at Montreal’s McGill University. AON3D was largely born out of what the trio saw as a gap in the market between 3D printers that are very expensive — up to hundreds of thousands per machine — and more consumer-geared printers that aren&#8217;t much more than a couple of hundred bucks.</p>
<p>They started off operating 3D printers as a service, before launching a Kickstarter campaign in 2015 that ultimately garnered CAN $89,643 ($71,064) to bring the company’s debut 3D printer, the AON, to backers. Six years later, they’ve raised a total of $14.2 million in funding. This latest round was led by SineWave Ventures with participation from AlleyCorp and Y Combinator Continuity. BDC, EDC, Panache Ventures, MANA Ventures, Josh Richards &amp; Griffin Johnson, and SV angels also participated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beyond selling printers and customized materials, AON3D also works with companies on an ongoing basis, giving training in additive manufacturing and ensure their printer parameters are adequate for the parts they want to make.</p>
<p>The company has found a number of clients in the aerospace industry, in part because of the advantages in weight — crucial for space companies, where the economics largely come down to payload size — as well as cost, time and the ability to use geometries that aren’t possible through injection molding or traditional manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>That includes Astrobotic Technology, a lunar exploration startup that is aiming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/spacexs-falcon-heavy-rocket-to-deliver-an-astrobotic-lander-and-nasa-water-hunting-rover-to-the-moon-in-2023/">send a lander</a> to the moon on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in 2022. Onboard the mission will be hundreds of parts printed using AON3D&#8217;s AON M2+ high-temperature printer, which will likely be the first additively manufactured parts to touch the lunar surface. These include bracketry components, including critical parts in the avionics boxes.</p>

<p>“This [partnership] is giving Astrobotic the ability to use materials that they want to use very quickly,” Singh said. “Otherwise, they have really long lead time to get like material to work in a different process.” Injection molding using high-performance polymers, for example, can have a lead time of many months, he added, versus in a day or two using 3D printing.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the company will be using the capital from this financing round to build a dedicated full-scale materials lab and to grow its team. The company also wants to fully automate the 3D printing process, using data coming out of the materials lab, so that any business can start using additive manufacturing for their products.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Pancake is democratizing interior design services to make it accessible to everyone.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pancake.live/">Pancake</a> brought in a $350,000 seed round to develop its home design platform that leverages furniture you already have in your home with a designer’s fresh eye on your space.</p>
<p>Maria Jose Castro and Roberto Meza, both from Costa Rica, started the company in 2020, based on their own experience of transitioning to work-from-home and needing to outfit a space. However, design services can be expensive, and therefore not accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Pancake is reinventing the way you can work with an interior designer and get a rendering of your space to work from. Customers can go on the website and book a session with a designer, providing them with measurements and photos of the room.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bDqpn5-yPXo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The designer then prepares a rendering of the space and a deck to explain the design and how the customer will do it &#8212; and if paint or furniture is needed that isn’t already available, Pancake will show the customer where to find it. Future features of the site will include connecting with furniture providers, Jose Castro told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Meza called the company “furniture-as-a-service,” with the main focus to reuse what already exists in a space to create healthy, sustainable spaces that someone can work in, live in and enjoy all at the same time. While that may seem like a tall order, he said that with everyone suddenly together during the global pandemic, relationships are better when people are in a space they like.</p>
<p>“Wellness in construction is what I do, and we wanted to create that with Pancake,” he added. “Sometimes it is the little things that create a space and makes you feel good, or not feel good.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pancake plans to use its funding to further develop its platform and add new features like an ecological footprint calculator so customers can see how sustainable their designs are. The company also prides itself on transparent pricing. An average two-hour session with a designer is $199, and the designer will add to the budget if items like paint and new furniture are needed.</p>
<p>Christian Rudder, co-founder of OkCupid, is the lead investor in the seed round. He said that he doesn’t typically invest at the seed stage, but was impressed with the progress Pancake has made in a short period of time. This includes marketing tests on social media platforms that yielded a respectable return on investment, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pancake has facilitated over 100 designer sessions and has begun to see referrals and repeat customers who want to design additional rooms in their house. That has translated into 200% month over month revenue growth, on average, despite having to stop for four months during the pandemic, Meza said. Up next, the company will continue to build out its brand and revenue model as it advances to a Series A round next year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To learn more about the pros and cons, we spoke with executives from Marqeta, Expensify and Cardless.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the previous two or three years we’ve seen an explosion of new debit and credit card products come to market from consumer and B2B fintech startups, as well as companies that we might not traditionally think of as players in the financial services industry.</p>
<p>On the consumer side, that means companies like Venmo or PayPal offering debit cards as a new way for users to spend funds in their accounts. In the B2B space, the availability of corporate card issuing by startups like Brex and Ramp has ushered in new expense and spend management options. And then there is the growth of branded credit and debit cards among brands and sports teams.</p>
<p>But if your company somehow hasn’t yet found its way to launch a debit or credit card, we have good news: It’s easier than ever to do so and there’s actual money to be made. Just know that if you do, you’ve got plenty of competition and that actual customer usage will probably depend on how sticky your service is and how valuable the rewards are that you offer to your most active users.</p>
<p>To learn more about launching a card product, TechCrunch spoke with executives from <a href="https://www.marqeta.com/">Marqeta</a>, <a href="https://www.expensify.com/">Expensify</a>, <a href="https://www.synctera.com/">Synctera</a> and <a href="https://www.cardless.com/">Cardless</a> about the pros and cons of launching a card product. So without further ado, here are all the reasons you should think about doing so, and one big reason why you might not want to.</p>
<h2>Because it’s (relatively) easy</h2>
<p>Probably the biggest reason we’ve seen so many new fintech and non-fintech companies rush to offer debit and credit cards to customers is simply that it’s easier than ever for them to do so. The launch and success of businesses like Marqeta has made card issuance by API developer friendly, which lowered the barrier to entry significantly over the last half-decade.</p>
<p>“The reason why this is happening is because the ‘fintech 1.0 infrastructure’ has succeeded,” <a href="https://twitter.com/salmanhsyed?lang=en">Salman Syed</a>, Marqeta’s SVP and GM of North America, said. “When you&#8217;ve got companies like [ours] out there, it&#8217;s just gotten a lot easier to be able to put a card product out.”</p>
<p>While noting that there have been good options for card issuance and payment processing for at least the last five or six years, Expensify Chief Operating Officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anuradhamuralidharan/">Anu Muralidharan</a> said that a proliferation of technical resources for other pieces of fintech infrastructure has made the process of greenlighting a card offering much easier over the years.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Pixalate provides fraud protection, privacy and compliance analytics for connected television and mobile advertising.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pixalate.com/">Pixalate</a> raised $18.1 million in growth capital for its fraud protection, privacy and compliance analytics platform that monitors connected television and mobile advertising.</p>
<p>Western Technology Investment and Javelin Venture Partners led the latest funding round, which brings Pixalate’s total funding to $22.7 million to date. This includes a $4.6 million Series A round raised back in 2014, Jalal Nasir, founder and CEO of Pixalate, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company, with offices in Palo Alto and London, analyzes over 5 million apps across five app stores and more 2 billion IP addresses across 300 million connected television devices to detect and report fraudulent advertising activity for its customers. In fact, there are over 40 types of invalid traffic, Nasir said.</p>
<p>Nasir grew up going to livestock shows with his grandfather and learned how to spot defects in animals, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/navigating-ad-fraud-and-consumer-privacy-abuse-in-programmatic-advertising/">he has carried that kind of insight to Pixalate</a>, which can detect the difference between real and fake users of content and if fraudulent ads are being stacked or hidden behind real advertising that zaps smartphone batteries or siphons internet usage and even ad revenue.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aH5TUiSCrb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/navigating-ad-fraud-and-consumer-privacy-abuse-in-programmatic-advertising/">Navigating ad fraud and consumer privacy abuse in programmatic advertising</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Navigating ad fraud and consumer privacy abuse in programmatic advertising&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/navigating-ad-fraud-and-consumer-privacy-abuse-in-programmatic-advertising/embed/#?secret=aH5TUiSCrb" data-secret="aH5TUiSCrb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Digital advertising is big business. Nasir cited Association of National Advertisers research that estimated $200 billion will be spent globally in digital advertising this year. This is up from $10 billion a year prior to 2010. Meanwhile, estimated ad fraud will cost the industry $35 billion, he added.</p>
<p>“Advertisers are paying a premium to be in front of the right audience, based on consumption data,” Nasir said. “Unfortunately, that data may not be authorized by the user or it is being transmitted without their consent.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While many of Pixalate’s competitors focus on first-party risks, the company is taking a third-party approach, mainly due to people spending so much time on their devices. Some of the insights the company has found include that 16% of Apple’s apps don’t have privacy policies in place, while that number is 22% in Google’s app store. More crime and more government regulations around privacy mean that advertisers are demanding more answers, he said.</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward adding more privacy and data features to its product, doubling the sales and customer teams and expanding its office in London, while also opening a new office in Singapore.</p>
<p>The company grew 1,200% in revenue since 2014 and is gathering over 2 terabytes of data per month. In addition to the five app stores Pixalate is already monitoring, Nasir intends to add some of the China-based stores like Tencent and Baidu.</p>
<p>Noah Doyle, managing director at Javelin Venture Partners, is also monitoring the digital advertising ecosystem and said with networks growing, every linkage point exposes a place in an app where bad actors can come in, which was inaccessible in the past, and advertisers need a way to protect that.</p>
<p>“Jalal and Amin (Bandeali) have insight from where the fraud could take place and created a unique way to solve this large problem,” Doyle added. “We were impressed by their insight and vision to create an analytical approach to capturing every data point in a series of transactions —  more data than other players in the industry — for comprehensive visibility to help advertisers and marketers maintain quality in their advertising.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a long time coming but Facebook is finally feeling some heat from Europe&#8217;s much trumpeted data protection regime: Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-announces-decision-whatsapp-inquiry"> just announced</a> a €225 million (~$267M) for WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The Facebook-owned messaging app has been under investigation by the Irish DPC, its lead data supervisor in the European Union, since December 2018 &#8212; several months after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">first complaints were fired</a> at WhatsApp over how it processes user data under Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), once it begun being applied in May 2018.</p>
<p>Despite receiving a number of specific complaints about WhatsApp, the investigation undertaken by the DPC that&#8217;s been decided today was what&#8217;s known as an &#8220;own volition&#8221; enquiry &#8212; meaning the regulator selected the parameters of the investigation itself, choosing to fix on an audit of WhatsApp&#8217;s &#8216;transparency&#8217; obligations.</p>
<p>A key principle of the GDPR is that entities which are processing people&#8217;s data must be clear, open and honest with those people about how their information will be used.</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s decision today (which runs to a full 266 pages) concludes that WhatsApp failed to live up to the standard required by the GDPR.</p>
<p>Its enquiry considered whether or not WhatsApp fulfils transparency obligations to both users and non-users of its service (WhatsApp may, for example, upload the phone numbers of non-users if a user agrees to it ingesting their phone book which contains other people&#8217;s personal data); as well as looking at the transparency the platform offers over its sharing of data with its parent entity Facebook (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/whatsapps-privacy-u-turn-on-sharing-data-with-facebook-draws-more-heat-in-europe/">highly controversial issue at the time the privacy U-turn was announced</a> back in 2016, although it predated GDPR being applied).</p>
<p>In sum, the DPC found a range of transparency infringements by WhatsApp &#8212; spanning articles 5(1)(a); 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to issuing a sizeable financial penalty, it has ordered WhatsApp to take a number of actions to improve the level of transparency it offer users and non-users &#8212; giving the tech giant a three-month deadline for making all the ordered changes.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In a statement responding to the DPC&#8217;s decision, WhatsApp disputed the findings and dubbed the penalty &#8220;entirely disproportionate&#8221; &#8212; as well as confirming it will appeal, writing: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“WhatsApp is committed t</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">o providing a secure and private service. We have worked to ensure the information we provide is transparent and comprehensive and will continue to do so. We disagree with the decision today regarding the transparency we provided to people in 2018 and the penalties are entirely disproportionate. We will appeal this decision.” </span></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s worth emphasizing that the scope of the DPC enquiry which has finally been decided today was limited to only looking at WhatsApp&#8217;s transparency obligations.</p>
<p>The regulator was explicitly <em>not</em> looking into wider complaints &#8212; which have also been raised against Facebook&#8217;s data-mining empire for well over three years &#8212; about the legal basis WhatsApp claims for processing people&#8217;s information in the first place.</p>
<p>So the DPC will continue to face criticism over both the pace and approach of its GDPR enforcement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, prior to today, Ireland&#8217;s regulator had only issued one decision in a major cross-border cases addressing &#8216;Big Tech&#8217; &#8212; against Twitter when, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">back in December</a>, it knuckle-tapped the social network over a historical security breach with a fine of $550k.</p>
<p>WhatsApp&#8217;s first GDPR penalty is, by contrast, considerably larger &#8212; reflecting what EU regulators (plural) evidently consider to be a far more serious infringement of the GDPR.</p>
<p>Transparency is a key principle of the regulation. And while a security breach may indicate sloppy practice, systematic opacity towards people whose data your adtech empire relies upon to turn a fat profit looks rather more intentional; indeed, it&#8217;s arguably the whole business model.</p>
<p>And &#8212; at least in Europe &#8212; such companies are going to find themselves being forced to be up front about what they&#8217;re doing with people&#8217;s data.</p>
<h3><strong>Is the GDPR working?  </strong></h3>
<p>The WhatsApp decision will rekindle the debate about whether the GDPR is working effectively where it counts most: Against the most powerful companies in the world, which are also of course Internet companies.</p>
<p>Under the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection regulation, decisions on cross border cases require agreement from all affected regulators &#8212; across the 27 Member States &#8212; so while the GDPR&#8217;s &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; mechanism seeks to streamline the regulatory burden for cross-border businesses by funnelling complaints and investigations via a lead regulator (typically where a company has its main legal establishment in the EU), objections can be raised to that lead supervisory authority&#8217;s conclusions (and any proposed sanctions), as has happened here in this WhatsApp case.</p>
<p>Ireland originally proposed a far more low-ball penalty of up to €50M for WhatsApp. However other EU regulators objected to its draft decision on a number of fronts &#8212; and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) ultimately had to step in and take <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/edpb_bindingdecision_202101_ie_sa_whatsapp_redacted_en.pdf">a binding decision</a> (issued this summer) to settle the various disputes.</p>
<p>Through that (admittedly rather painful) joint-working, the DPC was required to increase the size of the fine issued to WhatsApp. In a mirror of what happened with its draft Twitter decision &#8212; where the DPC has also suggested an even tinier penalty in the first instance.</p>
<p>While there is a clear time cost in settling disputes between the EU&#8217;s smorgasbord of data protection agencies &#8212; the DPC submitted its draft WhatsApp decision to the other DPAs for review back in December, so it&#8217;s taken well over half a year to hash out all the disputes about WhatsApp&#8217;s lossy hashing and so forth &#8212; the fact that &#8216;corrections&#8217; are being made to its decisions and conclusions can land &#8212; if not jointly agreed but at least arriving via a consensus getting pushed through by the EDPB &#8212; is a sign that the process, while slow and creaky, is working. At least technically.</p>
<p>Even so, Ireland&#8217;s data watchdog will continue to face criticism for its outsized role in handling GDPR complaints and investigations &#8212; with some accusing the DPC of essentially cherry-picking which issues to examine in detail (by its choice and framing of cases) and which to elide entirely (those issues it doesn&#8217;t open an enquiry into or complaints it simply drops or ignores), with its loudest critics arguing it&#8217;s therefore still a major bottleneck on effective enforcement of data protection rights across the EU.</p>
<p>The associated conclusion for that critique is that tech giants like Facebook are still getting a pretty free pass to violate Europe&#8217;s privacy rules.</p>
<p>But while it&#8217;s true that a $267M penalty is the equivalent of a parking ticket for Facebook&#8217;s business empire, orders to change how such adtech giants are able to process people&#8217;s information at least have the potential to be a far more significant correction on problematic business models.</p>
<p>Again, though, time will be needed to tell whether such wider orders are having the sought for impact.</p>
<p>In a statement reacting to the DPC&#8217;s WhatsApp decision today, <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/statement-dpc-issues-eu-225-million-fine-whatsapp">noyb</a> &#8212; the privacy advocacy group founded by long-time European privacy campaigner Max Schrems, said: &#8220;We welcome the first decision by the Irish regulator. However, the DPC gets about ten thousand complaints per year since 2018 and this is the first major fine. The DPC also proposed an initial €50MK fine and was forced by the other European data protection authorities to move towards €225M, which is still only 0.08% of the turnover of the Facebook Group. The GDPR foresees fines of up to 4% of the turnover. This shows how the DPC is still extremely dysfunctional.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schrems also noted that he and noyb still have a number of pending cases before the DPC &#8212; including on WhatsApp.</p>
<p>In further remarks, they raised concerns about the length of the appeals process and whether the DPC would make a muscular defence of a sanction it had been forced to increase by other EU DPAs.</p>
<p>&#8220;WhatsApp will surely appeal the decision. In the Irish court system this means that years will pass before any fine is actually paid. In our cases we often had the feeling that the DPC is more concerned with headlines than with actually doing the hard groundwork. It will be very interesting to see if the DPC will actually defend this decision fully, as it was basically forced to make this decision by its European counterparts. I can imagine that the DPC will simply not put many resources on the case or &#8216;settle&#8217; with WhatsApp in Ireland. We will monitor this case closely to ensure that the DPC is actually following through with this decision.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In another reaction statement, the European consumer protection association BEUC &#8212; which has also pressed complaints against Facebook-owned WhatsApp, dubbed the decision &#8220;well overdue&#8221;.</p>
<p>David Martin, its team leader of digital policy. added: &#8220;It sends a serious message to Facebook and its subsidiaries that breaking the EU’s rules on data protection has consequences. It also shows the decisive role that the European Data Protection Board has in enforcing the GDPR, as the Irish data protection authority was forced by its EU counterparts to take a much stricter stance. We hope that consumer authorities take note of this decision and act swiftly on BEUC’s separate <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/consumer-groups-file-complaint-against-whatsapp-unfairly-pressuring-users-accept-its/html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.beuc.eu/publications/consumer-groups-file-complaint-against-whatsapp-unfairly-pressuring-users-accept-its/html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630678987140000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHezeAPNm1SXc6J2DI5aPssu4py0g">complaint</a> against WhatsApp for unfairly pressuring users to accept the recent changes to its terms and conditions and privacy policy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corelight, a San Francisco-based startup that claims to offer the industry’s first open <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/network-security/">network detection and response</a> (NDR) platform, has raised $75 million in Series D investment led by Energy Impact Partners.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The round — which also includes a strategic investment from Capital One Ventures, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/crowdstrike-falcon-fund">Crowdstrike Falcon Fund</a> and Gaingels — brings Corelight’s total raised to $160 million, following a $50 million Series C in October 2019, a $25 million Series B in September 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/corelight-closes-9-2m-series-a-to-help-enterprises-battle-ransomware/">and a $9.2 million Series A in July 2017</a>.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s raised plenty of capital in the past few years, the startup isn’t planning its exit just yet. Brian Dye, CEO of Corelight, tells TechCrunch that given Corelight’s market opportunity and performance — the startup claims to be the fastest-growing NDR player at scale — it plans to invest in growth and expects to raise additional capital in the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Public listing timeframes are always hard to forecast, and we view the private markets as attractive in the short term, so we expect to remain private for the next couple years and will look at market conditions then to decide our next step,&#8221; Dye said, adding that the Corelight plans to use its latest investment to fuel the acceleration of its global market presence and to develop new data and cloud-based offerings.</p>
<p>“Aside from go-to-market expansion, we are investing to ensure that the insight we provide both continues to lead the industry and can be readily used by customers of all types,” he added.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Corelight, which competes with the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fireeye/">FireEye</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fireeye-to-sell-products-unit-for-1-2b-to-symphony-led-group/">STG-owned McAfee</a>, was founded in 2013 when Dr. Vern Paxson, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, joined forces with Robin Sommer and Seth Hall to build a network visibility solution on top of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/open-source/">open-source</a> framework called Zeek (formerly Bro).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Paxson began developing Zeek in 1995 when he was working at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The software is now widely regarded as the gold standard for both network security monitoring and network traffic analysis and has been deployed by thousands of organizations around the world, including the U.S. Department of Energy, various agencies in the U.S. government, and research universities like Indiana University, Ohio State, and Stanford.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As live audio becomes more and more popular, co-founders David Sacks (former COO of PayPal and CEO of Yammer) and Axel Ericsson sought to combine social audio and podcasting into one seamless app. The resulting app <a href="https://www.callin.com/">Callin</a> launches today on iOS with an announcement of $12 million in Series A funding co-led by Sequoia, Goldcrest, and Craft Ventures, where Sacks is a founder and partner.</p>
<p>On live audio platforms like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, once a room ends, the audio is gone. While Callin has similar live audio functionality, it sets itself apart by allowing users to save their live recording and edit it into an episode of a podcast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d been meaning to do a podcast for years, and I just had never gotten around to it, because it&#8217;s too complicated, and the barriers are too high,&#8221; said Sacks, who started his &#8220;All In&#8221; podcast in lockdown. &#8220;We have a guy in the studio who spends six hours doing post-production on every episode of the pod, and we all had to get microphones, hardware&#8230; It&#8217;s complicated to organize.&#8221;</p>
<p>For aspiring podcasters creating their first shows, Callin reduces the barrier to entry while allowing users to retain ownership of the content they create on the app. To start recording, users just open a room, which can be private or public &#8212; then they can invite guests to talk with them, or record alone. In a live room, Callin also has a more streamlined queue for audience participation to make it easier for hosts to manage crowds.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2197200" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p>To edit your podcast after recording, the app generates a transcript &#8212; it takes about the same amount of time as your recording to transcribe. Then, you can tap a block of text to cut it from the podcast, including isolated filler words, like um and uh. As of now, you can&#8217;t cut individual words or phrases within each block of text identified by the AI, but Sacks says that the app will continue building out its editing system. Callin also automates the process of cutting out &#8220;dead air&#8221; at the beginning or end of a recording. After finishing edits, the host can upload the recording as an episode of a show that they create on the app. Users can also export their audio to share it on other podcasts hosts, and in the future, Sacks said users will be able to syndicate the content via an RSS feed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But consuming that content via a podcast app would be different from experiencing it on Callin, because you have the interactive playback to see the room as it was when the conversation occurred,&#8221; said Sacks. &#8220;So you can see the avatar of who&#8217;s talking and you can click it and follow them or browse their profile to see what else they&#8217;re interested in, so it&#8217;s a different experience than just a flat audio file.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2197159" style="width: 405px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197159" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2197159 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png?w=395" alt="" width="395" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png?resize=174,300 174w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png?resize=395,680 395w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197159" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Callin, screenshot by TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Podcasters cannot yet publish their transcripts &#8212; which, like most automated transcripts, aren&#8217;t 100% accurate &#8212; but that functionality, which Callin is working on, could create some much-needed accessibility that&#8217;s still lacking on Clubhouse. Like Clubhouse, Callin doesn&#8217;t support live captioning yet (Twitter Spaces does). But Sacks said that once it expands to allow hosts to share transcripts, live captioning would &#8220;be on the roadmap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are apps out there that do rooms, there&#8217;s apps that let you edit transcripts, and there&#8217;s apps that do social discovery or highlights, but nobody&#8217;s really put all these pieces together into one experience,&#8221; Sacks said. &#8220;So we&#8217;re trying to be this complete vertical stack for anyone who wants to create an audio show, and so I think you&#8217;ll see us keep iterating on every aspect of that experience. We want there to be nothing you can do in a podcasting studio that you can&#8217;t do on our app.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, in its current form as it launches into the App Store, Callin lacks tools to edit the quality of an audio recording, add sound effects or music, and edit content in a more precise way. Plus, a podcast recorded on an iPhone won&#8217;t sound as good as a professionally produced show, or even a hobbyist&#8217;s podcast recorded on a consumer-grade USB mic. But the success of live audio apps has shown that sometimes listeners aren&#8217;t looking for quality post-production and sound design, but rather, they just want to hear people talk about a subject that interests them. So, Callin and its investors are betting on the fact that people would want to listen to pre-recorded Clubhouse rooms if they could.</p>
<p>Sacks has used his app to create shows like &#8220;Sacks on SaaS,&#8221; a show for software company founders, and an interview show called &#8220;Red Pills,&#8221; which is titled with a phrase that has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/red-pill-meme-alt-right-twitter/618577/">a very fraught history</a> on the internet. Other user-made content on the app includes shows about the NFL, startups in Berlin, cooking, and more. In its beta, Sacks says that Callin had &#8220;thousands&#8221; of users who created over 100 shows.</p>
<p>Per its Community Guidelines, Callin &#8220;is a place for people to speak, so whenever speech is limited on our platform, there should be a good reason.&#8221; Callin will only limit speech restricted by the host of a room, speech restricted by &#8220;underlying technology platforms&#8221; like Apple and Google, and &#8220;dangerous speech not protected by the First Amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Content moderation has been a challenge on live audio platforms like Clubhouse, which has struggled to refine its <a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/on-community-moderation/">content moderation standards</a> after <a href="https://twitter.com/clubhouse/status/1383935475333820417?lang=en">reports</a> of racist and antisemitic speech. Callin&#8217;s Community Guidelines indicate that it will host any user-generated content that won&#8217;t get the app booted off of Apple and Google stores. Recently, Parler served as a high-profile example of how a social platform&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/apple-confirms-it-will-allow-parler-to-return-to-app-store/">refusal to moderate content</a> got it removed from app stores, though it has since been reinstated after months of back-and-forth.</p>
<p>With its $12 million Series A round, Callin hopes to support Android and web versions of the app. Eventually, Callin could seek profit through advertisements and show subscriptions, but Sacks says that the company plans to scale first before exploring its monetization options.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is the best product that I&#8217;ve ever worked on,&#8221; said Sacks. &#8220;I mean, I think it&#8217;s better than Yammer. I think it&#8217;s better even than PayPal.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s top banks five years ago built the interoperable UPI railroads and enabled over 150 million people in the South Asian market to pay digitally. Scores of firms &#8212; including local firms Paytm, PhonePe, CRED and international giants Google and Facebook &#8212; in India today support the UPI infrastructure, which is now reporting 3 billion transactions each month.</p>
<p>Banks are now ready for their second act.</p>
<p>On Thursday, eight Indian banks announced that they are rolling out &#8212; or about to roll out &#8212; a system called Account Aggregator to enable consumers to consolidate all their financial data in one place. (Participants banks are HDFC, Kotak, ICICI, Axis, SBI, IndusInd, IDFC, and Federal. Four of them are rolling out the system on Thursday, others say they will roll out the new system soon.)</p>
<p>The objective of Account Aggregator (AA) is to aggregate all financial information of an individual, said M Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor of India’s central bank &#8212; Reserve Bank of India &#8212; at a virtual event Thursday.</p>
<p>The new system makes it possible for banks, tax authorities, insurers, and other finance firms to aggregate data of customers &#8212; who have provided their consent &#8212; to get better understanding about their potential customers, make informed decisions and ensure smoother transactions.</p>
<p>Users who provide consent &#8212; and it only takes a few taps to do so &#8212; will be able to share their financial information from one Account Aggregator participant to another through a centralized API-based repository. Users get to decide for how long they wish their data to be shared with a particular Account Aggregator participant.</p>

<p>Most countries globally already have privacy laws that recognize the rights of individuals. But even as individuals and businesses have the right to exercise their control over their data, the current system has made it difficult for consumers to operationalize how they provide consent.</p>
<p>&#8220;They face this difficult for two reasons,&#8221; explained Siddharth Tiwari, head of the Bank for International Settlements in Asia and Pacific. &#8220;Firstly, a service provider usually seeks consent to use and transfer data at time when consumers [are] agreeing to participate in an activity with the service provider. Since this consent is granted for a wide variety of possibilities, it is broad and sweeping in nature,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, newly created data are often gathered and retained in proprietary silos and stored in various institutions in incompatible formats. Consumers can find it difficult to share their data as they have only limited options. [&#8230;] Thus, service providers who are custodians of data effectively act as defacto owner of the data,&#8221; he said, adding that Account Aggregator is designed to potentially address these challenges. &#8220;A robust consent-based data sharing system has the potential for consumers derive value from their data while maintaining control.&#8221;</p>
<p>Account Aggregator is built in part to also help consumers and businesses access financial services such as loans. Existing credit bureaus in India have data of only a fraction of the nation&#8217;s 1.4 billion population, which makes it very difficult for most in the country to access working capital, explained Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani, who’s been an adviser to the initiative, at the event Thursday.</p>
<p>Most of these individuals have made enough digital financial transactions and businesses have enough cashflow to show that would make them eligible for financial services, he said. “Digital footprints, when properly used, empowered by consumers using their own data, enables a huge amount of credit to small businesses. It can lead to the democratisation of credit.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Talks are on to onboard telecom operators as well,&#8221; he said, adding that the system has already achieved the sophistication that it could be extended to other industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an architecture that can now be applied to several additional industries,&#8221; he said, pointing to healthcare, fitness, testing labs as examples. &#8220;We can confidently say that there is no other country in the world that has built a robust infrastructure at this scale where its people can leverage their data. This approach is now getting global recognition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For retail loan underwriting (&#8220;eligibility check&#8221;), rather than submitting previous 3 years bank statements, I can simply authenticate a data transfer via AA (and revoke the data transfer AFTER the loan is approved or sanctioned). For self-employed or freelance professionals, getting Term Insurance has always been difficult since they cannot prove their income &#8211; AA lets you provide an audit trail of past income to underwrite the Term Insurance application,&#8221; Rahul Mathur, founder and chief executive of insurance aggregator startup BimaPe, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The Account Aggregator system is also positioned to dramatically increase the addressable market for online insurers, lenders, and players in several other industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a big step towards a connected financial ecosystem, and will be very significant in Fi&#8217;s journey to help working millennials get better with their money. With the successful demonstration of the framework today we are excited to have all our users experience the power and convenience of the AA integration once it’s rolled out to all users,” said Sumit Gwalani, co-founder of Fi.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The Federal Aviation Administration is looking into an anomaly on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-reopens-ticket-sales-073418808.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Virgin Galactic</a> flight that carried <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Richard Branson to space</a>.

Apparently, the pilots for the mission didn&#8217;t fly as steeply as they should have, causing the system to raise the alarm.</p>
<p>An FAA spokesperson confirmed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-faa-probing-virgin-galactic-july-11-flight-deviation-2021-09-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>Reuters</em></a> that the vehicle &#8220;deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America&#8221; and it&#8217;s investigating the incident. The agency gives missions to space a designated airspace they can fly in to prevent collisions with commercial planes and to minimize civilian casualties in the event of an accident. Virgin&#8217;s Unity 22 mission flew out of that designated airspace for a minute and forty-one seconds before the pilots were able to correct course.</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>Nicholas Schmidle, author of <em>The New Yorker</em> piece, said he attended a meeting a few years ago, wherein the same pilots on the Unity 22 flight said a red light entry glide-cone warning should &#8220;scare the shit out of you.&#8221; Apparently, that means it&#8217;s too late, and that the safest course of action is to abort. In a statement it <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/09/01/virgin-galactic-statement-about-anomaly-on-richard-bransons-suborbital-space-flight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">published</a> after the article went out, though, Virgin Galactic said it &#8220;disputes the misleading characterizations and conclusions&#8221; in the piece and that the people on the flight weren&#8217;t in any danger as a result of the flight deviation. The company said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the vehicle encountered high altitude winds which changed the trajectory, the pilots and systems monitored the trajectory to ensure it remained within mission parameters. Our pilots responded appropriately to these changing flight conditions exactly as they were trained and in strict accordance with our established procedures. Although the flights ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico. At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It also said that the spacecraft did not fly outside of the lateral confines of the mission&#8217;s protected airspace, though it did drop below the altitude of the airspace it was provided. The company added that it&#8217;s &#8220;working in partnership with the FAA to address the airspace for future flights.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last-mile logistics supplier AxleHire provides same-day and next-day delivery through a network that includes gig economy, couriers and traditional carriers. Over the past year, it has been quietly piloting automated repositioning startup Tortoise&#8217;s remote controlled delivery robots in Los Angeles and compact container delivery service URB-E&#8217;s e-bike container delivery in New York City. On Thursday, it announced plans to scale the two very different zero-emissions pilot programs nationally over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>AxleHire, which is known for parcel delivery and restaurant meal kit delivery like Blue Apron and HelloFresh, plans to bring over 100 Tortoise robots across the country. During URB-E&#8217;s summer deployment with AxleHire in NYC, it deployed 10 vehicles moving 100 containers per week. Now it will deploy 50 URB-E vehicles moving anywhere from 300 to 500 containers per week in NYC, LA and San Francisco, as well as other launch cities. The company, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210407005155/en/AxleHire-Raises-20-Million-to-Redefine-Last-Mile-Logistics">which raised a $20 million round in April</a>, didn&#8217;t specify every city it would be entering with these new programs, but Tortoise and URB-E said we can look to the cities AxleHire already operates in: Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, New York, Phoenix, Seattle and Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>AxleHire&#8217;s style is to establish delivery hubs in or near dense metro areas, which makes for easier trips and less miles traveled in total. The partnerships with Tortoise and URB-E are a part of AxleHire&#8217;s mission to create more sustainable and cheaper last-mile delivery. The company says its partnerships with the two startups have also lowered its emissions by 95%. AxleHire is providing an example of one company trialing two very different greener and tech-focused forms of transporting goods, so it will likely serve as an interesting case study for other last-mile logistics providers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197277" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197277" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197277 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-2066-1.jpg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-2066-1.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-2066-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-2066-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-2066-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-2066-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-2066-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-2066-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-2066-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197277" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> URB-E</p></div></p>
<p>In New York, AxleHire and URB-E have been working together on a microcontainer delivery system between Brooklyn and Manhattan. URB-E&#8217;s vehicles are specifically designed to be able to ride in the bike lanes, despite their ability to haul over 800 pounds. AxleHire says its pilot with URB-E resulted in a six times reduction in traffic and a model that is three times cheaper than EV delivery vans, largely based on the avoidance of parking tickets.</p>
<p>Over the past year in Los Angeles, AxleHire stationed Tortoise&#8217;s electric, 4-mph remote-piloted carts, which carried up to 120 pounds worth of goods, in its delivery microhubs in cities, allowing the little bots with friendly smiley faces to go back and forth, making about 15 deliveries per day within a three-mile radius. In addition, AxleHire loaded a large truck with multiple packages and a Tortoise robot, which would then drive into a dense residential area. This truck would serve as a mobile delivery hub, doing its own deliveries while the bot goes back and forth delivering parcels and being reloaded all day long.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s basically the hive model, where we&#8217;re augmenting the existing van or truck in terms of how many deliveries they could do in a two-hour stretch,&#8221; Dmitry Shevelenko, co-founder of Tortoise, told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s communication happening with our subject confirming they&#8217;ll be home to receive it. If so, they get notified that the robot&#8217;s on the way when it&#8217;s about 10 minutes away, and then when it arrives, the customer will come out and get it from the containers in the robot.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Tortoise bots, which can ride on sidewalks or bike lanes, have both swappable batteries and can be plugged and charged, according to Shevelenko. On a single charge, they can get around 10 to 15 miles of range.</p>
<p>While Tortoise&#8217;s bots will be operated 100% remotely over the next year, remote positioning is not Tortoise&#8217;s end goal at all. Autonomy is the goal, and doing partnerships like this, as well as with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/spin-bets-its-scooter-future-on-3-wheels-and-remote-control-tech/">shared e-scooter operators like Spin</a>, allows Tortoise not only to get into markets that currently don&#8217;t have regulation for self-driving vehicles, but also to just get into the market now, rather than spending multiple years mapping it first. The only real infrastructure the bots need is 4G connectivity.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The beauty is that we can ship the robot to a new location and because we have the benefit of human judgment oversight every inch of the journey,&#8221; said Shevelenko. &#8220;We don&#8217;t need perfect routing or perfect mapping. We&#8217;re filling in the maps over time, and that gives us a big data advantage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>By slowly collecting routing data over the course of the next year, Tortoise will be giving its system more data to learn on and create the most optimal route for the specific use case of low-speed and lightweight delivery vehicles. Shevelenko says the long-term vision of Tortoise is to have its tech on any light electric vehicle, whether it be a delivery robot, a scooter, a cleaning robot, security robot or construction robot. Delivery is a great place to start, given the massive demand in the COVID marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more vehicles we have with Tortoise eyes on them, the more data we&#8217;re collecting, which means we&#8217;re doing trips with higher autonomy and lower costs,&#8221; said Shevelenko.</p>
<p>Aside from allowing for max data collection, remote controlled delivery bots over the next year also give Tortoise the advantage of getting the community used to this new tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think the right way to enter a community is first to reassure people that this is safe and get them comfortable with it,&#8221; said Shevelenko. &#8220;Once it&#8217;s part of daily life, then slowly over time, we can turn on more autonomy, but there&#8217;s no need to rush into that right now. The practical reality is, everybody&#8217;s claiming they&#8217;re doing autonomy but they aren&#8217;t. They always have a fallback like safety drivers or remote monitors. Nobody actually trusts their economy system, and so we&#8217;re kind of leaning into that and not trying to do something that is impossible.&#8221;</p>
