										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1458468539812044803">announced</a> today the comapny has begun testing a new feature this week called &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; which will allow users to remind themselves to take a break from using the app after either 10, 20 or 30 minutes, depending on their preferences. As an opt-in feature, however, the reminders may have a limited impact as users would have to be motivated to set up the new control for themselves.</p>
<p>The company had previously said it was looking into &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; reminders. Mosseri, for instance, mentioned the coming addition when <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461241289555977">commenting</a> on Instagram&#8217;s plans to pause its plans to build a version of its service for younger users, Instagram for Kids. He referenced Instagram&#8217;s plans to build in &#8220;nudges&#8221; and &#8220;reminders,&#8221; like &#8220;Take a Break,&#8221; as an example of how Instagram was addressing issues related to its product&#8217;s impact on users&#8217; mental health.</p>
<p>Meta&#8217;s (previously, Facebook&#8217;s) Global Head of Security Antigone Davis also referenced Instagram&#8217;s¬† &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; reminders when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">the company was grilled in a Senate hearing</a> over teen mental health back in September. He said the idea with the feature was to encourage users to stop looking at the app after they had been browsing for too long, and cited it as one of the many ways the company was working to improve the experiences of young people using its platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232240" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But similar to Instagram&#8217;s experiment with removing Like counts from posts, which it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/">ultimately decided to make an opt-in feature</a>, these new &#8220;break&#8221; reminders won&#8217;t likely impact platform usage as they&#8217;re not being made the default experience. In addition, it&#8217;s unclear if users will adopt the feature given that iOS and Android&#8217;s built-in screen time controls already allow device owners to set limits on the time spent in mobile apps either on an individual basis or by category, like &#8220;social.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instagram, in other words, appears to want credit for building mental health features without actually going so far as to make any universal changes that would impact its app usage.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>This is not the first time Instagram has pulled such a stunt. In 2018, Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-your-activity-time/">rolled out</a> a &#8220;You&#8217;re All Caught Up&#8221; notice that appeared when you reached the end of all the new content from the past two days on your Instagram Feed. But last year, Instagram regressed and decided to use the space below the &#8220;You&#8217;re All Caught Up&#8221; notice <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/instagram-finds-new-ad-space-at-the-end-of-your-feed-with-launch-of-suggested-posts-feature/">to push suggested posts and ads</a> in an attempt to keep users engaged even after they had reached a stopping point.</p>
<p>If Instagram was serious about addressing mental health, it could designate a time to show users a reminder within its app, and <em>then</em> offer controls that would allow users to turn it off or adjust the duration. Its competitor TikTok already does this by inserting videos into users&#8217; For You feeds that suggest it&#8217;s time to take a break after the user has been scrolling for too long. TikTok <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/features/tiktok-tips-telling-users-log-off-get-outdoors-sleep">also leverages influencers</a> with millions of followers to issue these warnings, which can be more effective than just a pop-up notification.</p>
<p>Mosseri says the new &#8220;Take a Break&#8221; reminders are launching this week as a test with a limited number of users, for the time being, but the company expects to roll out the feature publicly in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The euphoria around Rivian kicked into overdrive Wednesday as it debuted as a publicly traded company, with an opening share price of $106.75.</p>
<p>If that sticks, it would give Rivian an implied valuation of $90 billion. The opening trade was nearly 37% higher than its listed IPO price of $78. That absolute eye-popping number makes Rivian one of the largest IPOs in U.S. history and puts its market cap above GM as well as one of its backers, Ford (GM&#8217;s market cap is $86.31 billion; Ford&#8217;s is $78.2 billion).</p>
<p>That share price continued to rise after it began trading around 1 pm ET, hitting as high as $119 a share before falling to about $112.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232202" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The historic size of the Rivian IPO is not lost on founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. However, and perhaps as expected, he is bullish on the future of EVs, noting in a recent interview that the 90 to 100 million vehicles sold each year will transition to electric in the next 10 to 20 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, the way investors look at the space is really valuing what the future looks like,&#8221; Scaringe said. &#8220;In not too much time, 100% of the business will be electric.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Rivian is very early in terms of its vehicles and launch, Scaringe said investors see and are valuing the company based on its future potential as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re evaluating us purely on our P&amp;L (profit/loss) today, I think they&#8217;d be missing the point of the company; they&#8217;re, of course looking at what they think the company is capable of achieving over time,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What Rivian is capable of achieving has yet to be proven; investors, customers and industry observers will learn that soon enough. However, its future plans are certainly ambitious and extend far beyond the first two consumer vehicles ‚Äî the R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV ‚Äî and its partnership with Amazon to produce 100,000 electric commercial delivery vans by 2024. Patent documents as well as Scaringe&#8217;s own comments to TechCrunch show that Rivian plans to launch a range of consumer and commercial products.</p>
<p>Investors may also be betting that Rivian&#8217;s push to become vertically integrated ‚Äî in the long term it even plans to develop its own battery cell ‚Äî will make the company a technology leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really critical to control and vertically integrate what we would think of as the core technology stack ‚Äî so all the electronics in the vehicle, the full software stack, the propulsion layer in the vehicle,&#8221; Scaringe said. &#8220;I would say among all those things, the most important is actually software and electronics.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Wild IPO ride</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s been a wild ride since Rivian made its IPO filing public last month (it filed confidentially for the IPO in August). That filing &#8212; a detailed snapshot of Rivian&#8217;s financial standing, risks and opportunities &#8212; shows a company burning through cash as it takes on the capital-intensive task of designing, developing, producing and then selling electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The company planned to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also had an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares.</p>
<p>To say that investor demand has been frenetic is perhaps the understatement of 2021. Rivian not only upped its targeted share price twice, finally listing its initial public offering at $78 a share, it also added more and offered 153 million shares of common stock, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001874178/000119312521324915/d439957ds1mef.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory filing</a> was posted late Tuesday evening. Rivian also gave underwriters an option to buy another 22.95 million shares, a higher number than previously expected.</p>
<p>The size of the IPO also benefits some of its biggest backers. Amazon holds a 20% stake and Ford has a 12% stake in Rivian.</p>
<p>The run up in Rivian&#8217;s stock is notable for a number of reasons. For instance, it is now valued more than established automakers that produce and sell millions of vehicles every year.</p>
<p>In contrast, the revenues are light and the expenses are high over at Rivian.</p>
<p>The company has hired thousands of employees over several facilities, including its factory in Normal, Illinois. The company now employs more than 9,000 people, Scaringe told TechCrunch in an interview Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Scaringe&#8217;s obsession with vertical integration has also pushed up R&amp;D costs. (The company spent $766 million on R&amp;D in 2020. In the first half of 2021, the company spent $683 million on R&amp;D.)</p>
<p>As a result, net losses have expanded as it prepared for production of the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. The company posted a net loss of $994 million in the first half of 2021 alone, far more than double its $377 million net loss the company posted in the same period of 2020.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, revenues are trickling in as deliveries of its R1T to customers, which began last month, begin to ramp up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is hoping to advance its reusability program one step forward tonight, when it will attempt to recover the booster from its Electron rocket for the third time.</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúLove at First Insight‚Äù mission is set to take off at 11:25 PM EST from the company‚Äôs launch facility on New Zealand‚Äôs Mahia Peninsula. <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/live-stream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can watch the launch live on Rocket Lab‚Äôs website here</a>.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab has successfully recovered the first-stage booster twice before, the only other company besides SpaceX to do so. The first recovery took place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/">November 2020</a> and then again in May 2021, though that latter mission resulted in a complete loss of payload (more on that below). Both boosters made a splashdown via parachute, and if all goes to plan, the booster tonight will too. But this recovery attempt has an added twist: this time, a helicopter will be hovering nearby to track and observe the booster as it makes its descent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The addition of the helicopter is significant; it means Rocket Lab is getting closer to attempting its ultimate plan for reusability: using a parachute to slow the velocity of the booster enough that the helicopter can capture it in mid-air. While the helicopter won‚Äôt be attempting a mid-air capture tonight, it will be performing requisite tests to ensure the concept of operations is viable in the future.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve perfected Electron‚Äôs controlled descent, demonstrated flawless parachute deployment, and successfully plucked stages from the ocean. Now we‚Äôre gearing up for the next stage ‚Äì preparing to use a helicopter to catch a rocket as it descends to Earth from space,‚Äù CEO Peter Beck said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ambitious, but with each recovery mission we‚Äôve iterated and refined the hardware and processes to make the impossible ordinary.‚Äù</p>
<p>The primary goal of the mission will be to send two BlackSky Earth imaging satellites to orbit, part of a rapid five-launch agreement for BlackSky between Rocket Lab and launch services provider Spaceflight Inc. The satellites were originally scheduled to go up in August, part of a launch schedule that included two other dedicated missions, but those were delayed due to lockdown restrictions caused by a small outbreak of coronavirus in New Zealand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOperations have experienced disruptions due to some of the most restrictive COVID-19 measures globally, including current stay-at-home orders which prevent launch operations from taking place,‚Äù CEO Peter Beck told investors during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/rocket-labs-order-backlog-tops-141m-as-the-company-inks-five-launch-deal-with-kineis/">a third-quarter earnings call</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two BlackSky satellites will join seven others already in orbit, part of the geospatial intelligence company‚Äôs larger plans to grow its constellation to 14 satellites by the end of this year. Earlier this year, two BlackSky satellites <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/rocket-labs-20th-electron-launch-ends-in-failure-with-the-loss-of-its-payload/">were lost due to a significant anomaly</a> that occurred shortly after the Electron‚Äôs second-stage ignited.</p>
<p>This is Rocket Lab‚Äôs twenty-second¬†Electron launch and the fifth mission this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People subscribe to music so why wouldn‚Äôt they subscribe to carbon offsetting to alleviate their conscience about the climate crisis? That‚Äôs partly the thinking behind UK startup <a href="https://ecologi.com">Ecologi</a>, which uses the funds to plant 1m trees every 10 days in places like Africa, and Latin America, as well as doing things like protecting peatlands in Indonesia. By doing this it reduces your carbon footprint by buying carbon offsets tailored to what you consume.</p>
<p>In April, Ecologi closed a seed investment round of $5.75m (¬£4.05m) at a pre-money valuation of ¬£16.5m from lead investor General Catalyst, with and Entr√©e Capital.<br />
¬†<br />
The subscription service &#8211; used by 35,000 individuals and businesses  &#8211; allows members to ‚Äú<a href="https://ecologi.com/elliot?treeId=60bcf53a4dd2669e3bd5750f">grow their own forest</a>‚Äù with at least 12 trees a month and offset their carbon footprint by funding a wide range of the carbon reducing projects.</p>
<p>Launching in 2019 and bootstrapped until now, the company also puts all receipts, certificates, board minutes and financial statements all up on their <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dACvzjE5nBE1cKZBAhYzsUa7rIiLJqCWXVgY4bNS8_Q/edit#gid=1742437033">public ledger</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232195" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It‚Äôs now hit a pre-money valuation of ¬£75m after exceeding its ¬£2m crowdfunding target on the UK‚Äôs Crowdcube platform. The money will be used for product development, growing its team and expanding in the US and EU. It&#8217;s also now awaiting B-Corp certification.</p>
<p>In early 2022 the company also plans to launch <a href="https://ecologi.com/business/ecologi-zero">Ecologi Zero</a>, its real time carbon footprinting software for businesses.</p>
<p>This would compete with other carbon footprinting SaaS startups such as Normative, Spherics, Plan A and others.</p>
<p>Ecologi claims to have grown by more than 650% in nine months, and increased its impact through carbon reductions by 330% in the last year. In January 2021, turnover was at ¬£3.0m ARR (annual recurring revenue), but the company projects it will end the year with ¬£8.5m ARR.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In total, the company claims to have planted over 25 million trees and offset 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. The majority of these trees were planted across Madagascar, Mozambique, Nicaragua, the United States, Australia, the UK, and Kenya. Projects the company supported in the quarter included protecting peatlands in Indonesia and producing energy from landfill gas in Turkey and from waste rice husks in India.<br />
¬†<br />
Elliot Coad, CEO and co-founder, commented: ‚ÄúCommunity ownership is at the heart of what we do, and has been the driving force behind our growth over the last two years, so we felt it was only fitting that we offered our loyal subscribers the chance to own a stake in Ecologi.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Toronto Transit Commission has confirmed that the personal information of tens of thousands of employees may have been compromised as a result of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack on its systems last month.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p>The TTC, which operates Toronto&#8217;s bus, subway, streetcar and paratransit systems, said <a href="https://www.ttc.ca/news/2021/November/TTC-provides-update-on-cyber-security-incident" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a statement</a> that the compromised data includes the names, addresses and Social Insurance Numbers of 25,000 past and present employees. The agency said it&#8217;s continuing to investigate whether a &#8220;small number&#8221; of customers and vendors have also been affected.</p>
<p>The agency added that while there is ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù that any of the information has been misused, it is notifying those individuals affected and will provide them with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/credit-monitoring/">credit monitoring</a> and identity theft protection. The TCC has also advised employees to call their banks and alert them of the security breach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232142" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The ransomware attack on October 29 resulted in problems with vehicle tracking and &#8220;next bus&#8221; systems, and the loss of the online Wheel-Trans booking system, said TTC chief executive Rick Leary. He added that the incident resulted in &#8220;a number of the TTC‚Äôs servers being encrypted and locked,‚Äù<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span>While most customer-facing systems have been restored already, the TTC‚Äôs internal email system remains offline.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn behalf of the entire organization, I want to express my deep regret that this has occurred to everyone who may be impacted,‚Äù said Leary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span>‚ÄúIt is not lost on me that organizations like ours are entrusted with significant amounts of personal information and it is essential that we do our best to protect it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the coming weeks, we will continue rebuilding the remaining impacted servers and internal services, like re-establishing external e-mail capabilities. But in truth, and based on the experiences of other organizations, this could take some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leary added the fact there have been nearly 700 similar cybersecurity attacks involving public and private sectors groups in Canada. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On October 30, the day before TCC&#8217;s ransomware attack, a separate cyberattack <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/health-services-it-outage-update-nov-1-1.6232426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck</a> Newfoundland and Labrador&#8217;s health system data centres. In <a href="https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2021/exec/1109n07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> released this week, the provincial government said ‚Äúit has been determined that some personal information and personal health information was accessed from the systems.‚Äù</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube today announced its decision to make the &#8220;dislike&#8221; count on videos private across its platform. The decision is likely to be controversial given the extent that it impacts the public&#8217;s visibility into a video&#8217;s reception. But YouTube believes the change will better protect its creators from harassment and reduce the threat of what it calls &#8220;dislike attacks&#8221; &#8212; essentially, when a group teams up to drive up the number of dislikes a video receives.</p>
<p>The company says that while dislike counts won&#8217;t be visible to the public, it&#8217;s not removing the dislike button itself. Users can still click the thumbs down button on videos to signal their dislike to creators privately. Meanwhile, creators will be able to track their dislikes in YouTube Studio alongside other analytics about their video&#8217;s performance, if they choose.</p>
<p>The change follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/youtube-tests-hiding-dislike-counts-on-videos/">an experiment YouTube ran earlier this year</a> whose goal was to determine if these sorts of changes would reduce dislike attacks and creator harassment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232098" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the time, YouTube explained that public dislike counts can affect creators&#8217; well-being and may motivate targeted campaigns to add dislikes to videos. While that&#8217;s true, dislikes can also serve as a signal to others when videos are clickbait, spam or misleading, which can be useful.</p>
<p>YouTube said it had also heard from smaller creators and others who were just getting started on the platform that they felt they were being unfairly targeted by dislike attacks. The experiment confirmed this was true &#8212; creators with smaller channels were targeted with dislike attacks more than larger creators were.</p>
<p>YouTube declined to share the specific details or the data collected through those experiments when TechCrunch asked, however. But it said it ran its tests for &#8220;multiple months&#8221; and conducted &#8220;in-depth analysis of the impact&#8221; as to how the changes affected both users and creators alike.</p>
<p>The company had experimented with different designs for removing the dislike counts, including one where the word &#8220;Dislike&#8221; appeared underneath the thumbs down button instead of the number of dislikes. This is the design the company has now settled on, which is less of a disruptive change to the row of engagement buttons beneath a video.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2232172" style="width: 350px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232172" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2232172" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?w=340" alt="" width="340" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=75,150 75w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=150,300 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=340,680 340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/youtube-dislike.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232172" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</em></p></div></p>
<p>The company would not be the first major platform to experiment with the idea of reducing the public visibility of signals that convey user sentiment. For similar mental health-related reasons, Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/instagram-private-like-counts/">a couple of years ago</a> began tests to hide its Like counts globally. It believed the focus on achieving Likes could be detrimental to its community and may make creators less comfortable expressing themselves on the platform. Ultimately, though, neither Facebook nor Instagram could fully commit to a decision and instead put <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/facebook-and-instagram-will-now-allow-users-to-hide-like-counts-on-posts/">the power to hide Likes back under users&#8217; control</a> &#8212; a move that effectively kept the status quo intact.</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s changes to the &#8220;dislike&#8221; count are being introduced at a time when there&#8217;s been a public reckoning over big tech and its impact on mental health, particularly when it comes to minors. Companies have been rethinking how their systems are designed to target and influence their user base, as well as what sort of changes they can make ahead of coming regulations. In a number of markets, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">lawmakers</a> have been dragging in tech execs to hearings &#8212; YouTube included &#8212; and are crafting legislation aimed at reigning in some of tech&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/why-facebooks-angry-emoji-should-interest-the-us-sec/">more</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/the-fda-should-regulate-instagrams-algorithm-as-a-drug/">problematic elements</a>. Mental health is only one area of regulatory interest, though, along with ad targeting, privacy,¬†<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/leak-shows-facebooks-business-model-needs-regulating-says-mep/">algorithmic boosting</a> of misinformation and more.</p>
<p>In YouTube&#8217;s case, the company has attempted to get ahead of some of the required changes by implementing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">increased protections and privacy features</a> for users ages 13 to 17 while also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/youtube-warns-creators-it-will-start-to-demonetize-low-quality-kids-videos-next-month/">decreasing the monetization potential</a> for &#8220;unhealthy&#8221; kids&#8217; content. But the larger shift in the market is also pushing companies to consider the other areas of their platforms that are potentially toxic to broad groups of people.</p>
<p>That said, YouTube told TechCrunch today&#8217;s removal of the dislike count is not being guided by any regulatory changes, but rather its support for creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proactively making this change because YouTube has a responsibility to protect creators, especially smaller creators, from harassment and dislike attacks,&#8221; a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The company, of course, is also rolling this out when the battle for creator talent is becoming hugely competitive among tech giants. Today&#8217;s social platforms are establishing funds to retain their top creators amid increased competition, particularly from the growing threat of TikTok. YouTube this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">announced a $100 million creator fund</a> to jumpstart its short-form video platform, for example. And, over the past year or so, it&#8217;s introduced several new <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/make-youtube-more-inclusive-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/make-youtube-more-inclusive-platform/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636565624705000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3628II0au1cO-CTWEfIMN7">features</a> and <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/an-update-to-our-harassment-policy/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636565624705000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1l6b58XGAH7ZhyGkzzxhB7">policies</a> aimed at improving the creator experience.</p>
<p>The changes to the dislike count will roll out globally across YouTube&#8217;s platform starting today, including all devices and the web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The sales process can be chaotic, with data flowing in from a variety of sources and a number of people involved. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce bought Slack</a> for more than $27 billion last year because it recognized it could be the glue that holds this together. <a href="https://momentum.io/">Momentum</a>, an early-stage startup, wants to build on that relationship by being the automated collaboration layer between sales and the rest of the organization.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $5 million seed round led by Basis Set Ventures with participation from Inovia Capital, Leadout Capital, South Park Commons and a group of industry angels.</p>
<p>Momentum CEO and co-founder Santiago Suarez Ordo√±ez said the company originally wanted to build a deal room on top of Slack, but when Salesforce took that route in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/after-spending-28b-salesforce-announces-first-direct-integrations-with-slack/">its first round of Slack integrations</a> in August, the company decided to attack a different problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232111" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s interesting, and I think this is what ultimately differentiates us from what Salesforce could put together, is as we went down that path of deal rooms and collaboration and we delivered value there, we started realizing that collaboration and sales can be so much more,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said the founders recognized that salespeople need to connect not only to Slack and Salesforce &#8212; they need to connect with tools like Google Calendar, Asana and Jira, and automate follow-ups from a single place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Momentum ended up turning into a platform that allowed those people to streamline that process. Instead of going into Jira and knowing [how to] file a ticket for my security team, I just go to Momentum and raise my hand and I say &#8216;I need a security review,&#8217; and Momentum has codified the process of finding where to go, creating the ticket, sharing all the context about the deal in that ticket for the rep, and the rep doesn&#8217;t have to do anything at that point,&#8221; Suarez Ordo√±ez explained.</p>
<p>He said that while they still have the deal-room functionality along with this task-driven capability, the plan is to build on that to create a complete platform of similar automated workflows inside Slack, such as getting approval for a discount rate or asking for engineering support for a sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company just hired its 14th employee since closing the seed round in August. The company has a diverse founding team that includes Suarez Ordo√±ez&#8217;s wife &#8212; COO Ashley Wilson &#8212; and CTO Moiz Virani. The company said it takes building a diverse team extremely seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually have a mandate from the top to drive diversity and inclusion,&#8221; Suarez Ordo√±ez said. &#8220;In fact, one of our investors made it a term in their investment and it ended up being what made us go in with them and make room for them in our round as an investor.&#8221; He added that half the board is female at this early stage and that two of the three investor partners in the round are women.</p>
<p>They launched the company last year amid the heart of the pandemic. &#8220;One of the craziest things about it is that we already had half a dozen employees and customers and we had raised millions of dollars and 99% of that work had happened sitting at the kitchen table in my house, which was quite a wild realization of what happened,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is now operating at least part of the time out of shared spaces, but he said that being together makes it feel more real to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that it wasn&#8217;t real half a year ago, [but the fact that] we couldn&#8217;t be together was just just a weird artifact of how the world was working,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My company wants to send one of its employees to India to open an office there. He came to the United States from India as a child on a visa, but he now has DACA status. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Can he take on this project and still be able to return to the United States? Will this impact his ability to renew DACA? Are there any other potential repercussions that we should keep in mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>‚Äî Devoted to Dreamers</strong></p>
<p>Dear Devoted,</p>
<p>I appreciate that you and your company are supporting Dreamers and providing peace of mind for your employee. My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, and I have worked with many Dreamers to help them obtain and renew DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) so they can attend university and work. Like other immigrants, Dreamers have to work harder to live the American dream, particularly since the DACA program has faced so many challenges in recent years, which Anita and I chatted about on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/096-daca-in-tech/">podcast</a>.</p>

<h2>Traveling abroad with Advance Parole</h2>
<p>To answer your first question, your employee can travel to India to set up your office there only if he gets what‚Äôs called an ‚ÄúAdvance Parole‚Äù document from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</p>
<p>Since the U.S. ended its COVID-related travel restrictions from India this week, your employee could probably return to the United States with an approved Advance Parole document, complete COVID-19 vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test. You and your employee should know this comes with some risk.</p>
<p>For Advance Parole, your employee (who already has DACA) would have to file <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-131">Form I-131</a> (Application for Travel Document) to USCIS and receive approval <em>before </em>he leaves for India. USCIS usually takes eight months or more these days to process travel document applications due to pandemic-related backlogs. Advance Parole is basically a travel document that allows DACA recipients living inside the United States to travel abroad temporarily for up to a year and seek to reenter the United States.</p>
<p>At its discretion, USCIS may grant Advance Parole for one of three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educational purposes, such as academic research or a semester-long study abroad program.</li>
<li>Employment purposes, such as overseas projects, conferences, training, interviews or meeting with clients.</li>
<li>Humanitarian purposes, such as to receive medical treatment, visit an ailing relative or attend the funeral of a family member.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on our experience, DACA recipients requesting Advance Parole based on employment purposes tends to be more difficult to obtain. USCIS adjudicators seem to be more willing to approve Advance Parole based on humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p>Some things to keep in mind: Your employee should not leave the U.S. before USCIS issues the Advance Parole document, otherwise his departure from the U.S. will automatically terminate his DACA status, his application for Advance Parole will be considered abandoned and he will not be able to reenter the U.S. In addition, he must have a valid passport from his country of citizenship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://evergrow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evergrow</a>, a stealth climate fintech startup, just landed over $7 million in seed funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a two-pronged approach, Evergrow aims to be the world‚Äôs first dedicated carbon offtake company &#8212; rapidly funding climate developer projects and initiating long-term offtake agreements for these projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the larger seed rounds of 2021 in the industry, the raise was led by XYZ Venture Capital and Congruent Ventures with participation from First Round Capital, Garuda Ventures, MCJ Collective, Skyview Ventures and numerous other individual investors.¬†</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232035" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The problem with climate project financing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are core issues in launching and scaling a successful climate project.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Banks require an offtake contract &#8211; guarantee purchase of carbon credits created by the project &#8211; to underwrite any financing; securing an offtake contract is difficult when a company is young.¬† </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/key-takeaways-from-the-sosv-climate-tech-summit/?cx_testId=6&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_undefined&amp;cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A VC‚Äôs expectation on ROI often clashes with industry standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Multiple stakeholders &#8212; insurance, investors, offtakers, debt investors and the project developer themselves &#8212; create long financing timelines, intensive negotiation and extremely complex underwriting processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, climate risk underwriters and insurers have lacked data to create efficient underwriting processes. Each time a project turns up, there is an entirely new underwriting model developed. Finally, securing an offtake contract is done one-to-one. This means projects without an offtake agreement from the onset will have to pander to buyers after the fact.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232043" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232043" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2232043" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/EVERGROW-HEADSHOTS23830510-0036.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232043" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ulysses Ortega</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrow founders James Richards and Luke Whiting aim to streamline and standardize this process.¬†</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have set the goal internally of supporting the avoidance, reduction or removal of one gigaton of CO2e by 2030; scaling to a billion tons a year shortly there after,&#8221; Richards states.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With CEO Richards‚Äô background as a former Wall Street lawyer, serial entrepreneur and early-stage investor, and Whiting‚Äôs data and software experience as former founding COO of Clearbit, Evergrow shows promise in tackling this enormous challenge. The growth of the carbon markets over the past two years suggests the endeavor could be lucrative as the long-term offtake carbon purchase price is set.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äú[Evergrow] can reduce the complexity two ways,&#8221; Richards said. ‚ÄúOne, we can do the work upfront to make a programmatic underwriting and funding model for each project type. And second, we can use data and technology to underwrite or do the majority of the heavy lifting and underwriting versus humans. And so our goal internally is to be almost an order of magnitude faster in terms of time to close than a traditional project financial.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked for details on the underwriting structure itself and the capital partners who back them, Richards said, ‚ÄúWe aren&#8217;t ready to describe this in detail yet, but we&#8217;re exploring a range of structures with our capital partners to meet their needs. &#8230; We&#8217;re actively building up a base of multiple financial partners.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232041" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232041" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2232041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="163" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png 2760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=1536,837 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=2048,1116 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.22-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Evergrow</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Richards did provide insight on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they will be judging risk. Evergrow will utilize historical data points to predict which sets of projects can be underwritten and how. Standardizing the underwriting process is only possible now because the industry has hit a critical mass of data points and success metrics for carbon projects.</span></p>
<h2>Why long-term offtake contracts matter and how they‚Äôll make money</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many financial institutions won‚Äôt consider financing climate projects unless they have a dedicated offtake contract. The risk is considered too great.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúBy bringing long-term offtake contracts to the carbon markets, we provide price certainty and unlock capital for these projects,‚Äù Richards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/09/15/2297338/0/en/Voluntary-Carbon-Markets-Rocket-in-2021-On-Track-to-Break-1B-for-First-Time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecosystem Marketplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the voluntary carbon market has ‚Äúposted a near-60% increase in value from last year ‚Ä¶ [with] markets on track to hit $1B in transactions by the end of this year.‚Äù Judging by the growth rate, long-term offtake contracts could generate a significant amount of returns for Evergrow‚Äôs capital partners.</span></p>
<h2>Fragmented competition and market validations</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are multiple players across the different parts Evergrow aims to streamline. Long-term offtake contracts are not new to commodities, though newer in the carbon markets. There is a growing trend among corporations to create long-term offtake contracts with climate projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://www.swissre.com/media/news-releases/nr-20210825-swiss-re-climeworks-partnership.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiss Re‚Äôs partnership with Climeworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; valued up to $10 million &#8212; is one of the largest long-term offtake contracts to date. The large insurer and reinsurer </span><a href="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/siriuspoint-strategic-partnership-parameter-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SiriusPint Ltd. partnered with Parameter Climate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides full-service climate underwriting and distribution.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232042" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232042" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2232042 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="144" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png 2574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=150,72 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=300,144 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=768,368 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=680,326 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=1536,736 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=2048,982 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-08-at-12.01.33-PM-1.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2232042" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Evergrow</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrow believes that these companies are signals for market readiness, not necessarily direct competitors.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe were really pleased to see what Swiss Re did with Climeworks because we think it&#8217;s great validation of the market,‚Äù Richards said. ‚ÄúWhen a balance sheet as large as Swiss Re thinks that it&#8217;s worthwhile to enter this market and provide what we&#8217;re providing, that&#8217;s really great validation. The opportunity has to be measured in the billions in order for Swiss Re to even think about it or care about it. That was great validation for us.‚Äù</span></p>
<h2>It‚Äôs not a marketplace</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final step after underwriting, funding and signing the offtake agreement is the eventual return to the capital partners. One competitor, Puro.earth, created a carbon removal marketplace simplifying developers‚Äô access to offtakers. When asked about creating one-to-one marketplace similar to this, Richards was quick to clarify.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúEvergrow does not match offtake contracts to investors on a deal-by-deal basis,‚Äù Richards said. ‚ÄúWhen you borrow money from Brex, whether on a credit card or working capital line, it&#8217;s not like Brex matches you with an investor on the backend who gets to set the price and you know, say yes or no. Instead, Brex has arranged warehouse financing and more, so Brex can give you that financing immediately. It all gets pooled and then the investors take the pool of return.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analogy is especially relevant because Brex CFO Michael Tannenbaum is an investor in Evergrow, as well.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe&#8217;re hoping to emulate that kind of a structure, where we raise one or more facilities from the capital markets into which all of our offtake contracts get pooled,‚Äù Richards said. ‚ÄúInvestors get the benefit of aggregation and pooling and also levered exposure to the underlying.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The set price of a long-term offtake agreement allows stability for the developer and financing partners with understandable risk growth. The silver bullet lies in Evergrow‚Äôs ability to efficiently underwrite the right products, though without the specifics on the exact underwriting model, it‚Äôs tough to fully predict their success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evergrow has a handful of notable individuals investing in the startup &#8212; Bridgewater Associates Sustainability investor Karen Karniol-Tambour, Plaid CEO Zach Perret and Instacart co-founder Max Mullen, among others. Evergrow will start in California and expand to the U.S. with hopes of international expansion depending on the climate project type. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Christopher Male‚Äôs son was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in 2018, the long-time investor found himself in unfamiliar territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúAt the time, I literally knew the word ‚Äòautism,‚Äô and that was about it,‚Äù he recalls.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to help his son, Male immersed himself in the topic and found what he described as an ‚Äúincredibly fragmented and polarized community and marketplace, inadequate, antiquated solutions with hefty price tags and long wait lines.‚Äù</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231310" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He determined there was ‚Äúno scientific understanding of what was happening in the marketplace.‚Äù In part driven by capitalism but mostly driven by an eagerness to help his child and others like him, Male dove in and, earlier this year, teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian O&#8217;Callaghan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to found t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span><a href="https://autismimpact.fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Autism Impact Fund (AIF)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fund‚Äôs mission is to &#8220;revolutionize the status quo for diagnosing treating and living with autism through a venture-capital model.‚Äù¬† So far, AIF has invested in seven early-stage companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIF brought</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Sarrazin </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to serve as its chief investment officer and managing partner. Male and Sarrazin manage the fund‚Äôs day-to-day operations.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need is there. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%2054%20children%20has%20been%20identified,occur%20in%20all%20racial%2C%20ethnic%2C%20and%20socioeconomic%20groups." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">impacts 1 in 54 children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and millions of families around the world, according to the CDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe created the Autism Impact Fund with the ambition of becoming the investment and innovation arm of the autism community,‚Äù said Male. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThis is just a massive societal issue with a system that is very, very broken, and our goal is to change that system.‚Äù</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly a decade, Male operated his family‚Äôs investment office. He then launched his own venture fund. But he admits there has been no role in his life more important than his current one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIF has enlisted a high-profile group of advisors, including Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who has</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">twin boys with autism; Jennifer Frist of the Frist Center for Autism &amp; Innovation at Vanderbilt University; and Bob Nelson, co-founder and managing director of ARCH Venture Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Male declined to reveal AIF‚Äôs LPs, he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said they include high net worth institutions and family offices. The fund is actively fundraising so Male could not comment on those plans, other than to say things were going well.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe market for us has been quite positive and on track, so we‚Äôre further ahead than we thought we would be,‚Äù he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIF makes direct investments across a variety of sectors, such as biology, environment and behavior, and stages of financing. It is intentionally focused on for-profit companies so that its work doesn‚Äôt overlap with nonprofits.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äú</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not just a group of individuals. We&#8217;re professional investors,‚Äù Male said. ‚ÄúWe&#8217;re also bringing together the community through academics, government institutions, nonprofits and foundations.‚Äù</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portfolio companies include Axial, which is developing gut-restricted small molecule agents intended for the treatment of core autism symptoms; BioROSA, which is developing a biomarker for autism; Floreo, which provides a range of therapies through an AI-driven virtual reality platform; and Joshin, a digital care platform for people with special needs whose funding TechCrunch </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/minnesota-twins-raise-3m-to-increase-accessibility-to-disability-care/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently covered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Slattery and Marie Causey founded Boston area startup </span><a href="http://www.biorosa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BioROSA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is developing a biomarker that aims to detect ASD in children as young as 18 months, in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThat would bring down the average age of diagnosis, which is currently four plus years and is very skewed with minority and less affluent populations not doing well with that,‚Äù Male told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BioROSA has raised just north of $3 million, including a round in which AIF participated in July.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThere is strong academic research that supports the thesis that this company is built on,‚Äù Slattery said. ‚ÄúOur goal is to allow for early detection, and transform the diagnostic standard of care.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For families with autism, the investments made by AIF could be life-changing &#8212; and you can‚Äôt get much more meaningful than that.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://getcacheflow.com/">Cacheflow</a> this morning announced its exit from stealth and a seed round worth $6 million.</p>
<p>The startup is a wager that the software buying experience of today is antiquated &#8212; and a rising source of frustration. So, Cacheflow is building a hybrid buying service and financing solution to make it simpler.</p>
<p>On the money side of things, <a href="https://www.ggvc.com/team/glenn-solomon/">GGV&#8217;s Glenn Solomon</a> led the company&#8217;s seed round, which also saw participation from <a href="https://pelionvp.com/">Pelion Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.neythrifuturesfund.com/">Neythri Futures Fund</a>, a collective of South Asian women looking to change the ratio in venture capital investing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232021" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cacheflow CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/sarikagarg">Sarika Garg</a> emphasized to TechCrunch the importance of having a diverse cap table in the round, and at her company more broadly. Per Neythri Futures Fund, a slim quarter of a percent of U.S. venture partners are South Asian women, meaning that getting the group onto the Cacheflow ownership docket early could provide material upside to the investor demographic if the company succeeds.</p>
<p>Thematically, Cacheflow&#8217;s market wager makes sense. According to Garg, companies are no longer buying software in long procurement cycles that involve golf and dinners. Correct. And modern corporations are buying more discrete pieces of software than ever before. Also correct. But, almost oddly, although companies need more software, the selling process is still somewhat manual, with myriad phone calls and documents and e-signatures. Anyone who has friends working in SaaS sales can confirm this.</p>
<p>With most companies wanting to sell yearly contracts with upfront payments for cash flow reasons, SaaS sales can prove oddly rigid in the modern era, when you&#8217;d expect more flexibility. To attack that issue, Cacheflow wants to offer buyers a number of payment options while also providing upfront cash to software companies.</p>
<p>Cacheflow will let customers choose to pay for their software contract monthly, quarterly or even on a deferred basis. This may help customers buy software even when they have exhausted a particular budget cycle, Garg said. And that means that software concerns can sell more consistently without having to wait for yearly budgets to reset late in the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the risk that Cacheflow will take on regarding non-payment of a contract &#8212; if the company allows a software customer to defer payment on a yearly contract while also paying the provider upfront, there&#8217;s risk inherent &#8212; Garg said that her company can peer into a customer firm&#8217;s SaaS metrics and properly take into account the chance of customer infidelity.</p>
<p>I presume that the startup will get better at that work as it grows its customer base. Today Cacheflow has a few pilot customers, with intentions to bolster its roster in the coming months. It&#8217;s just coming out of stealth, mind, so it&#8217;s still early days on an operating basis.</p>
<p>Checkout technologies in general have had a big few quarters, with names <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">like Checkout.com,</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/">¬†Fast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/bolt-adds-75m-to-its-series-c-as-the-battle-to-rule-online-checkout-continues/">Bolt raising oodles of boodle</a>. And we&#8217;ve seen SaaS financing services also scale rapidly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">like Pipe</a>. Cacheflow is a little bit of both.</p>
<p>Cacheflow thinks that it can make the SaaS buying process more flexible &#8212; and faster. That could mean better sales results for software companies and simpler procurement for software customers. Given the growing bulk of the software market more generally, the goals make sense. From here, it&#8217;s up to Cacheflow to prove that it can embed its software into a great number of SaaS checkout processes and generate material top line from its labors.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch‚Äôs venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show, the time of the week when we niche down to a single topic. Today we spoke about the revolution within agriculture otherwise known as <strong>vertical farming</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> spoke to hardware editor <a href="http://twitter.com/bheater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Heater</a>, who recently wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1/">TC-1 about Bowery Farming </a>spanning over 11,000 words and topics such as the taste of sustainable turnips and produce sections at grocery stores. The core of his multi-part exploration, though, was built around a question: Can Bowery Farms bring the newest and most innovative technologies to bear on civilization‚Äôs oldest and most optimized industry?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231506" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As a result, our episode went down a lot of tasty rabbit holes. We spoke about the current state of vertical farming, the challenges that come with commercialization and our struggling climate, and if your local dairy farm is actually thinking about adding a robot to their staff.</p>
<p>There was more to chew on, including the balance between sustainability and profit, how to think about carbon footprints, the commercialization of vertical farming today, and how some folks are spending $30 on a strawberry. We had a lovely time and will have Brian back on the pod.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the TC-1 if you&#8217;re interested:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-origin/">Bowery Farming is forcing us all to look up at the future of vertical agriculture </a>(3,500 words/14 minutes) ‚Äî explores the evolution of vertical farming, its expansion in Japan and how Bowery Farming was started to bring indoor farming to the masses in the United States.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">Hacking lettuce for taste and profit</a>¬†(2,500 words/10 minutes) ‚Äî evaluates how Bowery collects data from its farms in order to optimize flavor while also potentially expanding its produce line into new categories like strawberries and turnips.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter and ViacomCBS today announced a sizable global deal that will see the social media platform streaming digital content from across the ViacomCBS portfolio of news, sports and entertainment brands &#8212; including content from live events, TV shows and other franchises. In addition, ViacomCBS-owned streaming service Paramount+ will host three &#8220;Twitter Watch Parties&#8221; designed to capitalize on Twitter&#8217;s ability to serve as a second screen and a home to fan communities and conversations.</p>
<p>The companies did not specify which Paramount+ shows would be hosted as Watch Parties, only noting that they would be original series.</p>
<p>The content partnership represents a significant expansion of Twitter&#8217;s prior deal with the media giant. Before, Twitter&#8217;s deal had been a U.S.-only partnership with just Viacom, ahead of the ViacomCBS merger. The renewed agreement is now a multi-year, global deal and expands to include the entire ViacomCBS portfolio. That means it also now includes news and sports, instead of only entertainment properties, as before. The companies declined to detail the financial terms, however.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232046" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The ViacomCBS umbrella today covers a wide range of brands, such as BET, CBS Television Network, CBS News, CBS Sports, Channel 5, CMT, Comedy Central, MTV, Network 10, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network and Telefe.</p>
<p>In recent months, Twitter and ViacomCBS have partnered on select live events, including the 2021 MTV Music Video Awards, which aired its live pre-show on Twitter, and the BET Awards, which livestreamed from the red carpet to Twitter. It&#8217;s likely that under the new agreement, Twitter users will gain continued access to these types of events. As for which other properties and programs will be featured on Twitter in the months ahead, ViacomCBS would not say.</p>
<p>While the new agreement is focused on hosting digital content, it will also involve Twitter&#8217;s marketing support. The ViacomCBS programs will be eligible for both marketing support and brand sponsorship sales through Twitter&#8217;s Amplify program, which connects ViacomCBS&#8217; video with Twitter&#8217;s paid reach and targeting, the company said. ViacomCBS will also leverage other marketing features around live video, real-time highlights and Twitter Moments.</p>
<p>Twitter in previous years had heavily focused on its ability to serve live video content to its users, by doing things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/twitter-now-puts-live-broadcasts-at-the-top-of-your-timeline/">pinning live video to the top of the Timeline</a>, offering livestreamed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/twitter-announces-new-live-shows-from-the-wnba-buzzfeed-live-nation-and-more/">events</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/twitter-stream-concerts/">concerts</a>, and more. But over time, news of those types of partnerships dwindled. Twitter even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/periscope-will-shut-down-by-march-twitter-confirms/">shut down</a> its own livestreaming app Periscope to focus more on its new set of social features, like Fleets, Spaces, Communities, Super Follows and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Twitter is again doing deals to make digital content a part of its core offering. In early 2021, for example,<a href="https://together.nbcuni.com/news/nbcu-twitter-expand-digital-content-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> NBCUniversal and Twitter announced</a> their own global, multi-year partnership, similar to this with ViacomCBS.</p>
<p>&#8220;We‚Äôre thrilled to extend our long-standing relationship with Twitter in this expansive global deal that brings together the full ViacomCBS portfolio and magnifies the scale and scope of our valued partnership,&#8221; said Andrea Wolinetz, SVP, Distribution &amp; Business Development-Streaming at ViacomCBS, in a statement. &#8220;Twitter is the digital water cooler for trending topics and fandom worldwide, and we‚Äôre excited to provide front-row access to innovative digital content experiences and culture-defining moments across the best of entertainment, news and sports for Twitter users everywhere.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crypto giveth, and crypto confuseth the heck out of Wall Street.</p>
<p>In the wake of Coinbase&#8217;s <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Coinbase-Q321-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">earnings report</a> yesterday afternoon, shares of the U.S. crypto exchange are off sharply this morning. What happened? Public-market investors continued to underestimate how volatile the crypto market is, leaving them to over-index on gains and over-despair on less impressive results.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Coinbase is not alone in giving Wall Street raptures followed by panics. Thanks to falling crypto trading activity, we recently saw a similar miss in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">Robinhood&#8217;s earnings</a> in terms of raw results and sharp resulting declines in its share price.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220370 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Notably, both companies made noise before their earnings reports that their crypto incomes would fall in Q3 2021 compared to the second quarter. And yet it appeared that public investors were still surprised when that, in fact, happened.</p>
<p>The speed of the crypto economy as a whole may be simply too quick for public-market investors to fully grok. And the exchanges aren&#8217;t even the swingiest of crypto-themed investments. Let&#8217;s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Up, down, up, down (repeat)</h2>
<p>Robinhood saw its trading revenues from crypto fall from $233 million in <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-Press-Release-(1).pdf">Q2 2021</a> to just <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Press-Release.pdf">$51 million</a> in the third quarter. That the company had explicitly told investors that a slowdown was coming does make the declines less painful, although it may be that Wall Street had simply expected a <em>smaller</em> decline.</p>
<p>To reiterate, Robinhood had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping/">previously told investors</a> during its IPO process that it expected to post sequential revenue declines in Q3 &#8220;as a result of decreased levels of trading activity relative to the record highs in trading activity, particularly in cryptocurrencies, during the three months ended June 30, 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet! Investors were perplexed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alex Gorsky, the chairman and CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/alex-gorsky-joins-apples-board-of-directors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined Apple‚Äôs board of directors</a>. Gorsky‚Äôs move to Apple‚Äôs board comes ahead of his planned departure as CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson in January 2022. It also coincides with Apple focusing more on health technology.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not surprising that Apple has tapped Gorsky to be part of its governance team, as the company has been very public about its health and wellness ambitions, including launching a number of health-focused features for iOS and WatchOS over the years.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlex has long been a visionary in healthcare, applying his tremendous insight, experience, and passion for technology to the cause of improving lives and building healthier communities,‚Äù said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/alex-gorsky-joins-apples-board-of-directors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a>. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to welcome him to Apple‚Äôs board of directors, and I know that all of us will benefit from his leadership and expertise.‚Äù</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232057" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gorsky began working at Johnson &amp; Johnson in 1988 and became CEO in 2012. Apple notes that Gorksy has made innovation and technology key priorities, with investments that have helped shape the future of the pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer health sectors.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve long shared Apple‚Äôs belief that technology has the potential to improve lives and create healthier communities,‚Äù said Gorsky, in the press release. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honor to join Apple‚Äôs board of directors, and to be part of a values-led company that‚Äôs constantly innovating to both enable and enhance the way we live.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For many small businesses, trying to manage their employees&#8217; Apple devices and keep them up-to-date is a huge challenge. These businesses tend to lack sophisticated IT departments, and when devices break down or users have questions, they are often left to figure out things on their own using Apple&#8217;s consumer support tools.</p>
<p>Recognizing this issue, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/apple-has-acquired-fleetsmith-a-startup-that-helps-it-manage-apple-devices-remotely/">Apple acquired Fleetsmith</a> last year, and today the company announced the beta of a device management solution called <a href="http://apple.com/business/essentials">Apple Business Essentials</a> aimed squarely at businesses with less than 500 employees.</p>
<p>Susan Prescott, vice president of enterprise and education marketing at Apple, said that the company wanted to help these customers onboard, support and update employee Apple devices, then offboard them when workers leave the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;‚Äã‚ÄãIt is designed to manage Apple devices across that lifecycle of the device and it&#8217;s comprised of three core pieces. It&#8217;s got device management, along with storage, as well as support in one single subscription,&#8221; Prescott explained.</p>
<p>The management component is composed of a combination of the Fleetsmith acquisition and the Apple Device Enrollment Program. It enables small businesses to have access to a similar set of tools as their larger counterparts, giving them more control over the devices and ensuring they work as soon as the employee logs in.</p>
<p>After a business signs up for the service, admins can create users and groups. Users belong to groups and admins can set up a configuration for each group that includes the number of supported devices and an amount of storage. Each company or group can also include a base set of apps that make sense for that group.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2231653" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2231653" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2231653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?w=680" alt="Apple Business Essentials device management interface on MacBook Pro, iPad and iPhone" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Apple_Apple-Business-Essentials_11102021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2231653" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that employees can bring their own devices, and when they sign in to a supported device, the company will set up a work profile for them. That way, only their work product is backed up, and should they leave the company, only their work will be deleted, leaving their personal stuff intact and out of the reach of the employer.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it&#8217;s a personal or work-owned device, the solution also helps maintain security by keeping it up-to-date with the latest system updates. In addition, it enables admins to enforce security settings such as FileVault full-disk encryption on the Mac or Activation Lock to lock down any Apple device should it be lost or stolen.</p>
<p>The storage piece comes from iCloud, although companies are free to connect to a third-party storage provider like Dropbox. The support element will include help desk services for both the IT department running Apple Business Essentials and employees who have any Apple-related questions. That part will be handled through AppleCare+, Apple&#8217;s business-level support arm. Finally, when it launches out of beta, it will also include onsite service, whether in an office or at home, within four hours of reporting an incident. The latter will be run by Apple partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maribel Lopez, founder and principal analyst at Lopez Research, said that it&#8217;s a service that should appeal to small businesses, essentially saving them from having to go through Apple consumer support channels, which aren&#8217;t really designed to meet business requirements.</p>
<p>&#8220;SMBs [have been] effectively left out of management and support. Many would&#8217;ve thought the heavier MDM (mobile device management) wasn&#8217;t for them, and The Genius Bar lacked the real-time support that every business, especially SMBs, needs. Fleetsmith was viewed as a more user-friendly, mobile-friendly way to think of [device] management, so that is part of it. User-centricity versus device-centricity is also a part of it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Tom Mainelli, an analyst in IDC&#8217;s device and consumer research group, said that the new program gives small businesses access to a set of services that were previously only available to larger companies, and as long as the price is reasonable, chances are that they will be willing to pay Apple to provide these services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple‚Äôs focus on small businesses makes a great deal of sense. Enterprise customers likely already have management systems in place to manage their Apple products, but smaller companies don‚Äôt always have full-time IT. That means it can be tough for them to manage everything, especially when it‚Äôs a mix of employer-provided and employee-purchased devices,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple will likely need to drive some education about what the various levels of service offered, and why a small business needs them, but I suspect many business owners will gladly pay Apple to take care of these challenges for them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Although the service is free during beta, the company will charge on a per-user, per-month basis for the device management and storage components, based on the chosen configuration. There will be an additional per-user charge for the support pieces, although that won&#8217;t be ready until the solution is generally available, which is expected in spring next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apps catering to frontline workers are seeing a surge of interest in the market these days, as businesses finally start to wake up to using tech to better connect with these employees, and investors eye up an interesting and new growth opportunity in enterprise IT. In one of the latest developments, <a href="https://joinblink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blink</a> &#8212; a startup and app of the same name that provides a platform for frontline workers to use and engage with the various IT services used by their organizations, as well as with each other &#8212; has picked up $20 million, a Series A that is being led by Next47, with participation from early investors Partech and Techstars. Blink has confirmed that the funding values it at $100 million.</p>
<p>The startup will be using the capital to double down on growth. Blink was founded in London &#8212; where it has found strong traction with metropolitan bus networks (where some 5,000 bus drivers are using the Blink app) and the NHS (where thousands of frontline workers in clinical and nonclinical roles are also on Blink). Those users are very engaged, CEO Sean Nolan tells me, with some 72% of all users opening it on average 13 times a day to check things like pay slips, shift rostering, holiday and overtime pay, to chat with each other and read their company&#8217;s latest announcements.</p>
<p>Now Blink is planning to relocate its HQ to New York to better tackle the U.S. The global opportunity is a big one, with an estimated 2.7 billion people working on the front line, according to the company. Blink currently has some 93,000 users, so there is a lot of growing to do.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232033" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After years of being overlooked in favor of so-called knowledge workers &#8212; those who sit at screens day in, day out and are more likely to be using software all the time &#8212; frontline workers are experiencing a kind of renaissance in the world of enterprise IT. There are now a number of companies building solutions to provide more digital solutions to them, whether it&#8217;s a platform to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/wonolo-raises-140m-for-its-staffing-platform-used-by-1m-laborers-and-front-line-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help them find work</a>, or any number of communication and productivity apps. Just last week, one of them &#8212; another frontline worker productivity app called When I Work &#8212; raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/when-i-work-an-messaging-app-that-lets-shift-based-teams-schedule-work-and-more-raises-200m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$200 million</a>. Others include Workplace from Meta (fka Facebook); Microsoft&#8217;s Teams; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/homebase-raises-71m-for-a-team-management-platform-aimed-at-smbs-and-their-hourly-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebase</a>, which raised $71 million earlier this year;¬†<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a>, which focuses on home services pros;¬†<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/workwhile-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WorkWhile</a>;¬†<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/yoobic-raises-50m-for-its-chat-and-communications-app-app-aimed-at-frontline-and-service-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoobic</a>¬†(more of a productivity platform for frontline workers currently);¬†<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/crew-a-workplace-and-slack-messaging-rival-for-shift-workers-raises-35m-adds-enterprise-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crew</a>¬†(which¬†<a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-acquires-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square acquired</a> earlier this year); and¬†<a href="https://www.justworkshours.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justworks</a>¬†(which in September filed to go public).</p>
<p>Nolan said that Blink&#8217;s particular approach has been to try to create a user interface, and functionality, that caters both to asynchronous activities as well as real-time information, the idea being that front-line workers are most likely not going to be looking at the app continuously throughout the day, so the priority for making sure important things surface when they do is especially higher.</p>
<p>The company has built some functionality, such as its chat feature, in-house, but otherwise its strategy is to integrate, integrate, integrate. It has built APIs and flows to bring in the most popular software used by its customers so that essentially when a user wants to access documents or information from any of them, that person logs in with a single sign-on process to do so, and then essentially uses the other app within the Blink experience.</p>
<p>The company is planning to hire some 40 more people in New York as it looks to double its base of 60 employees to 120.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">‚ÄúToday‚Äôs top enterprise software companies are reexamining the way we work; Blink is uniquely positioned to lead in this category for frontline workers‚Äù, said Daniel Kirchleitner, partner at Next47, in a statement. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been blown away by their customer feedback and results so far, especially the impact on employee retention. We look forward to partnering with the Blink team as they continue their expansion into the US market and beyond.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers have uncovered a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/spyware/">spyware</a> campaign that‚Äôs targeting South Korean residents with Android devices in order to steal confidential data.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Unlike other spyware campaigns that typically take advantage of on-device vulnerabilities, this <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">campaign, known as PhoneSpy, hides in plain sight on victims‚Äô devices, masquerading as legitimate </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/android/">Android</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">¬†lifestyle apps</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from TV streaming to yoga instruction. In reality, however, the spyware is stealthily exfoliating data from the victim‚Äôs device, including login credentials, messages, precise granular location and images. PhoneSpy is also capable of uninstalling any apps, including </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mobile-security/">mobile security</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> apps.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Researchers at mobile security firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zimperium/">Zimperium</a>, which discovered PhoneSpy inside 23 apps, say the spyware can also access a victims‚Äô camera to take pictures and record video in real-time, and warned that this could be used for personal and corporate blackmail and espionage. It does this without a victim knowing, and Zimperium notes that unless someone is watching their web traffic, it would be difficult to detect.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2231172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The legitimate-looking apps request excessive on-device permissions ‚Äî a common red flag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span>‚ÄúOnce the permissions are granted, the attackers can take control and hide the app from the user&#8217;s menu, staying behind the scenes to continue to track and steal with little to no interruption,‚Äù Zimperium‚Äôs Richard Melick told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>PhoneSpy is not known to be listed in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-play/">Google Play</a>, nor were samples found in any Android storefront. Rather, Zimperium says that attackers are using distribution methods based on web traffic redirection or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>, an attack method whereby users are manipulated into performing certain actions or handing over confidential data.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPhoneSpy is distributed through malicious and fake apps that are downloaded and sideloaded onto the victim&#8217;s devices,&#8221; Melick said. &#8220;There is evidence pointing to distribution through web traffic redirection or social engineering, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a>, tricking the end-user into downloading what they think is a legitimate app from a compromised website or direct link.‚Äù</p>
<p>PhoneSpy, which has so far claimed more than 1,000 victims in South Korea, according to Zimperium, shares many similarities with other known and previously used spyware and stalkerware apps. ‚ÄúThis leads us to believe that someone compiled the features and capabilities they wanted into a new spyware setup,‚Äù Melick added. Using off-the-shelf code also produces fewer fingerprints, making it easier for attackers to obscure their identity.</p>
<p>Zimperium says it has notified U.S. and South Korean authorities of this hyper-targeted spyware campaign and has reported the host of the command and control server multiple times. However, at the time of writing, the PhoneSpy spyware campaign is still active.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/stalkerware-security-phone-data-thousands/">TechCrunch revealed a significant stalkerware campaign</a> that‚Äôs putting the private phone data of hundreds of thousands of people at risk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬†</span></p>
