										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We may still be a long way off from Level 5, fully self-driving cars on the open road, but companies building autonomous vehicles and shuttles for specific uses within closed-campus deployments say they are on their way to commercial operations and are raising money to get there. In the latest development, a startup out of Toulouse, France, called <a href="https://easymile.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasyMile</a> &#8212; which builds shuttles for transporting both people and goods &#8212; has closed a Series B of €55 million ($66 million).</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Searchlight Capital Partners &#8212; the investor that just earlier this week appointed <a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/searchlight-capital-partners-announces-appointment-133700322.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former FCC chairman Ajit Pai as its newest partner</a> &#8212; with McWin and NextStage AM also participating. Previous investors rail industry heavyweight Alstom, Bpifrance and auto giant Continental also participated. Searchlight is also an investor in Get Your Guide and Univision.</p>
<p>EasyMile claims to be the world leader in autonomous shuttles with 60% of the global market using its vehicles. It says that its vehicles have racked up 800,000 kilometers in over 300 locations in 30 countries. But as a mark of how small and nascent that market is today, EasyMile also says that it has just 180 vehicles deployed worldwide. (One big competitor, Navya, also happens to be based out of France, interestingly.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>EasyMile said it will use the funds to scale its business, by securing and building out commercial deployments in closed-campus environments. It will also continue to invest in its longer term strategy, to deploy its vehicles and technology in public transportation networks, although the company said believes its focus on more immediate use cases is what has helped it grow and attract new investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have stayed focused on what we can deliver in a reasonable timeframe and partnered with leaders in niche markets that are addressable now,&#8221; said EasyMile Founder and CEO Gilbert Gagnaire in a statement. “The participation of all of EasyMile’s earlier investors in the round is a strong vote of confidence in our expansion plan, and we are very happy to welcome Searchlight, McWin and NextStage and look forward to accelerating our growth thanks to their expertise.&#8221;</p>
<p>EasyMile is not disclosing its valuation, nor how much it has raised to date in what it described as an oversubscribed round. We are asking the company and will update this post as we learn more.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">EasyMile&#8217;s vehicles include the EZ10 people shuttles and TractEasy, an autonomous &#8220;tractor&#8221; trailer system for moving goods, and its over the years inked deals with companies like </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://www.tld-group.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TLD</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (which runs ground transport and support in air cargo) and is currently working with the Peugeot, Chrysler and Fiat group Stellantis to build an autonomous vehicle using EasyMile technology.</span></p>
<p>The company has also had some setbacks. Last year, the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/self-driving-startup-easy-mile-injury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHTSA barred EasyMile from running any services with passengers</a> on board after the company had an accident. (It can still operate vehicles without passengers.) We have asked the company to update us on the latest developments on this front.</p>
<p>On that front, it will be interesting to see how and if its new investor will have an impact in terms of helping with regulatory issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to be investing in EasyMile at this critical juncture in the firm’s trajectory,&#8221; said Ralf Ackermann, a partner at Searchlight Capital, in a statement. &#8220;Having observed its robust, quality-driven approach and industry-leading technology, we are confident that it is well positioned to scale commercially and are delighted to be part of the journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fundraising is interesting in that it is coming at a time when we&#8217;re seeing some reshuffling and in some cases retrenchment in the autonomous driving space. Just this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lyft sold off its Level 5 division to Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet for $550 million</a>. EasyMile believes that its continuing focus on specific markets around shuttles in closed-loops has helped it stay the course and build more traction and profile in what is still an early market and bound to go through more changes, and hiccups.</p>
<p>“This injection of capital validates EasyMile’s strategy and will allow us to finalize our technical development and finance our scaleup strategy. We’ll bring the technology up to a level that can be industrialized and deliver a real commercial service,&#8221; said GM Benoit Perrin, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every day in the United States, hundreds of thousands of people will dial 911 to seek help. Some of those calls are serious and require immediate emergency attention, but the reality is that most 911 calls are of a far simpler variety: concerns about a prescription, fear over a newly-developed symptom, or a general medical question.</p>
<p>When a 911 call taker receives that request for medical assistance, it sets into motion a series of responses. Ambulances and paramedics are sent, leading to skyrocketing costs for patients and insurers alike. What if instead of sending hyper-expensive emergency services to a non-emergency situation, call takers had an ally to guide patients to the resources they actually need?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdally.com">MD Ally</a> is a startup that triages 911 calls and reroutes non-emergency calls to telehealth medical services. The company closed $3.5 million in seed funding led by Hemant Teneja at General Catalyst, along with Tuoyo Louis of Seae Ventures. The company formerly raised $1 million in financing last March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shanel Fields, the CEO and founder of the company, said that the impetus for the company came from a very early age. “It goes back to my own childhood — my father was a volunteer EMT when I was growing up on Long Island,” she said, and that interest in healthcare brought her to Athenahealth.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144646" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144646" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2144646" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shanel-Fields_MD-Ally_Houston-FD-High-Res.jpg?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shanel-Fields_MD-Ally_Houston-FD-High-Res.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shanel-Fields_MD-Ally_Houston-FD-High-Res.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shanel-Fields_MD-Ally_Houston-FD-High-Res.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shanel-Fields_MD-Ally_Houston-FD-High-Res.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shanel-Fields_MD-Ally_Houston-FD-High-Res.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shanel-Fields_MD-Ally_Houston-FD-High-Res.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Shanel-Fields_MD-Ally_Houston-FD-High-Res.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144646" class="wp-caption-text">CEO and founder of MD Ally Shanel Fields. Image Credits: MD Ally</p></div></p>
<p>She kept thinking about 911 calls though, and the disparities that exist between different communities when it comes to response times. “Whether you have $5 dollars in your pocket or $5 million — you call the same number,” she said. But I “read some research that in low-income and indigent communities, they had higher rates of ‘dead on arrival’ due to higher wait times.” The reason was simple: in communities with less access to healthcare, emergency services are often the only alternative, leading to higher volumes of 911 calls with many that would be considered low priority.</p>
<p>That gave her the idea for MD Ally — to improve the efficiency of dispatching so that emergencies got first care, and that non-emergency calls could also be helpfully routed to improve clinical outcomes. She officially started building the company in Fall of 2019, and joined up with Kojo DeGraft-Hanson, who is the company’s chief product officer. The two have known each other for a decade from Cornell, and they stayed in touch as each pursued their own careers.</p>
<p>The company integrates into the computer-aided dispatch systems used by 911 operations centers (known more formally as Public Safety Answering Points or PSAPs). Today, when a 911 call comes in, call takers determine the acuity of the medical danger involved using an Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System, a uniform process for coding each call by severity. MD Ally has established a range of codes that call takers can safely redirect to telehealth treatment options.</p>
<p>Best of all for cash-strapped 911 centers, MD Ally’s platform is free. The company instead intends to generate revenues on the provider side for telehealth referrals as well as from insurance companies looking to reduce the cost of emergency medical services. The company is integrating with centers in New York and Florida now and by the end of the year, hopes to also have centers on board in Louisiana, California, and Arizona.</p>
<p>Long-term, the company hopes to help deescalate situations where 911 callers, who might be experiencing mental illness, are sent police response rather than psychological services. We’re “really passionate about and excited to provide a range of resources to deescalate scenarios,” Fields said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data intelligence company <a href="https://near.co/">Near</a> is announcing the acquisition of another company in the data business — <a href="https://um.co">UM</a>.</p>
<p>In some ways, this echoes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/near-acquires-teemo/">Near&#8217;s acquisition of Teemo</a> last fall. Just as that deal helped Singapore-headquartered Near expand into Europe (with Teemo founder and CEO Benoit Grouchko becoming Near&#8217;s chief privacy officer), CEO Anil Mathews said that this new acquisition will help Near build a presence in the United States, turning the company into &#8220;a truly global organization,&#8221; while also tailoring its product to offer &#8220;local flavors&#8221; in each country.</p>
<p>The addition of UM&#8217;s 60-person team brings Near&#8217;s total headcount to around 200, with UM CEO Gladys Kong becoming CEO of Near North America.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the same time, Mathews suggested that this deal isn&#8217;t simply about geography, because the data offered by Near and UM are &#8220;very complementary,&#8221; allowing both teams to upsell current customers on new offerings. He described Near&#8217;s mission as &#8220;merging two diverse worlds, the online world and the offline world,&#8221; essentially creating a unified profile of consumers for marketers and other businesses. Apparently, UM is particularly strong on the offline side, thanks to its focus on location data.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144687" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144687" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2144687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Near CEO Anil Mathews and UM CEO Gladys Kong" width="680" height="530" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=768,599 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=680,530 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144687" class="wp-caption-text">Near CEO Anil Mathews and UM CEO Gladys Kong</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;UM has a very strong understanding of places, they&#8217;ve mastered their understanding of footfalls and dwell times,&#8221; Mathews added. &#8220;As a result, most of the use cases where UM is seeing growth — in tourism, retail, real estate — are in industries struggling due to the pandemic, where they&#8217;re using data to figure out, &#8216;How do we come out of the pandemic?'&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch readers may be more familiar with UM under its old name UberMedia, which created social apps like Echofon and UberSocial before pivoting its business to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/ubermedia-cross-media/">ad attribution and location data</a>. Kong said that contrary to her fears, the company had &#8220;an amazing 2020&#8221; as businesses realized they needed UM&#8217;s data (its customers include RAND Corporation, Hawaii Tourism Authority, Columbia University and Yale University).</p>
<p>And the year was capped by connecting with Near and realizing that the two companies have &#8220;a lot of synergies.&#8221; In fact, Kong recalled that UM&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ubermedia-rebrands-to-um-to-deliver-data-intelligence-to-every-business-301258454.html">rebranding last month</a> was partly at Mathews&#8217; suggestion: &#8220;He said, &#8216;Why do you have media in your name when you don&#8217;t do media?&#8217; And we realized that&#8217;s probably how the world saw us, so we decided to change [our name] to make it clear what we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2010, UM raised a total of $34.6 million in funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ubermedia/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>. The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Opsera, a startup that&#8217;s building an orchestration platform for DevOps teams, today announced that it has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Felicis Ventures. New investor HMG Ventures, as well as existing investors Clear Ventures, Trinity Partners and Firebolt Ventures also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $19.3 million.</p>
<p>Founded in January 2020, Opsera lets developers provision their CI/CD tools through a single framework. Using this framework, they can then build and manage their pipelines for a variety of use cases, including their software delivery lifecycle, infrastructure as code and their SaaS application releases. With this, Opsera essentially aims to help teams set up and operate their various DevOps tools.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s two co-founders, <a href="https://www.opsera.io/author/chandra-ranganathan">Chandra Ranganathan</a> and <a href="https://www.opsera.io/author/kumar-chivukula">Kumar Chivukula</a>, originally met while working at Symantec a few years ago. Ranganathan then spent the last three years at Uber, where he ran that company&#8217;s global infrastructure. Meanwhile, Chivukula ran Symantec&#8217;s hybrid cloud services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;As part of the transformation [at Symantec], we delivered over 50+ acquisitions over time. That had led to the use of many cloud platforms, many data centers,&#8221; Ranganathan explained. &#8220;Ultimately we had to consolidate them into a single enterprise cloud. That journey is what led us to the pain points of what led to Opsera. There were many engineering teams. They all had diverse tools and stacks that were all needed for their own use cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>The challenge then was to still give developers the flexibility to choose the right tools for their use cases, while also providing a mechanism for automation, visibility and governance &#8212; and that&#8217;s ultimately the problem Opsera now aims to solve.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144507" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144507" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2144507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png" alt="" width="1024" height="604" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png 1712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=1536,905 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pipeline.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2144507" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opsera</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;In the DevOps landscape, [&#8230;] there is a plethora of tools, and a lot of people are writing the glue code,&#8221; Opsera co-founder Chivukula noted. &#8220;But then they&#8217;re not they don&#8217;t have visibility. At Opsera, our mission and goal is to bring order to the chaos. And the way we want to do this is by giving choice and flexibility to the users and provide no-code automation using a unified framework.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wesley Chan, a managing director for Felicis Ventures who will join the Opsera board, also noted that he believes that one of the next big areas for growth in DevOps is how orchestration and release management is handled.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spoke to a lot of startups who are all using black-box tools because they&#8217;ve built their engineering organization and their DevOps from scratch,&#8221; Chan said. &#8220;That&#8217;s fine, if you&#8217;re starting from scratch and you just hired a bunch of people outside of Google and they&#8217;re all very sophisticated. But then when you talk to some of the larger companies. [&#8230;] You just have all these different teams and tools &#8212; and it gets unwieldy and complex.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike some other tools, Chan argues, Opsera allows its users the flexibility to interface with this wide variety of existing internal systems and tools for managing the software lifecycle and releases.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is why we got so interested in investing, because we just heard from all the folks that this is the right tool. There&#8217;s no way we&#8217;re throwing out a bunch of our internal stuff. This would just wreak havoc on our engineering team,&#8221; Chan explained. He believes that building with this wide existing ecosystem in mind &#8212; and integrating with it without forcing users onto a completely new platform &#8212; and its ability to reduce friction for these teams, is what will ultimately make Opsera successful.</p>
<p>Opsera plans to use the new funding to grow its engineering team and accelerate its go-to-market efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By his own admission, Chris Thür wasn&#8217;t the most obvious person to start a music education startup.</p>
<p>Thür (previously a laser researcher) recalled an early meeting with an investor who asked whether he and co-founder Mikko Kaipainen (an electrical engineer) were music teachers or musicians, ultimately going &#8220;down the list of all the things that would somewhat qualify us for that world.&#8221; Each time, they had to tell him no.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were just two people who wanted to play an instrument and felt we were missing out,&#8221; Thür said. &#8220;Obviously, we were not the only ones.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While they didn&#8217;t convince that unnamed investor to write a check, Thür and Kaipainen did start <a href="https://yousician.com">Yousician</a>, which now reaches 20 million monthly users across its two apps — the music education app Yousician and the guitar tuning app GuitarTuna. And the Helsinki-based startup is announcing today that it has raised $29 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>Thür (Yousician&#8217;s CEO) said that it&#8217;s been &#8220;a bit of a journey&#8221; to get here. The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/08/ovelin-funding/">previously known as Ovelin</a>, was founded a decade ago, and it originally focused exclusively on kids before finding success with a less age-specific strategy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144922" style="width: 509px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144922" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2144922" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chris-4.jpg?w=499" alt="Yousician CEO Chris Thür" width="499" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chris-4.jpg 1892w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chris-4.jpg?resize=110,150 110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chris-4.jpg?resize=220,300 220w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chris-4.jpg?resize=768,1047 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chris-4.jpg?resize=499,680 499w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chris-4.jpg?resize=1126,1536 1126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chris-4.jpg?resize=1502,2048 1502w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Chris-4.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144922" class="wp-caption-text">Yousician CEO Chris Thür</p></div></p>
<p>He described the Yousician app as providing an interactive, gamified approach to learning guitar, piano, ukulele, bass or singing — but not <em>too</em> game-like. Users advance through a standard syllabus, playing for 15 or 20 minutes a day, with the app listening to their performance and awarding one to three stars based on how many mistakes they made. Users get one lesson per day for free, but if they want access to more lessons and the full library of songs (or if they want to learn multiple instruments), they need to sign up for a Premium or Premium+ subscription, with pricing starting at $19.99 per month.</p>
<p>Thür said Yousician allows people to learn music on their own schedule, at a much lower cost than in-person lessons. At the same time, he suggested that it&#8217;s not a &#8220;zero sum&#8221; competition with music teachers; there are teachers who recommend Yousician to their students as a way to keep practicing and learning between lessons.</p>
<p>As an example of how Yousician can help its users, Thür pointed to the story of Karen Gadd, who (as told in the video below) &#8220;in one year went from never having played an instrument to performing on-stage&#8221; with her band — though he hastened to add that the app is beneficial even if you never perform for anyone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make musicality to be as common as literacy,&#8221; Thür said. &#8220;Everyone should play from time to time and get all those benefits [&#8230;] I think learning with a teacher works for many, but unfortunately it doesn&#8217;t work for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rALbjWNpAG8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The past year, he said, has been &#8220;a difficult year and an interesting year for us.&#8221; With students largely shifting to remote learning, &#8220;a lot of music lessons didn&#8217;t happen,&#8221; so Yousician tried to make up for some of those lost lessons by providing free premium subscriptions to more than 100,000 teachers and students.</p>
<p>At the same time, many people became interested in learning an instrument during the pandemic as part of a general focus on self-improvement, leading to &#8220;a huge organic increase&#8221; in usage. Monthly users grew from 14.5 million to 20 million, while subscriptions increased 80%, with the company bringing in revenue of $50 million last year.</p>
<p>Yousician has now raised a total of $35 million. True Ventures led the round, with participation from new investors Amazon’s Alexa Fund and MPL Ventures, as well as Zynga founder Mark Pincus, LAUNCH Fund founder Jason Calacanis, Unity Technologies founder David Helgason, Trivago co-founder Rolf Schrömgens, Cooler Future founder Moaffak Ahmed and Blue Bottle Coffee Company executive chairman Bryan Meehan.</p>
<p>“Yousician has been the leading platform for music instruction for nearly a decade, and people – now more than ever – are turning to the pursuit of creativity and music with renewed vigor,” said True Ventures co-founder Jon Callaghan in a statement. “We’re proud to stand behind a company and team that brings the joy and excitement of playing an instrument into more homes and families.”</p>
<p>Thür said that with the new funding, Yousician will work the team, improve brand marketing, localize the product and build <a href="https://yousician.com/blog/jason-mraz-yousician-guest-teacher">more relationships with musical artists</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.messagebird.com/en/">MessageBird</a>, a communications platform out of the Netherlands, had a busy day today with two huge announcements. For starters, the company got an $800 million extension on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/messagebird-series-c/">$200 million Series C round</a> announced last October. It then applied $600 million of the extension to buy email marketing platform <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/">SparkPost</a>. The company&#8217;s C round now totals at least $1 billion.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the acquisition. MessageBird CEO Robert Vis says his company had an email component prior to the acquisition, but the chance to pick up the largest email provider in the world was too good to pass up.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you talk about infrastructure, we&#8217;re defining largest [&#8230;] as a matter of interactions, so basically the amount of emails sent. SparkPost sends about 5 trillion emails a year. And the second thing that&#8217;s very important to us is to be able to send high scale emails when it&#8217;s really critical,&#8221; Vis told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the company in the fold, it enables MessageBird, which has mostly been in Europe and Asia, to get a stronger foothold in the U.S. market. &#8220;So this is as much for us about the technology around SparkPost as it actually is for us to have market entry into the United States with a significant workforce instead of having to build that from scratch,&#8221; Vis said.</p>

<p>Rich Harris, CEO of SparkPost sees the deal as a way to expand SparkPost to multiple channels already available on the MessageBird platform and be a much more powerful combination together than it could have been alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;By joining forces with MessageBird, we will be able to bring broader, deeper value to all of our customers through any digital communications,&#8221; Harris said in a statement.</p>
<p>Vis agrees saying it gives his company the opportunity to upsell other MessageBird services to SparkPost customers. &#8220;SparkPost obviously only offers email. We can offer SmartPost customers way more channels. We can offer them texting, Instagram, WhatsApp or Apple Business Chat. So we feel very excited about leveraging them to go sell much more broad messenger products to their customers,&#8221; Vis said.</p>

<p>MessageBird announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/messagebird-series-c/">$240 million Series C on a $3 billion valuation</a> last October. The company&#8217;s whopping $800 million extension brings the round to around $1 billion. It&#8217;s worth noting that the round isn&#8217;t completely closed yet, so that&#8217;s not an official figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The round isn’t completely closed yet as we are still waiting on some of the funds to come in, so we cannot give you 100% final figures on the round, but we can say with confidence that the round will close at $1B or slightly higher,&#8221; a company spokesperson explained. It is announcing the funding before everything is 100% done due to regulatory requirements around the acquisition.</p>
<p>Eurazeo, Tiger Global, BlackRock and Owl Rock participated in the extension along with Bonnier, Glynn Capital, LGT Lightstone, Longbow, Mousse Partners and NewView Capital, as well as existing investors such as Accel, Atomico (they led the Series A and B rounds) and Y Combinator. The mix is 70% equity and 30% debt, according to the company.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s acquisition <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2021/03/30/dutch-unicorn-messagebird-acquires-two-startups/?sh=417e7efbd743">comes on the heels of two others</a> just last month when the company announced it was acquiring video meeting startup 24Sessions and Hull, a synchronization technology startup. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/push-it-realtime-good/">also acquired Pusher</a>, a push notification company in January, as MessageBird is using its Series C cash to quickly expand the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are lot of companies out there making robotic exoskeletons. In fact, it’s one of the more active categories in the space &#8212; and for good reason. These sorts of technologies have the ability to profoundly impact the future of how people work, move and rehabilitate.</p>
<p>The category also houses a surprisingly broad range of solutions, with something like the sci-fi Sarcos at one end and <a href="https://www.roamrobotics.com/">Roam</a> on the other. Roam’s solution is really putting the wearable back in wearable robotics. Specifically, the company makes assistive devices out of fabrics, rather than metal or plastic.</p>
<p>Ultimately, that means the loss of some of the strength of more industrial solutions, but it also means they’re more suited for every day use. That’s precisely why something like the robotic smart knee orthosis makes a lot of sense. The product, which recently cleared the FDA as a Class I medical device, utilizes AI for an adapted technology that senses the wearer’s movements and adjusts accordingly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“Roam is focused on a massively underserved market. More than 20% of the global population is limited by their body’s mobility, and as medical advancements help people live longer that number is only going to increase,” co-founder and CEO Tim Swift said in a release tied to the news. “Our approach to wearable robotics works seamlessly with the human body to help people lead healthier, happier and more active lives, unhindered by physical limitations.”</p>
<p>The product, which joins the company’s skier and military-focused offers, sports embedded sensors that can detect things like movement up and down stairs and standing up from a seated position. It utilizes a power source and air compressor to create motion to assist in movement.</p>
<p>The device is up for preorder and starts shipping later this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merama, a five-month old e-commerce startup focused on Latin America, announced today that it has raised $60 million in seed and Series A funding and $100 million in debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money was raised “at well over a $200 million valuation,” according to co-founder and CEO Sujay Tyle.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are receiving significant inbound for a Series B already,” he said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LatAm firms Valor Capital and Monashees Capital and U.K.-based Balderton Capital co-led the “massively oversubscribed” funding round, which also included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silicon Valley-based Triplepoint Capital and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the CEOs of four unicorns in Latin America, including Uala, Loggi, Rappi and Madeira Madeira. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyle, Felipe Delgado, Olivier Scialom, Renato Andrade and Guilherme Nosralla started Merama in December 2020 with a vision to be the “largest and best-selling set of brands in Latin America.” The company has dual headquarters in Mexico City and São Paulo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merama partners with e-commerce product sellers in Latin America by purchasing a stake in the businesses and working with their teams to help them “exponentially” grow and boost their technology while providing them with nondilutive working capital. CEO Tyle describes the company’s model as “wildly different” from that of Thras.io, Perch and other similar companies such as </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it does not aggregate dozens of brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will work with very few brands over time, and only the best, and work with our entire team to scale and expand these few businesses,” Tyle told TechCrunch. “We’re more similar to The Hut Group in the EU.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merama expects to sell $100 million across the region this year, more than two times the year before. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently focused on Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Already, the company operates “very profitably,” according to Tyle. So the cash raised will go primarily toward partnering with more brands, investing in building its technology platform “to aid in the automation of several facets” of its partners&#8217; brands and in working capital for product innovation and inventory purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 42-person team is made up of e-commerce leaders from companies such as Amazon, Mercado Libre and Facebook, among others. Tyle knows a thing or two about growing and building new startups, having co-founded Frontier Car Group, which sold to OLX/Naspers for about $700 million in 2019. He is also currently a venture partner at Balderton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a fact that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latin American e-commerce has boomed, particularly during the pandemic. Mexico was the fastest-growing e-commerce market in 2020 worldwide, yet is still in its infancy, Tyle said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the $85 billion e-commerce market in Latin America is growing rapidly, with projections of it </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/445860/retail-e-commerce-sales-latam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching $116.2 billion in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Merchants are seeing hypergrowth but still struggle with fundamental problems, which creates a ceiling in their potential,” Tyle told TechCrunch. “For example, they are unable to expand internationally, get reliable and cost-effective working capital and build technology tools to support their own online presence. This is where Merama comes in. We seek to give our partners an unfair advantage. When we decide to work with a team, it is because we believe they will be the de facto category leader and can become a $1 billion business on their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merama collaborates with e-commerce giants such as Amazon and Mercado Libre, and several executives from both companies have invested in the startup, as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Waterhouse, partner at Balderton Capital, says his firm sees “huge potential” in Merama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In our two decades scaling businesses in Europe, we have seen firsthand what defines eCommerce category leaders,” he said in a written statement. “What they have already achieved is breathtaking, and it is just the tip of the iceberg.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valor Capital founding partner Scott Sobel believes that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reating superior products that connect with consumers is the first key challenge D2C companies face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is why we like Merama&#8217;s approach to partnering with these established brands and provide them unparalleled support to scale their operations in an efficient way,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Group video calls will be coming to Telegram&#8217;s messaging platform next month with what&#8217;s being touted as a fully featured implementation, including support for web-based videoconferencing.</p>
<p>Founder Pavel Durov made the announcement via a (text) message posted to his official Telegram channel today where he wrote &#8220;we will be adding a video dimension to our voice chats in May, making Telegram a powerful platform for group video calls&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Screen sharing, encryption, noise-cancelling, desktop and tablet support &#8212; everything you can expect from a modern video conferencing tool, but with Telegram-level UI, speed and encryption. Stay tuned!&#8221; he added, using the sorts of phrases you&#8217;d expect from an enterprise software maker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Zoom Apps be the next hot startup platform?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/will-zoom-apps-be-the-next-hot-startup-platform/embed/#?secret=8SnlQyhgqN" data-secret="8SnlQyhgqN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Telegram often taunts rivals over their tardiness to add new features but on video calls it has been a laggard, only adding the ability to make one-on-one video calls <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-calls">last August</a> &#8212; rather than prioritizing a launch of group video calls, as it had suggested it would a few months earlier.</p>
<p>In an April 2020 <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/400-million">blog post</a>, to mark passing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/telegram-hits-400-million-monthly-active-users/">400M users</a>, it wrote that the global lockdown had &#8220;highlighted the need for a trusted video communication tool&#8221; &#8212; going on to dub video calls in 2020 &#8220;much like messaging in 2013&#8221;.</p>
<p>However it also emphasized the importance of security for group video calling &#8212; and that&#8217;s perhaps what&#8217;s caused the delay.</p>
<p>(Another possibility is the operational distraction of needing to raise a large chunk of debt financing to keep funding development: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/telegram-raises-150m-from-mubadala-and-abu-dhabi-cp-via-pre-ipo-convertible-bonds/">Last month</a> Telegram announced it had raised over $1BN by selling bonds &#8212; its earlier plan to monetize via a blockchain platform having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/telegram-abandons-its-ton-blockchain-platform/">hit the buffers in 2020</a>.)</p>
<p>In the event, rather than rolling out group video calls towards the latter end of 2020 it&#8217;s going to be doing so almost half way through 2021 &#8212; which has left videoconferencing platforms like Zoom to keep cleaning up during the pandemic-fuelled remote work and play boom (even as &#8216;Zoom fatigue&#8217; has been added to our lexicon).</p>
<p>How secure Telegram&#8217;s implementation of group video calls will be, though, is an open question.</p>
<p>Durov&#8217;s post mades repeat mention of &#8220;encryption&#8221; &#8212; perhaps to make a subtle dig at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/zoom-ftc-deceptive-security-claims/">Zoom&#8217;s own messy security claims history</a> &#8212; but doesn&#8217;t specify whether it will use end-to-end encryption (we&#8217;ve asked).</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/zoom-launches-end-to-end-encryption-for-free-meetings-with-a-catch/">Zoom does now offer e2e</a> &#8212; and also has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/zoom-launches-100m-zoom-apps-investment-fund/">designs on becoming a platform in its own right</a>, with apps and a marketplace, so there are a number of shifts in the comms landscape that could see the videoconferencing giant making deeper incursions into Telegram&#8217;s social messaging territory.</p>
<p>The one-to-one video calls Telegram launched last year were rolled out with its own <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end/voice-calls">e2e encryption</a> &#8212; so presumably it will be replicating that approach for group calls.</p>
<p>However the MTProto encryption Telegram uses is custom-designed &#8212; and there&#8217;s been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)#Security">plenty of debate</a> among cryptography experts over the soundness of its approach. So even if group calls are e2e encrypted there will be scrutiny over exactly how Telegram is doing it.</p>
<p>Also today, Durov touted two recently launched web versions of Telegram (not the first such versions by a long chalk, though) &#8212; adding that it&#8217;s currently testing &#8220;a functional version of web-based video calls internally, which will be added soon&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said the Webk and Webz versions of the web app are &#8220;by far the most cross-platform versions of Telegram we shipped so far&#8221;, and noting that no downloads or installs are required to access your chats via the browser.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is particularly good for corporate environments where installing native apps is now always allowed, but also good for users who like the instant nature of web sites,&#8221; he added, with another little nod toward enterprise users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.wunderite.com/">Wunderite</a>, a Boston-based software startup, announced that it has raised $3 million in an early-stage round led by <a href="https://www.sparkcapital.com/">Spark Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Wunderite builds and sells software designed to help insurance agencies more rapidly process insurance applications, and automate some of their processes. With an industry-focus on insurance agencies while providing some API hooks, the startup fits into a number of startup trends, including vertical SaaS, developer-friendly tooling, and insurtech.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petemacdonald">Peter MacDonald</a> (CEO) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephschnare/">Joe Schnare</a> (COO) about their company and its new investment. MacDonald previously worked for his family&#8217;s insurance business, while Schnare earned insurance experience by working for a large player in the market. The two met while at business school.</p>
<p>The pair told TechCrunch that most property and casualty insurance (car, pet, home, and other forms of popular coverage) is still sold by small and mid-sized agencies. That may surprise, but most of the United States is not the Bay Area, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Denver, or Seattle it turns out.</p>
<p>But while that market share point is good news for smaller insurance groups out there, it&#8217;s not great news for the staff of those firms as MacDonald and Schnare detailed that many are forced to work with archaic tooling. Like writing with their hands. Or email. A huge market &#8212; insurance is a monster industry &#8212; with a piecemeal competitive market and antiquated tooling could prove ripe for Wunderite, provided that it can reach a sufficient number of the companies that it hopes will comprise its revenue base.</p>
<p>Spark Capital&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sparkcapital.com/team-profiles/alex-finkelstein">Alex Finkelstein</a> is bullish on the company&#8217;s chances. In a conversation with TechCrunch concerning the round, he expressed an interest in what he called &#8220;unsexy&#8221; business categories that feature extensive fragmentation and either outdated software, or no software at all. That is precisely Wunderite&#8217;s thesis.</p>
<p>Finkelstein thinks that such companies can build workflow tooling, grow themselves into being the data hub of their industry customers, leveraging that perch into an even larger enterprise. So he has big hopes for startup past its current product remit.</p>
<p>Today the startup is just seven folks &#8212; four in the United States, three in the Philippines &#8212; but expects to grow to 15 to 20 this year.</p>
<p>Finally, why did the company raise $3 million in a market when it seems that every round is ten times the size it might have been three years ago? The founders said that they are at the &#8220;early stages&#8221; of product-market fit, so they want to start building their sales team without overspending. Asked the same question, Finkelstein said that the company had outlined a series of milestones that it wants to meet, and that $3 million was the number it needed to reach them. At which point it can raise more capital at a higher valuation.</p>
<p>Wunderite &#8212; a portmanteau of the German word &#8220;wonder,&#8221; which means wonder or miracle, and &#8220;underwrite,&#8221; which is English for taking on risk in exchange for a fee &#8212; has the funds it needs to stretch its sales legs a bit and put more revenue points on the board. Let&#8217;s see how well it can scales its revenue operation with its new capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last few months, PayPal has been quietly gearing up for its expansion in China.</p>
<p>At the recent Boao Forum for Asia, China&#8217;s answer to Davos, the American payments giant <a href="http://www.hinews.cn/news/system/2021/04/18/032541194.shtml">said</a> its strategy for China is not to challenge the duopoly of Alipay and WeChat Pay. Instead, it wants to focus on cross-border business and provide gateways both for Chinese merchants to collect funds and for Chinese consumers to pay for overseas goods.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly a lucrative area. The market size of cross-border e-commerce in China surged from about 3 trillion yuan ($460 million) to nearly 6 trillion yuan between 2016 and 2021, according to market research firm <a href="http://report.iresearch.cn/wx/report.aspx?id=3661">iResearch</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But this space has also become crowded in recent years and PayPal may be late to the fray, said a China-based manager for an American tech giant, who asked for anonymity because he&#8217;s not authorized to speak to the media.</p>
<p>On Amazon, one of the largest marketplaces for Chinese exporters to sell online, there are already established options for merchants to collect funds. Setting up a bank account in a foreign country can be difficult for a small-time Chinese exporter, not to mention the high fees for remittance, so such merchants often seek third-party payments transfer solutions such as U.S.-based Payoneer and Chinese equivalents <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pingpong">Pingpong</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lianlian-pay">Lianlian</a>, which charge a relatively small fee to deposit merchants&#8217; sales into their bank accounts at home.</p>
<p>China has stringent policies for foreign exchange and electronic payments, but PayPal has already cleared the regulatory hurdles. In January, the American fintech titan became the first foreign firm to hold a license for online payment processor in China after it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-paypal-stake/paypal-becomes-first-foreign-firm-in-china-with-full-ownership-of-payments-business-idUKKBN29J0IC">bought out shares in a local payments firm</a>.</p>
<p>Obtaining the government greenlight is just the first step. The appeal of PayPal hinges largely on what it can offer to Chinese e-commerce exporters, who are now flooding the likes of Amazon and eBay.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, customers only care which service is the cheapest and easiest to use,&#8221; said the China-based manager from the American firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese cross-border payment solutions have achieved impressive results in terms of products, scale, and fees,&#8221; the person said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think PayPal stands a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exporters who build their own online stores instead of selling on mainstream marketplaces may still find PayPal necessary as a tool to accept payments from customers, given the app&#8217;s wide reach.</p>
<p>As for cross-border payments, PayPal is competing with Tencent&#8217;s WeChat Pay and Ant Group&#8217;s Alipay, which have long been ubiquitous in China. Both e-wallets have been aggressively growing their global partnerships to let China&#8217;s outbound travelers pay at overseas retailers like they would at home. Those shopping for overseas products domestically often use Chinese-owned e-commerce apps, which tend to have Alipay or WeChat Pay as their payment processor. Credit cards never became prevalent in China.</p>
<p>Cross-border payments have also become one of Ant&#8217;s main growth goals, according to the <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2020/1026/2020102600165.pdf">prospectus</a> of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">now-halted initial public offering</a>. While overseas businesses accounted for just about 5% of the firm&#8217;s revenue in the second half of 2020, most of that segment came from cross-border payments. At the time, Ant also had plans to spend HK$52.8 billion, or 40%, of the net proceeds from its IPO on expanding its cross-border payment and merchant services as well as other overseas functionalities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on whether PayPal is able to offer even lower fees than Ant,&#8221; said a person who previously worked on cross-border wallets for a Chinese company. &#8220;But PayPal itself is not famous for low fees.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sos-accessoire.com/">SOS Accessoire</a>, a French startup that helps people diagnose and repair their home appliances, has raised €10M/$12M in a funding round led by ETF Partners. The round was joined by Quadia, Starquest, and Seed for Good.</p>
<p>There is now a growing home repair market, powered by startups like this, which allow people to save money, but also reduce waste, and ultimately help the environment.</p>
<p>Around 80% of home appliances get replaced instead of repaired, creating an enormous environmental problem. At the same time, says SOS Accessoire, the spare parts market is worth €4.1bn in the European Union alone. So why not tap into that consumer desire? Why indeed not.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, sourcing spare parts is not easy, there are hundreds of suppliers, and instructions are aimed at professionals, not amateur repairers.</p>
<p>SOS Accessoire provides tools to diagnose home appliance problems, access spare parts, and provides video tutorials for the repair process.</p>
<p>The company says it estimates it has now saved half a million appliances in 2020, equivalent to 20,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, or the annual equivalent of CO2 emissions from 4,375 French people a year.</p>
<p>Olivier de Montlivault, the founder of SOS Accessoire, said: “We have a huge opportunity to help reduce household appliance waste and, in doing so, disrupt the perceived thinking that once something is broken, it must be replaced.”</p>
<p>Its direct competitors are other digital players focusing on the retail customer such as Spareka and Adepem. But SOS Accessoire says its competitive advantages include its size, availability of spare parts and catalog/database.</p>
<p>Remy de Tonnac, a partner at ETF Partners, said: “We’re seeing an increasingly conscious consumer wanting to maintain their appliances, rather than just throw them away. SOS Accessoire is ideally placed to meet that need, with a management team that has a deep understanding of the  market and the business model to not only dominate this niche within the e-commerce sector but disrupt the broader market itself.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, Ivorian e-commerce startup <a href="https://www.afrikrea.com/en">Afrikrea</a> started as a marketplace for African-based and inspired clothing, accessories, arts, and crafts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five years, Afrikrea has served more than 7,000 sellers from 47 African countries and buyers from 170 countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the company&#8217;s data, it records more than 500,000 visits monthly, with the majority of its customers from Europe and North America recording over $15 million in transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Afrikrea presents African merchants to showcase and sell their products to the world, it is just one of the many channels available, including personal websites and social media</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moulaye-taboure-78280041/">Moulaye Taboure</a> says that he noticed that merchants were splitting time and concentration across different channels, which affected their engagement with Afrikrea</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We noticed that it was getting harder for our sellers to make sales because they were losing time, money and energy switching between channels,&#8221; Taboure told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Every time they want to sell a product, they put it on social media, Afrikrea, and other websites. And when one buyer shows interest, there is no single place to track and see all the orders. That&#8217;s hard for these businesses to offer quality services and grow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then last year, Afrikrea began testing an all-in-one SaaS e-commerce platform for these merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it is announcing its launch. The platform called <a href="https://www.anka.africa">ANKA</a> will allow users to sell from Africa, ship products to anywhere in the world and get paid through local and international African payment methods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce, payments and global shipping. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s ANKA&#8217;s play for thousands of micro-retailers and businesses on the continent and around the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform lets users sell via an omnichannel dashboard with a single inventory, orders and messages management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Customers can carry out t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ransactions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">via a customized online storefront like Shopify, social media platforms, links such as on Gumroad and the Afrikrea marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants can carry out payments and payouts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via a wallet and an Afrikrea Visa card. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform, which costs $12, allows customers to perform mobile money and mobile banking transactions with MPesa, Orange, MTN and PayPal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shipping completes the entire sales life cycle, from the point of sale to receipt of goods. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Afrikrea partnered with global logistics partner</span><a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/05006ca0a798b8b530707cf4067db5e759ed20bd?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.africa-eshop.dhl%2F&amp;userId=1734919&amp;signature=83e47d57b7a55579"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DHL</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to offer shipping services to its customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike MallforAfrica and other e-commerce platforms, ANKA differentiates itself as a platform for export rather than import, specifically for African products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Moulaye, ANKA is currently the largest e-commerce exporter on the continent, and since its partnership with DHL, it has shipped more than 10 tons of cargo monthly from Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are the biggest client of DHL exporting from Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ship 10 tons every month and have sellers in 47 African countries, with Kenya and Nigeria as our largest markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have something African that is going to a global scale. That&#8217;s one of the angles we had with Afrikrea, and we want to keep that with ANKA. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sets us apart is that we&#8217;re not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trying to solve a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> African problem; we want to solve a global problem for Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching five years ago, Afrikrea, which Taboure launched with</span><a href="https://ci.linkedin.com/in/luc-b-perussault-diallo-99525519"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Luc B. Perussault Diallo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/abdoul-kadry-diallo-a7295b73"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kadry Diallo</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised a total of $2.1 million per Crunchbase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In this period, the company has seen its revenue grow 5x and claims to have ARR more than it has raised in its lifetime. To continue its growth efforts, Afrikrea is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the process of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concluding a Series A round later this year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger banks continue to make significant waves in the world of finance, with smaller outfits luring customers away from incumbents by providing an easier way for them to not only engage with basic banking services, but to tap into a wave of technology that brings more personalization and often better deals into the equation. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.vivawallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viva Wallet</a>, a Greek startup building banking services aimed at small and medium merchants, has picked up financing of $80 million, money that it will be using to expand its footprint and the services that it is offering to users, in particular expanding its Merchant Advance loans business.</p>
<p>The company is already live in 23 European markets and plans soon to expand that to Croatia, Hungary and Sweden.</p>
<p>The funding is notable in part because of who is doing the investing. Tencent &#8212; the Chinese technology giant behind Wechat that is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making major inroads into financial services</a> &#8212; is in the round, alongside the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Breyer Capital. Hedosophia, the somewhat secretive fund that also has been active in SPACs in the US, is also a backer, we have confirmed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Viva Wallet is not disclosing its valuation right now, but Yannis Larios, the company&#8217;s VP of strategy and business development, confirmed to us that it&#8217;s in the middle of closing a large Series D that will value it at €1.5 billion ($1.8 billion). This is a big leap: he also noted that when Viva Wallet closed its Series C in the second half of 2019, it was valued at €305 million.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the Series D is the same as a<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/greece-banks-vivawallet-idUSL8N2FF8G8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> €500 million ($603 million)</a> round that Reuters reported in August 2020 that Viva Wallet is raising (we have asked) to help it build out a new kind of loan book around its Merchant Advances and other loans that it provides to customers.</p>
<p>Essentially, if approved by regulators, investors would get stakes in a new legal entity, a special purpose vehicle, that will hold the loans. This is not typically how debt from loans is handled by neo-banks, but it seems that the logic is that it could give the startups more agility to scale faster by removing some of the risk from its balance sheet. (The downside: potentially less accountability around those loans?)</p>
<p>The round is notable for coming at a time when Europe is slowly, hopefully poking its head out from under the weight of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has shaken and knocked over many an economy already wobbling even before the public health crisis. Focused primarily on merchants, Viva Wallet is a prime example of the kind of tech business that might help some of these critical businesses recover.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“We are excited to onboard Tencent, EBRD and Breyer Capital to Viva Wallet,” said Haris Karonis, Founder and CEO of Viva Wallet, in a statement. “We are confident that our investors’ extensive know-how and network of partnerships will accelerate Viva Wallet’s plan to unify the fragmented European payments market. The technology innovations that we are bringing forward to European merchants will help them provide a frictionless, localised payment experience to all their clients, and liberate them from the hassle of maintaining legacy card terminals.”</span></p>
<p>If you think that the world of neo-banks is very crowded &#8212; and that specifically neo-banks focussed on the SMB opportunity is also getting crowded (some of the other contenders include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/small-business-challenger-bank-finom-raises-another-12-million-to-expand-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finom</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/wise-locks-down-5-7-million-to-scale-its-challenger-bank-designed-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wise</a> out of the US, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/monzo-business-bank-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monzo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/penta-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Penta</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/uk-challenger-bank-starling-raises-376m-now-valued-at-1-9b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starling</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/uks-anna-raises-21m-for-its-smb-focused-business-account-and-tax-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANNA</a> among many others)&#8211; one reason why Viva Wallet is getting some attention is because of its traction and track record so far.</p>
<p>Larios says that the startup has been profitable as of Q1 of this year, on the back of a business that has grown by more than 40% in the last year, with 60,000 merchants currently active on its books. It&#8217;s on track, he said, for that number to be 100,000 by the end of this year.</p>
<p>One reason for its success, he said, is that it&#8217;s taken a very localized approach to growth, setting up operations with physical branches in each of the countries where it is active &#8212; somewhat of a retro idea in today&#8217;s market where banks are regularly shutting down their brick-and-mortar locations and going virtual. &#8220;Viva Wallet is proving the resilience of its business model,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The funding will be used in part to build out its loans program but also to expand areas where Viva Wallet is already strong. One of these is its point of sale Tap-On-Phone solution, which turns any Android device (smartphone, tablet or enterprise device) into a card terminal, to accept both contactless and PIN payments without the need for separate hardware. (Most POS systems use small, separate terminals that will connect to a tablet or phone.)</p>
<p>He also said there will be some M&amp;A in the future to expand to more markets more quickly.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">One area where the company will not expand is into the consumer space. Other neo-banks like Revolut and Atom have leveraged their traction with younger consumers to move into providing services for the enterprises that they found, but Larios that that is not a strategy that Viva Wallet will take in the reverse, not least because the consumer market has so far proven to be a tough-margin (or even bad-margin) game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Viva Wallet focuses on businesses only and will continue to do so!&#8221; he said (exclamation his!). &#8220;The consumer segment is not providing any space for profitability and we are seeing that all competing neo-bank business models focusing on consumers are mostly burning money away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are focusing on the SMEs of Europe, providing a pan-European payments solution which however is very much localized to address merchants’ true local needs in terms of local payments acceptance, local IBAN accounts, local BIN business debit cards etc.&#8221; But while Viva Wallet may have a lot of SMB customers &#8212; and the EBRD investment is definitely being made to endorse that &#8212; he points out that it also includes medium businesses and some enterprises &#8212; larger merchants like supermarket chains, for example &#8212; and that will be an area it will continue to expand in.</span></p>
<p>This gives Viva Wallet enough specialization and differentiation, alongside its profitability in targeting those areas so far, to bring in the big name investors keen to tap into economic recovery, both to help that along and to ride the wave of that as it pays dividends.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very excited to help Viva Wallet unify the fragmented European payments ecosystem across 23 countries. Viva Wallet is at the forefront of a paradigm shift for fintech and together, we expect to transform the payments industry in Europe” said Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tencent shares Viva Wallet&#8217;s aspirations of creating value for users and partners through innovation. We look forward to supporting Viva Wallet in its expansion across Europe,&#8221; added Danying Ma, MD of Tencent Investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.barkyn.com/">Barkyn</a>, a European subscription service for pets that combines food with tele-vet services, has raised a further €3 milion ($3.6M) from FoodTech investor <a href="https://www.fiveseasons.vc/">Five Seasons Ventures</a>, extending its previous Series A to €8M, and total funds raised to date to €10M. Five Seasons Ventures joins previous investors Indico Capital Partners, All Iron Ventures, Portugal Ventures and Shilling Capital. Barkyn is in the same space as Tails, acquired by Nestlé, and Butternut Box from the UK which has raised $28M.</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, the Portuguese startup currently serves customers in Portugal, Spain and Italy, and is aiming to be a key ‘pet wellness’ brand for Southern Europe.</p>
<p>Barkyn says its subscription service offers “healthy food using fresh meat” plus a dedicated remote online veterinarian. It says personalizing the food to match the dog’s nutritional needs is part of its attraction for customers. It has also created the ‘Barkyn Complex’, a trademarked anti-inflammatory supplement for pets, plus a pet insurance product to its customers in Portugal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>André Jordão, Barkyn’s CEO and Co-Founder said in a statement: “There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to nutrition and what the body needs, and we solve this based on our knowledge, existing products and continued research and development.”</p>
<p>Barkyn is pushing at an open door. It’s widely acknowledged that during the pandemic, pet ownership has gone up across the world as people fought the lockdown blues.</p>
<p>In 2020 Barkyn says it experienced 40 percent growth each quarter across Southern Europe. </p>
<p>Commenting on the investment in Barkyn, Five Seasons’ Founding Partner Niccolo Manzoni said: “Barkyn is a unique company within Southern Europe, where the region has higher levels of pet ownership but no inspiring digital pet wellness brands. Combining personalized food with tele-vet services and, in the case of Portugal, insurance, gives customers one destination for the well-being of their pets.”</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Jordão said the startup had a shot at over-taking existing pet food brands because it’s “rethinking what the pet market should look like, through technology &#8211; building a pet care service and not only a pet food subscription. We’ve developed a 360 holistic experience: a subscription that aligns the best food you could ever give your dog with telemedicine. We’re able to secure a very close relationship while scaling the model.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenyan consumer experience platform for businesses in Africa, <a href="https://ajua.com/">Ajua</a> today announced that it has acquired <a href="https://www.wayawaya.com/">WayaWaya</a>, a Kenya-based AI and ML messaging and payments company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WayaWaya&#8217;s customers and partners include the likes of I&amp;M Bank, Interswitch and MTN. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company offers a range of services, from digital banking and payment services to financial services APIs and payment bots</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ajua, the acquisition is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on WayaWaya&#8217;s payments bots system known as <a href="https://janja.me/">Janja</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform, which has customers like Airtel, Ezee Money, Housing Finance Company of Kenya (HF Group), enables borderless banking and payments across apps and social media platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/teddy-ogallo-18211225">Teddy Ogallo</a>, the entrepreneur who founded WayaWaya, joins Ajua as VP of Product APIs and Integrations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wayawaya"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, WayaWaya has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $75,000. Although the two companies did not disclose the financial details of the acquisition, Ajua </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have paid 10 times more than WayaWaya&#8217;s total raise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ajua, formerly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/26/responding-to-the-demand-for-reliable-data-collection-in-africa-msurvey-raises-seed-funding/">mSurvey</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2012 by <a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/kenfieldgriffith">Kenfield Griffith</a>. The company is solving a consumer data problem for African businesses to understand their business better and drive growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of commerce happening on the continent and Ajua wants companies to move from transaction numbers to the customers behind such transaction,&#8221; Griffith told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Imagine if we knew what drove consumer habits for businesses. I mean, that&#8217;s a huge exponential curve for African businesses.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria&#8217;s SME market alone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is valued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at $220 billion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while businesses, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> big enterprises, can afford customer communication tools, a large segment of small businesses are being left out</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ajua&#8217;s play is to use data and analytics to connect companies with their customers in real time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken what makes enterprise customers successful, and we&#8217;re capturing it in a simple format so SMEs can have the same tools,&#8221; Griffith added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since most consumer behavior for these SMEs happens offline, Ajua gives businesses unique USSD codes to receive payments, get feedback and offer discounts to their customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the products Ajua has launched over the years for customer feedback at the point of service to businesses that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cumulatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have over 45 million customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an intelligent messaging bot, Janja </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> individuals and businesses across WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Telegram to automate customer support and make cross-border payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Janja&#8217;s integration into Ajua&#8217;s product stack will close much of the acquirer&#8217;s customer experience loop by automating responses and giving customers what they want, when they want it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This acquisition comes a month after Ajua announced that it partnered with telecom operator MTN Nigeria to launch a customer management product for Nigerian businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product called <a href="https://www.mtnbusiness.com.ng/engauge">MTN EnGauge</a> carries the same features present in Ajua but, in this case, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is tailored</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">solely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for businesses using the MTN network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The roll-out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to generate more data for Ajua&#8217;s thousands of users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also be upgraded to incorporate Janja and other services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, it appears Ajua could have created a product like Janja in-house due to its vast experience in the consumer experience space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company chose an acquisition and Griffith gave two reasons why &#8212; building a similar product would have taken a long time and Ogallo seemed to know Janja&#8217;s business and operations so well, it just made sense to get him on board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Teddy was going the same direction we&#8217;re going. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thought to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WayaWaya instead and make a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good company out of both products attempting to solve the same problem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To me, it&#8217;s all about solving the problem together rather than going alone,&#8221; said the CEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On why he accepted the acquisition, Ogallo, who now has a new role, noted that Ajua&#8217;s ability to scale customer service and experience and also help businesses was one reason and earned admiration from him</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Seeing how WayaWaya’s technology can complement Ajua’s innovative products and services, and help scale and monetize businesses, is an exciting opportunity for us, and we are happy that our teams will be collaborating to build something unique for the continent,” he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a solid infrastructure play from Ajua coming from a founder who is a massive advocate of acquisition and consolidation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith believes that the two are strategies for a speedier route to new markets and channels in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there are lots of ways we can build the ecosystem. There are lots of young talent building stuff, and they don&#8217;t have access to capital to get to the next stage. The question is if they want to race to the finish line or take off time and get acquired. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there&#8217;s a huge opportunity in Africa if you want to solve complex problems by acquisition.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been an uptick in local acquisitions in Africa from startups within a single country and between two countries in the past three years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he former, Nigerian recruitment platform <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/03/jobberman-acquires-top-competitor-ngcareers-undisclosed-deal/">Jobberman&#8217;s acquisition of NGCareers</a> last year comes to mind</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there are pan-African instances like Lagos-based hub <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/nigerias-cchub-acquires-kenyas-ihub-to-create-mega-africa-incubator/">CcHub&#8217;s acquisition of iHub</a>, its Nairobi counterpart; Ethiopian software provider Apposit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/nigerias-paga-acquires-apposit-confirms-mexico-and-ethiopia-expansion/">sell-off to Nigerian fintech Paga</a>; and Johannesburg-based fintech <a href="https://techcabal.com/2020/06/30/mfs-africa-beyonic-acquisition/">MFS Africa acquiring Uganda&#8217;s Beyonic</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The common theme among the acquisitions (and most African acquisitions) is their undisclosed sums</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Ajua, Griffith cited regulatory issues as one reason why the company is keeping the figure under wraps</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching nine years ago, Ajua has raised a total of $3.5 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/msurvey">Crunchbase</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the nature of this acquisition and partnership with MTN, the company might set sights on another fundraise to scale </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Nigeria (a market it entered in 2019) and other African countries.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic threw remote work into the spotlight, but tech companies have hired in other locations for years to deal with talent shortages. <a href="https://arc.dev/">Arc</a> announced today it is opening its remote hiring platform to all software developers. Previously, Arc was open only to developers who passed its verification process. Developers can still get verified to stand out from other applicants, but Arc’s job database and search engine is now available to everyone.</p>
<p>Arc was launched two years ago by the team behind <a href="https://www.codementor.io/">Codementor</a>, an online education platform for software developers. Since then, Arc has been used by companies like Spotify, Hims, Hubspot and FiveStars for hiring. Its investors include Techstars, 500 Startups, WI Harper and Y Combinator.</p>
<p>“As proud as we are of impact we have made for developers, we really want to scale that impact, and that’s why we decided to create a much more open product experience,” founder and chief executive officer Weiting Liu told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new version of Arc centers around two features: its smart remote job search engine and developer community. Arc crawls job boards and other sites for its database and has so far aggregated 54,000 developer openings from 13,000 companies. Then its search engine removes some of the challenges associated with searching for remote work.</p>
<p>“For example, one common complaint is that a lot of jobs are remote, but U.S. only. Or it’s only remote until the end of the pandemic,” Liu said. “Our algorithm will do its best based on your circumstances. For example, if you are a developer based in Asia or in Eastern Europe, there are certain job opportunities that are unfortunately not applicable to you based on the time zones. So we filter all of those things, and also based on your experience and tech stacks, to recommend the most relevant jobs.”</p>

<p>Arc Community is a resource for software developers who are new to remote work or want to learn about work practices in other countries. For example, “they might have questions like, should my resume be in this format for a U.S.-based employer, or what are the types of tools used and cultural norms?” Liu said. “If someone is looking for a position with an American company, we will talk about common interview practices or even basic work practices like how many companies use Slack. That’s where the community comes in and we want to enable developers who have already been working remotely to share their experiences.”</p>
<p>Even though it is now optional, Arc still recommends its verification process. It typically takes about a week, and includes a coding challenge and behavioral and technical interviews with an Arc team member. Even if someone doesn’t pass, they get feedback about where they can improve and can reapply in six months. Verification and job searches are free, and Arc monetizes by charging employers for hires through its platform.</p>

<p>In addition to its community, Arc recently launched a program called Elevate. Inspired by Liu’s experiences in Y Combinator and Techstars, Elevate is meant to be a “short-term talent accelerator” for developers who want to transition into remote work. Its first program included 13 developers from Latin America and future cohorts will range in size from 10 to 20 people. The program includes career preparation workshops, interview practice and live mentorship sessions with developers who work at GitLab, Zapier and Dialpad.</p>
<p>Arc is currently <a href="https://wefunder.com/arc">running a crowdfunding campaign</a>, started after the SEC implemented its new equity crowdfunding regulations, and has raised about $950,000 so far.</p>
<p>“This is aligned with our vision, which is about democratizing access, so if we can make Arc a partially community-owned remote job platform, it will be extremely interesting because we aspire to become the world’s largest remote job site and if we can turn our community members into investors-slash-owners of the platform, it can help us realize our mission faster,” said Liu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Look out Amazon Go. A Lisbon startup plans to offer the same autonomous store technology to other retailers. Lisbon-based <a href="https://www.sensei.tech/">Sensei</a>, a computer vision startup that allows convenience stores to offer check-out-free purchasing has secured a seed round of $6.5 million (€5.4M). The funding was led by <a href="https://seayaventures.com/">Seaya Ventures</a> and <a href="https://iberiscapital.com/">Iberis Capital</a>, with participation from <a href="https://www.200m.pt/">200M Fund</a>.</p>
<p>The startup will now scale its R&amp;D and launch new stores. Its proprietary platform uses a blend of cameras, sensors, and AI to automate stores, both new and existing. The platform means retailers can manage inventory in real-time and also access insights into the way the stores are used.</p>
<p>Vasco Portugal, Sensei’s CEO and Co-founder said: “Sensei’s technology will help level the playing field for retailers to compete against digital giants such as Amazon. We aim to enhance the familiar and enjoyable customer shopping experience, making it seamless, convenient, and safe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sensei is designed to work mainly with grab-and-go stores, forecourts, and similar retail formats. Competitors include <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trigo-vision">Trigo</a> which has raised $89 million.</p>
<p>The advantages of automated stores in a pandemic are obvious: customers no longer have to queue. Plus retailers can avoid stock-outs and staff turn into customer support.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to invest in a business that is part of the digitalization of commerce, a trend that is currently clearly being accelerated,” said Aris Xenofontos, Principal at Seaya Ventures.</p>
<p>Luis Quaresma, Partner at Iberis Capital, added: “Sensei brings tremendous efficiencies and cost-savings to the retail industry, while providing a much needed seamless checkout experience for consumers.”</p>
<p>Sensei was founded by Vasco Portugal (CEO, ex-MIT), Joana Rafael (COO),Nuno Moutinho (CTO) and Paulo Carreira (CSO).</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Almost two centuries ago, gold prospectors in California set off one of the greatest rushes for wealth in history. Proponents of socially conscious investing claim fund managers will start a similar stampede when they discover that environmental, social and governance (ESG) insights can yield treasure in the form of alternative data that promise big payoffs &#8212; if only they knew how to mine it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			First, let’s be clear: ESG is not on the fringe.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>There may be some truth to that line of thinking if you take some of the rhetoric and advertising out of the equation.</p>
<p>First, let’s be clear: ESG is not on the fringe. The European Union has implemented new financial regulations via the <a href="https://www.pwc.ch/en/publications/2020/sustainable-finance-disclosure-regulation.pdf">Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation </a>(SFDR). These improve ESG disclosures and considerations and help to direct capital toward products and companies that benefit people and the planet. As we write, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/sec-response-climate-and-esg-risks-and-opportunities">considering</a> drafting and implementation of ESG-related regulations.</p>
<p>Whether enacted or currently under consideration, these rules encourage fund managers to integrate sustainability risks into their business processes, report on them publicly, stamp out <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greenwashing.asp#:~:text=Greenwashing%20is%20the%20process%20of,company's%20products%20are%20environmentally%20friendly.">greenwashing</a>, and promote transparency and knowledge among investors. Accordingly, it will become easier to compare firms&#8217; sustainability efforts, too, allowing stakeholders from all corners to make more informed decisions.</p>
<p>Incorporating ESG factors into investment strategies is not new, of course. The world&#8217;s largest asset managers have been practicing it for years. <a href="https://www.ga-institute.com/press-releases/article/90-of-sp-500-index-companies-publish-sustainability-reports-in-2019-ga-announces-in-its-latest-a.html">According</a> to the Governance &amp; Accountability Institute, 90% of companies listed on the S&amp;P 500 now produce sustainability reports, an increase of 70 percentage points from more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>Yet some are still groaning about adopting an ESG investing mindset; they see ESG as a nuisance that detracts from their mission of earning high returns. But could this mindset mean they are missing important opportunities?</p>
<h2>Don’t wait</h2>
<p>Waiting for new mandatory ESG reporting and compliance framework standards in the U.S. puts Americas-focused managers at a significant disadvantage. Fund managers can start gaining insights today from alternative data originating in ESG-related data stemming from climate change, natural disasters, harassment and discrimination lawsuits, and other events and information that can be mined.</p>
