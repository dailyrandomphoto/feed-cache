										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In January, <a href="https://www.sabre.com/insights/releases/sabre-forges-10-year-partnership-with-google-to-build-the-future-of-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabre</a>, the travel technology company that probably managed at least some aspects of your last flight and hotel bookings, announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/google-cloud-lands-lufthansa-group-and-sabre-as-new-customers/">10-year partnership with Google Cloud</a> that would see it spend about $2 billion on Google&#8217;s cloud platform over that time. Sabre, like so many companies of its size, has long operated its own data centers, so any shift to the cloud would be a major undertaking. But while the story for a lot of big enterprises is all about being multi-cloud, Sabre is squarely betting on a single partner.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joedifonzo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe DiFonzo</a>, Sabre&#8217;s CIO, told me that this is the result of quite a bit of learning. When he joined Sabre in 2017, the company&#8217;s leadership had already decided on moving more workloads to the cloud. For Sabre, with its eight mainframes and more than 35,000 servers, that was never going to be a trivial undertaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was this whole element of how we operate our software, how we deploy our products, how we deliver service to customers, that was very much still sort of stuck in the traditional models, [including how you] run your own data center and the massive supply chain management issues around that, how we deploy software and package it, this notion of physical machine environments, that sort of thing,&#8221; he explained.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236668" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6LcRTPw25M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/google-cloud-lands-lufthansa-group-and-sabre-as-new-customers/">Google Cloud lands Lufthansa Group and Sabre as new customers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google Cloud lands Lufthansa Group and Sabre as new customers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/google-cloud-lands-lufthansa-group-and-sabre-as-new-customers/embed/#?secret=6LcRTPw25M" data-secret="6LcRTPw25M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With buy-in from the leadership, he set to move the company to not only the cloud but also a modern development model. And like so many other companies, Sabre started making deals with a number of cloud providers, mostly because the team wasn&#8217;t sure yet who to bet on &#8212; or whether to opt for a multi-cloud approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were able to start making that journey, but we had not done a lot in the cloud before. So, originally, we went on path where we made deals with all the major cloud providers. We were thinking: well, let&#8217;s go down the multi-cloud path until we see if there&#8217;s something better, because, quite frankly, we didn&#8217;t know what we didn&#8217;t know and we didn&#8217;t want to make the mistake of committing to anybody too early.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while the leadership was behind the move, DiFonzo felt like he had to get an early win, in part because the company&#8217;s customers also had to be on board. For that, the team picked one of Sabre&#8217;s most important and most CPU-intensive services: its shopping application, which previously ran in its own Tulsa, Oklahoma data center. That&#8217;s where a lot of revenue for Sabre&#8217;s customers is generated, so by being able to show improved performance and stability for this service, the team was able to build up credibility for the rest of its roadmap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But by mid-2018, the team realized that using multiple clouds became a limiting factor. While all of the different providers offered a plethora of interesting services, being multi-cloud meant the team had to limit itself to the lowest common denominator across the different providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you didn&#8217;t take the least common denominator approach, then you&#8217;d have this massive problem of having to train your entire staff on three different sets of architectures, three different groups of databases, three different types of messaging mechanisms, and on and on and on,&#8221; DiFonzo said. &#8220;So we really came back to, &#8216;hey, given where the cloud vendors are today &#8212; and this is two years from the initial point &#8212; do we really have a lack of confidence that any one of them really could fulfill our needs?'&#8221;</p>
<p>After an extensive search, the team decided to go with Google Cloud, based on its technology offerings and road map, but also because of Google&#8217;s acquisition of ITA, which gave it unique insights into how the travel space operates. Sabre was also interested in Google&#8217;s AI technologies, as well as Apigee&#8217;s ability to help Sabre manage its APIs &#8212; and, as DiFonzo noted, both companies also had similar engineering mindsets.</p>
<p>Even with hindsight, more than two years later and with new multi-cloud tools available like Google&#8217;s own Anthos or Microsoft&#8217;s Azure Arc, DiFonzo believes he would make the same decision. Indeed, Sabre actually uses parts of Anthos to manage its applications inside of Google&#8217;s environment. But maybe most importantly, DiFonzo argues, going with a single vendor allows its engineering teams to focus.</p>
<p>So far, Sabre has trained more than 3,600 employees on Google Cloud (and those employees have consumed over 67,000 hours of learning content on Coursera alone).</p>
<p>At this point, about 15% of Sabre&#8217;s mid-range workloads have been migrated to Google&#8217;s cloud, including 100% of its Hotel Customer Reservation System and Travel Solutions airfare shopping service.</p>
<p>That may be slower than some expected. A report in The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-a-2-billion-google-cloud-contract-has-generated-only-10-million-in-revenue-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this year</a> noted that Sabre had only spent about $10 million on Google Cloud so far. But DiFonzo argues that nobody should be surprised by this, and that the last year was all about laying the foundations, with the move now accelerating. Indeed, he expects that 75% of Sabre&#8217;s total compute capacity will be powered by Google Cloud by the end of next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took the time of training and building all the infrastructure &#8212; because our goal isn&#8217;t to just move machines immediately, it&#8217;s to be more efficient at the end of the day. All of the automation work and all of the planning work that went into this is now helping us move forward faster,&#8221; he said. That also means that the team is decomposing old applications into microservices, for example &#8212; which itself means that engineering and operations teams have to learn new skills. So it&#8217;s not just about containerizing existing applications, but also moving some applications to a serverless architecture using Google Cloud Functions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to take a little bit more work on our part to validate all that &#8212; performance and operation and scale, etc. But certainly, that just goes to the next level of how we continue to virtualize away a lot of the routine day-to-day management activities we have to deal with today,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>As for bringing more AI-powered services to its customers, DiFonzo noted that he doesn&#8217;t want to have to build all of the infrastructure to do so. Together, Saber and Google are developing a new AI-driven platform to bring more of this technology to Sabre&#8217;s product portfolio. Sabre is also in the process of moving 11 petabytes from its core data sets to Google Cloud (with all data migrating by 2023), and it&#8217;s about to launch a new market intelligence product that uses BigQuery and Looker to predict travel demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to stand on the shoulders of giants,&#8221; DiFonzo explained. &#8220;They have tens of thousands of engineers figuring out all this cool stuff. And I just want to put it to use as quickly and safely as we can here at Sabre.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hulu is getting a sizable upgrade starting next month that will give its Live TV subscribers access to both the Disney+ and ESPN+ streaming services as part of their plan. Beginning on December 21, 2021, Hulu + Live TV subscriptions across both its ad-free and ad-supported tiers will bundle in access to Disney&#8217;s other streaming services for a small &#8212; but not optional &#8212; upcharge.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/how-much-does-hulu-cost">plans</a> will increase by $5 per month, the company says.</p>
<p>That means the Hulu + Live TV Ad-Supported plan will now be $69.99 per month instead of $64.99 per month, while the Hulu +  Live TV No Ads plan will now be $75.99 per month, instead of $70.99 per month.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236903" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While generally, streaming subscribers don&#8217;t appreciate the constant fee hikes they&#8217;ve been seeing, a $5 increase to add on two more major streaming services may be viewed a bit differently. By itself, a Disney+ subscription would have otherwise cost either $7.99 per month or $79.99 per year. Meanwhile, ESPN+ is priced at either $6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year. If you subscribed to at least one of those separately from your Hulu + Live TV plan, you&#8217;ll be saving money.</p>
<p>Before this change, all three services had been separately marketing <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-hulu-espn-bundle">the &#8220;Disney bundle,</a>&#8221; which combined Disney+ and ESPN+ with Hulu&#8217;s regular ad-supported or ad-free plan for $13.99 per month or $19.99 per month, respectively. However, this combo had left out Hulu + Live TV subscribers from accessing a similar bundle discount.</p>
<p>Of course, the current Disney bundle is something consumers can opt into if they want to combine multiple services onto one bill. Hulu + Live TV is being upgraded automatically.</p>
<p>Despite the combination, users will still need different apps. While ESPN+ content <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/hulu-disney-espn-bundle#watch">was already made available</a> in the Hulu app, users will still need to visit a separate app to access Disney+. Hulu will email users an activation link for adding Disney+, it says, and will include this link in users&#8217; account settings for easy access.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also notes that existing subscribers will not need to cancel Disney+ or ESPN+, if they were already subscribed. As long as the email addresses on file for both accounts are the same &#8212; and they&#8217;re paying through Hulu (not a carrier) &#8212; the subscriptions will be connected automatically. For applicable subscribers, Hulu will issue a credit for the retail value of each existing subscription on their first regular billing cycle on or after December 21.</p>
<p>Disney has been working to further capitalize on its Hulu investment since its 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/disney-closes-it-71-3b-fox-acquisition/">acquisition</a> of Fox and subsequent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/15/hulu-buys-back-atts-minority-stake-in-streaming-service-now-valued-at-15-billion/">buyback</a> of AT&amp;T&#8217;s 9.3% stake <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/hulu-disney-comcast/">gave it full operational control</a> of Hulu. In the time since, it&#8217;s changed the organizational structure, raised prices, and combined some content libraries.</p>
<p>Last year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/hulu-restructures-under-disney-ceo-randy-freer-departs/">restructured</a> Hulu to streamline executives&#8217; reporting structure to be directed to Disney&#8217;s Direct to Consumer and International chairman, which was then Kevin Mayer. (Mayer shortly thereafter left to run TikTok in the U.S., then <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiktok-ceo-kevin-mayer-resigns-control-acquisition-bytedance-zhang-yiming-2020-8">quit</a> amid the Trump-induced &#8220;TikTok ban&#8221; drama. <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/leaders/rebecca-campbell/">Rebecca Campbell</a> <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/rebecca-campbell-disney-kevin-mayer-direct-to-consumer-international-1234611583/">succeeded</a> him at Disney.)</p>
<p>Disney this year <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/disney-phase-out-hotstar-us-espn-hulu-bundle-1235050111/">made the decision</a> to fold in Hotstar&#8217;s South Asian sports and entertainment programing into ESPN+ and Hulu, and shutter the standalone Hotstar U.S. service in 2022. The company also pushed price increases across its service, hiking Hulu + Live <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/hulu-will-increase-the-price-of-its-live-tv-service-again-on-december-18th/">by $10 more per month last December,</a> and <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/09/hulu-raises-prices-disney-ad-supported-premium-streaming-1234827203/">later</a> bumping up the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22661241/hulu-plans-ads-dollar-price-increase-monthly-subscription-disney">Hulu + Live service</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date">Disney+</a>, ESPN+, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date">Disney bundle</a> by $1 more per month in 2021.</p>
<p>Today, Disney+ is larger and growing faster than the Hulu business. As of Disney&#8217;s fiscal Q4 2021 <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2021/11/q4-fy21-earnings.pdf">earnings</a>, Disney+ had 118.1 million subscribers, up 60% year-over-year, while Hulu combined business had 43.8 million subscribers, up 20% year-over-year. Hulu&#8217;s Live TV business is the smallest tier of Hulu, with just 4 million subscribers. That&#8217;s down from 4.1 million year-over-year &#8212; an indication that today&#8217;s consumers may see a declining value in live TV content. (It&#8217;s still larger than Sling TV, however, which <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/dish-network-dish-q3-earnings-145702640.html">has 2.56 million</a> subscribers).</p>
<p>This new bundle could give Hulu + Live TV&#8217;s numbers a boost, if it incentivizes upgrades or new sign-ups, as Disney hopes. Or it may end up being one price hike too many, leading to further cancellations as users drop down to the more affordable Disney bundle, which doesn&#8217;t have live TV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market for crypto-focused investing is growing rapidly. News that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/crypto-vc-firm-paradigm-debuts-monster-2-5-billion-fund/">Paradigm put together a $2.5 billion fund</a> the other day is a reminder of the scale of funds now available to startups looking to build on the blockchain. Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">has a mega-fund in the market as well</a>, while Coinbase Ventures is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase-ventures/recent_investments">setting a blistering pace</a> for a corporate venture firm.</p>
<p>The result of the run-up in capital availability has led to, as in many other venture markets, larger and more rapid-fire rounds &#8212; and more unicorns.</p>
<p>While the now-dated unicorn valuation threshold of $1 billion is losing some of its salience in a market where there are hundreds of unicorns globally, inside a single niche the metric can still prove useful. The crypto market is one such place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/">The Block</a>, a crypto-focused publication <a href="https://www.theblockresearch.com/">and research operation</a>, has <a href="https://www.theblockresearch.com/mapping-out-the-blockchain-unicorns-124025">a new data collection</a> out this morning that highlights just how rapidly the unicorn cohort is expanding in the crypto space. The data set also details where unicorns are being formed, in both focus terms &#8212; exchanges, NFT platforms, etc. &#8212; and geographically.</p>
<p>Key takeaways today are that the United States, despite certain domestic complaints that it is hostile to the crypto economy, is by far the dominant single market for crypto unicorn creation, and that the business-model mix of crypto unicorns is broader than I anticipated. Let&#8217;s dig in!</p>
<h2>Money</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s the perfect moment to discuss crypto unicorns, and not because Paradigm just secured billions to invest. Furthermore, rumor is out that OpenSea, an NFT platform, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/co-founder-titles-arent-a-formality-theyre-a-morality/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">considering raising capital at a $10 billion valuation</a>. The company was last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/nft-market-opensea-hits-1-5-billion-valuation/">valued at $1.5 billion earlier this year</a>. <em>That&#8217;s</em> the sort of valuation appreciation that some crypto startups are enjoying today.</p>
<p>The result? There are now 64 total crypto unicorns. And, per The Block Research, that figure has grown by 39 so far in 2021. Simply: More than half of the global crypto unicorns reached the $1 billion threshold this <em>year</em> alone.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why. Crypto trading has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/coinbase-crushes-q2-expectations-notes-q3-trading-volume-is-trending-lower/">proven to be nearly comedically lucrative</a>, leading to a number of exchanges <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/11/18/gemini-raises-400-million-to-protect-the-metaverse-from-meta-facebook/?sh=57e516b25f57">raising what we might describe as <em>hella bank</em></a>. But more than that, crypto assets themselves have proven to be profitable trades to host. NFT marketplaces are minting cash, adding more unicorns to the tally.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s The Block&#8217;s breakdown of today&#8217;s crypto unicorn model makeup:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/sequoia-dramatically-revamps-its-fund-structure-as-it-looks-to-rethink-venture-capital-model/">decision by Sequoia</a> to become a registered investment adviser (RIA) and move to a “singular, permanent structure,” in its own words, landed with a splash in the U.S. venture capital market. But perhaps it shouldn’t have made quite as many waves as it did.</p>

<hr />
<p>Sequoia was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/andreessen-horowitz-isnt-alone-in-leaving-behind-vc-as-we-know-it-and-more-company-is-coming/">not the first</a> United States-based venture capitalist to opt for RIA status, and it was also not the first venture capitalist that The Exchange tracks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/how-public-markets-can-help-address-venture-capitals-limitations/">that moved to a more permanent-capital model</a>. The combination of becoming an RIA and moving to a capital pool that isn’t beset with artificial return windows may be notable in the United States, but we’ve seen examples of this elsewhere.</p>
<p>To better understand what Sequoia is up to, The Exchange reached out to a number of publicly listed venture capital groups from the United Kingdom: We chatted with Augmentum Fintech COO <a href="https://twitter.com/rmatthews_">Richard Matthews</a>, Molten Ventures partner <a href="https://twitter.com/vinothj">Vinoth Jayakumar</a>, and Forward Partners managing partner <a href="https://twitter.com/brisbourne">Nic Brisbourne</a>. We’ve spoken to them before, when we previously explored the advantages and costs of VCs moving to listed status.</p>

The Sequoia shift, the investors told us, is similar to their own setup in its ability to provide more returns-timing flexibility – possibly allowing for greater return maximization – but different in whom it benefits.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about it.</p>
<h2><strong>The Sequoia shift</strong></h2>
<p>Sequoia partner Roelof Botha spoke about his firm’s model shift <a href="https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/66371765/botha-sequoias-crucible-moment?tab=transcript">on a podcast the other day</a>, giving us a somewhat long-form explanation of what it&#8217;s up to. During the show, he noted that Sequoia tells “founders that the IPO is a milestone” &#8212; not the finish line &#8212; for a company. So, he rhetorically asked, why “should the IPO be a destination for the investor”?</p>
<p>The comment gets at the crux of what Sequoia would like to do with its new model: hold investments longer, requiring the VC to be able to hold stocks over a long time horizon. RIAs are not beholden to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/sbcfac/2020-02-04-presentation-vc-fund-definition.pdf">venture capital rules</a> requiring them to hold 80% of their assets in private companies, loosely, and no more than 20% in other assets. This means that if a venture capitalist scores a big win with a startup that goes public, there will likely be pressure to liquidate some of the VC&#8217;s position as a result.</p>
<p>This can lead to earlier-than-desirable exits in terms of returns, i.e., VCs have to return stock or cash to their LPs before the investment in question has had its full chance to generate profit &#8212; and, therefore, returns for both venture fund backers (LPs) and venture fund managers (GPs).</p>
<p>And if there is one thing that is true about venture investors, it’s that they want to get paid.</p>
<p>In the same podcast, Botha said that Sequoia “realized” that the best venture bets “continue to compound, and the majority of the value accrues after the IPO.” The balance has changed, we’d note, as private companies stay private longer. But, yes, it’s true that in some cases, big returns largely land post-IPO. Shopify is an obvious example of how money can be made holding through a public offering, to pick one.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/2021-financial-operating-benchmarks-report">recent report from OpenView</a> makes this point well, noting that since Salesforce’s 2004 IPO, it has grown its valuation 210x. Shopify, the venture group noted, is up 143x from its IPO price. ServiceNow is up 60x. There are simply massive returns to be made – and therefore huge checks for GPs – in holding certain investments post-debut.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The skyline of the city is a mass of brightly lit office buildings, industrial factories and skyscrapers, the endless hash of lights and shadows making the night seem as if it is teeming with life. Within that urban jungle, we find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitgupta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amit Gupta</a>, our dastardly hero. He smelled of fresh laundry, hair gel and a faint aroma of peppermint. His suit was a silken blend of powerful cologne and a soft, warm scent of leather and musk. His woolly hat was of a bright hue of burnt ochre. His necktie was of a darker hue of pink. The startup founder’s skin is soft and warm like a newborn baby. He has a strong handshake and a gentle demeanor. His conviction runs deep. The company? <a href="https://www.sudowrite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sudowrite</a>. The co-founder? James Yu, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/25/facebook-parse/">also founded Parse and later sold it to Facebook</a>. The investors? An impressive list of angels. The dollar amount? $3 million.</p>
<p>In the midst of the urban cacophony and an immense symphony of sounds, the sounds of traffic, the sounds of kids playing, the sounds of televisions, of radio, of fire alarms, of police sirens, of mumbling drunks, he received a piece of blood-curdling news. Amit was diagnosed with leukemia, and his life was utterly upended. It was time to take stock, and really examine what was important for him. He took a breath &#8212; was he on borrowed time, or was this merely a wake-up call?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235339" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235339" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235339" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png" alt="" width="1024" height="358" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png?resize=150,53 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png?resize=300,105 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png?resize=768,269 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png?resize=680,238 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Startup.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235339" class="wp-caption-text">Asking Sudowrite to describe what a startup is had me laughing so hard I was gasping for air. Truly, a magical experience. Screenshots: Sudowrite</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235319" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gone was the dream of running his existing startup, Photojojo, which was known for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/16/photojojo-gets-into-camera-gear-rentals-but-not-just-for-fancy-lenses/">drone rentals</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/01/turn-your-expensive-dlsr-into-a-cheap-pinhole-camera/">strange photography accessories</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/03/20/wrap-around-photo-frames-fit-on-corners/">creative photo-mounting ideas.</a> He sold it, and ended up spending some time trying to figure out what to do next. The money he got from the sale of his company was no thicker than a thin black leaf, curled like the wings of the devil, thin as paper, thin as smoke, thin as silk; it felt like spider webs.</p>
<p><strong>If the first couple of paragraphs of this article seem weird</strong>, that&#8217;s because I used the Sudowrite tool to write a bunch of descriptions. It&#8217;s hilarious &#8212; but also an incredibly powerful tool. Do they make sense? Not always, but that&#8217;s not the point &#8212; the tool isn&#8217;t meant to replace writers completely, but to help summarize or expand, or to spark the creative juices that sometimes are lacking in the writing process. With that in mind &#8212; as you can read from the completely bonkers beginnings of this article &#8212; it works fantastically well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sold Photojojo in 2014 after being sick and kind of going through some soul searching. I left Silicon Valley completely and did some travel. I did all these things on my bucket list. At some point, it was five years out from the transplant, which meant that like I probably wasn&#8217;t going to die of leukemia,&#8221; Amit Gupta, founder and CEO of Sudowrite told me. &#8220;And then I was like &#8212; well, what do I do with my life? I was coaching for a while. And then I ended up writing science fiction for the past several years and getting really into that. It was really fun, and something very new for me, starting all the way at the bottom and clawing my way up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his journey as a science fiction writer, Gupta ran into an issue many writers experience: Writer&#8217;s block. It shouldn&#8217;t be this hard to write, should it?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think Sudowrite solves multiple problems, and I think the specifics are different for every writer. One of the problems I discovered with writing was that it is very solitary. Coming from the startup world where everything is very collaborative. It felt very lonely to be sitting at the keyboard, hitting my head against the desk whenever I got stuck in having no outlet except for my once-a-week reading group which may or may not be able to help. I think our first impulse was, can we create something that acts like a creative partner sitting next to you, so that when you&#8217;re stuck you can turn to them and say, &#8216;I can&#8217;t figure this out? This isn&#8217;t working, like give me ideas.&#8217; That was the original impulse,&#8221; Gupta explains.</p>

They have been known to grow to a size just a little larger than a typical house cat. A hodgepodge of human skeletons lay huddled together in the dirt, their eye sockets staring blankly at the sky, nestled in a pile that looks more like a rubbish heap than a grave. The founders gather their wits, shaking the muck from their clogs and steeling themselves for battle. They can hear the dragon breathing down on them.

<p>&#8220;We wanted to <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">give you someone who&#8217;s almost as good as a human reading partner, to bounce ideas off of. Beyond that, I think as we talked to users, especially people in the entertainment industry such as screenwriters, we discovered there was a specific need. They have a lot of rote tasks that they don&#8217;t like doing: they might have a screenplay they&#8217;ve written and they might need to generate a one-page treatment, a three-page treatment, etc. It&#8217;s all very specific industry stuff, but it&#8217;s pretty easy for an AI to do. It&#8217;s not very creative work, and a tool like Sudowrite saves them hours and hours of the worst kind of work that they have to do. I think there&#8217;s a lot of opportunities like that, but the core product is really about inspiration provocation, helping you stay in flow.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Gupta was trying to fight off the loneliness of writers with a Sci-Fi writing group, where he met his co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesyu/">ex-Parse founder James Yu</a>. Together they built an early version of the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/okay-the-gpt-3-hype-seems-pretty-reasonable/">built on GPT-3</a>, started getting some paid customers, and decided to raise some funds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started thinking we&#8217;d raise about $1 million just to get this off the ground. We ended up raising $3 million, almost entirely from individual investors. That was by design: We wanted to have people who were willing to allow us to experiment at our own pace and try some like weird stuff, without the pressure of doing the startup / VC treadmill,&#8221; explains Gupta.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s list of angel investors is incredibly impressive, and includes Medium and Twitter founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ev-williams/">Ev Williams</a>, Gumroad founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sahil-lavingia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sahil Lavingia</a>, Parse founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-lacker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Lacker</a>, WordPress founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/matt-mullenweg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Mullenweg</a> and Rotten Tomatoes founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/patrick-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrick Lee</a>. The cap table also includes an impressive who-is-who from the entertainment world, including Big Fish and Aladdin screenwriter <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0041864/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John August</a>, Bourne Ultimatum and Oceans Twelve writer/director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1079776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Nolfi</a>, and many more.</p>
<p>The company currently has between 300 and 400 users, paying around $20 per month for the platform. The fundraising round enabled the founding team to extend the team a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;The primary thing this fundraise unlocks for us is to be able to hire. We hired our first machine learning person, our first developer and a lead designer. Those are the first three roles we just closed, and we&#8217;ll probably keep the team at that size for a while as we hit our stride,&#8221; explains Gupta. &#8220;Our users all came from word of mouth, and cover a wide range. We have people who are writing novels or screenplays. Some of our users are creating Substack newsletters. We have users who write for their occupation. But we have some unusual use cases too: A rabbi who uses Sudowrite to make parables, and someone who uses the tool to write meditations. We also have users who create roleplaying games. We have a very broad appeal,&#8221;</p>
<p>Sudowrite is currently in a closed beta. You can <a href="https://www.sudowrite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join the waitlist on its website</a>. Below, I&#8217;m embedding a video demo Gupta recorded. It&#8217;s a few months old, but it gives a bit more of an idea what the tool is and how it works.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. financial regulators have approved a new rule that requires <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/banking/">banking</a> organizations to report any “significant” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> incident within 36 hours of discovery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Under the rule, banks must inform their primary federal regulator about incidents that have — or are reasonably likely to materially affect — the viability of their operations, their ability to deliver products and services, or the stability of the U.S. financial sector. That could include large-scale distributed denial of service (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ddos/">DDoS</a>) attacks that disrupt customer access to banking services, or computer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/hacking/">hacking</a> incidents that disable banking operations for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Additionally, banks — which the rule defines as “banking organizations” including national banks, federal associations, and federal branches of foreign banks — must notify customers “as soon as possible” if the incident has or might materially affect their customers for four hours or more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237154" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Computer-security incidents can result from destructive malware or malicious software (cyberattacks), as well as non-malicious failure of hardware and software, personnel errors, and other causes,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/board-matters/2021/2021-11-17-notational-fr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer-Security Incident Notification Final Rule</a> explains. &#8220;Cyberattacks targeting the financial services industry have increased in frequency and severity in recent years. These cyberattacks can adversely affect banking organizations&#8217; networks, data, and systems, and ultimately their ability to resume normal operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final rule, approved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), will take effect on April 1, 2022, with full compliance expected by May 1, 2022.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether the rule will also apply to banking startups and fintech companies. TechCrunch contacted the FDIC for more but did not immediately hear back.</p>
<p>Financial regulators first proposed the notification requirement in December, but after receiving some negative feedback from industry groups, it was forced to change some elements of the final rule.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The original version, for example, said that banks would have to report incidents if they “believed in good faith” they had suffered a significant cyber incident, but the industry warned that this could lead to over-reporting of a wide range of incidents, and the rule was changed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“After considering the comments carefully, the agencies are replacing the ‘good faith belief’ standard with a banking organization’s determination,” <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20211118a1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the final rule summary states</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> “The agencies agree with commenters who criticized the proposed ‘believes in good faith’ standard as too subjective and imprecise.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The Bank Policy Institute, one of the industry groups that had commented on the regulation, <a href="https://bpi.com/bpi-supports-cyber-incident-notification-rule-finalized-by-banking-regulators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a statement</a> that it supported the final rule.</p>
<p>“BPI recognizes the value of timely notification and supports the final rule, which establishes a clear timeline and flexible process for notifying regulators and affected parties when a significant incident occurs,” said Heather Hogsett, BPI&#8217;s senior vice president of Technology and Risk Strategy. “The rule also importantly maintains a clear distinction between notification and reporting. Cyber incident notification encourages early collaboration between regulators and banks so that regulators are made aware of circumstances that may have broader implications across the financial system while banks work to respond to, and investigate the incident.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Mini, the diminutive and unexpectedly fun to drive car born out of the <a href="https://www.mini.com/en_MS/home/automotive/heritage/1959-the-mini-was-born.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late 1950s fuel crisis in the U.K.</a>, is undergoing another revolution. This time, it&#8217;s being driven by climate change and parent company BMW&#8217;s plan to go all-electric by 2030.</p>
<p>Mini isn&#8217;t new to battery electrics &#8212; the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2010/08/19/lessons-learned-after-150000-kilometers-with-the-mini-e-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mini E pilot program</a> started way back in 2008. The current Mini SE electric vehicle has been in high demand since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/all-electric-mini-cooper-se-priced-starting-at-29900-in-the-u-s/https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/all-electric-mini-cooper-se-priced-starting-at-29900-in-the-u-s/">going on sale in 2020</a>. But they&#8217;re not the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both the Mini E and the Cooper SE. They&#8217;re essentially retrofits of existing internal combustion engine vehicles. So we have yet to really get into the space,&#8221; Mike Peyton, vice president of MINI of the Americas, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237062" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like nearly all automakers, Mini is working on a dedicated electric platform for its future vehicles. However, the central focus isn&#8217;t range as much as how it drives. It has to drive like a Mini.</p>
<p>&#8220;​​It&#8217;s got to be fun. It&#8217;s got to be that Mini handling and we think that fits really, really well overall for electrification,&#8221; Peyton said. That behind-the-wheel go-kart feeling Mini is famous for needs to be there even when the vehicle is powered by electrons instead of dead dinosaurs.</p>
<p>As for how these future electric Minis will look, Peyton says, &#8220;it&#8217;s definitely going to be more of that modern interpretation of what people have maybe seen and expected from us. In our very early years, it was all about that minimalism and that simplicity. I think you&#8217;ll see that as a theme in a lot of our future cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Future cars will include an electric convertible Mini that drives forward the tech, while maintaining its legacy and brand identity. The company is working today on what that future-yet-brand-centric EV looks like and how it can evolve moving forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Mini might get smaller and bigger</h2>
<p>More exciting is the potential for something completely unexpected, especially in a world quickly being populated by electric SUVs and crossovers. In the future, Peyton said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll also see some small-format vehicles, which are very very Mini.&#8221; When asked if these vehicles would be smaller than what the automaker currently has for sale, Peyton replied &#8220;potentially, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>For fans of the pre-BMW-acquisition Minis, which are incredibly tiny, the move to electrification might usher in a new micro-vehicle market in the United States.</p>
<p>Peyton said the brand may also design and sell an EV Mini larger than what&#8217;s on the road today. It&#8217;s unclear exactly what &#8220;bigger&#8221; Mini means. Based on the reaction to the automaker&#8217;s <a href="https://www.mini.com/en_MS/home/nextgen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concept Urbanaut</a>, this vehicle may skew more VW microbus than Mini.</p>
<p>Mini is in an interesting position. The character of its vehicles &#8212; small, fun and mostly urban &#8212; fits incredibly well in an EV package.</p>
<p>The Mini SE (a vehicle with an EV powertrain shoved into a gas-powered car) is a bit of an appetizer of the company&#8217;s future. Even though its range of 110 miles is laughably small in a world where more than 200 miles is the norm, the first year of production was sold out. Mini says that 80% of those buying the vehicle are new to the brand.</p>
<p>The success of the brand as it navigates the climate crisis really relies on one thing. How its EVs drive and look. On that front Peyton tells us &#8220;it will always be unmistakably a Mini.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony.ai, the self-driving startup that operates in both the U.S. and China, has lost at least two executives from its trucking team following the combination of the company’s passenger car and self-driving truck R&amp;D teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development, initially detailed by two sources familiar with the internal restructure that happened quietly in September, was later confirmed by Pony. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Toyota-backed startup said the restructuring was made because combining the teams would lead to more efficient outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the move has called into question Pony’s plans for commercially developing autonomous trucking technology, specifically in the United States. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232394" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank (Zhenhao) Pan, one of the executives who recently resigned, was the chief technology officer for Pony&#8217;s trucking business. The team he led included senior engineers of the autonomous truck driving team in the U.S. Twenty members of that team have since left the company, either leading up to or immediately after the restructuring, a person familiar with the departures told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan and another colleague, Youhan Sun, who used to lead planning and control for Pony’s trucking business in the U.S., left to start another self-driving truck company together, Qingtian Smart Trucking Technology. According to Tianyancha, a Chinese database that compiles business records, Zhenhao owns 82% of Qingtian and Youhan owns 18%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sun Haowen, former head of planning and control for Pony’s autonomous driving in China, also left following the merger, </span><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/w4kWHIOAmijHEHWxsyrXBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to China’s LatePost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has gone on to work at Qiangua Technology, a company that specializes in Level 4 autonomous trucking technology.</span></p>
<h3>Pony.ai&#8217;s thwarted IPO</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until August this year, Pony was gearing up to go public in New York with a $12 billion valuation through a SPAC merger. The company put those plans on hold as it struggled to gain assurances from Beijing that it wouldn’t become the next target of a crackdown against Chinese technology companies going public in the U.S., </span><a href="http://reuters.com/technology/exclusive-chinas-tech-crackdown-thwarts-ponyais-us-listing-plans-sources-2021-08-11/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Pony says it’s an American company with headquarters in Silicon Valley. However, much of its operations, including all of its self-driving truck testing, take place in China, a country that exerts considerable regulatory power over autonomous vehicle companies.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pony does have some operations in the U.S., notably in California, <span style="font-weight: 400;">where it tests passenger cars equipped with autonomous vehicle technology. The company has been testing its AVs on public roads in California since 2017. It was even providing a driver passenger service in Irvine, California until service was suspended due to the pandemic. The service should return in 2022, the company says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony’s SPAC deal would have given the startup an additional $1.2 billion to play with, but since the listing was reportedly blocked, Pony has had to think a little differently about its finances and the allocation of resources, according to LatePost. Pony declined to comment on its IPO, but a lack of resources could be the reason the two R&amp;D teams were combined. </span></p>
<h3>A short history of PonyTron</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company established a separate trucking division in 2020, which it branded <a href="https://www.telematicswire.net/pony-announces-brand-name-of-autonomous-truck-business-ponytron/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PonyTron</a> at the end of March. It was actively hiring for the division, Pony confirmed. The team had grown to about 100 people by September, according to LatePost. While PonyTron was growing fast, it still lagged in terms of total workforce compared to others in the self-driving trucks industry. </span><a href="https://ir.tusimple.com/static-files/2df1337a-af02-4ac3-9adc-ea1b5dcdf53f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TuSimple’s R&amp;D team is about 1,000 people</span></a>, for instance.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony, while demonstrating potential, was still lagging in terms of resources. Now recruitment has slowed nearly to a halt and road tests for trucks based in the U.S. have been suspended, TechCrunch&#8217;s source confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony denied that it had intentionally slowed its hiring in trucking, saying it has enough staff and will continue to fill roles as needed. The company also said it has the same approximate headcount working on trucking and auto as before, with plans to continue to hire in trucking to support future growth. </span></p>
<h3>Divide and conquer?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current trucking staff on the newly combined R&amp;D team are mainly junior engineers, since most of the senior ones left, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The source said at least some of the senior engineers believed strongly that smart trucking and passenger trucks should be separate, not combined. Many experts in the industry agree it makes more sense to train different models for different use cases. Passenger cars usually go to market as robotaxis, which are often trained to drive in urban environments. Trucks, which carry freight between cities, are often trained to drive on highways.</span></p>
<p>Some companies, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/self-driving-startup-aurora-taps-pixar-veterans-to-make-a-more-realistic-virtual-world-for-testing/">Aurora</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/waymo-self-driving-vehicles-are-headed-to-nyc-for-a-mapping-operation/">Waymo</a>, have been known to follow a similar approach to Pony and combine forces, saying experiences learned by one driver can benefit others. Others tend to focus on one or the other because they say it&#8217;s a faster and more direct route to market, which will allow for a better business and possibly room in the future to move into other markets. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/self-driving-truck-startup-kodiak-robotics-raises-125m/">Kodiak Robotics</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/tusimple-aims-to-test-self-driving-trucks-on-public-roads-without-human-safety-operator-by-eoy/">TuSimple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/einride-launches-autonomous-pods-and-electric-freight-operations-in-u-s/">Einride</a> all work to solve the problem of highway driving, whereas companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/motional-and-lyft-to-launch-driverless-commercial-robotaxi-service-in-las-vegas-in-2023/">Motional</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/cruise-lays-out-its-plan-for-how-it-will-make-robotaxis-a-reality/">Cruise</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/walmart-to-launch-autonomous-delivery-service-with-ford-and-argo-ai/">Argo AI</a> focus specifically on passenger cars and smaller delivery vehicles that are trained for urban autonomy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It all comes down to management because the technology behind them is similar,” a former Pony employee told TechCrunch. “From a purely technological point of view, passenger cars and trucks could be worked on together. But when a company reaches such a scale, I think there are considerable obstacles if the two are combined.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you mix the technology, who is responsible for the product at the end of the day?&#8221; said the person who asked not to be named.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pony said both its robotaxi and trucking operations have always included urban and highway use cases and that the company remains equally focused on global robotaxi and trucking, adding that the reorganization has not changed its go-to market in China, at least. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To increase our engineering efficiency &#8212; and recognizing the many overlaps between virtual truck driver and virtual auto driver, in both coding and testing, especially in China &#8212; we optimized our R&amp;D processes,” a Pony spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We have the same approximate headcount working on trucking and auto as before, but the engineering process is now more fluid and integrated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spokesperson went on to say Pony is continuing to invest in its trucking business, “and we have made significant progress on that front, which we hope to announce shortly.”</span></p>
<p>Pony is also still focused on scaling robotaxis into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/chinese-startup-pony-ai-plans-to-launch-a-driverless-robotaxi-service-in-california-in-2022/">commercial service</a> beyond Irvine and into other parts of California. <span style="font-weight: 400;">In May this year, Pony</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/chinese-startup-pony-ai-can-now-test-driverless-vehicles-in-three-california-cities/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">obtained a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to test fully driverless AVs on public roads, and the company says it’s been testing both driverless and drivered AVs on public roads in the state. Meanwhile in China, Pony just got the</span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211015005137/en/Pony.ai-to-Start-Driverless-Tests-on-Public-Roads-in-Beijing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">OK to perform driverless testing on public roads in Beijing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, something it&#8217;s been doing in Guangzhou, as well, as of this year. </span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</p>
<p>Good news, everyone: Mary Ann is back! Yes, after a short absence we have our third Friday host back where she belongs. Namely right in front of a microphone, talking to us.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236788" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And it was good to have her back, as we had a small mountain of news to talk through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-marketplace-opensea-offered-10-billion-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSea could be worth $10 billion</a>:</strong> Right before we recorded, news broke that OpenSea could raise new capital at a far-greater valuation than it did earlier this year. While we had some jokes, we also did a little math on why OpenSea could really be worth so much money.</li>
<li><strong>Other rapid-fire funding rounds:</strong> If OpenSea does raise again, it will join good company in putting together several rounds in under a year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/brazilian-social-commerce-marketplace-facily-quietly-raises-366m-in-less-than-a-year-now-valued-at-850m/">Facily has done the same</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/justt-comes-out-of-stealth-with-70m-in-funding-to-help-online-merchants-fight-false-chargebacks-with-ai/">has Justt</a>. In short, the old 18-month cycle for raising capital is so dated it might as well get delivered by telegram.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/lambda-school-rebrand-bloom-institute-of-technology/">Lambda School rebrands</a>: </strong>Change at Lambda has felt inevitable for a long while. Nearly a year after its last layoff, Lambda School <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">announced more cuts in April</a> amid a broader restructuring. Then, Allred admitted that it’s been difficult to make his company’s vision work.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/caspers-return-to-private-life-isnt-a-canary-for-dtc-companies-going-public/">Casper goes private</a>:</strong> After a tough time as a public concern, DTC mattress company Casper is going private. Notably its issues have not dampened market interest in taking other DTC companies public.</li>
<li><strong>What makes a founder, a founder: </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/avi-dorfmans-legal-battle-to-be-named-founding-member-of-compass-has-ended-in-a-settlement/">Avi Dorfman’s legal battle to be named founding member of Compass has ended in a settlement,</a> bringing up a discussion about founder disputes and why titles matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re entering the holiday period, so expect the usual disruptions to Equity&#8217;s production calendar. We&#8217;ll be taking short breaks as per usual, but will be recharging some ahead of what should prove to be a very, very busy 2022.</p>

The social media giant says the &#8220;Tips&#8221; feature is geared toward users looking to get a little financial support from their followers through Cash App, PayPal, Venmo and Patreon directly through the app. Android users can now get set up to receive tips from their profile by tapping the &#8220;Edit profile&#8221; button and then selecting &#8220;Tips&#8221; to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Tips, we&#8217;re creating an easy way to direct people to links to your payment profiles and we’re making it easier to support the people driving the conversation on Twitter – whether you want to support a content creator, help someone fundraise, tip someone who just needs some help or thank someone for making you laugh,&#8221; the social media giant <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notes</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tips is now on Android!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237124" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You can get set up to receive tips from your profile –– tap the “Edit profile” button then tap “Tips” to start.</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1461463681728983041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter introduced the feature in May after reports had indicated the company was working on a direct payment option. The launch of &#8220;Tips&#8221; on Android comes a month after Twitter rolled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/twitter-is-bringing-ticketed-spaces-to-android-users-in-the-u-s/">&#8220;Ticketed Spaces&#8221; on Android</a>. With this feature, hosts on Spaces, Twitter’s live audio room feature, are able to sell access to Spaces. The social media giant notes that the feature is a way to support creators for their time and effort in hosting and moderating public conversations.</p>
<p>Twitter isn&#8217;t the only social media platform pushing toward monetization and helping creators earn a living through its app. Last month, TikTok confirmed to TechCrunch that it is testing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tiktok-is-testing-a-new-direct-tipping-feature-with-select-creators/">new in-app tipping feature</a> on its platform that would allow creators to accept money from fans outside of TikTok LIVE streams, where gifting is already supported. The company confirmed the feature is part of a limited test for the time being and is not yet widely available.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TikTok and Twitter’s direct tipping features appear to be a way for the companies to compete with other digital platforms like Instagram and YouTube, which offer lucrative ways for creators to make money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most noticeable &#8212; and noted &#8212; effects of climate change has been its impact on how other events in the environment &#8212; be they natural or man-made occurrences &#8212; play out: forest fires burn more violently and for longer; floods happen more often and are more severe when they do; and so on, with climate change often cited as the main culprit for all of the catastrophes. Today, an insurance startup called <a href="https://ourkettle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kettle</a> that believes it has built a better product &#8212; specifically, reinsurance underwriting product to insure insurers &#8212; to account for catastrophic events like these, by way of better data science, is announcing some funding on the heels of (sadly) more need for its services.</p>
<p>It has closed a Series A of $25 million, money that it will be using to build out tools and services for a specific set of catastrophes in one specific market: fires in California. Acrew Capital is leading the round, with Homebrew, True Ventures, Anthemis, Valor, DCVC, and LowerCarbon Capital also participating.</p>
<p>Kettle&#8217;s longer-term plan is to expand to more disaster types, and more states, in the coming years, but for now, fires in California present a particularly acute set of problems.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237097" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Events like the Caldor and Dixie fires have contributed to an overall rise in the rate and size of wildfires in California, Kettle says. 2020 saw over 4% of the state burning. On average there are some 10,000 fires every year in California, but the outsized nature of some of the fires seems to be growing, with 14 fires causing 98% of the damage due to wildfire in the state.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Manning, Kettle&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Andrew Engler, said that these forces have created a gap in the market for insurance: in short, those who might want to insure their homes against these kinds of wildfires are either unable to, or end up having to pay exorbitant premiums.</p>
<p>Manning said that this is primarily because insurance companies &#8212; while ironically being the trailblazers in data science decades ago to determine risk for unexpected events &#8212; have failed to keep up with how to use that technology to account for recent developments like climate change, subsequent catastrophic environmental events, and their impact on the things that typically get insured like property, life, automobiles and so on.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;The industry hasn’t updated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the classic innovator&#8217;s dilemma.&#8221; Typically, insurance companies are using the same modeling that they have always used to try to understand what are new kinds of risks, &#8220;but you can&#8217;t look at the last five years and determine the next ten years anymore.&#8221; Communication, and making it more accurate and reflective of the situation at hand, is something of a fixation for Manning: prior to Kettle, he had been the CEO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/kenyan-startup-ushahidi-launches-a-crowdsourced-campaign-to-monitor-the-u-s-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ushahidi</a>, the crowdsourced information startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kettle mostly presents itself as a reinsurance technology provider to customer-facing insurance companies (it also currently resells insurance that it underwrites via one channel, aimed at the most expensive properties and their owners, starting at anything over $3 million and up to $10 million).</p>
<p>This is a huge business, typified by incumbent behemoths like Lloyd&#8217;s of London, who in theory mitigate the risk insurance companies face when they get the formula wrong. Manning&#8217;s belief is that reinsurance companies also are not using enough data, and accurate enough data science or technology overall, to do their jobs to match today&#8217;s circumstances.</p>
<p>Reinsurance is currently a $400 billion-a-year industry, but it&#8217;s struggling with the cracks just starting to emerge. There has been, Kettle said, a 68% drop in return on equity because catastrophes, and their unintended consequences, have caused more than $1 billion in damage over the past 15 years. This presents an opportunity to provide a different spin on how to provide this service. Kettle&#8217;s approach is to pinpoint specific situations &#8212; in this case wildfires in California &#8212; to provide reinsurance specifically for policies or parts of policies that cover just that.</p>
<p class="p7">Using machine learning in which it combines weather data, satellite imagery and other data sets, Kettle applies a lot what has helped AI stand out from non-AI processes in other fields: the ability for machines to simply make more calculations than any human or even group of humans can.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;Normally, an insurance company will run between 10,000 and 100,000 simulations to predict outcomes,&#8221; Manning said. &#8220;We run over 500 bill This means that it can account better for eventualities to help create pricing that meets them. Kettle claims to have been accurate on its predictions 89% of the time so far. In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-26/wildfire-predicting-startup-kettle-tries-to-help-insurers-with-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August</a>, Kettle said that some 26 insurance carriers have been in contact with it to help model their risk, and Manning told me that the company expects three to four commercial deals to close by the end of this year.</p>
<p>There is often something a little weird feeling about technology that essentially is built around the idea of bad events happening, and potentially profits from those things that go wrong. Insurance often falls into the category, not least because a lot of insurance hasn&#8217;t really been built that well, to fit modern times, and often feels exploitative, or arbitrary, or there by grace of lobbyists making sure it is mandated, more than any actual need for it. (And insurance fraud speaks to the other side of that inefficiency coin.)</p>
<p>Manning accepts this, but also sees it very differently.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;I think the industry itself is very poorly managed,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;The incentives are not in the right direction, and creating a system where the customer and company have different incentive structures is not great.</p>
<p class="p7">&#8220;But I do think it’s important,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;As a homeowner, if my home burns down I’ll get its value back. That can be a truly life changing thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>For investors, the disruptiveness Kettle is bringing is what attracted them, although longer term you have to imagine that the big incumbents can&#8217;t not be considering how to update their data models, too. And that could mean more business for Kettle, or an acquisition, or&#8230; death, which is perhaps fitting for a insuretech. For now, though, there&#8217;s a lot of potential still for this young startup.</p>
<p>“When you take a minute to think about it, it becomes very obvious why traditional reinsurers can&#8217;t accurately underwrite climate risk &#8212; their methodologies  look to the past,” says Lauren Kolodny, Partner at Acrew Capital, in a statement. “And our climate is changing in ways that can’t be predicted on the basis of historical data. Kettle is solving a massive, global problem. And we&#8217;re so thrilled to deepen our partnership with this incredible team.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This year, Amara produced its Yogurt Smoothie Melts, which CEO Jessica Sturzenegger touts as “the only melt-in-mouth snacks for babies and toddlers without any added sugar.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In February, parents received a shock when a <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2021-02-04%20ECP%20Baby%20Food%20Staff%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform showed that some commercial baby foods were found to contain “dangerous levels” of toxic metals.</p>
<p>This caused a flurry of information in the media on the impacts and what parents can do to avoid it, which included checking ingredients. That growing awareness for nutrition also benefited food companies focused on providing more nutritious options for babies and older children.</p>
<p><a href="https://amaraorganicfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amara</a> is the latest startup in this space to raise funding, announcing today that it brought in $12 million Series A funding to expand its product line of nutrient-dense foods created for children up to seven years old. The investment comes 18 months after a $2 million seed round and growth that had the company going from from 100 to 1,000 stores.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236899" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The latest funding round was led by plant-based foods company Eat Well Group in a majority partnership, with current management in place, that values the company at $100 million, founder and CEO Jessica Sturzenegger told TechCrunch. Existing investors from the seed round also participated, including Pharmapacks.</p>
<p>Sturzenegger and her team launched Amara’s first products in Whole Foods in 2017 after three years of working on the technology. The company developed proprietary technology that locks in the taste, texture and nutrients into a shelf-stable pouch of fresh baby food meals. It has 10 SKUs and a baby food line designed to mix with breast milk, formula or water.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Packaged foods found on grocery shelves today often are fruit-based and high in sugar, coming in at a price point of $3 to $7 per meal and which also have to be kept cold or frozen, she added. By contrast, Amara’s meals start as low as $1.80 per meal, in keeping with the company’s mission to provide products that cater to a wider range of family budgets.</p>
<p>This year, Amara expanded on that to produce its Yogurt Smoothie Melts, which Sturzenegger touts as “the only melt-in-mouth snacks for babies and toddlers without any added sugar.”</p>
<p>“Studies show that the food you eat from zero to seven years old impacts how you think, feel and perform later on in life,” Sturzenegger told TechCrunch “‘You are what you eat’ may be a cliché, but studies show it is also true, and parents are paying attention.”</p>
<p>Prior to taking the Series A dollars, Amara was already profitable on every order; in fact, it was growing three times year over year organically and through word of mouth, but after the baby food report came out in February, Sturzenegger said the company garnered increased attention by both parents and venture capital firms.</p>

<p>“Amara has proven an impressive ability to scale through retail distribution and e-commerce excellence, and the funding and industry expertise from Eat Well Group will help accelerate Amara’s growth as we head into 2022,” said Marc Aneed, president of Eat Well Group, in a written statement.</p>
<p>The funding will enable Amara to grow fast to meet the demand as it invests in hiring, product development and brand awareness. In addition to grocery stores, the company sells via its website, Amazon and grocery stores mostly in California, but in Sprouts nationwide. Over the next 12 months, Sturzenegger plans to get Amara’s products into more grocery stores.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the shift to nutrition is providing room for many startups to disrupt the baby and child food market. As such, the <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/baby-food-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global baby food market</a> was valued at $67.3 billion in 2019, and is expected to grow to $96.3 billion by 2027, with <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1218/baby-food-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$6.3 billion of that revenue</a> coming from the U.S. market currently.</p>
<p>Venture capital firms have taken notice, pumping fresh capital into food companies focused on infants and children, like Little Spoon, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/little-spoon-scoops-up-44m-to-grow-its-childrens-nutrition-delivery-service/">$44 million in Series B funding</a> in July, while Serenity Kids, offering low-sugar baby food, took in<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/exclusive-baby-food-brand-serenity-kids-expands-product-line-with-7m-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $7 million in Series A</a> funding in June.</p>
<p>“There is room in the market, and for everyone to target different parents and price points,” Sturzenegger said. “Our niche is good food for everyone. If we are going to change the way the future generation eats, it has to be accessible.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Switzerland-based privacy tech startup, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym Technologies</a>, which is trying to commercialize an old idea for privacy-centric infrastructure (mixnets) by combining it with buzzy crypto incentives, has closed $13 million in Series A investment from Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s crypto-focused fund, following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/nym-gets-6m-for-its-anonymous-overlay-mixnet-to-sell-privacy-as-a-service/">$6M raise we covered back in the summer</a> (also loosely pegged as a Series A).</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2021/11/17/andreessen-horowitz-leads-investment-in-privacy-startup-integrating-with-bitcoin/">Forbes</a>, which had the exclusive on the latest tranche of funding, the round values the nascent European startup at circa $270M.</p>
<p>Other investors are named as including Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, Tayssir Capital, Huobi Ventures, HashKey, Fenbushi Capital, and &#8220;more than two dozen&#8221; operators of validator nodes, or servers responsible for verifying transactions on Nym&#8217;s network.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237098" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Trumpeting the raise earlier this week, founder Harry Halpin <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhalpin/status/1461100059374805003">tweeted</a> that Nym&#8217;s mission is to &#8220;see crypto destroy surveillance economy within the next years&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although the tweet earned him some instant trolling over taking VC investment for a privacy-centric project; and, er, for taking VC investment from a fund whose investment portfolio sprawls deep into the surveillance economy &#8212; including the likes of privacy-eviscerating adtech giant Facebook and Sam Altman&#8217;s (literal) eyeball-scanning crypto dystopia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/sam-altmans-worldcoin-wants-to-scan-every-humans-eyeball-and-give-them-crypto-in-exchange/">Worldcoin</a>, both of which have rather more in common with fuelling surveillance than driving privacy. But, hey, no one goes to VC for those kind of &#8216;values&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We at Nym, who for have been fighting  to end mass surveillance for years without mainstream support, see the tides are turning for privacy. With the support of <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@a16z</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DCGco</a>, and many more, I hope <a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nymproject</a> will see crypto destroy surveillance economy within the next years! <a href="https://t.co/rRNFSYizjb">https://t.co/rRNFSYizjb</a></p>
<p>&mdash; harryhalpin (@harryhalpin) <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhalpin/status/1461100059374805003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>According to Forbes, Nym&#8217;s test network has around 5,000 nodes and 30 validators at this stage &#8212; and is expected to go live at full capacity by the end of this year. Although Halpin told us the test network had around 9,000 nodes when we spoke to him back in July. So quite what full network capacity will mean (in terms of nodes) isn&#8217;t clear.</p>
<p>In a further scoop, Forbes reports that the startup has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/08/25/chelsea-manning-is-back-and-hacking-again-only-this-time-for-a-bitcoin-based-privacy-startup/">hired former U.S. Army intelligence analyst and whistleblower, Chelsea Manning</a>, to work on client side security.</p>
<p>It couches Nym&#8217;s beefed up Series A as a sign of the rising store being placed on privacy infrastructure &#8212; quoting Ali Yahya, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, offering the qualified claim that [emphasis ours]: “Encryption is <em>becoming</em> an incredibly important component of the internet today&#8221;; and describing Nym&#8217;s tech as serving up &#8220;privacy at the very bottom layer as a foundation for other private solutions to be built on top&#8221;.</p>
<p>Quite how Andreessen Horowitz valued (or, well, didn&#8217;t) encryption in earlier Internet decades is certainly one to ponder.</p>
<p>Nym, meanwhile, is using the a16z-led capital injection to expand the size of its team (to up to 30) as it gears up to launch the mainnet &#8212; slated to happen some time in the next few weeks. It is also, per Forbes, planning to award grants to third party developers to encourage them to build for the network, starting next year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Given its product market fit in real estate, Zuma now aims to implement its business model into other industries with sales teams, like healthcare, automotive, insurance, education and fashion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Looking for a new apartment is either a leisurely thing to do or something that has to take place quite quickly. When you don’t reach anyone in the leasing office, you often move on to the next one on the list, even if it was one you would have considered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getzuma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zuma</a> wants to ensure that any reach out for information is answered in minutes versus days. Today, the company, which adds artificial intelligence to sales engagement, exited its beta phase with $6.7 million in seed funding led by Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>The company was co-founded by CEO Shiv Gettu, a former real estate consultant, and president Kendrick Bradley, a former Boeing and SpaceX engineer who left his job in 2018 to work at a property management company. They both saw the pain points for real estate sales teams and together built a tech-driven Airbnb-like hospitality property company that grew to $2 million in revenue in nine months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236704" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When the global pandemic hit, they had long-term lease commitments, but with business and leisure travel halted, they pivoted their company into a virtual leasing office using AI to automate the conversion process, which became Zuma, Gettu said in an interview.</p>
<p>He noted statistics that showed a <a href="https://www.hireaiva.com/blog/real-estate-isa-missing-80-pct-leads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">majority of real estate leads</a> tend to come in at night and on weekends, when leasing agents aren’t usually on property, and that response gap of waiting until the next business day can account for a decrease of <a href="https://www.onecavo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MIT-InsideSales.com_Lead-Response-Management.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 times after half an hour</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236716" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236716" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2236716" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png" alt="Zuma" width="1024" height="562" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png 3458w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=1536,843 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=2048,1124 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-16-at-2.29.17-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236716" class="wp-caption-text">Zuma app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zuma</p></div></p>
<p>Zuma’s AI-powered agent, Kelsey, answers complex questions about a property as they come in, and via text message, to encourage any hot lead to become a booking customer, even outside of normal business hours. It also brings in a human-in-the-loop aspect, if the questions are outside the scope of Kelsey’s ability, to respond.</p>
<p>“We understood the value of leads and the importance of nurturing them,” Bradley told TechCrunch. “Text messages engage with prospects immediately. If you’re interested in an apartment, you might not hear back for 48 hours, but Zuma integrates with property management tools and when a lead inquires, Kelsey gives them information on the property and the policies with the idea of them then coming in to view the property and sign a lease.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since January, the company has grown revenue by 10 times and is working with customers like Bungalow.com, which see an average conversion rate increase of 2.1 times in 30 days and 35 times return on investment, while saving an average of 50% on sales staffing costs.</p>
<p>Joining Andreessen Horowitz in the investment were Y Combinator, Range Ventures, Liquid 2, Day One Ventures, Soma Capital and a group of individual investors, including Apartment List co-founder Chris Erikson, former Y Combinator COO Qasar Younis and Lambda School founder Austen Allred. The latest funding round gives Zuma a total of $7.2 million raised to date.</p>
<p>Gettu says the company has hit a good rhythm with its initial product, so the new capital will go into new features, hiring and expanding sales to capture the market. Zuma is also looking to implement its business model into other industries with sales teams, like healthcare, automotive, insurance, education and fashion.</p>
<p>“Zuma’s blend between human support and AI creates a magical conversation experience for prospective customers that drastically increases conversion,” Connie Chan, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, shared in a statement. “The Zuma team has proven their impact for property management teams, and the sky&#8217;s the limit as this platform grows to serve and help scale any industry that has leads that require nurturing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.flytrex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flytrex</a>, the Israeli startup working with <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/09/09/walmart-now-piloting-on-demand-drone-delivery-with-flytrex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart</a>, Chilli&#8217;s, and others in North Carolina in pilots for a drone-based delivery service targeting suburban consumers, has picked up $40 million in funding to continue developing its hardware and software, and more business partnerships, as it awaits regulatory nods to expand its service to more markets in the U.S.</p>
<p>While others like Amazon are looking at building their own drone services (Amazon&#8217;s service called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=8037720011" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Air</a>), Flytrex claimes that its drone pilot in the North Carolina is the biggest of its kind at the moment. But it&#8217;s just the start of a bigger delivery service and fleet that Flytrex is hoping to build, taking the approach of getting its drones certified by the Federal Aviation Administration as commercial aircraft to give it the most flexibility in how it can design and run its business in the long run.</p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate that we&#8217;ll have national approval by the first half of next year,&#8221; said Yariv Bash, Flytrex&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, in an interview. &#8220;We are in the process with the FAA, which we started more than a year ago.&#8221; The first part of its efforts was taking part in the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/integration_pilot_program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s4">UAS Integration Pilot Program (IPP)</span></a> (UAS: unmanned aircraft system, which includes dronts) which concluded in October 2020; now it&#8217;s continuing that with another initiative, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s4">BEYOND</span></a><span class="s4">,</span> and it is working with the North Carolina Department of Transportation &#8220;to help tackle the remaining challenges of UAS integration.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237087" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Currently Flytrex approved to fly in North Carolina for a distance of 1 nautical mile (just over 1 land mile), he said, but the aircraft that the company has designed have a range of three miles in each direction currently, so that will be part of what it hopes to offer in future.</p>
<p>This is a Series C that brings the total raised by Flytrex to $60 million. <span class="s4">BRM Group</span> is leading the round, with participation also from <span class="s4">OurCrowd (the SoftBank-backed, Israel-based crowdfunded investor); </span>Lukasz Gadowski; and previous investors <a href="https://benhamouglobalventures.com/"><span class="s4">Benhamou Global Ventures (BGV)</span></a>, <a href="https://btov.vc/"><span class="s4">btov</span></a>, and <a href="https://www.backboneventures.ch/"><span class="s4">BackBone Ventures</span></a>. In a list mostly filled with financial backers, there is one interesting strategic name: Gadowski is the founder and chairman of Delivery Hero, a big player in online food delivery around the world using land-based transportation.</p>
<p>Delivery Hero is not working with Flytrex now, but Bash said that more generally the startup believes that existing on-demand delivery platforms like DoorDash, Delivery Hero and the rest could be potential partners and customers: in cases where established delivery brands want to complement their own fleets with an air-based mode, they might integrate with Flytrex rather than trying to build it themselves.</p>
<h2>&#8216;We are producing commercial airplanes, not drones&#8217;</h2>
<p>Flytrex was founded and is finding traction with early customers and investors on the back of a fairly simple premise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On-demand delivery services using bikes and four-wheeled vehicles are just about starting to work out the positive unit economics of providing services in dense, urban areas: the key is to double or triple up orders, or make them short enough loops that drivers can fit in many in the space of a day of work.</p>
<p>That formula doesn&#8217;t quite fly, so to speak, when we are talking about people in more spread-out residential areas, such as suburbs &#8212; especially when the cargo, in Bash&#8217;s words, &#8220;is just a $5 burrito.&#8221; It costs too much to send people out, both to restaurants and to customers, which each pay fees to keep the cost of that burrito from looking too ridiculous, and couriers also end up carrying costs that eat into their own margins. &#8220;It’s a lose-lose-lose situation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Flytrex believes that in these cases, a drone-based system, which zips around and is managed remotely and deposits whatever the cargo happens to be into a customer&#8217;s backyard, is the solution.</p>
<p>The opportunity is a huge one in a market like the U.S., where some two-thirds of the population lives in suburban areas. &#8220;The major cities&#8221; &#8212; where so much of on-demand delivery has focused up to now &#8212; &#8220;are basically niche,&#8221; Bash said.</p>
<p>Flytrex is taking a very vertical &#8212; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no pun intended</a> &#8212; approach in its business model, starting first with the hardware and how the service is designed.</p>
<p>Drawing on the breadth of experience you get in Israel in building hardware, computer vision and other AI technology, and cloud services, the startup has designed its own drones and software that is used to control them.</p>
<p>Given the FAA process that it&#8217;s going through to get that hardware certified as aircraft &#8212; &#8220;I am standing in line with Lockheed, Boeing, and Amazon. Everyone has to stand in line,&#8221; Bash told me &#8212; strictly speaking, he doesn&#8217;t refer to his aircraft with the D-word.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We are producing commercial airplane, not drones,&#8221; he said, a process that has added, he estimates, three to five years to its timeline for getting approval. There are many, many companies making drones today, so much so that you could argue it has become commoditized. Bash doesn&#8217;t completely rule out the idea of using hardware made by others one day, but notes that this lengthy timeline, and the software that it has built around its hardware, will make this unlikely anytime soon.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the future if I can get a more affordable airplane than producing my own, we are more than happy to do that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Around the &#8220;drone&#8221; &#8212; or whatever you might call it &#8212; is a bigger tech stack and database that Flytrex is building. It&#8217;s mapped out backyards in the communities it serves, so that it knows where to fly and drop off packages so that they are relatively safe for drop-and-go deliveries so that people can walk out of the back of their houses to pick them up. Bash said that Flytrex has amassed data on more than 80 million backyards. Google Maps and the others that power the mapping services for the various delivery companies in the market today might have figured out all the front doors, &#8220;but we&#8217;ll have the back doors.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p9">Added to this is a wider fleet system design that sits in the cloud to manage where and when drones are operating. The idea is that Flytrex doesn&#8217;t operate these directly all the time, but works with its equivalent of &#8220;couriers&#8221; to do so: these can be the same people who today delivery packages via bikes or cars, and they will be trained to become &#8220;flight operators&#8221; who will work via third-party companies to operate the drones. (As an equivalent, this would not be unlike how some on-demand transport platforms contract with individuals, but also local fleets that use the platform to pick up business.)</p>
<p class="p9">The early version of the service so far seems to have found willing customers on both sides of the marketplace. Flytrex&#8217;s first-ever service was launched in <span class="s5">Reykjavik</span>, Iceland in 2017, but the first U.S. pilot started only about a year ago, in September 2020 in Fayetteville, NC. It has since expanded to a second location, Raeford, NC. Flytrex said that since February 2021, the volume of orders has increased more than tenfold, with thousands of deliveries to date.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s all smooth sailing, though. Flytrex&#8217;s service has been years in the making already, and Bash admits nothing is easy. Even others like Amazon have seen ups and downs: the company also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/31/amazon-prime-now-drone-delivery-fleet-gets-faa-approval.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed a key FAA hurdle</a> recently, too, but in recent weeks has seen the <a href="https://insideunmannedsystems.com/amazon-prime-air-co-founder-gur-kimchi-joins-near-earth-autonomy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">co-founder of Prime Air leave the company</a>, and moreover it seems to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/amazon-s-prime-air-drone-unit-quietly-disbanded-french-r-d-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mothballing some of its R&amp;D efforts</a> for the project.</p>
<p class="p5">And beyond these specific businesses, there is a strong degree of skepticism around anything involving autonomous transportation of any kind.</p>
<p class="p5">But while some indeed may see drone delivery services as still something of a moonshot &#8212; ironic considering Bash&#8217;s previous entrepreneurial effort as the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yarivbash/?originalSubdomain=il" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founder of SpaceIL</a> &#8212; but there are enough shortcomings with existing delivery services, and enough advances in autonomous systems, that might well merit at least some bets being taken here for strong rewards ahead, as far as investors are concerned.</p>
<p class="p5">And if big companies like Amazon will be doing something in the space &#8212; either for itself or just as likely as a service for third parties &#8212; it&#8217;s definitely important for there to be alternatives and choice in the market for those that opt not to go the Amazon route.</p>
<p class="p4">“We are committed to supporting companies that have the potential to change people’s lives for the better, and Flytrex’s impact on retailers and consumers alike fits that mission perfectly,” said Eran Barkat, Partner at BRM Group, in a statement. “Drones are playing a key role in revolutionizing last mile delivery for communities around the world, and we are thrilled to support the Flytrex team as they take the future of food and household delivery to new heights.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Helaina is tapping into a precision fermentation process that programs yeast cells and teaches them to become manufacturing hubs to develop almost identical proteins found in human milk.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.myhelaina.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helaina</a>, a company producing a first-of-its-kind infant milk, announced $20 million in Series A financing to usher in its next phase of growth that includes beginning the manufacturing and commercialization process for its first product.</p>
<p>Food scientist Laura Katz, who also teaches food science at New York University, founded the company in 2019, and touts it as “the first company making functional human proteins for food.”</p>
<p>To do this, Helaina is tapping into a precision fermentation process that programs yeast cells and teaches them to become manufacturing hubs to develop almost identical proteins found in human milk.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236953" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“When we started Helaina, there was a lot of technology going into a lot of industries, but feeding babies had not advanced too much,” Katz told TechCrunch. “For me, when I thought about where in the population to advance nutrition and health, infants and parents were the first thing that came to me.”</p>
<p>As the infant formula market, poised to be a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/infant-formula-market-size-to-reach-usd-103-75-billion-by-2026--fortune-business-insights-300929520.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$103 billion market by 2026</a>, grows, there continues to be shame and stigma around how to feed children in their early years, and Helaina aims to provide parents with a choice of foods that are priced to be accessible to all, but also support as they examine their choices, she said.</p>
<p>Helaina created its first protein and now wants to create all of breast milk’s components, though one at a time. Not only will its product provide calories, but also it will help to build immunity against fungal, bacterial and viral diseases.</p>
<p>The company’s latest round was co-led by Spark Capital and Siam Capital, and includes Plum Alley Investments and Primary Venture Partners. It gives the company $24.6 million in total funding, which includes a $4.6 million combined round of pre-seed and seed investments from 2019 and 2020, respectively, Katz said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was a planned round, but what Katz noted was unexpected was the “overwhelming interest” in the company from investors.</p>
<p>“What we found in raising money is such a personal connection to what we are doing,” she added. “So much is happening in food tech, but seeing the ability to use this tech for a product so close to people’s heart has been overwhelming. Lots of people are interested in what we are doing.”</p>
<p>The Series A will enable the company to scale with manufacturing partners to prepare for commercialization. The goal is to grow capability, round out the executive team and finalize go-to-market plans.</p>
<p>The company is working to gain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its product and then has plans to use its proteins in a host of consumer products that will be clinically proven, essentially creating a new category within the consumer sector that broadens the definition of nutrition to include immunity, Katz said.</p>
<p>Helaina is not alone in working to create a formula that is more nutritious and best resembles human milk. Earlier this year, Bobbie raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/bobbie-bags-15m-series-a-to-create-a-better-baby-formula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$15 million in Series A funding</a> for its formula modeled after European brands. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90639417/can-this-startup-engineer-a-better-baby-formula" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ByHeart</a> is also developing a formula, while <a href="https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/biomilq-says-it-has-successfully-produced-worlds-first-cell-cultured-human-breast-milk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biomilq</a> says it has produced the “world’s first cell-cultured human milk outside of the breast.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Willow, the startup making the wearable breast pump, raises $55 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/willow-the-startup-making-the-wearable-breast-pump-raises-55-million/embed/#?secret=HkJUdbAL23" data-secret="HkJUdbAL23" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Katz says the approach her company is taking to create the proteins and focus on making a product that is better in terms of health outcomes is what differentiates Helaina from its competitors.</p>
<p>“Helaina is the first company to bring human proteins to food,” she added. “No one else has done this before. As we expand technology to parents to feed growing children, we are creating this new category that is like consumer immunology.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company is one of the first investments that Sita Chantramonklasri made from her new fund, Siam Capital, which she said invests in businesses that are at the intersection of sustainability and consumer need.</p>
<p>Chantramonklasri spends a lot of her time in the food tech space and heard about Helaina long before she was connected with Katz by Kevin Thau, who led the seed round for Spark Capital, she said.</p>
<p>At the time, she was doing a deep dive into the breast milk space and was looking at some of the novel technology in the space from some of Helaina’s competitors. She spent a lot of time with Katz to understand her background and what Helaina was doing in the space. After spending time in the laboratory and seeing the company’s yeast engineering experience, Chantramonklasri said she felt that Helaina was providing a science-forward product.</p>
<p>“Laura is a fantastic founder and wise beyond her years [she’s 29 years old!] and wants to see the mission of Helaina through,” she added. “The market will get more competitive and timing is the play as is customer loyalty. Helaina is in a position to be an advocate for mothers and families. From a technology standpoint, it is too early to tell what will happen. We see innovation in other cell culture technologies like the Biomilq, but Helaina will be a leader in the space from a progress standpoint.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart-backed Flipkart is acquiring online pharmacy startup SastaSundar to enter the healthcare segment in India as e-commerce battle intensifies in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Flipkart said it has signed definitive agreements to acquire a majority stake in <a href="https://www.sastasundar.com">SastaSundar</a>, but did not disclose the size of the deal. Eight-year-old SastaSundar was last valued at $125 million in a financing round in 2019. The Kolkata-headquartered startup, which works with over 490 pharmacies, raised $48.2 million across several financial rounds prior to the current deal, according to research firm Tracxn.</p>
<p>India’s top e-commerce platform, which is valued is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/flipkart-valued-at-37-6-billion-in-new-3-6-billion-fundraise/">valued at over $37 billion</a>, said its healthcare vertical will be called Flipkart Health+. Flipkart&#8217;s planned foray into the healthcare space comes at a time when the market is seeing both consolidation and aggressive investments.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237074" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Amazon India, Flipkart&#8217;s chief rival in India, began selling medicines on its marketplace last year. Reliance Retail, the largest retail chain in India, acquired the parent firm of online pharmacy Netmeds last year. Its conglomerate rival, Tata Digital bought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/tata-digital-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-online-pharmacy-1mg/">online pharmacy 1mg in June</a></p>
<p>PharmEasy, the market leading healthcare startup, filed for an $843 million initial public offering earlier this month.</p>
<p>E-pharmacies today accounts for less than 5% of the pharma market and its &#8220;scope for growth is very high with increasing awareness, digital penetration and increasing comfort with online transaction in other categories,&#8221; analysts at Bernstein said in a report earlier this year. &#8220;Even with low levels of penetration, there has been significant levels of consolidation with players exiting and M&amp;A activity,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>Ravi Kant Sharma, founder and chief executive of SastaSundar said the startup&#8217;s majority stake acquisition to Flipkart will accelerate the younger firm&#8217;s mission to &#8220;provide affordable healthcare to all Indians in a convenient manner.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The consumer internet ecosystem in India is growing rapidly as consumers recognize the opportunities and convenience that digital adoption is enabling in their lives. With growing awareness and focus on health heightened by the pandemic, there is a large opportunity and demand for affordable healthcare and ancillary offerings,” said Ravi Iyer, Senior Vice President and Head of Corporate Development at Flipkart, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We are excited to enter this space through this investment in SastaSundar.com, a company that has established itself as a trusted partner for lakhs of consumers through genuine products, a technology-powered platform and a wide network. The synergies between the Flipkart Group and SatsaSundar.com, combined with our commitment to prioritize our customer’s needs, will help us grow and transform online healthcare in India.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like Nio, Chinese electric car maker Xpeng has kickstarted its international expansion. But unlike its rival, which put on a series of splashy campaigns in Norway, Xpeng launched quietly in the Scandinavian country last month.</p>
<p>In Norway, Xpeng has begun shipping its G3 SUVs and P7 sedans. The Chinese EV startup aims to enter more European markets in 2022, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Xpeng has stayed low-key with its overseas expansion probably because it was waiting to launch its first &#8220;international&#8221; model, the G9 SUV that came to light today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236299" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;G9 is our first model to be conceived and developed from the ground up for both the international and Chinese markets, bringing our most sophisticated designs to our customers worldwide,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s co-founder and president Henry Xia said at an auto exhibition on Friday.</p>
<p>The SUV is Xpeng&#8217;s fourth production model and will be the first to possess the carmaker&#8217;s latest advanced driver assistance system. The ADAS, called Xpilot 4.0, is built for urban driving, as Xpeng <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/top-highlights-from-xpengs-2021-tech-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> at its Tech Day last month. Baking Xpilot 4.0 into a passenger car is ambitious, as the version aims to assist anything from &#8220;vehicle start-up to parking,&#8221; a big step closer to fully autonomous driving.</p>
<p>Xpilot 4.0&#8217;s computing power comes from two Nvidia Orin-X system-on-the-chip units. Its hardware includes a mix of cameras, lidar, millimeter-wave radar, and a 3D visual perception network.</p>
<p>In other words, G9 will be layered with sensors. But Xpeng tries to make them inconspicuous. Its dual-lidar units, for example, have been integrated into the headlights. Lidar had traditionally been too expensive for mass-produced cars, but Xpeng and other industry players are working to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">make the sensing tech affordable</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>G9 is not launching in China until the third quarter of 2022, according to a person familiar with the matter, so European customers won&#8217;t likely get to try the SUV until 2023.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Xpeng has much work to do before its highly autonomous passenger cars are ready to ship internationally. It will need to set up charging networks in its target markets, a process that is prone to COVID disruptions. Xpilot also relies on high-definition mapping, so the Chinese firm will probably need to team up with local navigation providers.</p>
<p>Xpeng may also be questioned by local governments regarding the safety of its smart cars. Governments around the world vary in their attitude toward vehicle autonomy, and episodes of collisions involving Tesla&#8217;s ADAS have only increased their skepticism about the tech&#8217;s readiness.</p>
<p>Xpeng has done some preparation in this regard. For instance, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/top-highlights-from-xpengs-2021-tech-day/">will be testing drivers</a> and giving them a safety score before letting them activate Xpilot. Its vehicles&#8217; built-in monitoring system will also keep vetting drivers and may revoke Xpilot access if it determines a driver is acting irresponsibly.</p>
<h2><strong>Other specs</strong></h2>
<p>The G9 is compatible with Xpeng&#8217;s &#8220;superchargers&#8221;, 800V high-voltage mass-production SiC (silicon carbide) that&#8217;s able to charge a car for up to 200 km of range within five minutes.</p>
<p>The SUV comes with a &#8220;fault detection&#8221; system that can identify the fault location after a breakdown. The system will then display the service center with available inventory as well as estimated repair time and cost.</p>
<p>Lastly, the G9 uses the Gigabit Ethernet communications architecture, which &#8220;improves communications and support&#8221; for higher-level autonomous driving, smart cockpits, and OTA upgrades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook announced Thursday that it&#8217;s running a test to give users a sliver more control over what they see on the platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237048" style="width: 252px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237048" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2237048 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-6.01.38-PM-e1637287394305.png?w=242" alt="Facebook test feature" width="242" height="335" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-6.01.38-PM-e1637287394305.png 242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-6.01.38-PM-e1637287394305.png?resize=108,150 108w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-6.01.38-PM-e1637287394305.png?resize=217,300 217w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-18-at-6.01.38-PM-e1637287394305.png?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237048" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>The test will go live on Facebook&#8217;s app for English-speaking users. It adds three sub-menus into Facebook&#8217;s menu for managing what shows up in the News Feed: friends and family, groups and pages and public figures. Users in the test can choose to keep the ratio of those posts in their feed at &#8220;normal&#8221; or change it to more or less, depending on their preferences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237031" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Anyone in the test can do the same for topics, designating things they are interested in or stuff they&#8217;d rather not see. In a blog post, Facebook says the test will affect &#8220;a small percentage of people&#8221; around the world before the test expands gradually in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Facebook will also be expanding a tool that allows advertisers to exclude their content from certain topic domains, letting brands opt out of appearing next to &#8220;news and politics,&#8221; &#8220;social issues&#8221; and &#8220;crime and tragedy. &#8220;When an advertiser selects one or more topics, their ad will not be delivered to people recently engaging with those topics in their News Feed,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s algorithms are notorious for promoting inflammatory content and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/03/facebook-misinformation-nyu-study/">dangerous misinformation</a>. Given that, Facebook— and its newly-named parent company Meta — are under mounting regulatory pressure to clean up the platform and make its practices more transparent. As Congress mulls solutions that could give users more control over what they see and tear down some of the opacity around algorithmic content, Facebook is likely holding out hope that there&#8217;s still time left to self-regulate.</p>
<p>Last month before Congress, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen called attention to the ways that Facebook&#8217;s opaque algorithms can prove dangerous, particularly in countries beyond the company&#8217;s most scrutinized markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even within the U.S. and Europe, the company&#8217;s decision to prioritize engagement in its News Feed ranking systems enabled divisive content and politically inflammatory posts to soar.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the consequences of how Facebook is picking out that content today is that it’s optimizing for content that gets engagement, or reaction,&#8221; Haugen said on &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; last month. &#8220;But its own research is showing that content that is hateful, that is divisive, that is polarizing — it’s easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions.&#8221;</p>
