										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days, investing goes way beyond the stock market. And in recent years there’s been a growing number of startups which aim to give more people access to a wider array of investment opportunities. Today, one of those startups has raised a significant round of funding to help it achieve its goals.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://yieldstreet.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yieldstreet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which provides a platform for making alternative investments in areas like real estate, marine/shipping, legal finance, commercial loans and other opportunities that were previously only open to institutional investors — announced Tuesday that it has raised $100 million in a Series C funding round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former E*TRADE CEO Mitch Caplan, of Tarsadia Investments, led the round. Other participants include Alex Brown (a division of Raymond James), Kingfisher Capital, Top Tier Capital Partners and Gaingels. Existing backers Edison Partners, Soros Fund Management, Greenspring Associates, Raine Ventures, Greycroft and Expansion Capital also put money in the round, which brings Yieldstreet’s total raised to $278.5 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milind Mehere and Michael Weisz co-founded Yieldstreet with the mission of making investing more inclusive for non-institutional investors. In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO Mehere declined to say at what valuation the Series C was raised other than to say &#8220;near unicorn.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What he did share is that Yieldstreet has funded nearly $1.9 billion on its platform and has about 300,000 consumers signed up on its platform. That’s up from $600 million invested on its platform from more than 100,000 members in February 2019, at the time of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/yieldstreet-raises-62m-to-democratise-alternative-investments-in-shipping-real-estate-and-more/">last raise</a>. Also since that time, Yieldstreet has seen its investor base climb by 350%, he said. And this year, the company is expecting “over 50% revenue growth,&#8221; compared to 2020.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159765" style="width: 212px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159765" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2159765" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?w=148" alt="" width="202" height="409" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg 815w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=768,1557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=335,680 335w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=758,1536 758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/iPhone-12-_-12-Pro.jpg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159765" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yieldstreet</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, Yieldstreet says it has provided nearly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than $950 million in principal and interest payments to its investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, both the number of investment requests and new investors surged by more than 250% from January to April 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, with new investors already exceeding all of last year, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehere also shared that Yieldstreet is considering going public via a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/">SPAC</a> (special purpose acquisition vehicle) sometime in the next year or two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are growing extremely fast and a few SPACs have approached us,” he told TechCrunch. “We are on a great path to potentially explore some of those options in the next 12 to 24 months. I think the public markets would be great for a company like Yieldstreet, purely because that gives you the visibility to expand your consumer growth but also gives you access to equity to pursue growth strategies such as potential acquisitions and other things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Yieldstreet has acquired two companies (both in 2019): WealthFlex and Athena Art Finance. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some context</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a very high level, Yieldstreet aims to give consumers access to invest in asset classes outside of the stock market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are investments that generate passive income. For example, we do a bunch of things in real estate such as financing warehouses, multifamily and distribution centers,” Mehere told TechCrunch. “We also do art, auto loans or equipment finance. These are typically investments done by institutions and what we’re trying to do is really fractionalize them and get them to real estate investors. A lot of this stuff is asset-backed and it’s generating cash flow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to help people understand just exactly what they’re putting their money into, Yieldstreet aims to provide “a ton of investor education,” Mehere added, in the form of content such as articles, blog posts and infographics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also aims to have its portfolios working “around the clock” to automatically apply earned income toward everyday expenses &#8212; a concept conceived by Mahere as “self-driving money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yieldstreet will use its new capital to expand its user base, develop new investment products, explore international expansion and pursue strategic acquisitions, according to Mehere. Outside of its New York City headquarters, Yieldstreet also has offices in Brazil, Greece and Malta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alternative investing has generally been restricted to very high net worth individuals. This is not just a U.S. problem, but a worldwide one. In Europe, especially, it is exacerbated by a negative interest rate,” he said. “So it’s even more compelling to them to tap into U.S. assets.” As such, Yieldstreet plans to expand into Europe and Asia as part of its growth strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarsadia Investments (and former E*TRADE CEO) President Caplan believes the company is “uniquely positioned” to “achieve significant growth in revenue while ultimately achieving tremendous scale.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything begins and ends with the management team,” he told TechCrunch. “Yieldstreet&#8217;s management team&#8217;s vision for the future of digital investing aligned perfectly with that of our organization at Tarsadia. Yieldstreet is building the future of investing.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Locus, a startup that uses AI to help businesses map out their logistics, said on Wednesday it has raised $50 million in a new financing round as it looks to expand its presence.</p>
<p>The new round, a Series C, was led by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC. Qualcomm Ventures and existing investors Tiger Global Management and Falcon Edge also participated in the round, which brings the startup’s to-date raise to $79 million. The new round valued the startup, which was founded in India, at about $300 million, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Angel investors Amrish Rau (CEO of Pine Labs), Kunal Shah (CEO of CRED), Raju Reddy (founder of Sierra Atlantic), and Deb Deep Sengupta (former President and MD of SAP in South Asia) also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Locus helps its clients <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/indias-locus-raises-22-million-to-expand-its-logistics-management-business/">automate their logistics workload</a> &#8212; tasks such as planning, organizing, transporting and tracking of inventories, and finding the best path to reach a destination &#8212; that have traditionally required intensive human labor, said Nishith Rastogi, CEO of Locus, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“When you order from Licious or BigBasket, for instance, they need to decide each day at their centres how many vehicles they need to use, and what size of vehicles they need to go with,” Rastogi explained. These clients, he said, also need to assign drivers based on how familiar they are with the delivery area, and factor in the traffic to determine at what time they should leave for delivery.</p>
<p>“We help our clients move beyond visibility into all of these decision makings,” he said, adding that the startup uses proprietary algorithms and deep machine learning.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; which operates in North America, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent &#8212; says it has helped its customers save over $150 million in logistics costs, and shaved off tens of millions of kilometres from their journey that they would have travelled otherwise.</p>
<p>Rastogi said the vast majority of the startup&#8217;s revenue today comes from international markets, especially North America. The startup said its platform is especially popular among FMCG, retail, and e-commerce firms as well as those who need distribution partners.</p>
<p>Locus enters into categories where the cost of logistics is a big portion of cost of goods sold and where the profit margin is thin, he said. &#8220;At many distribution or e-commerce companies, the cost of logistics can be 40% of the good sold. This gives our clients a huge incentive to make some changes,&#8221; he said, adding that brands across the globe are increasingly beginning to explore ways to optimize their supply chain networks.</p>
<p>“Locus’ smart product suite is optimizing supply chain efficiencies by using machine learning to deliver real-time tracking and insights for the last mile fulfillment,” said Varsha Tagare, Sr. Director at Qualcomm Technologies and Managing Director at Qualcomm Ventures, in a statement. “We’re excited to invest in Locus to enable logistics as a service and support their journey to become a global last-mile automation leader.”</p>
<p>Rastogi termed the new funding as &#8220;insurance money&#8221; as he said the startup already generates enough cash, but said the additional capital would help the startup as it looks to<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> expand in additional markets and also broaden its technology team.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab has already <a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/about-us/updates/the-federal-aviation-administration-approves-rocket-lab-to-resume-launches/">received approval</a> from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to resume its launch activities, following a failure during the second stage burn of its 20th Electron rocket mission that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/rocket-labs-20th-electron-launch-ends-in-failure-with-the-loss-of-its-payload/">resulted in the loss of the payload</a>. That&#8217;s a testament to Rocket Lab&#8217;s safety systems design, and everything working as intended when it encountered an anomaly, meaning that while the mission failed, it did so safely and without any risk to ground crew, the general population or other orbital objects.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean Rocket Lab will actually resume launches immediately; while the FAA has determined that its existing launch license is still in good standing after the incident, the company itself will continue its investigation into the cause of the problem. Rocket Lab CEO and founder Peter Beck called the ongoing effort to determine the cause of the second stage engine shutdown &#8220;an intricate and layered fault analysis,&#8221; but also noted that they have already replicated the error in testing.</p>
<p>Now, the focus will be on working out exactly the sequence of events and figuring out what exactly caused what that led to the automatic safety shut-off. That process is expected to be done sometime &#8220;in the coming weeks,&#8221; and then at that point the company will proceed with resuming active flight activities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rocket Lab didn&#8217;t reference an earlier mission failure from last July in this update. It ultimately concluded that anomaly was the result of a bad electrical connection, but which had similar results with a second stage engine safety shutdown.</p>
<p>The company did note that the information collected from the first stage of the Electron rocket that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/rocket-lab-recovered-the-first-stage-from-its-failed-may-15-launch-a-silver-lining-for-its-reusability-program/">recovered after the launch</a> indicates that everything went as planned with that part of the mission. Rocket Lab is in the process of adding reusability to its Electron first stage booster, and had implemented a new atmospheric re-entry and splashdown process test in this one, which went smoothly. The company added that the new heat shield it used for this flight worked as intended, and that it now plans to do hot fire testing on the engines from the recovered first stage to see how they perform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Very big news today coming out of Europe in the world of e-commerce. <a href="https://www.etsy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etsy</a>, the New York-based marketplace where crafty creators and those interested in their styles can discover and buy those goods, today announced that it is acquiring <a href="https://depop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Depop</a>, a London-based marketplace targeting millennial and Gen-Z consumers with a new take on social shopping. Etsy is paying $1.625 billion for the company, in what <a href="https://investors.etsy.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Etsy-to-acquire-global-fashion-resale-marketplace-Depop/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etsy is describing as a mostly-cash deal</a>.</p>
<p>This is not just Etsy&#8217;s biggest acquisition to date by some margin &#8212; it&#8217;s made <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/etsy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven other deals</a> but all for well under $1 billion &#8212; but a huge acquisition for e-commerce in Europe, and also a massive endorsement of companies that are building business models, namely commerce models, specifically targeting younger and/or more creative users.</p>
<p>Some 90% of Depop&#8217;s users are under the age of 26, and this will give Etsy a sizeable opportunity both to tap them and their community in Depop itself, but likely will also act as a bridge to bringing more content and younger shoppers to Etsy, which may have started skewing younger but has also a huge number of older users now, too. Etsy is publicly traded and has a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETSY?p=ETSY&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap of over $20 billion currently</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Depop last raised money, it seems, in 2019 (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/depop-a-social-app-targeting-millennial-and-gen-z-shoppers-bags-62m-passes-13m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$62 million round</a>) and was on a roll at the time, with 13 million users and growing very fast in the U.S. Today, some two years later, its user numbers have grown to over 21 million stylists, designers, artists, collectors, vintage sellers and more, with an especially strong audience in the U.S. (Etsy&#8217;s biggest market) and its home market of the UK (which is also strong for Etsy).</p>
<p>This is a volume game for Etsy, but not necessarily an initially profitable one: Depop in 2020 saw gross merchandise sales of $650 million but revenues of only $70 million, both up 100% on the year before.</p>
<p>Depop&#8217;s ethos is a promising one, however, in terms of how Etsy might see itself growing, particularly as a kind of anti-Amazon in the world of clothes, home goods, and consumer goods shopping. Depop also fits squarely into a lot of the tastes of the moment. 2020 was a year that saw not just a huge surge of e-commerce, but also the flourishing of a lot of smaller businesses and cottage industries as a swathe of people opted to shop locally and support individuals, and to buy more used goods &#8212; areas where Depop plays very strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are simply thrilled to be adding Depop—what we believe to be <i>the</i> resale home for Gen Z consumers—to the Etsy family. Depop is a vibrant, two-sided marketplace with a passionate community, a highly-differentiated offering of unique items, and we believe significant potential to further scale,&#8221; Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. CEO, said in a statement. &#8220;Depop&#8217;s world-class management team and employees have done a fantastic job nurturing this community and driving organic, authentic growth in a way that aligns well with Etsy&#8217;s DNA and mission of Keeping Commerce Human. We see significant opportunities for shared expertise and growth synergies across what will now be a tremendous &#8216;house of brands&#8217; portfolio of individually distinct, and very special, e-commerce brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silverman&#8217;s track record includes a number of years at eBay leading Shopping.com, something also worth considering when thinking about how sees the growth of Etsy over time.</p>
<p>Depop&#8217;s CEO Maria Raga added: &#8220;We&#8217;re on an incredible journey building Depop into a place where the next generation comes to explore unique fashion and be part of a community that&#8217;s changing the way we shop. Our community is made up of people who are creating a new fashion system by establishing new trends and making new from old. They come to Depop for the clothes, but stay for the culture. We&#8217;ll now take an exciting leap forward as part of the Etsy family, benefiting from Josh&#8217;s and his team&#8217;s expertise, and the resources of a much larger company whose values are so aligned with ours here at Depop.&#8221;</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close in Q3 2021, pending regulatory approval in the U.S. and UK and other closing conditions, and Etsy said that after the deal closes, it will operate Depop as a separate brand alongside Etsy and Reverb, a marketplace for musical instruments that it acquired in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2746">announced</a> a partnership with Bill Gates&#8217; sustainable energy funding vehicle with the goal of unlocking new investments for clean tech and sustainable energy projects totalling up to $1BN (€820M) over five years (2022-2026).</p>
<p>EU-based projects the partnership will focus on initially fall into four sectors which are being prioritized for their potential to deliver substantial reductions in regional emissions &#8212; namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green hydrogen;</li>
<li>Sustainable aviation fuels;</li>
<li>Direct air capture;</li>
<li>Long-duration energy storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to scale technologies which are currently too expensive to compete with fossil fuel-based incumbent technologies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pair said they will continue to work on setting up the program over the coming months, with an eye on having something further to announce at the COP-26 conference in November.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time the Commission and Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy organization have worked together on funding sustainable investment. But the scale of this latest partnership dwarfs the €100M fund the EU established back in 2019 with its venture investment funding arm.</p>
<p>Now the Commission has partnered with Breakthrough Energy Catalyst &#8212; a financing program within Gates&#8217; organization that aims to accelerate the development and adoption of technologies needed to underpin a low-carbon economy &#8212; to mobilize up to 10x more than the earlier fund to build large-scale, commercial demonstration projects for clean technologies.</p>
<p>The overarching goal is of course to lower the costs and accelerate deployment of clean tech in order to deliver significant reductions in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The bloc is a major emitter of CO<sub>2 </sub>but has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/tech-driven-change-a-key-priority-for-new-ec-president/">European Green Deal</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">With the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUGreenDeal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EUGreenDeal</a>, Europe can become the continent of climate innovation. </p>
<p>Glad to invest with <a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BillGates</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Breakthrough?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Breakthrough</a> Energy in next generation climate technologies. </p>
<p>So the EU industry can reap the benefits of the green transition and create the jobs of tomorrow. <a href="https://t.co/qRUITpzl8H">pic.twitter.com/qRUITpzl8H</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) <a href="https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1399977232009936898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Gates&#8217; philosophy with his 2015-founded Breakthrough Energy vehicle, meanwhile, is that renewables alone won&#8217;t be enough to avert catastrophic climate change &#8212; and investments in a range of high risk but potentially high reward technologies is also needed.</p>
<p>But given the lengthy time-scales needed for a return on these types of investments public-private partnerships look like a key piece of the financing puzzle.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership announcement in a statement, EU president Ursula von der Leyen, said: “With our European Green Deal, Europe wants to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. And Europe has also the great opportunity to become the continent of climate innovation. For this, the European Commission will mobilise massive investments in new and transforming industries over the next decade. This is why I&#8217;m glad to join forces with Breakthrough Energy. Our partnership will support EU businesses and innovators to reap the benefits of emission-reducing technologies and create the jobs of tomorrow.”</p>
<p>In another supporting statement, Gates, founder of Breakthrough Energy, added:<strong> </strong>“Decarbonising the global economy is the greatest opportunity for innovation the world has ever seen. Europe will play a critical role, having demonstrated an early and consistent commitment to climate and longstanding leadership in science, engineering, and technology. Through this partnership, Europe will lay solid ground for a net-zero future in which clean technologies are reliable, available, and affordable for all.”</p>
<p>On the EU side, funding for the partnership is expected to come from the bloc&#8217;s flagship R&amp;D fund, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en">Horizon Europe</a>, and also via the low-carbon-focused <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/innovation-fund_en">Innovation Fund</a> within the framework of the <a href="https://europa.eu/investeu/home_en">InvestEU</a> program.</p>
<p>Breakthrough Energy Catalyst will mobilise equivalent private capital and philanthropic funds to finance selected projects.</p>
<p>The partnership will also be open to national investments by EU Member States through InvestEU or at project level, the Commission noted. It added that a call for expressions of interest for potential InvestEU implementing partners is currently open until June 30 2021.</p>
<p>Renewable energy and clean(er) transport were also key focus areas for the massive €750BN ‘Next Generation EU’ coronavirus recovery fund put together by the Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/5g-ai-cybersecurity-and-renewable-energy-set-for-investment-boost-under-eu-coronavirus-recovery-plan/">last year</a> &#8212; which said it would borrow money on the financial markets through the issuance of bonds for post-pandemic recovery &#8212; with that money pegged to be channelled through EU programs between 2021 and 2024.</p>
<p>The bloc&#8217;s lawmakers have also suggested that digitization and AI technologies &#8212; which are other areas it&#8217;s pegged for major investment &#8212; will play a key supporting role in Europe&#8217;s green transition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.tier.app/">Tier Mobility</a> has raised $60 million to help the e-scooter company expand its fleet and its network of battery charging stations in 2021.</p>
<p>The funds, which come from investment banking firm Goldman Sachs, come just weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/dott-lime-and-tier-selected-for-london-e-scooter-trial/">Tier was awarded the London e-scooter pilot permit</a>, alongside Lime and Dott. With a major new city on the horizon and hints of further expansion plans, Tier will need a significant upfront investment to cover everything from fleet orders to local warehouses to new teams.</p>
<p>In November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/e-scooter-startup-tier-raises-250-million-round-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/">Tier also closed a $250 million Series C funding round</a>, led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2. The latest funds are asset-backed financing, meaning Goldman Sachs is essentially providing Tier with a loan that is secured by one of the company&#8217;s assets, probably its scooters. Tier did not respond to a request for specifics on the loan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The size of this highly scalable asset-backed debt facility is a game-changing first in micro-mobility, accelerating our expansion and cementing our market leadership in Europe,&#8221; said Alex Gayer, Tier&#8217;s chief financial officer, in a statement. &#8220;This facility leverages our recent equity raise and will enhance our capital-efficient growth.”</p>
<p>In addition to London, over the past year, Tier has added the coveted cities of Dubai and Paris to its list. It&#8217;s available in over 100 cities across 12 countries in Europe and the Middle East. With the fresh capital, Tier plans to extend its international coverage and invest in its multi-modal fleet, adding bicycles and mopeds to the mix.</p>

<p>The Goldman Sachs-backed funding will also enable Tier to expand its Tier Energy Network, a venture to place battery charging stations in retail stores across its coverage area. The energy network would provide an incentive structure for riders to take a minute at the end of their ride to swap the scooter&#8217;s battery and earn free credit, while shops can enjoy the extra foot traffic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even amid a global pandemic, TIER has established a proven track record of profitable unit economics and asset longevity,&#8221; said Ben Payne, managing director at Goldman Tier, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to help the European leader extend sustainable mobility to more people across the world.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Home services marketplace Urban Company said on Wednesday it has raised $255 million in a new financing round and confirmed a valuation of $2.1 billion, joining over a dozen other startups in India that have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/zeta-unicorn-softbank/">earned the unicorn status this year</a>.</p>
<p>The new financing round &#8212; a Series F &#8212; was led by Prosus Ventures, Dragoneer and Wellington Management, while Vy Capital, Tiger Global and Steadview participated in it. The Gurgaon-headquartered startup said* the new round features a primary capital infusion of $188 million while the rest is a secondary sale by some angel and other early investors. The startup has raised about $470 million to date.</p>
<p>Formerly known as UrbanClap, the seven-year-old startup offers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/urbanclap-indias-largest-home-services-startup-raises-75m/">a range of home services on its platform</a>. Does your AC need maintenance work? Is the TV not working? The house needs a fresh coat of paint? Plumbing issues? Need your cleaned and disinfected? How about a haircut done at a place of your choosing?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These are just some of the services <a href="https://www.urbancompany.com/">Urban Company</a> offers to its customers, who can place an order using the startup’s app or the website and pick a good time and venue.</p>
<p>The idea of the startup came from its three co-founders, who in their early 20s were puzzled why nobody else was trying to take a stab at the industry, which remains largely unorganized, said Raghav Chandra, a founder of Urban Company, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>What started as an idea is now a unicorn. The startup today operates in 35 cities in India, Singapore, Australia, the UAE, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. More than 35,000 service partners are active on the platform, said Chandra, who serves as Urban Company’s Chief Technology Officer.</p>
<p>“Urban Company is disrupting a large, fragmented industry that has seen low digital adoption until now,” said Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Investment for India at Prosus Ventures.</p>
<p>Through their technology-enabled platform and keen focus on providing high-quality, trained service partners, Urban Company has been able to achieve the very difficult task of productizing services. In addition, the initial traction with international expansion in geographies we know well is encouraging and presents an opportunity for significant growth into the future,” he added.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s fast-growth was abruptly punctuated last year after New Delhi enforced a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Chandra said the startup began seeing recovery last year after the nation started to open up again and had its best month to date in March this year.</p>
<p>Chandra said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to further expand in the markets where it operates, and work on ways to supercharge onboarding, training, and safety of service workers on the platform. It is also looking to expand its technology team. The startup plans to file for an IPO within the next 24 months, it said.</p>
<p>Urban Company spends weeks on training and upskilling the workers that join its platform, said Chandra. The startup today also enables workers with expertise in one category to learn about other categories, hence increasing their odds of getting more work and earning more. Chandra said offering upskilling courses to the workers will remain one of the key areas as the startup expands.</p>
<p>*The startup had disclosed the new fundraise in a filing with local regulator in April, but co-founder and chief executive Abhiraj Singh Bhal declined to comment at the time, citing the rising coronavirus cases in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon confirmed its annual sales event known as Prime Day will be held on Monday, June 21 and Tuesday, June 22. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/amazon-said-to-hold-prime-day-sales-event-june-21-and-22">Bloomberg</a> had previously reported these same dates, citing leaked records. The once-a-year mega sale had typically been held in July, when the shopping season goes through its usual lull. But due to the COVID-19 pandemic, last year&#8217;s Prime Day was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/amazon-confirms-prime-day-delay-in-u-s-will-run-prime-day-in-india-on-aug-6-7/">delayed</a> until October in most markets, including the U.S.</p>
<p>Despite the changes, Amazon said small and midsize businesses <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/amazon-announces-prime-day-2020-results.html">generated mo0re than $3.5 billion</a> during the Prime Day event, Amazon said, up 60% from the year prior. However, it didn&#8217;t disclose its total Prime Day figures.</p>
<p>This year, Amazon will kick off Prime Day early with a new promotion aimed at supporting small businesses. Starting June 7 and running up until Prime day&#8217;s start, when Prime members spend $10 on items sold by a participating small business, they&#8217;ll receive a $10 credit they can later spend during the Prime Day event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This deal will run in select markets, including the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Japan, and is the big promotion for small businesses in Amazon&#8217;s history, the company noted. More than 300,000 selling partners are participating.</p>
<p>Prime Day was originally conceived as a way to push more Amazon shoppers to convert to paying Amazon Prime subscribers by luring them with deep discounts across categories &#8212; including Amazon&#8217;s own consumer hardware devices, like Echo smart speakers or Fire TV devices, which have been regular best sellers.</p>
<p>This will again be the case, as Amazon promises savings and discounts across home, electronics, beauty, fashion and Amazon devices. And it will again extend sales to other areas of Amazon&#8217;s business, like Prime Video, Amazon Music, Prime Gaming and others.</p>
<p>One of those deals is live now, as Prime members are offered a four-month free trial for its on-demand music streaming service, Amazon Music Unlimited, which offers up to 70 million songs. The company recently added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/amazon-makes-its-its-lossless-music-streaming-service-a-free-upgrade/">lossless streaming support as a free upgrade</a>, following Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">move</a> to do the same for its own Music subscribers.</p>
<p>While Prime Day has been running since 2015, Amazon has more recently begun using the event to put a stronger spotlight on how it helps small businesses in light of increased regulatory scrutiny and antitrust investigations over its business practices.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/tech-hearing-apple-google-amazon-facebook-antitrust-house-judiciary/">Congressional hearings</a> which saw Amazon founder and (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/jeff-bezos-to-formally-step-down-as-amazon-ceo-on-july-5.html">soon to be former</a>) CEO Jeff Bezos hauled in to testify, DC&#8217;s Attorney General Karl Racine last month filed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/amazon-antitrust-suit-dc-attorney-general/">an antitrust suit against Amazon</a>, accusing the retailer of stifling competition by exerting control over third-party sellers. The suit alleges Amazon fixed prices on its retail platform by prohibiting sellers from selling products for less elsewhere, creating an artificially high price floor across the online retail market.</p>

<p>The company is also facing antitrust investigations abroad, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/eu-hits-amazon-with-antitrust-charges-for-distorting-competition.html">including</a> in the E.U. The retailer has been accused of harming small businesses by leveraging nonpublic data from its third-party sellers who use its marketplace in order to copy the best-selling products and undercut its selling partners.</p>
<p>This reality stands in sharp contrast as to how Amazon presented itself during an upbeat press briefing, where it had leveraged actress Kristen Bell&#8217;s (&#8220;The Good Place&#8221;) likeability factor to promote how well small businesses were doing on Amazon. During the event, she &#8220;interviewed&#8221; favorite sellers, like dog food seller Pawstruck and artisanal self-care product maker Live by Being, who had nothing but great things to say about working with Amazon.</p>
<p>Bell, along with Karamo Brown and Mindy Kaling, will also be highlighting some of their favorite sellers on Amazon&#8217;s video shopping service, Amazon Live.</p>
<p>Amazon also gave a broader update on its small business sellers and related efforts. The retailer noted that, last year, it delivered more than 250 new tools and services to help its selling partners reach 300 million customers globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty incredible to think in the past year in the U.S. alone, our small and medium-sized selling partners sold more than 3.7 billion products as more than 7,200 products, every minute,&#8221; said Keri Cusick, head of Small Business Empowerment at Amazon, in a press briefing. &#8220;Overall, they average $200,000 in sales, up from about $150,000, and more than 27,000 American sellers had over half a million dollars in sales,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Amazon didn&#8217;t offer specifics about its upcoming Prime Day deals, but said that it will host hundreds of thousands of deals leading up to Prime Day from companies including Le Creuset, Tommy Hilfiger, Lego, Mattel and Black &amp; Decker.</p>
<p>Alexa device owners can also shop early, starting on Friday June 18, by asking &#8220;Alexa, what are my deals?&#8221;</p>
<p>Prime Day will be available on Amazon.com or regional websites, on Amazon.com/espanol for Spanish-language speakers and in Amazon&#8217;s physical retail stores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla has recently <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/90740074/APP20210531123730/">filed a new trademark</a> for its brand under restaurant services, a sign the company might be finally gearing up to deliver on an idea that CEO Elon Musk and other company executives have discussed publicly since at least 2017.</p>
<p>The company applied for three new trademarks that will cover the categories of: &#8220;Restaurant services, pop-up restaurant services, self-service restaurant services, take-out restaurant services, according to the May 27 filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office that was first <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/01/tesla-files-trademark-restaurant-services/">reported by Electrek</a>. The application is awaiting examination and will be reviewed by an attorney around August 27.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, how does the restaurant industry fit in with the world&#8217;s most influential luxury electric car company? Let&#8217;s take it back to 2017, when then-CTO JB Straubel said at a <a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/4-potential-game-changers-restaurants-tech-summit#page=1">FSTEC restaurant-technology conference</a> that the company might move into the restaurant business. The idea was to turn EV charging stations into full-service convenience stores that also serve food. Tesla has tried out a scaled down version of that idea by creating lounges like the one at its Kettleman City, California Supercharger station.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk then expanded upon the convenience store idea and tossed out on Twitter — as he does — a restaurant concept. &#8220;Gonna put an old school drive-in, roller skates &amp; rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in LA.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gonna put an old school drive-in, roller skates &amp; rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in LA</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/949831212326993920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>A few months later, Tesla did in fact apply for a restaurant and supercharger station, but has been relatively quiet about the potential business venture since. The company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/teslas-decision-to-scrap-its-pr-department-could-create-a-pr-nightmare/">which recently dissolved its communications team</a>, did not respond to requests for more information on Tesla&#8217;s plans to open a restaurant charging station, or whether other restaurants would be able to use the logo to create a similar business model.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s iconic &#8216;T&#8217; logo is featured on the USTPO application to be trademarked for use by restaurants. The company also applied for trademarks for the word &#8216;Tesla&#8217; itself, as well as a stylized version of the word.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159883" style="width: 469px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159883" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2159883" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tesla.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="459" height="191" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tesla.jpeg 320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tesla.jpeg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tesla.jpeg?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/tesla.jpeg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 459px) 100vw, 459px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159883" class="wp-caption-text">Tesla applied for a trademark under restaurant services for a stylized version of the company name.</p></div></p>
<p>With this filing, it looks like Tesla might be taking the necessary steps to move forwards with Musk&#8217;s plans to create a Sonic-meets-fueling station. This is not the first time the restaurant industry and the auto industry have collided. The Michelin Guide, in which the loss or acquisition of a star might make or break a restaurant, was originally compiled in 1900 by brothers Andre and Edouard Michelin who wanted to create demand for automobiles, and therefore, the tires they manufactured. So they created an extensive guide of restaurants and hotels, as well as mechanics and gas stations along the way, so people might be encouraged to use their newfound mobility to explore their taste buds and the world.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s supercharger restaurant isn&#8217;t quite as revolutionary as that, but it does invite creativity to the EV game by providing people with another incentive structure to purchase a new vehicle – even if that incentive is only to appear trendy while basking in the nostalgic glow of the past. And who knows, maybe the waiters will serve up burgers on electric roller skates, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Artificial intelligence is becoming an increasingly common part of how customer service works &#8212; a trend that was accelerated in this past year as so many other services went virtual and digital &#8212; and today a startup that has built a set of low-code tools to help enterprises integrate more AI into their customer service processes is announcing some funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cognigy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cognigy</a>, which provides a low-code conversational AI platform that notably can be used flexibly across a range of applications and geographies &#8212; it supports 120 languages; it can be used in external or internal service applications; it can support voice services but also chatbots; it provides real-time assistance for human agents and usage analytics or fully automated responses; it can integrate with standard call center software, and also with RPA packages; and it can be run in the cloud or on-premise &#8212; has closed a round of $44 million, funding that it will be using to continue scaling its business internationally.</p>
<p>Insight Partners is leading the Series B investment, with previous backers DN Capital, Global Brain, Nordic Makers, Inventures and Digital Innovation and Growth also participating. The Dusseldorf-based company had previously only raised $11 million and spent the first several years of business bootstrapped.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cognigy is not disclosing its valuation but it has up to now built up a concentration of customers in areas like transportation, e-commerce and insurance and counts a number of big multinational companies among its customer list, including Lufthansa, Mobily, BioNTech, Vueling Airlines, Bosch and Daimler, with &#8220;thousands&#8221; of virtual assistants now powered by Cognigy live in the market.</p>
<p>With 25% of Cognigy&#8217;s business already coming from the U.S., the plan now is to use some funding to invest in building out its service deeper into the U.S., Asia and across more of Europe, CEO and founder Philipp Heltewig said in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conversational AI&#8221; these days appears in many guises: it can be a chatbot you come across on a website when you&#8217;re searching for something, or it can be prompts provided to agents or salespeople, information and real-time feedback to help them do their jobs better. Conversational AI can also be a personal assistant on your company&#8217;s HR application to help you book time off or deal with any number of other administrative jobs, or a personal assistant that helps you use your phone or set your house alarm.</p>
<p>There are a number of companies in the tech world that have built tools to address these various use cases. Specifically in the area of services aimed at enterprises, some of them, like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/startup-gong-said-to-seek-new-funds-at-above-7-billion-value" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gong</a>, are raising huge money right now. What is notable about Cognigy is that it has built a platform that is attempting to address a wide swathe of applications: one platform, many uses, in other words.</p>
<p>Cognigy&#8217;s other selling point is that it is playing into the new interest in low- and no-code tools, which in Cognigy&#8217;s case makes the integration of AI into a customer assistance process a relatively easy task, something that can be built not just by developers, but data scientists, those working directly on conversation design, and nontechnical business users using the tools themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;The low-code platform helps enterprises adopt what is otherwise complex technology in an easy and flexible way, whether it is a customer or employee contact center,&#8221; said Heltewig. As you might expect, there are some direct competitors in the low- and no-code conversational AI space, too, including <a href="https://www.ada.cx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ada</a>, <a href="https://talkie.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Talkie</a>, <a href="https://snaps.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snaps</a> and more.</p>
<p>Flexibility seems to be the order of the day for enterprises, and also the companies building tools for them: it means that a company can grow into a larger customer, and that in theory Cognigy will also evolve the platform based on what its customers need. As one example, Heltewig pointed out that a number of its customers are &#8212; contrary to the beating drum and march you see every day toward cloud services &#8212; running a fair number of applications on-premises, since this appears to be a key way to ensure the security of the customer data that they handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lufthansa could never run its customer services in the cloud because they handle a lot of sensitive data and they want full ownership of it,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;We can run cloud services and have a full offering for those who want it, but many large enterprises prefer to run their services on premises.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teddie Wardi, an MD at Insight, is joining the board with this round. “We are thrilled to be leading Cognigy’s Series B as the company continues on their ScaleUp journey,” he said in a statement. “Evident by their strong customer retention, Cognigy has created an essential product for global businesses to improve their customer experience in an efficient and effortless manner. With the new funding, Cognigy will be able to expand their leadership position to reach new markets and acquire more customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After burning through more than $2 billion in funding, SoftBank-backed construction startup Katerra has told employees that it will be shutting down operations, according to a report in <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/softbank-backed-katerra-to-shut-down">The Information</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, the company claimed it had more than 8,000 employees globally.</p>
<p>Menlo Park-based Katerra had already been struggling to find a viable business in cheaply building properties for real estate developers when it was pushed to the edge of bankruptcy late last year, with the company blaming its latest struggles on climbing labor and material costs associated with the pandemic. The company was given one last chance after receiving a $200 million bailout from SoftBank, which reportedly bought up a majority stake after already having invested billions in the effort.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Katerra&#8217;s fall marks the most high-profile failure for SoftBank since the failed 2019 WeWork IPO. The firm has largely been seeing gains among its Vision Fund portfolio in the past year amid a larger tech stock rally, though some of those gains have receded in recent months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello, and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 1, 2021. We’re back from a long weekend here in the United States, which means that the blog has been humming all day. Today’s tech and startup news had a fun mix of the old going new (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/7-eleven-to-install-500-ev-charging-stations-by-the-end-of-2022/">7-Eleven adding EV charging points</a>), and new going old (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/kudos-with-its-cotton-based-eco-friendly-diaper-soaks-up-2-4-million-in-seed-funding/">check out this new diaper startup</a>), but mostly we had funding rounds. Lots of them. So let’s get to work! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/european-insurtech-startup-wefox-grabs-650-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">European tech is hot</a>:</strong> EU-based insurtech startup Wefox announced a $650 million round today. The huge round will surely help burnish Europe’s Q2 venture capital results, while also underscoring how the neoinsurance provider boom that we’ve seen in America is hardly a domestic affair. Expect more investment and startup activity in this space during the rest of 2021.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cloudera-to-go-private-as-kkr-cdr-grab-it-for-5-3b/">Hadoop is not</a>: </strong>Cloudera and Hortonworks were once hot startups. They both went public. And then they struggled. So <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/cloudera-and-hortonworks-announce-5-2-billion-merger/">they teamed up</a> in a $5.2 billion merger. And then they struggled. And now their combined entity is being taken off the public markets by a pair of private equity companies for $5.3 billion, a modest premium on their pre-deal value. Thus concludes Hadoop’s startup run.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/sprinklrs-ipo-filing-shows-uneven-cash-flow-but-modest-growth/">The IPO boom continues</a>:</strong> But while The Artist Formerly Known As Hortonworks takes its leave, many companies are looking to join the public markets. Sprinklr, for example. The New York-based customer experience startup is looking to list on the back of modest revenue gains and possibly improving profitability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>The last 24 hours have brought a steady deluge of startup rounds. We can’t fit them all in the newsletter. But here are some of our favorites all the same:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/molecule-one-grows-its-drug-synthesis-ai-platform-with-a-4-6m-seed-round/"><strong>Molecule.one raises $4.6M for computational chemistry</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Former TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield participant Molecule.one wants to “bring theoretical drug molecules to reality,” we reported, creating workflows to help labs figure out how to make exotic molecules from known materials and methods.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/goldman-sachs-leads-202m-round-into-project44-which-just-doubled-its-valuation-to-1-2b/"><strong>project44 raises $202M for supply chain APIs</strong></a><strong>:</strong> project44 uses APIs to provide “connective tissue” between the myriad players in the supply chain world. The company is now worth $1.2 billion, a rapid-fire doubling of its prior valuation. That’s thanks to money from Goldman Sachs and rapid growth. TechCrunch reports that the company has “crossed $50 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), which is up 100% year over year.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/redacted-comes-out-of-stealth-with-60m-in-funding-and-a-new-take-on-fighting-cybercrime/"><strong>Redacted raises $60M for proactive cybersecurity</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Most cybersecurity software feels defensive. Redacted, fresh out of stealth, wants to flip that narrative and, instead, “proactively [go] after the hackers to recover data loss and disrupt their activities.” There are probably fun legal questions at play here, but it’s a nice mental image at least.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/truebill-raises-45-million-for-its-personal-finance-app/"><strong>Truebill raises $45M for its personal finance app</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Early in life Truebill was a neat way to cancel subscriptions. But like all consumer fintech products in 2021, it has become a broad service that offers a host of features and capabilities. Savings? Sure. Credit information? Why not. You get the idea.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/belvo-latams-answer-to-plaid-raises-43m-series-a-to-scale-its-api-for-financial-services/"><strong>Belvo raises $43M for fintech APIs</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Since Belvo first took part in Y Combinator, we’ve been pretty positive about the company’s chances. Building a sort of Plaid for the Latin American market, it seemed like a pretty darn good bet. And today’s news that the company has put together a fresh $43 million in funding somewhat backs up our early read.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong> </strong>4 proven approaches to CX strategy that make customers feel loved</h2>
<p>People have been working to optimize customer experiences (CX) since we began selling things to each other.</p>
<p>A famous San Francisco bakery has an exhaust fan at street level; each morning, its neighbors awake to the scent of orange-cinnamon morning buns wafting down the block. Similarly, savvy hair stylists know to greet returning customers by asking if they want a repeat or something new.</p>
<p>Online, CX may encompass anything from recommending the right shoes to AI that knows when to send a frustrated traveler an upgrade for a delayed flight.</p>
<p>In light of Qualtrics&#8217; spinout and IPO and Sprinklr&#8217;s recent S-1, Rebecca Liu-Doyle, principal at Insight Partners, describes four key attributes shared by &#8220;companies that have upped their CX game.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TV4acXXcEd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/4-proven-approaches-to-cx-strategy-that-make-customers-feel-loved/">4 proven approaches to CX strategy that make customers feel loved</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Big Tech news on the blog was somewhat light today thanks to the pace of startup happenings. But we still found time to discuss how Twitter is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitter-to-begin-pilot-testing-fleet-ads-starting-today/">making room for more ads on its service</a>. But don’t worry &#8212; unless you use its Fleets service, you probably won’t see them.</p>
<p>While Daily Crunch has been positive concerning Twitter’s <em>general</em> product work of late, this is one update that we’d be happy to skip.</p>
<p>Then from Line, news that the messaging app best known for its market share in certain Asian markets is now a bank. Basically. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/line-launches-digital-banking-platform-in-indonesia/">wrote that the well-known tech company</a> “launched a digital banking platform in Indonesia today” that will include “deposit accounts, microcredit products, and remittance and payment services.”</p>
<p>It’s a joke in tech that every messaging app is really a dating service. That’s so old-fashioned. Now every <em>app</em> is simply a service that exists somewhere on the evolutionary continuum of becoming &#8212; slowly or quickly &#8212; a horizontal fintech offering.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Another IPO, but will it be a successful public offering? <a href="https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1399759634681020422">Tell us what you think</a> will happen with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/sprinklrs-ipo-filing-shows-uneven-cash-flow-but-modest-growth/">Sprinklr</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard about our upcoming field trip to Pittsburgh, which <a href="https://twitter.com/billpeduto/status/1399476840255864833">even the mayor is excited</a> about. Have friends building companies in the Steel City? Ask them to <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/F2JkiUKt">sign up to pitch</a> during <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">the event</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Since we were off yesterday for Memorial Day, today's roundup is brief, but we'll have much more to recap on Friday.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite a recent history of uneven cash flow and moderate growth, SaaS customer experience management platform Sprinklr has filed to go public.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/sprinklrs-ipo-filing-shows-uneven-cash-flow-but-modest-growth/">today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange</a>, Alex Wilhelm pores over the New York-based unicorn&#8217;s S-1 to better understand exactly what Sprinklr offers: &#8220;Marketing and comms software, with some machine learning built in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite 19% growth in revenue over the last fiscal year, its deficits increased during the same period. But with more than $250 million in cash available, &#8220;Sprinklr is not going public because it needs the money,&#8221; says Alex.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since we were off yesterday for Memorial Day, today&#8217;s roundup is brief, but we&#8217;ll have much more to recap on Friday. Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch!</p>

<p>The changes brought by a global shift to remote work and schooling are myriad, but in the business realm, they have yielded a change in corporate behavior and consumer expectations — changes that showed up in a bushel of earnings reports last week.</p>
<p>Startups have told us for several quarters that their markets are picking up momentum as customers shake up buying behavior with a distinct advantage for companies helping users move into the digital realm.</p>
<p>Public company results are now confirming the startups’ perspective. The accelerating digital transformation is real, and we have the data to prove it.</p>

<p>In a recent episode of TechCrunch Equity, hosts Danny Crichton, Natasha Mascarenhas and Alex Wilhelm connected the dots between multiple funding rounds to sketch out three perspectives on the future of workplace meetings.</p>
<p>Each agreed that the traditional meeting is broken, so we gathered their perspectives about where the industry is heading and which aspects are ripe for disruption:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Wilhelm: Faster information throughput, please.</li>
<li>Natasha Mascarenhas: Meetings should be ongoing, not in calendar invites.</li>
<li>Danny Crichton: Redesign meetings for flow.</li>
</ul>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The last few months have been interesting for Twitter.</p>
<p>After years of no innovation at all, Twitter is making big product changes. It has acquired Breaker and Revue, and presumably has more M&amp;A coming. It&#8217;s coming out with Spaces. The only thing it clearly isn’t working on is an edit button.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The core idea is that Twitter is doubling down on multichannel engagement for creators so that they never have to leave for anywhere else.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Strategically, though, what is a microblogging service doing buying a social podcasting company and a newsletter tool while also building a live broadcasting sub-app? Is there even a strategy at all?</p>
<p>I humbly propose this: There is a strategy. Twitter is trying to revitalize itself by adding more contexts for discourse to its repertoire. The result, if everything goes right, will be an influence superapp that hasn’t existed anywhere before. The alternative is nothing less than the destruction of Twitter into a link-forwarding service.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how Twitter is trying to eat the public conversation.</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>Twitter’s problem is pretty simple. It’s <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TWTR/twitter/revenue">this</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159433" style="width: 788px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159433" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2159433 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3.png" alt="Twitter revenue quarterly growth 2013-21" width="778" height="195" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3.png 778w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image3.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159433" class="wp-caption-text">Twitter revenue quarterly growth 2013-21. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Macrotrends</p></div></p>
<p>Another way of putting it is: Twitter is not generating as much money from ads as it used to. Ad revenue has failed to grow because Twitter is generally considered to have a poorly performing product for marketers. As a result, its stock price has been flat for years.</p>
<p>The irony, though, is that Twitter became more socially important during this period of financial stagnation to the point that the president of the United States nearly launched several wars on the platform!</p>
<p>The core reason is that since becoming a public company, Twitter has been considered by most to be one of the most boring tech companies productwise. Yes, people joke about the lack of an edit button, but the platform really has been slow to innovate in any real way.</p>
<p>Twitter was one of the most dynamic companies around, going from the fail whale company to being the company that invented the hashtag and acquiring some of the hottest companies, from Periscope to Vine.</p>
<p>But it all failed. Twitter rarely used acquisitions successfully. It stopped putting out new features and barely even managed simple improvements. Despite describing itself as &#8220;what’s happening now,&#8221; it missed every boat. Until this year.</p>
<p>What changed?</p>
<ol>
<li>Twitter started to face its first real competition in years due to the social media renaissance. Twitter’s strength has always come from being where the news happens. Podcasts, Clubhouse, newsletters and other new channels are true competitive threats.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even as remote software uptake has boomed during the pandemic, certain workflows have gotten prioritized for specialized toolsets while other team members have been left piecemealing their productivity. Employees designing the copy that directs users and encapsulates company messaging have been particularly forgotten at times, say the founders of <a href="https://www.dittowords.com/">Ditto</a>, a young startup building software focused on finding a &#8220;single source of truth&#8221; for copy.</p>
<p>The startup was in Y Combinator&#8217;s winter 2020 batch (we selected it as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/the-20-best-startups-from-y-combinators-w20-demo-day/">one of our favorites</a> from the class); now Ditto&#8217;s founders tell TechCrunch the team has raised a $1.5 million seed round from investors including Greycroft, Y Combinator, Soma Capital, Decent Capital, Twenty Two VC, Holly Liu and Scott Tong, among others.</p>
<p>While copy workflows are often very messy when it comes to design and implementation, even the most-organized teams are often left scouring through meandering email threads, screenshot dumps and slack DMs with disparate teams. The founders behind Ditto hope that their software can give copy teams the home they deserve to keep everything organized and synced across projects and applications, ensuring that language is actually finalized and ready to ship when the time comes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s founders Jessica Ouyang and Jolena Ma were Stanford roommates who saw a lingering opportunity to build a toolset that prioritized copy as its own vertical.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so easy to couple text with where it lives, like you may think of it as part of the design so a lot of writers have to manage it inside toolsets for design or you may already think of it as part of development so writers end up having to go into the codebase and figure out how to code or manage JSON even though they&#8217;re content designers,&#8221; Ouyang tells TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AFUifJ84dG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/the-20-best-startups-from-y-combinators-w20-demo-day/">The 20 best startups from Y Combinator&#8217;s W20 Demo Day</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 20 best startups from Y Combinator&#8217;s W20 Demo Day&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/the-20-best-startups-from-y-combinators-w20-demo-day/embed/#?secret=AFUifJ84dG" data-secret="AFUifJ84dG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Out of the gate, Ditto has been built for Figma, meaning users can easily export text blocks from designs in the app and rework them inside the Ditto web app, pushing updates without having to dig through the designs themselves. The founders say they are currently working on building out integrations for Sketch and Adobe XD as well. Inside the Ditto web app users can access change logs and update the status of particular pieces of text inside a project so that approvals are always certain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find there&#8217;s a lot more opportunity to integrate into all of the places where copy is being worked on,&#8221; Ma tells us. &#8220;We have a lot more we&#8217;re hoping to do with our developer integrations and just integrating to all of those places where copy lives, places like A/B testing, internationalization, localization and other workflows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Copy development has plenty of stakeholders and the team is looking to experiment with pricing tiers that address that. For now they split up users into <em>editors</em> and <em>commenters</em> paying $15 and $10 monthly (priced annually), respectively, on the startup&#8217;s Teams plan. Ditto has a free tier for teams of two, as well as pricing designed for larger enterprise clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Work looks wildly different today than it did a year ago. In tech, every bit of the workplace has been tweaked to fit our new remote world. From scaling accountability and onboarding remotely to figuring out what old perks can be made socially distant &#8212; myriad decisions have been made at the hands of the employers.</p>
<p>An early-stage startup thinks it’s time to give some of that decision-making power back to employees, too. So Unit, a New York-based company, is tackling perhaps the most elusive and controversial topic in mainstream tech today: labor unions.</p>
<p>Numerous studies show that union members earn significantly higher wages and get better benefits than non-union workers. At the same time, many companies are anti-union because it impacts the bottom line, or puts more autonomy into their workers’ hands and limits control.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unit wants to make it easier for employees to virtually organize, and manage, labor unions to protect them from their employers. Unit itself is not a labor union, but instead helps worker-organizers set up, affiliate and manage a union with a mix of software and human resources.</p>
<h2><strong>Janitorial entrepreneurship </strong></h2>
<p>Unit founder and CEO James White watched <a href="http://occupywallst.org/">Occupy Wall Street </a>unfold in real time while he was a graduate student. He helped out a cohort of janitorial workers from MIT and Harvard that were organizing with the SEIU, or Service Employees International Union, a union of about 2 million people across the services industry.</p>
<p>“By day I would be working in the bio-instrumentation lab at MIT on medical injection devices, and by nights and weekends we were organizing students to support these janitors in their bid for better pay and working conditions,” he said. “[Volunteer organizing] felt very manual and inefficient, but they won some things. It took a couple of years, but they won.”</p>
<p>White spent most of the next decade picking the day job, and worked on a company in the medical device space. But after getting business and sales chops, he left to start his own business. He kept thinking about labor unions.</p>
<p>“Tech-enabled organizing kept coming back to the forefront [of my ideas], and being both the most exciting to me personally, but also I think the most impactful in the ways I wanted to see the world change in terms of income inequality and individual empowerment,” he said.</p>
<h2><strong>A turnkey solution for unions</strong></h2>
<p>Unit offers a suite of services to fix the process of unionizing, which starts with education. The startup has<a href="https://guide.unitworkers.com/how-to-unionize-your-workplace/"> a step-by-step process</a> of how to virtually unionize a workplace that it offers for free public use on its website.</p>
<p>After a worker-organizer decides that they want to unionize, Unit helps them begin the process. Employees can come to the website, run through an eligibility survey, and begin to start inviting fellow co-workers to the organizing platform. Interested employees will fill out paperwork and a small cohort will begin to form within an organization.</p>
<p>In the background, Unit begins handling the legal automation process needed before a team approaches a national union, such as the national Labor Relations Board, or local union with their pitch. The startup works with a Boston law firm that files the petitions on behalf of employees.</p>
<p>“So far, the biggest feedback we&#8217;ve gotten from our organizing application is that ‘I chose you guys over calling a labor organizer at a national union or over contacting volunteers to come and help us because it seemed like the fastest way to get started’,” White said.</p>
<p>After (and if) a union is approved, Unit takes on the role of a labor advisory service. The startup uses a combination of digital and human services to create a “turnkey solution” for union management.</p>
<p>The startup will help conduct voting and polling, provide consensus tools and oversee the charter draft and review process, otherwise known as the governance of a union, on behalf of workers. It will also help with negotiation, such as bargaining surveys, contract drafting and review, compensation and strategic analysis. Beyond that, Unit focuses on ongoing organizing such as new member education and strike planning, as well as contract maintenance. Another company in the space, UnionWare, helps with membership management, while Unit is aiming for the full suite.</p>
<p>“We plan to try to take the time commitment down by quite a bit by automating a bunch of it,” he said. “So that people can vote over software, they can get updates over software, nominate new officers or run for office within these small unions over software.” A Shopify for union organizers, of sorts.</p>
<p>Similar to how an employee only pays fees once a union is approved, Unit only charges a fee after the formation process is complete. The typical cost of national union dues is 1.5% of wages, the company said, meaning that an employee who makes $40,000 a year would pay about $50 a month. Unit charges 0.8% of those monthly earnings.</p>
<p>The “no strings attached” business model means that Unit could lose 90% of their customers once the union is approved, White said. The startup is in the process of forging partnerships with large national unions so that it gets paid whenever a Unit-approved union that comes through one of its networks gets affiliated &#8212; with the pitch that it saves unions time and resources through its software.</p>
<p>Customers include software developers, digital media companies, fast food franchises and mental health companies, with a specific focus on helping smaller companies unionize.</p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;It&#8217;s not a technical problem we have to solve&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p>Arianna Jimenez, who was a labor organizer for 20 years at SEIU, expressed caution around oversimplifying the unionizing process, which she thinks could give a false sense of hope to workers. In her experience, the negotiation process is the most contentious part of unionizing, taking anywhere from six months to 10 years.</p>
<p>“Once you have signed the cards and you are technically a union in the eyes of the law, that doesn’t in and of itself bring a change in the material conditions of the workers&#8217; lives,” she said. “What brings the change is that the workers are engaging in a legal process that is protected by law with the employer officially to change the contract &#8212; such as increased benefits, healthcare and pension.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon goes on the offensive ahead of next week’s union vote counting&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/embed/#?secret=X8GQ1dDda6" data-secret="X8GQ1dDda6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Unit and labor organizers across the country help with the negotiation process, employer-led oppression and fear tactics can often force employees to worry about their livelihoods, and thus vote against forming a union. For example, earlier this year Amazon conducted<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/"> an anti-union campaign</a> to pressure employees to vote against organizing efforts. The corporation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/">defeated the union </a>attempts, a setback for the biggest unionization push in Amazon’s 27-year history.</p>
<p>Jimenez doesn’t think that unionizing could ever have a fully turnkey solution because “the transformation fundamentally for workers between having a union and not having a union is not a legal threshold. It is really a more intangible transformation from a group of people who feel disempowered and disenfranchised to not.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon defeats warehouse union push, RWDSU challenges results&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/09/amazon-defeats-warehouse-union-push-challenges-expected/embed/#?secret=sDlPbrpXzg" data-secret="sDlPbrpXzg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Jimenez says hitting scale for Unit would mean rewriting U.S. labor laws.</p>
<p>“It’s not a technical problem we have to solve, it’s a problem of values,” she said.</p>
<h2><strong>When venture is the elephant in the room</strong></h2>
<p>To scale, Unit will have to lean on VC, per White. In July 2020, Unit closed $1.4 million in financing, from investors such as Bloomberg Beta, Draper Associates, Schlaf Angel Fund, Haystack, E14 and Gutter Capital.</p>
<p>And this is where the heart of the tension with Unit is, per White: It needs to raise venture capital to hit scale, but getting in bed with that very asset class can feel counterintuitive.</p>
<p>For example, what if Unit helps employees within portfolio companies of existing investors start unions? Is there a conflict of interest, or can Unit be swayed to not prioritize those clients in order to keep its cap table happy?</p>
<p>Last year, California voters<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/prop-22-results/"> passed Proposition 22</a>, essentially supporting Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates that gig workers should not be entitled to the same labor right as employees, staying as independent contractors. The move was a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">blow to the efforts</a> of worker-organizers around the world, and a reminder that venture-backed companies can be incentivized to act against broader access to benefits and worker protections.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EahDzk1Csx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">Human Capital: The gig economy in a post-Prop 22 world</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While White says that venture was the best option for speed and scale, he did admit to worrying about some of these concerns, specifically about the influence that investors might try to have in later rounds if the founding team is unable to keep the majority of the company. He hopes that Unit can operate off of little venture capital for as long as possible to delay or altogether avoid those interests.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pjux">Siri Srinivas</a>, an investor at Draper, thinks of Unit as a service that is building a better tool for a process that is regulated and complex. In other words, stripping out the politics, it’s a SaaS tool that makes sense.</p>
<p>“Frankly as VCs, we invest in technologies that people want. We as a team make a hard call on not engaging with certain products (e.g. tobacco) which we think are net negative for the world but don&#8217;t see this as much different from investing in other companies building software products in regulated industries,” she said. “Unit allows for a form of worker equity and can unlock a lot of value for its users and in that our incentives are completely aligned.”</p>
<p>For now, White is hoping that general interest in rebuilding workplaces keeps Unit busy and revenue-generating.</p>
<p>“We never could have predicted COVID having the impact that it did and really igniting even more conversations around labor and safety,” he said. “I do think, when we face these problems on a national level, sometimes they hit everybody at once and people think about the same things at the same time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Collaborative software is so hot right now, but the space is also incredibly crowded. It can be hard to rise above the noise, but Coda has managed to do so with $140 million in funding and a valuation topping $600 million.</p>
<p>So it should go without saying that we&#8217;re excited to hear from Coda CEO Shishir Mehrotra and Madrona investor S. Somasegar, who invested in the company&#8217;s Series C round, on an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-madrona-and-coda">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Soma is a managing director at Madrona, responsible for investments in Snowflake, UIPath, Coda, Pulumi, Seekout and more. He invests in a broad array of categories, including machine learning, next-gen cloud infrastructure, future of work, robotic process automation and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before Madrona, Soma spent 27 years at Microsoft as SVP of the Developer Division. He&#8217;s got experience both as an operator and investor and will have plenty of wisdom to impart on the episode.</p>
<p>Mehrotra, for his part, has built a pretty massive business that has not only scaled well, but competes directly with giants like Google. Coda is a collaborative doc/spreadsheet software that looks to take on the G Suite. Before Coda, Mehrotra was an executive at YouTube and, prior to that, held leadership roles at Microsoft working on Windows, Office and SQL Server.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to these two about fundraising for a product like Coda, what attracted Soma to the platform and how they work alongside one another today. We&#8217;ll also have an Extra Crunch Live Pitch-Off, where folks in the audience can come on &#8220;stage&#8221; and pitch their wares. Mehrotra and Soma will give their live feedback and, let&#8217;s face it, make all of us better at pitching in general.</p>
<p>The episode goes down on June 2 at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT and is accessible to anyone. However, only Extra Crunch members can access this episode (and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">entire ECL library</a>) on-demand.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Customers have been &#8220;experiencing&#8221; business since the ancient Romans browsed the Forum for produce, pottery and leather goods. But digitization has radically recalibrated the buyer-seller dynamic, fueling the rise of one of the most talked-about industry acronyms: CX (customer experience).</p>
<p>Part paradigm, part category <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/customer-experience-management.asp">and part multibillion-dollar market</a>, CX is a broad term used across a myriad of contexts. But <em>great </em>CX boils down to delighting every customer on an emotional level, anytime and anywhere a business interaction takes place.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Great CX boils down to delighting every customer on an emotional level, anytime and anywhere a business interaction takes place.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Optimizing CX requires a sophisticated tool stack. Customer behavior should be tracked, their needs must be understood, and opportunities to engage proactively must be identified. Wall Street, for one, is taking note: Qualtrics, the creator of &#8220;XM&#8221; (experience management) as a category, was spun-out from SAP and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/01/28/qualtrics-goes-public-two-years-after-8-billion-sap-acquisition/?sh=19339a3b1f27">IPO&#8217;d in January</a>, and Sprinklr, a social media listening solution that has expanded into a &#8220;Digital CXM&#8221; platform, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/customer-experience-startup-sprinklr-files-confidential-s-1-with-sec/">filed</a> to go public.</p>
<p>Thinking critically about customer experience is hardly a new concept, but a few factors are spurring an inflection point in investment by enterprises and VCs.</p>
<p>Firstly, brands are now expected to create a consistent, cohesive experience across multiple channels, both online and offline, with an ever-increasing focus on the former. Customer experience and the <em>digital </em>customer experience are rapidly becoming synonymous.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of customer data has also reached new heights. As a McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/prediction-the-future-of-cx">report</a> put it, &#8220;Today, companies can regularly, lawfully, and seamlessly collect smartphone and interaction data from across their customer, financial, and operations systems, yielding deep insights about their customers … These companies can better understand their interactions with customers and even preempt problems in customer journeys. Their customers are reaping benefits: Think quick compensation for a flight delay, or outreach from an insurance company when a patient is having trouble resolving a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moreover, the app economy continues to raise the bar on user experience, and end users have less patience than ever before. Each time Netflix displays just the right movie, Instagram recommends just the right shoes, or TikTok plays just the right dog video, people are being trained to demand just a bit more magic.</p>

We&#8217;re thrilled to have Venrock&#8217;s Camille Samuels join us as one of our esteemed Battlefield judges at our second <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/">virtual Startup Battlefield.</a></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Samuels is a partner at Venrock, building out the team&#8217;s investments in the healthcare world, focusing specifically on plays in biotech, medical devices and consumer health. Some recent bets include Unity Biotechnology, Iris Medicine and Biolux. Samuels joined Venrock in 2014 after 12 years at healthcare-centric firm Versant Ventures. Before the start of her 20+ year career in venture, Samuels worked in business development at drug discovery company Tularik and had stints in corporate development at Genzyme and Millennium Predictive Medicine.</p>
<p>When we spoke with Samuels <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/veteran-healthcare-vc-camille-samuels-explains-why-trying-to-cure-infectious-disease-is-a-lousy-business/">early last year</a> she talked about her interests in technology that could keep people healthier for longer. &#8220;In general, the big idea of improving health span is what really interests me. I want us to extend out the years that we can be healthy and happy versus on medication and decrepit,&#8221; she told us.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Polish computational chemistry outfit Molecule.one has raised $4.6 million to expand its quest to bring theoretical drug molecules to reality. Its machine learning systems predict the best ways to synthesize potentially valuable molecules, a crucial part of creating new drugs and treatments.</p>
<p>Molecule.one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/molecule-one-uses-machine-learning-to-make-synthesizing-new-drugs-a-snap/">went onstage at Disrupt SF 2019&#8217;s Startup Battlefield</a>, where they explained the difficulty faced by the drug discovery industry, basically that they come up with lots of <em>theoretical</em> treatments but can&#8217;t actually make the molecules.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s system enters play when you have some exotic new compound you want to make in order to test it in real life, but don&#8217;t know how to make it. After all, these molecules are brand new to science — no one has created them before, so why should anyone know? Molecule.one creates a workflow starting with ordinary off-the-shelf chemicals and provides step by step instructions using known methods of how to go from A to B&#8230; and to C, D and so on (it&#8217;s rarely simple).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company leverages machine learning and a large body of knowledge about chemical reactions to create these processes, though as CSO Stanisław Jastrzębski explained, they do it backwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Synthesis planning can be characterized as a game,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In each move of this game, instead of moving a piece on a board, we break a chemical bond between a pair of atoms. The goal of the game is to break down a target molecule to molecules that can then be bought on the market and used to synthesize the target. We use algorithms similar to the ones used by DeepMind to master Go or chess to find the synthesis pathway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Co-founders Piotr Byrski and Paweł Włodarczyk-Pruszyński note that predicting organic reactions is no cakewalk, and that they have dedicated a great deal of resources toward making their system efficient and verifiable. The theoretical pathways they produce seem plausible but still need to be tested, something they do regularly internally so companies see that Molecule.one isn&#8217;t just selling good ideas but workable ones.</p>
<p>Since their debut at Disrupt, the company has acquired a number of customers with annual contracts, Byrski said, and rolled out lots of features on the platform. Włodarczyk-Pruszyński said that their efficiency has increased as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our system has matured and we have extended our platform to support planning synthesis for thousands of molecules per hour,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This feature is incredibly useful when combined with AI systems for drug discovery that generate huge numbers of candidate drug molecules. All these improvements helped us gain trust in the industry and initiate collaborations with relevant parties.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly the problem becomes one of scaling as your customers start asking about pathways for hundreds of thousands of possible therapeutic molecules rather than a handful. For them, if they are to bear the manufacturing cost, it&#8217;s worth the outlay at the start to see if one of the compounds they&#8217;re looking at is considerably easier to make than another with a similar effect. Without simulating the entire process that&#8217;s difficult to say for sure, so they can just send the list to Molecule.one and get the report back a few days later.</p>

<p>The team can&#8217;t share any of their customers&#8217; successes (though presumably there have been some) because of course all this work is highly confidential. But they did say that like many companies in biotech they are doing what they can to support COVID-related therapies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We <a href="https://molecule.one/covid19">made part of our platform free</a> to eligible researchers working on COVID drug discovery. This has resulted in a lasting collaboration with the <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/exascale-search-of-molecules/">LambdaZero project at MILA</a>, which is advised by Prof. Yoshua Bengio,&#8221; said Byrski.</p>
<p>This also offered the opportunity to test their new scaling methods, since for such a project many candidate molecules must be evaluated, not just for efficacy but the capability of being manufactured easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are incredibly excited about this area in general because it enables traversing novel regions of the chemical space, which offers enormous promise in terms of looking for drugs that have not yet been synthesized,&#8221; Byrski said.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by Atmos Ventures, with a long list of participating investors: AME Cloud Ventures, Cherubic Ventures, Firlej Kastory, Inventures, Luminous Ventures, Sunfish Partners, and individuals including Bayer executive Sebastian Guth.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the money to expand the team and continue expanding generally; it also has a plan to open new offices in the U.S. and Western Europe (they&#8217;re based in Poland).</p>
