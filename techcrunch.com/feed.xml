										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vega.xyz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vega</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that is building a decentralized protocol for creating and trading on derivatives markets, has raised $5 million in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrington Capital and Cumberland DRW co-led the round, which also included participation from Coinbase Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Signum Capital, CMT Digital, CMS Holdings, Three Commas and a slew of others. The new investment brings Vega’s total funding raised to over $10 million, according to Crunchbase </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vega-protocol"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vega Founder Barney Mannerings launched the Vega project in 2018 with the mission of giving anyone the ability to create and launch a derivatives market. The company claims that by eliminating centralized gatekeepers and decentralizing governance, it can allow for instant settlement, remove conflict of interest from markets, reduce fees, and enable the throughput necessary for high-volume derivatives trading. In short, it claims to be realizing the promise of blockchain technology applied to financial business models, which is mostly around eliminating operators sitting in the middle that essentially profit mainly by passing money from one party to another.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;By allowing anyone to create and launch a derivatives market, we aim to give people the tools they need to hedge risks unique to their region, profession, or situation,&#8221; Mannerings said. &#8220;Derivatives trading has been a pillar of traditional finance for a long time, but DeFi has not been able to achieve the capital efficiency and throughput required to make decentralized derivatives trading viable, until now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Vega is still under development. The startup launched its &#8216;t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">estnet&#8217; (a testing version of its network, as the name implies) in the second quarter of 2020 and has had a number of iterations since.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services/embed/#?secret=AZWRM9V7iZ" data-secret="AZWRM9V7iZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital on resources “to ship and test high quality code,” among other things. This summer, Vega is gearing up to launch a “mainnet ready” release of its protocol code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, Mannerings said the company expects to see the first validators launch a Vega network that plugs into the Ethereum mainnet for the first time, allowing trading of real crypto assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company’s wallet software that is required to access the testnet is free and open sourced, meaning that anyone can download to create a wallet and use the testnet. Vega has so far given out around 500 IDs for its hosted wallet, which allows people to use testnet without running the wallet themselves. There have been other IDs created, but the company has not been able to track just how many.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anjan Vinod, investment analyst at investor ParaFi Capital, said his firm is both a DeFi investor and user and as such, has been monitoring the evolution of new blockchain-based financial primitives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The multi-trillion dollar derivatives market has been a missing piece in the core DeFi stack,” he wrote via email. “Leveraging a proof of stake protocol, integrated liquidity incentives, and permissionless market creation, Vega is bringing a novel and first-principles approach to decentralized derivatives. Vega disrupts the intermediaries traditionally controlling market creation, settlement, collateral management, and pricing in the derivatives market.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Trading platforms are being valued more like high-margin video games than software stocks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid all the news of the last few days, you might have missed that <a href="https://www.etoro.com/">eToro</a>, an Israeli consumer stock-trading service, is going public in the United States via a SPAC.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about the SPAC bit: If you want a rundown of the deal itself, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/trading-platform-etoro-to-go-public-via-spac-merger-in-10b-deal/">Mary Ann has you covered</a>. What matters for our purposes is that eToro competes with Robinhood in the United States, though it retains a strong European user base. And, thanks to the fact that it is SPACing itself onto the public markets, we now have lots of its financial data to play with.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>You can see where we&#8217;re going with this. With Robinhood somewhere between a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/business/robinhood-gamestop.html">sheaf of lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/robinhood-hires-google-veteran-to-lead-product-ahead-of-ipo.html">an IPO</a>, the eToro data could provide an interesting insight into the world in which its zero-cost trading competitor operates. If we want to better understand Robinhood, perhaps eToro can provide some clarity.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We&#8217;re going into the eToro investor deck, first asking ourselves what we think of its numbers and financial health and valuation. Then we&#8217;ll compare what we learned against what we know about Robinhood&#8217;s own business. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>eToro is going public</h2>
<p>The eToro-SPAC deal is a big one, weighing in at over $10 billion in calculated value. Whether the markets will support the valuation isn&#8217;t clear, but the debut matters for the Israeli startup market and the returns of a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/etoro/company_financials">goodly number</a> of venture capitalists and other capital pools.</p>
<p>What do its SPAC-backers see in eToro that could be worth so much? Let&#8217;s get into the deck, which you can open up <a href="https://www.etoro.com/wp-content/uploads/investors/eToro-Investor-Presentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>To illustrate both its recent growth and also how relaxed the rules are on what companies can share in their SPAC presentations, eToro has included its full-year 2020 results and its January 2021 results. Why? Because, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/as-coinbase-looks-to-list-robinhood-rides-the-crypto-boom/">like Robinhood and others</a>, it had a big start to the year. So, eToro wants to show off how well.</p>
<p>For example, this chart shows that eToro had a good 2020, and an <em>incredible</em> start to 2021:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2126922 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-8.56.29-AM.png" alt="" width="430" height="308" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-8.56.29-AM.png 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-8.56.29-AM.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-8.56.29-AM.png?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-18-at-8.56.29-AM.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" />Impressive, right? eToro later breaks the 2020/2021 split into numbers, noting that it recorded an average of 192,000 registrations per month in 2019, 440,000 per month in 2020, and 1.223 million in January 2021. The implication the company is trying to impart on investors is obvious: If you like our past growth, just look at what this teaser 2021 data point could mean!<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon is expanding customer deliveries via electric cargo vehicle to San Francisco, making the Bay Area the second of 16 total cities the company expects to bring its Rivian-sourced EVs to in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco&#8217;s unique terrain and climate were a couple of the reasons Amazon said it chose the city for its second round of testing. Its EVs, which were designed and built in partnership with Rivian, can last up to 150 miles on a single charge. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/amazon-begins-testing-customer-deliveries-using-rivian-electric-vans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon began testing its electric delivery van in Los Angeles in early February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of its Climate Pledge, which involves the purchase of 100,000 custom electric delivery vehicles. The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/amazon-debuts-its-first-fully-electric-delivery-vehicle-created-in-partnership-with-rivian/">unveiled the vans last October</a>, and has said it aims to have 10,000 of the vehicles operational by next year. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bay Area deliveries will initially come out of Amazon&#8217;s station in Richmond, California, just one of the many delivery stations the e-commerce giant is redesigning to service its new fleet of EVs. A recent $200 million investment into a new delivery station in the heart of San Francisco signals Amazon’s push to significantly increase deliveries in the city. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From what we&#8217;ve seen, this is one of the fastest modern commercial electrification programs, and we’re incredibly proud of that,” said Ross Rachey, director of Amazon’s global fleet and products in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon isn’t the only company to recognize the logic behind electrifying delivery fleets for short trips within cities: DHL says zero-emission vehicles already make up 20% of its fleet, UPS has placed an order for 10,000 EVs and FedEx has pledged to replace 100% of its fleet with electric vehicles by 2040. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In cybersecurity, nothing is &#8220;unhackable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security bugs are an unavoidable consequence of an online world, but how companies receive and respond to hackers can make or break them. Get it right, and you build bonds with the security and hacker community and improve your security by fixing flaws before malicious actors do. Get it wrong — well, you can imagine the rest.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re thrilled that Katie Moussouris, founder and chief executive at Luta Security, will give a crash course in bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure programs at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage 2021</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moussouris is a pioneer and one of the leading experts in vulnerability disclosure, and has helped some of the largest companies and government departments — from Microsoft to the Pentagon — change how they respond to hackers and security researchers. This cultural shift helped transform the security industry, creating a way for hackers to find, report and get paid for the vulnerabilities they find, while carving out an entire industry dedicated to helping to crowdsource and coordinate security fixes.</p>
<p>In 2016, Moussouris founded Luta Security to advise companies and governments on the benefits of security research and how to build and improve their vulnerability disclosure programs.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">TC Early Stage</a> session, you will hear the good, the bad and the ugly that startups will face when managing vulnerability disclosures.</p>
<p>Moussouris joins a growing list of speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=melissabradleypost">TC Early Stage</a>, an event packed with breakout sessions focused on all the core competencies that a startup needs to be successful.

		David Edmonson is vice president of State Policy and Government Relations at <a href="http://technet.org/">TechNet</a>, the national network of technology companies that promotes the growth of the innovation economy through bipartisan advocacy at the federal and state level in all 50 states.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">American tech companies are engaged in a worldwide competition for top talent that can pick and choose where they want to live or where they want to launch the next great startup. With the expansion of remote work and tech talent spread across the country, there are larger amounts of venture capital investment and opportunity available to companies. States should enact policies that embrace businesses and are welcoming for entrepreneurs and employees. However, far too many states are doing the opposite and trying to enact anti-equality legislation that will hurt business.</p>
<p>There are a number of states that are currently considering anti-LGBTQ legislation, including Montana, Texas, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Missouri, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, North Dakota, Mississippi and Alabama. These bills would cause irrevocable harm to tech employees and their families who may already be marginalized and susceptible to harassment.</p>
<p>The tech industry should therefore be more vigilant than ever in opposing discriminatory state-level legislation that would target workers and their families, become an economic liability, and negatively impact businesses’ ability to recruit and retain the best and brightest employees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Anti-LGBTQ bills are not just harmful on the human level, they’re bad economics, as well.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Tech employees want to know that they will be treated fairly as they move through their daily lives and that they, their colleagues and their families are protected from discrimination. And tech companies want to do business in states where they can recruit top talent to promote innovation. Laws that discriminate are a major barrier to that effort.</p>
<p>And states that care about the growth of their innovation economies should not erect institutional barriers to opportunity and make it harder to convince people to call their state home.</p>
<p>Anti-LGBTQ bills are not just harmful on the human level, they’re bad economics, as well.  As states struggle to rebuild their economies post-pandemic, anti-LGBTQ legislation would negatively affect travel, tourism and business investments.</p>
<p>There is precedence. When North Carolina passed a law banning transgender people from using public restrooms in 2016, it cost the state approximately $630 million in less than a year, and 2,000 new jobs were lost due to halted corporate investments. In Indiana, citing a dangerous <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2015/03/28/angies-list-canceling-eastside-expansion-rfra/70590738/">anti-LGBTQ law</a>, Indianapolis-based Angie’s List froze a $40 million, 1,000-job expansion. Visit Indy found that the <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2016/01/25/official-rfra-cost-indy-up-12-conventions-and-60m/79328422/">state lost</a> at least 12 conventions and $60 million in revenue after the passage of the legislation.</p>
<p>In Arizona, an economic development <a href="https://tucson.com/business/boycott-over-sb-cost-ariz-million-in-convention-business-study/article_1a966732-f33b-11df-814c-001cc4c03286.html">study</a> estimated potential economic damage of more than $140 million in lost meetings and conventions over three years after passage of a bill that was hostile to LGBTQ people and subsequently vetoed by their governor.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why TechNet, on behalf of our <a href="http://technet.org/membership/members">member companies</a>, recently spoke out against proposed anti-LGBTQ legislation in Montana, New Hampshire and elsewhere, making the case that welcoming, inclusive states are now 21st century economic imperatives. We plan to do so in any state that proposes similar discriminatory legislation.</p>
<p>We recognize the work these states have done to help the technology sector grow and be competitive in a national and global economy, but we caution legislators from doing anything that would make it more challenging to compete for the talented and highly educated workers many companies are looking to hire.</p>
<p>Businesses — and states — thrive when they are open to everyone. LGBTQ people are our family members, friends, co-workers, neighbors and community leaders. They deserve the same rights and opportunities.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Montana, Tennessee and elsewhere are preparing to send unconscionable anti-LGBTQ bills to their governors shortly for signing. We strongly encourage state lawmakers to reject these extreme proposals to ban the LGBTQ community from fully participating in all aspects of society.</p>
<p>The technology industry will continue to take a strong public stance in opposing these bills, as they would be immensely harmful to our families, our employees, and the communities in which we thrive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nvidia’s cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/">GeForce Now</a> has announced <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/03/18/geforce-now-priority/">some changes</a> when it comes to subscription plans. Starting today, paid memberships now cost $9.99 per month, or $99.99 per year — they are now called ‘Priority’ memberships.</p>
<p>If you’re an existing ‘Founders’ member, you’ll keep the same subscription price as long as you remain a subscriber. If you stop your subscription at any point, you won’t be able to pay $5 per month again.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/nvidia-officially-launches-cloud-gaming-service-geforce-now-for-5-per-month/">Last year</a>, when Nvidia originally introduced paid plans for GeForce Now, the company was pretty transparent with its user base. You could pay $4.99 per month to access the Founders edition, but the company was going to raise the subscription fee at some point. And it sounds like Nvidia has made up its mind and thinks the paid subscription is worth $9.99 per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you’re not familiar with GeForce Now, it lets you start a game on a powerful gaming PC in a data center near you. You get a video stream on your computer, mobile phone, tablet or TV of the game running in a data center — GeForce Now uses a web app on iOS and iPadOS and is available on a limited number of Android TV devices. When you press a button on your controller, the action is relayed to the server so that you can interact with the game. All of this happens in tens of milliseconds, making it one of the smoothest cloud gaming experience available right now.</p>
<p>Compared to Google Stadia and Amazon Luna, Nvidia isn’t starting its own game store. GeForce Now customers launch games that they already own. The platform supports Steam, Epic Games, GOG.com and Ubisoft’s launcher.</p>
<p>Game publishers have to opt in to GeForce Now, which means that you can’t launch <em>all</em> your games that you own in your Steam library. Right now, GeForce Now supports around 800 games that you can find <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/games/">on this page</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to try GeForce Now, you can start playing for free. Nvidia offers a free membership that should be considered as a free trial. First, you have to wait in a queue until a free server is available —&nbsp;it can take five, ten of fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>After that, you’re limited to one-hour sessions. When you’ve played for an hour, you’re kicked out of the server. You can still start the game again, but you’ll have to go through the queue one more time.</p>
<p>If you become a paid member, games start nearly instantly and you can play up to six hours at a time. Similarly, you can start the game instantly after your six hours are up. Paid members also get RTX-enabled graphics.</p>
<p>When it comes to specifications, Nvidia has several configurations with different CPUs, graphic cards and RAM. If you play Fortnite, you might not get the best rig as you can get very high graphics on a medium-range PC. But if you launch Cyberpunk 2077, the service tries to prioritize better rigs.</p>
<p>Nvidia says it has attracted nearly 10 million users for its cloud gaming service. It’s unclear how many of them are paying for a subscription.</p>
<p>The company doubled the number of data centers in the last year. There are now more than 20 data centers operated by Nvidia or local partners. The company plans to expand capacity in existing data centers, add new data centers in Phoenix, Montreal and Australia.</p>
<p>There will be some quality-of-life updates as well, such as the ability to link games with your account to make it easier to launch them and more aggressive preloading of games.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B payments space has been on fire for a while, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only fueled mass adoption of digitizing finances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In regions like Latin America, the need for innovation in the sector is even more paramount than in the United States with so many people still relying on outdated processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Mexico City-based startup, <a href="http://www.higo.io">Higo.io</a>, is out to transform B2B payments for SMBs (small and medium-sized businesses) in Latin America, starting with its home country.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodolfo Corcuera, Juan José Fernández and Daniel Tamayo founded the company in January 2020, recognizing that the process of paying vendors for business owners is largely “manual and cumbersome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Mexico, small businesses mostly handle payables with nothing more than spreadsheets and email and legacy bank accounts,” CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodolfo-corcuera-meier-58377844/">Corcuera</a> said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio formed Higo to automate processes and provide visibility into cash flow, particularly for small businesses. “Informal” businesses make up about 23% of Mexico’s GDP, according to data from <a href="https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/saladeprensa/boletines/2019/especiales/ENAPROCE2018.pdf">INEGI</a>, the government&#8217;s National Institute of Statistics and Geography. Higo launched its SaaS platform last November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now the startup has raised $3.3 million from a group of U.S.-based investors including Homebrew (which led the round), Susa Ventures, Haystack and J Ventures. The financing is the latest in a string of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/mexico-city-based-pay-on-demand-startup-minu-nabs-14m-series-a/">fintech-related fundings</a> in Mexico that TechCrunch has covered as of late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higo wants shake up the payments scene in the region by creating an alternative to traditional banking for businesses to pay each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to build the Venmo for B2B payments in Latin America,” Corcuera told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the goal is to help SMB owners deal less with tedious tasks and more on generating revenues and profits for their businesses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers so far include hundreds of small business owners and the company aims to have “thousands” of customers by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“E-invoicing is ubiquitous in the States and in the U.S., receiving a PDF invoice is enough,” Corcuera told TechCrunch. “But in Mexico, it has to be electronic to be [tax] <a href="https://www.sat.gob.mx/ordenamiento/18355/ley-del-impuesto-sobre-la-renta">deductible by law</a>. With our platform, invoices are automatically populated so businesses can have visibility into what has to be paid, what vendors they owe and when they owe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corcuera is no stranger to running companies, having launched a housecleaning marketplace at the age of 23 in 2013. He also founded Tandem, an office management platform, in 2018, to help office managers streamline their procurement needs. As is often the case for founders, it was during the process of growing that company that Corcuera realized how painful and time consuming it was for businesses to manage their payables and receivables. That led him to come up with the concept behind Higo.io. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallardo was previously COO at Swap, a Mexican challenger bank, and also was one of the founding members of Uber’s Mexican operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Higo plans to use its new capital </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in part to boost its six-person staff, particularly beefing up its engineering team so that it can “scale as fast as possible,” according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corcuera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the company&#8217;s efforts are focused exclusively on the Mexican market, which in of itself is huge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Later we will expand in Latin America. We see a very clear opportunity in similar markets across the region,&#8221; Corcuera said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebrew Partner Satya Patel said his San Francisco-based VC firm believes there’s a massive opportunity in Latin America given the move to digital payments. The investment in Higo marks Homebrew’s third in the region in the past 18 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an exceptional team focused on a problem that is visceral for businesses in Mexico in particular,” Patel told TechCrunch. “They are able to provide businesses with a real-time view of their cash flow and working capital.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.openreel.com">OpenReel</a>, a startup that makes it easier for teams to record videos remotely, has raised $19 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>CEO Lee Firestone told me that he and CTO Joe Mathew first started a video agency together, but when they were given &#8220;a pretty significant project&#8221; that involved remote production, they weren&#8217;t satisfied with any of the existing solutions and ended up &#8220;spending over a year to build this technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of teams that have figured out their own approach to remote video production, particularly in the past year. (Here at TechCrunch, it&#8217;s mostly involved shipping cameras and lights to writers, followed by lots of tech troubleshooting conversations.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But OpenReel&#8217;s &#8220;remote camera&#8221; technology is supposed to make the process much simpler, while also giving production members more control. The software allows a remote director to control a webcam or mobile device, along with up to four people recording and four people viewing the shoot in real time. The footage (which can be 4K quality) is stored locally, then automatically uploaded after the shoot. And it supports additional features like a teleprompter.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you talk to our clients &#8230; they would have had to put together multiple different pieces of technology, shipping or not shipping things, and even with all that, they would not have gotten the quality and seamless experience for both sides,&#8221; Firestone said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u2VtcHhbLb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/video-creation-and-editing-platform-invideo-raises-15-million/">Video creation and editing platform InVideo raises $15 million</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Video creation and editing platform InVideo raises $15 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/video-creation-and-editing-platform-invideo-raises-15-million/embed/#?secret=u2VtcHhbLb" data-secret="u2VtcHhbLb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Not surprisingly, demand grew dramatically in 2020, with Firestone recalling that the platform went from supporting &#8220;thousands of video shoots a year&#8221; to &#8220;10 or 20 times that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, the company said that annual recurring revenue has increased 12x over the past year as clients like Dell, HubSpot, ViacomCBS and TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company Verizon Media have used it to record things like marketing videos, internal communications, customer testimonials and more. It has more than 200 enterprise clients, as well as &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of small and medium business customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a pent up demand for content in these organizations that our technology &#8230; unlocks,&#8221; Firestone said. And he doesn&#8217;t anticipate that changing as in-person filming becomes safer post-pandemic.</p>
<p>The Series A comes from Five Elms Capital, bringing OpenReel&#8217;s total funding — debt and equity — to $23.9 million. Firestone said the money will allow the company to develop new product features (one possibility: support for livestreamed videos, rather than just pre-recorded footage), as well as continued global growth, after an international push last year that saw the platform launching across 125 countries.</p>
<p>“Five Elms loves investing in businesses that challenge the old way of doing things, and OpenReel does just that,&#8221; said Five Elms&#8217; Thomas Kershisnik in a statement. “OpenReel has proven itself as an important component of the remote technology stack as well as a vital tool in the broader content creation toolbox empowering enterprises to enhance their content and create more of it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before we get too far into this week’s roundup, I want to kick things off with an interview we haven’t published anywhere else. Earlier this week,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/ford-expands-robotics-research-with-75-million-u-m-facility/"> we noted that Ford will be deploying some 100 researchers and engineers</a> to the new $75 million facility at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>The automaker told TechCrunch the set up is not an incubator, so much as “an extension of our global research and advanced engineering network.” Beyond the autonomous driving research, the company will be devoting a lot of research to how it can use third-party robots like Boston Dynamics’ Spot and Agility’s Digit, the latter of which was the centerpiece to a partnership <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/05/agilitys-two-legged-robot-digit-is-for-sale-and-ford-is-the-first-customer/">Ford announced a couple of CESes ago.</a></p>
<p>Currently, the company currently has two Digit robots, purchasing the first two commercial units. Based on how the partnership pans out, Agility could, perhaps, be a prime acquisition target for a company more actively engaged with the robotics community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shortly after the event wrapped up, we hopped on the phone with Ford’s Technical Expert Mario Santillo, who will help head up the expanded robotics efforts. Some highlights below.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1831007" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1831007" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1831007" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Agility-GIF-1.gif" alt="Ford Agility Robotics" width="700" height="394" /><p id="caption-attachment-1831007" class="wp-caption-text">Ford is partnering with startup Agility Robotics to research and test the use of is bipedal Digit robot. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford/Agility Robotics</p></div></p>
<p><strong>What kind of work is Ford doing in robotics, beyond the autonomous driving space?</strong></p>
<p>We’re really looking at all area of robotics. My team is focused anywhere from the manufacturing environment to more customer-facing applications, like Digit getting out of some delivery vehicle to deliver a package to your doorstop. Working with University of Michigan, they’re really looking for us to provide better use cases. We would like to &#8212; not necessarily develop the robots &#8212; but use robots like Digit or Spot to make them smarter and deliver things that Ford really cares about and to ultimately help humanity.</p>
<p><strong>How close are you actually working with the team at Agility?</strong></p>
<p>We’re working very closely. We’re in almost daily stand-ups in terms of getting everything up and running. We just got our Digit in Dearborn, just a couple of months ago. We have another Digit, which is sitting out in Palo Alto, so they’re a little ahead of us, in terms of actually getting real use cases. We work very well with Agility Robotics. There’s nothing hidden from either side. We just want to come together in a partnership and similar to the University of Michigan, we want to come together to make this thing better, useful and safe.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of the actual research, what role does the university play?</strong></p>
<p>The university is starting with the teaching of the next generation of roboticist, so that’s a huge role. The work they’re doing really spans all areas of robotics: air, land, sea, space, you name it. It’s amazing to see how interconnected things are. The walking lab, they’re specifically focusing on doing rehabilitation robotics, and that can directly lead into our Digit being more capable walking over rough terrain.</p>

<p><strong>For the moment, Digit is a primary focus.</strong></p>
<p>Digit is a clear, direct link, but Ford has a lot of wheeled robots, and a lot of work can feed into how we might better use these, based on research that’s going on at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>Is Ford actively looking into acquiring startups or technologies in the robotics space?</strong></p>
<p>I think Ford is always interested in evaluating new needs and companies as they come. I wouldn’t necessarily say, “no.”</p>

<p>Some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/using-cameras-and-ai-to-help-exoskeletons-adapt-to-their-environment/">cool research coming out of the University of Waterloo in Canada</a>, where a team of researchers are exploring wearable cameras and machine learning to help robotic exoskeletons and prosthetics interact more naturally with their users. Per one of the researchers, “Our control approach wouldn’t necessarily require human thought. Similar to autonomous cars that drive themselves, we’re designing autonomous exoskeletons that walk for themselves.”</p>

<p>A number of companies are currently producing exoskeletons for mobility and rehabilitation purposes. Work like this could be a key step toward removing the need for a smartphone app or other external control.</p>

<p>In fundraising news, Hai Robotics completed a “nearly” $15 million Series B+ that adds to the Series B it announced late last year. The Shenzhen-based producers of the Haipick shelving system are one of a number of Chinese logistics robotics manufactures worth following. The system is tall and skinny, capable of moving up to eight boxes at once.</p>
<p>The company says it’s capable of improving warehouse operating efficiency by up to 4x. Like a number of entrants in the category, the pandemic has proven a big opportunity, as more people turn to e-commerce and companies look toward automation to avoid unnecessary shutdowns.</p>

<p>And just because I’m excited about baseball happening again, the Red Sox announced that they’ll be deploying UV disinfecting robots at Fenway this year. At the moment, the team appears to have only purchased three robots from <a href="https://www.surfacide.com/">Surfacide</a> (also the legal name for the murder of a proprietary Microsoft tablet). So this will likely be a small part of a larger effort focused on, “disinfecting close quarters like team clubhouses, training rooms, as well as higher-traffic fan areas such as suites and restrooms.”</p>
<p>The robotic umpires, meanwhile, will have to wait a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/12/976383147/minor-league-baseball-to-experiment-with-robotic-umpires">while longer for their MLB debut</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The running line from any acquired company CEO is that the company can do so much more with resources of the company that acquired it than it could on its own. Just seven months after being acquired, <a href="http://drone.io">Drone</a>, co-founder Brad Rydzewski says that his company really has benefited greatly from being part of <a href="http://harness.io">Harness</a>, and today the company announced a significant overhaul of the open source project.</p>
<p>The artist formerly known as Drone is now called &#8216;Harness CI Community Edition&#8217; and Rydzewski says the Harness CEO and founder Jyoti Bansal kept his word when he said he was 100% committed to continue developing the open source Drone product.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past seven months since the acquisition, a lot of community work has been around taking advantage of the resources that Harness has been able to afford us as a project &#8212; like having access to a designer, having access to professional writers &#8212; these are luxuries for most open source projects,&#8221; Rydzewski told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that having access to these additional resources has enabled him to bring a higher level of polish to the project that just wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without joining Harness. At the same time, he says the CI team, which has grown from the project&#8217;s two co-founders to 15 people, has also been able to build out the professional CI tool as it has become part of the Harness toolset.</p>

<p>Chief among the updates to the community edition is a new sleeker interface that has a much more professional look and feel, according to Rydzewski. In addition, developers can see how projects move along the pipeline in a visualization tool, while benefiting from real-time debugging tools and new governance and security features.</p>
<p>All of this is an embarrassment of riches for Rydzewski, who was used to working on a shoestring budget prior to joining Harness. &#8220;Drone came from very humble beginnings as an open source project, but now I think it can hold its own next to any product in the market today, even products that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security compliance may not be the hottest conversation starter, but it&#8217;s a critical and often grueling process that companies have to endure every year to show that their security practices are up to par. It&#8217;s a burden that bogs down startups more than others, and so it&#8217;s fitting that startups are trying to find a better way.</p>
<p>Enter security compliance startup Secureframe, founded by Shrav Mehta and Natasja Nielsen, which thinks it has.</p>
<p>The company is announcing it has raised $18 million at Series A, led by Kleiner Perkins and with participation from Gradient Ventures and Base10 Partners, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/secureframe-raises-4-5m-to-help-businesses-speed-up-their-compliance-audits/">led its $4.5 million seed round</a> less than a year after it was founded in January 2020.</p>
<p>Secureframe helps businesses maintain two key cybersecurity certifications, SOC 2 and ISO 27001, which many companies require before they will do business. Secureframe&#8217;s compliance platform integrates with dozens of the most used cloud providers and apps to understand its customers&#8217; security posture. The benefit, the company says, is that it can help companies get their certifications and become compliant in weeks, rather than months.</p>
<p>Shrav Mehta, the company&#8217;s founder and chief executive, told TechCrunch that it&#8217;s paying off, with a tenfold increase in revenue growth over the six months alone, and with over a hundred new customers, like software house Hasura and Omni, a Y Combinator graduate from the summer 2020 batch.</p>
<p>Mehta said the fresh funding round will help the company grow beyond the two certifications into an enterprise-grade risk and compliance management platform, such as the U.S. health privacy rules like HIPAA, and PCI compliance for secure card processing.</p>
<p>In the long term, Mehta said, he wants the company to design and offer its own compliance certifications.</p>
<p>In remarks, Kleiner Perkins&#8217;s Josh Coyne said Secureframe is leading the effort to modernize security compliance. &#8220;Secureframe is turning the industry on its head by automating compliance certifications end-to-end, serving as the single source of truth for commercial compliance,&#8221; he said.</p>

The company, which reached unicorn valuation in its last funding, also updated its Flutter SDK with support for new languages.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;App monitoring platform Sentry gets $60 million Series D at $1 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/app-monitoring-platform-sentry-gets-60-million-series-d-at-1-billion-valuation/embed/#?secret=hQifk8c9kE" data-secret="hQifk8c9kE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sentry’s Performance Monitoring software is used by development teams to trace bugs and performance issues to poor-performing API calls, database queries and other potential causes. Sentry’s Flutter SDK, originally built in partnership with Google, now supports Kotlin, Java for Android, Swift, Objective-C for iOS and C/C++.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other new features for its Flutter SDK include the ability to symbolicate, or transform into a human-readable format, Flutter-obfuscated Android builds; capture breadcrumbs, or a detailed record of events that happened before an issue, for user interface events and HTTP requests; and fatal crash support and offline caching, so app developers still get reports even if a user’s device goes offline.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sentry chief executive officer Milin Desai said, &#8220;These additions further expand our footprint, ensuring that all developers have visibility into the impact of their code—from frontend to backend—closing the observability gap and ensuring superior user experiences across all platforms and frameworks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sentry is currently used by about 68,000 organizations around the world, who need to monitor the performance of their apps and fix bugs, like slow-loading pages, that frustrate users and result in lost revenue. Its customers include Atlassian, Cloudflare, Disney, GitHub and Microsoft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The team at Google’s Area 120 in-house incubator says the idea for <a href="https://www.threadit.area120.com/">ThreadIt</a> came well before COVID-19 made remote work a necessity for large swaths of the globe. Of course, the pandemic certainly accelerated interest in the product among the team behind it.</p>
<p>“It’s adjusted the lens through which everyone sees it,” Keller Smith, general manager and founder, ThreadIt, tells TechCrunch. “It was a trend that was growing even before COVID-19, but, of course, the whole world changed overnight.”</p>
<p>ThreadIt, <a href="https://blog.google/technology/area-120/how-we-built-new-tool-without-ever-meeting-person/">which launches today</a> as a browser-accessible service and Chrome plug-in, is an attempt to address a perceived hole in the market. The system, which allows users to record short video messages, is positioned to sit somewhere between long-form, live- video teleconferencing and short texts and emails.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The steps for getting started are pretty straightforward. You:</p>
<ol>
<li>Record yourself speaking (you can rerecord if you mess up the first time)</li>
<li>Shoot the video off to selected colleagues.</li>
</ol>
<p>The interface borrows some key features from other Google offerings, including a drop-down that lets you determine how recipients can interact with the video, be it just viewing or adding their own clip. The app threads together short videos, organizing things chronologically into a single video conversation. The team behind the app notes that it’s been dogfooding ThreadIt, having never actually met in person.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Wall Street needs to relax, as startups show remote work is here to stay&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/wall-street-needs-to-relax-because-remote-work-is-here-to-stay/embed/#?secret=btp8lXo8hb" data-secret="btp8lXo8hb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Certainly the zeitgeist is right. Remote work is going to continue to be a reality for many, even well after the pandemic has mercifully faded. And, of course, short-form video clips are once again having a moment. TikTok or Vine, for work, perhaps, only with more straightforward approach to making and watching short, informational video.</p>
<p>“We found that by adding a little bit of structure and allowing you to break it up and show little pieces of your work, that actually creates a much shorter message that’s much more on-point,” says Smith. “That was actually one gap we saw in what was out there today.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXyj4n_Q1to?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=5&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>The app, which is available to access starting today, is in kind of a public beta mode, as is Area 120’s custom. Essentially the team will gauge interest and collect feedback to see if the project is worth continuing to pursue. Services that have graduated include code education tool Grasshopper and travel app Touring Bird.</p>
<p>That means, among other things, that its still in early stage. As such, there are no doubt going to be a number of desired features that aren’t present. Having dealt with some health issues earlier this year that made speaking difficult, for instance, I would love to see a straight text-reply feature for those who can’t &#8212; or otherwise would prefer not to &#8212; appear on camera.</p>
<p>Deeper Google productivity app integration would make sense as well, though I suspect part of growing the app is deciding how much of a standalone to make it. Additional Gmail integration would be good, for example, but you don’t want to have to rely on that platform if the new app is designed to augment it.</p>
<p>The service can be accessed on smartphones via the mobile Chrome browser, but a standalone app would probably make sense down the road, as well. “That’s something that we would look at going forward,” says Smith. “That’s a great example of looking for the interest and response and then being able to go deeper with that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube Shorts, the company&#8217;s short-form video experience and TikTok rival, is launching today in the U.S. The feature allows creators to record, edit and share short-form video content that&#8217;s 60 seconds or less in length, optionally set to popular music. At launch, YouTube has deals with Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and Warner Chappell Music, Believe, Merlin, 300 Entertainment, Kobalt, Beggars, CD Baby, Empire, Peer, Reservoir, OneRPM and others.</p>
<p>Globally, YouTube has agreements with over 250 publishers and labels for use in the Shorts product, it says.</p>
<p>The YouTube Shorts product itself was first introduced in September and has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">beta testing in India</a> over the past several months, where it has since seen adoption triple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Though you may have already encountered the YouTube Shorts &#8220;shelf&#8221; on the YouTube homepage, the ability to create YouTube Shorts videos was not live in the U.S. until today.</p>
<p>The experience of filming content for YouTube Shorts is very much like TikTok.</p>
<p>Creators have access to tools stop and start recording short video segments with a tap, much like the leading short-form app. They can also select the video&#8217;s backing music or sound and utilize a small handful of in-app editing features. At launch, these include speed controls to slow or speed the audio, a countdown timer, text timing capabilities to make text appear on the screen at certain times and, soon after launch, color adjustment filters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126700" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126700" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126700" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png 2166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=1535,2048 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Text-timeline-3_4.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126700" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>But while YouTube Shorts has a clever tool that lets you select the part of the song you want to use in your video, it&#8217;s lacking the more intelligent automatic sound-syncing feature that makes TikTok so accessible for beginners. YouTube&#8217;s product also at launch lacks a large catalog of special effects &#8212; like the AR features or green-screen options found on TikTok. Instead, like Instagram Reels, the initial goal with Shorts is to simply lower the barrier to entry for users who want to create and publish short-form video content on an existing social platform.</p>
<p>On the viewer&#8217;s side, the TikTok comparisons are even more obvious.</p>
<p>Currently, the experience can be launched via the YouTube Shorts shelf on the YouTube homepage, which has already been live in some markets, and, soon, from a dedicated Shorts tab in the YouTube mobile app.</p>

<p>Once launched, you&#8217;ll be taken to a familiar full-screen vertical video experience where you can double-tap to like a video, tap into the comments or share the video with others. You can also subscribe to the creators&#8217; YouTube channel from Shorts, if you find their content interesting.</p>
<p>You can also tap on hashtags in YouTube Shorts that will take you to a page with other videos using the same hashtag. (This, to be clear, is separate from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/youtube-launches-hashtag-landing-pages-to-all-users/">the other YouTube hashtag pages announced recently</a>, which will host both longer-form and short-form content.)</p>

<p>Also like TikTok, you can tap on the music icon &#8212; in YouTube Shorts, a square icon, not a spinning record as on TikTok &#8212; to be taken to a page featuring that same sound. Here, you&#8217;ll find all the other Shorts using that sound and have the option to do the same.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126698" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126698" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126698" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?w=510" alt="" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png 2166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=1535,2048 1535w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Pivot-3_4.png?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126698" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>This &#8220;sound&#8221; could be a clip from a popular song, original audio or what YouTube calls &#8220;remixed&#8221; content. The latter refers to how Shorts creators can sample from other Shorts videos to make their own sounds. And, in the months to come, the company will expand this remixing capability across YouTube&#8217;s billions of longer-form videos. YouTube creators can choose to opt out of having their original audio remixed for Shorts&#8217; clips, but by doing so they may limit themselves from finding a new audience.</p>
<p>YouTube suggests creators could remix videos to show themselves reacting to their favorite jokes, trying a YouTuber&#8217;s recipe or re-enacting a comedic skit, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126701" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126701" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126701" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png 2166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=300,235 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=768,602 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=680,533 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=1536,1204 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=2048,1605 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Watch-Flexible.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126701" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>Since its launch in India, the YouTube Shorts player has passed 6.5 billion daily views globally. However, YouTube wouldn&#8217;t say how many creators had adopted the product, nor how many Shorts videos have been produced. But the Indian market is not representative of how Shorts may fare in the U.S. because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">the country banned TikTok last year</a>, helping to boost other short-form video apps as a result.</p>
<p>YouTube, of course, isn&#8217;t the first social platform to copy TikTok. Instagram and Snapchat have done the same with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/instagram-reels-launches-globally-in-over-50-countries-including-u-s/">Reels</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">Spotlight</a>, respectively. But in YouTube&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s even more critical to offer support for short-form video to stay relevant in a market where TikTok has become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/apple-releases-its-best-of-2020-app-store-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/">one of the most downloaded mobile apps</a> and a preferred tool for watching video content on mobile devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Shorts and short-form video has come to feel like a natural progression for YouTube,&#8221; noted YouTube&#8217;s Todd Sherman, the product lead for YouTube Shorts. &#8220;We&#8217;re the original user generated video platform. And that was really based around video that&#8217;s created on the desktop &#8212; digital cameras, desktop computers and video editing software. Now, we&#8217;re really keen to take a step forward into this new world of video that&#8217;s really native to the phone,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And it&#8217;s really important that we build this in partnership with the creator community&#8230;and for that matter, even more broadly, the same goes for viewers and our partners in the music industry,&#8221; Sherman adds.</p>
<p>The YouTube Shorts product is still considered a beta, as YouTube expects to iterate on the Shorts experience over time, and respond to user feedback as it develops new features.</p>
<p>Longer-term, YouTube believes Shorts will differentiate itself from others on the market by way of its connection to the larger YouTube platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a two-way door here where we&#8217;re building a short-form video ecosystem,&#8221; explains Sherman. &#8220;You can take a step forward into YouTube or even YouTube Music in the foreseeable future. And then from YouTube, you could also initiate creation into Shorts. That bridging of ecosystems, I think is an important part of this,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>So far, however, TikTok rivals have often seen creators simply repurposing their TikTok videos for use on other platforms &#8212; not developing original content for each of the three: TikTok, Reels and Spotlight.</p>
<p>YouTube Shorts&#8217; video creation tools will begin to roll out to U.S. users starting today, and will expand to all of the U.S. over the next several weeks, the company says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kosta Eleftheriou, a co-founder of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fleksy/">Fleksy</a> keyboard app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/pinterest-acquires-the-team-behind-fleksy-a-custom-ios-and-android-keyboard/">later sold to Pinterest</a> in an acqui-hire deal, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">has been calling attention to Apple App Store issues</a> like fake reviews, ratings and subscription scams, as well as malicious clone apps, after his own app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flicktype-watch-keyboard/id1359485719">FlickType</a>, was targeted by scammers. Now, the developer is taking the next step in his App Store crusade: he&#8217;s filing a lawsuit against Apple.</p>
<p>The suit, which the developer claims was filed Wednesday in California Superior Court in Santa Clara county, alleges that Apple enticed developers to build applications for its App Store &#8212; the only place iOS applications can be legally sold &#8212; by claiming it&#8217;s a safe and trustworthy place, but doesn&#8217;t protect legitimate app developers against scammers profiting from their hard work.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the suit says, Apple is disincentivized to do so because scammers are generating revenue for Apple via their use of subscriptions, which involve a revenue share with Apple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eleftheriou has been personally impacted by App Store scammers. He left a well-paying job at Pinterest to develop his FlickType app, an alternative swipe keyboard for Apple Watch. After its launch, the app targeted by copycat app makers who claim their apps offer the same feature set as FlickType does, but instead lock users into high priced subscriptions for their poorly designed software. They also flood their apps with fake ratings and reviews to make them appear to be a much better option when users are looking for an app in this space.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, FlickType sports a 3.5-star rating, as it&#8217;s often dinged for Apple Watch platform issues that are outside the developer&#8217;s control or missing features users want to call attention to. Eleftheriou engages with his app&#8217;s users, however &#8212; responding to complaints and letting users know when features they&#8217;ve requested were added or bugs have been fixed. Scammers simply buy enough 5-star reviews to keep their apps&#8217; overall ratings higher.</p>
<p>In other words, Eleftheriou is doing the hard work of being an App Store developer carving out a category for swipe keyboards for the Watch, but his potential income is being shifted over to scam apps who have a falsified App Store presence.</p>
<p>In years past, Apple took issues of app quality seriously. It worked to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/sneaky-subscriptions-are-plaguing-the-app-store/">clean up shady subscription apps</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/apple-goes-after-clones-and-spam-on-the-app-store/">remove clones and spam</a> from the App Store through regular sweeps. It even once went so far as to ban apps built using templates in an effort to raise the bar on app quality, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/apples-widened-ban-on-templated-apps-is-wiping-small-businesses-from-the-app-store/">which angered small businesses</a> who didn&#8217;t have the resources or funds to build more professional apps. (Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/apple-revises-its-controversial-guidelines-on-template-based-apps/">later revised its policy</a> to be more equitable.)</p>
<p>But the new lawsuit alleges that Apple is now doing little to police scammers&#8217; apps because it profits from developer misconduct. Eleftheriou also notes he has raised these issues to Apple via his company KPAW, LLC, but Apple did &#8220;next to nothing&#8221; to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou&#8217;s story is even more complicated, though, because his app was rejected from the App Store numerous times after meeting with Apple special projects manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/randymarsden/">Randy Marsden</a> over a possible acquisition. He tells TechCrunch numbers were discussed with Apple and his meetings had included a Director and a VP, among others. Apple was considering turning FlickType into an Apple Watch feature, the lawsuit notes.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, FlickType was pulled from the App Store over App Store Review Guidelines violations, even as a competitor&#8217;s app was approved. Eleftheriou appealed for his app through Developer Relations but was given no guidance on how to prevent the same problem in the future, he said.</p>
<p>Over the months that followed, FlickType continued to face rejections from App Store Review. Apple&#8217;s App Store Review said that the app offered a &#8220;poor user experience,&#8221; even though tech journalists at numerous outlets had praised it, and Apple had once considering buying it. App Review also told the developer that &#8220;full keyboard apps are not appropriate for Apple Watch,&#8221; while it continued to allow competitors to publish their own keyboard apps.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s App Review team also allowed third-party apps that were running FlickType&#8217;s integratable version of the keyboard to be approved without issues. These included Watch apps like Nano for Reddit, Chirp for Twitter, WatchChat for WhatsApp, and Lens for Instagram.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>After Apple approved FlickType in January 2020, the company claims it had already lost over a year of revenue to competitor keyboards that were not constantly being rejected. Nevertheless, FlickType reached the App Store&#8217;s Top 10 Paid app list and generated $130,000 in its first month. As a result of its success, it was quickly targeted by scammers who launched watered down, barely usable competitors to the app, cutting into FlickType&#8217;s revenue. FlickType&#8217;s revenue dropped to just $20,000 per month. The competitors were also using fake ratings to get their app boosted and installed by unsuspecting users.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou&#8217;s story was not unique, as it turned out. In recent months, he <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/12/developer-reveals-fake-app-store-reviews-and-scams/">has been documenting</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype">the App Store&#8217;s multimillion-dollar scams</a>, including those he was facing as well as others brought to his attention by developers with similar struggles. Apple, in some cases, would take action against the scammers he highlighted on social media. In other cases, it would not. And it would sometimes only take down one of the developer&#8217;s scam apps, but allow <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-removes-300kmonth-scam-app-developer-still-large">others under the same developer account</a> to continue to operate.</p>
<p>The new lawsuit aims to hold Apple accountable for the issues Eleftheriou faced by asking Apple to restore his lost revenue and pay out any other damages awarded by the court.</p>
<p>Apple has not responded for a request for comment at this time.</p>
<p>A copy of the lawsuit is below. It is not yet appearing in public record searches for verification purposes. We&#8217;ll follow up to confirm when the case appears online and update accordingly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Five years ago, entrepreneur <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielsommer/">Dan Sommer</a> bet big on the adult learning space when he was building out Trilogy Education, an online and in-person bootcamp in collaboration with universities to train workforces on the latest tech skills.</p>
<p>In 2019, Sommer sold that company for $750 million to 2U in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/2u-trilogy/">one of the largest edtech exits</a> to date. And today, Sommer is launching a new venture-backed startup in education that goes a few steps earlier in the learning journey: high school.</p>
<p><a href="https://edgepathways.com/">Edge Pathways</a> is a for-credit, first-year program built in collaboration with universities to help aspiring engineers navigate entrance into the confusing, and often intimidating, field of science, technology and education. Along with launching to the public today, Edge Pathways announced it has raised 8 million in a seed round led by First Round Capital, Emerge Education, Rethink Education and 2U. First Round Capital’s Bill Trenchard will take a seat on Edge Pathway’s board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of helping employed techies stay sharp, Sommer’s new startup is helping aspiring techies get a degree in the first place. When asked what changed between his two startups, he says it boils down to one single insight: the point in which a founder has to start helping support students to be ultimately successful.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Online university degree provider 2U acquires Trilogy for $750M to expand into tech bootcamps and training&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/2u-trilogy/embed/#?secret=7wpSPI2oeB" data-secret="7wpSPI2oeB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“A lot of companies over the last two years are looking to group talent and looking at the old class of engineers,” Sommer said. “Starting earlier in this stage of the process is a way to help resolve the skills gap and help capture more students at a time when they’re impressionable, willing to learn and willing to support new kinds of pathways.”</p>
<p>Edge Pathways helps schools offer a program for credit that replaces the first year of college. Inspired by co-op programs at Drexel and Northeastern, Edge connects students to project-based learning and internship opportunities to replace a traditional lecture-style education. The startup is ultimately a services provider to colleges that want to open their doors to incoming engineering students.</p>
<p>Edge Pathways is more than a trial-run at college since it is for credit. To help colleges, the key stakeholder for Edge, stay happy, that means that the startup lets institutions make decisions on which students get admitted to the program, which faculty are involved and how the curriculum is created. Edge’s involvement is simply in the execution and daily support.</p>
<p>After the first year is completed, Edge stays with students to provide coaching and job opportunities throughout the college experience.</p>
<p>For the program, the startup charges students around $15,000, slightly lower than the price of in-state tuition. <a href="https://dcmathpathways.org/sites/default/files/resources/2017-03/STEM%20Attrition-%20College%20Students%E2%80%99%20Paths%20Into%20and%20Out%20of%20STEM%20Fields.pdf">As numerous studies have shown</a>, attrition rates in STEM fields are high due to changing majors or leaving the degree as a whole, which doesn’t help the some 3.5 million job openings out there for engineers, Sommer tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Edge’s largest challenge will likely be finding product-market fit with consumers. While it has created a curriculum in tandem with colleges, the startup needs to make sure the program fits a student&#8217;s wants and needs too &#8212; and those key decisions shouldn’t be without its end-customer in the room. Sommers, naturally, is optimistic that he’s on to something.</p>
<p>“So many students, particularly today, don’t see the relevance of what they’re learning in the classroom and don’t see how it ties into the world,” he said. “It’s hard to make that connection, so we designed a model to help universities support this gap.”</p>
<p>The other large challenge ahead for Edge is finding universities to work with. Sommer declined to share information about its inaugural partner, but said he will announce it “very soon.” Notably, the founder thinks early adopters will be transfer institutions because about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK368175/">40% of students that get STEM degrees are transfer students. </a></p>
<p>“So many institutions today are really focused on the transient population of students,” he said. Edge hopes to “support more students through these hard disciplines, through hard subjects, and give them a reason to have inspiration.”</p>
<p>It’s an ambitious play, but by weeding out the weed-out classes themselves, Edge could make a big difference in the opportunity some students see for themselves in the world of STEM.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://securityscorecard.com/">SecurityScorecard</a> has been helping companies understand the security risk of its vendors since 2014 by providing each one with a letter grade based on a number of dimensions. Today, the company announced a $180 million Series E.</p>
<p>The round includes new investors Silver Lake Waterman, T. Rowe Price, Kayne Anderson Rudnick, and Fitch Venture along with existing investors Evolution Equity Partners, Accomplice, Riverwood Capital, Intel Capital, NGP Capital, AXA Venture Partners, GV (Google Ventures) and Boldstart Ventures. The company reports it has now raised $290 million.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Aleksandr Yampolskiy says the company&#8217;s mission has not changed since it launched. &#8220;The idea that we started the company was a realization that when I was CISO and CTO I had no metrics at my disposal. I invested in all kinds of solutions where I was completely in the dark about how I&#8217;m doing compared to the industry and how my vendors and suppliers were doing compared to me,&#8221; Yampolskiy told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He and his co-founder COO Sam Kassoumeh likened this to a banker looking at a mortgage application and having no credit score to check. The company changed that by starting a system of scoring the security posture of different companies and giving them a letter grade of A-F just like at school.</p>
<p>Today, it has ratings on more than 2 million companies worldwide, giving companies a way to understand how secure their vendors are. Yampolskiy says that his company&#8217;s solution can rate a new company not in the data set in just five minutes. Every company can see its own scorecard for free along with advice on how to improve that score.</p>

<p>He notes that in fact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">the disastrous SolarWinds hack</a> was entirely predictable based on SecurityScorecard&#8217;s rating system. &#8220;SolarWinds&#8217; score has been lagging below the industry average for quite a long time, so we weren&#8217;t really particularly surprised about them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The industry average is around 85 or a solid B in the letter grade system, whereas SolarWinds was sitting at 70 or a C for quite some time, indicating its security posture was suspect, he reports.</p>
<p>While Yampolskiy didn&#8217;t want to discuss valuation or revenue or even growth numbers, he did say the company has 17,000 customers worldwide including 7 of the 10 top pharmaceutical companies in the world.</p>
<p>The company has reached a point where this could be the last private fundraise it does before going public, but Yampolskiy kept his cards close on timing, saying it could happen some time in the next couple of years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Barely more than seven months after its most recent funding announcement, <a href="https://www.yotpo.com">Yotpo</a> is revealing that it has raised another $230 million in a Series F round that values the company at $1.4 billion (post-money).</p>
<p>“Our round, in my eyes, it’s all about celebrating the future of e-commerce,” co-founder and CEO Tomer Tagrin told me. “Brands don’t need to worry about connecting the marketing stack anymore.”</p>
<p>Where success in traditional retail has been determined by “location, location, location,” Tagrin said e-commerce is “all about consumer attention.” To capture that attention, he estimated the average brand is using 10 to 14 different marketing applications, creating a “pretty horrible experience.” So Yotpo — founded in 2011 and headquartered in New York City — aims to provide all of a brand&#8217;s e-commerce marketing needs in a single, integrated platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To illustrate this, Tagrin described a marketer wanting to create a customized offer just for users who had both purchased a product in the past 90 days and left a five-star review. Yotpo allows them to do that with “just the click of a button,” whereas “that experience was just not feasible before Yotpo,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The platform currently consists of four main products — Yotpo SMS Marketing, Yotpo Loyalty &amp; Referrals, Yotpo Reviews and Yotpo Visual UGC — which integrate with each other, as well as with e-commerce platforms such as Shopify, Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Adobe-owned Magento and BigCommerce.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126712" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126712" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2126712" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?w=680" alt="Yotpo CEO Tomer Tagrin" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TomerFinalWide.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126712" class="wp-caption-text">Yotpo CEO Tomer Tagrin</p></div></p>
<p>Tagrin said Yotpo still had money leftover from the last round but it decided to raise additional money to continue investing in product and marketing, as well for strategic acquisitions. (The company<a href="https://www.yotpo.com/blog/smsbump-joins-yotpo/"> acquired SMSBump</a> at the beginning of 2020 and Tagrin said it&#8217;s “70% of the way there” towards full integration.) Among other things, the company is planning to launch new products around customer communication and measuring a customer’s lifetime value.</p>
<p>Yotpo also says that it has now exceeded $100 million in annual recurring revenue, with the SMS marketing product growing revenue by 170% last year, while the loyalty product saw its revenue nearly double. Big brands like Patagonia and Steve Madden use the platform, but Tagrin pointed out that it’s also used by newer direct-to-consumer businesses like Princess Polly and has 30,000 paying customers over all.</p>
<p>“I like to say that Victoria’s Secret will die by a thousand cuts,” he said. “These are the mini-brands … the up-and-comer brands that are going to replace the incumbents.”</p>
<p>Yotpo has now raised more than $400 million in total funding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yotpo">according to Crunchbase</a>. The round was led by by Bessemer Venture Partners and Tiger Global, with participation from Claltech Investment, Coin Ventures, Hanaco, Vertex Ventures, Vintage Investment Partners and others.</p>
<p>“Tiger Global has long been bullish on eCommerce as the future of retail, having invested in disruptor brands like Warby Parker and Peloton, giants like JD.com, and best-in-class SaaS companies like Stripe and Twilio,” said Tiger’s John Curtius in a statement. “We are excited by Yotpo’s approach to provide a unified marketing tech stack and the value it provides to brands and online shoppers in the process.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, London-listed telecom, <a href="https://airtel.africa/">Airtel Africa</a>, said it was looking to sell a minority stake in its mobile money business in a bid to raise cash and sell off some assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm seems to have found an investor as it announced that</span><a href="https://therisefund.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rise Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the global impact investing platform of investment firm</span><a href="https://www.tpg.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TPG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will invest $200 million in its mobile money arm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment will see the mobile money business &#8212;  Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV) &#8212; valued at $2.65 billion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC BV is an Airtel Africa subsidiary and the holding company for several of Airtel Africa&#8217;s mobile money operations across 14 African countries, including Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC BV says the holding company will use the investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to reduce its debt and invest in network and sales infrastructure in the respective operating countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal will close in two tranches &#8212; $150 million invested at first close, with $50 million to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be invested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at second close</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the deal&#8217;s completion, Airtel Africa will still hold a majority stake in the business and is also exploring the opportunity to take the business public within the next four years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our markets afford the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> market potential for mobile money services to meet the needs of the tens of millions of customers in Africa who have little or no access to banking and financial services, and this demand is driving growth,&#8221; Airtel Africa CEO <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/raghunath-mandava-30380347">Raghunath Mandava</a> said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With today’s announcement, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are pleased</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to welcome The Rise Fund as an investor in our mobile  money business and as a partner to help us realise the full potential from the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">substantial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunity  to bank the unbanked across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtel mobile money business, one of the many players driving financial inclusion across the continent, offers a range of services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include mobile wallet deposit and withdrawals, merchant and commercial payments, benefits transfers, loans and savings, virtual credit card and international money transfers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these services are present across countries of operation except Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the West African country, Airtel has gone through the route of partnering with local banks but has now applied for its own mobile banking licence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its most recent reported results for Q3 2020, Airtel Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">witnessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year on year revenue growth of 41.1% to $110 million, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">largely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> driven by 29% growth in the customer base to 21.5 million and 9.7% ARPU growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transaction value went 53% up to $12.8 billion ($52 billion annualised), and underlying EBITDA stood at $54 million ($216 million annualised) at a margin of 48.7%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AMC BV benefits from a strong offline presence of kiosks, mini shops and agents which tie with its core telecom business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n a bid to drive growth this year, the business has struck partnerships with Mastercard, Samsung, Standard Chartered Bank, WorldRemit, among others, to expand both the range and depth of its mobile money offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/yemi-lalude-42612">Yemi Lalude</a>, a partner at TPG who leads Africa investing for The Rise Fund, said that with financial inclusion being a global issue that is most acute in Africa, the telecom is closing the gap between traditional financial institutions and the millions of unbanked Africans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We look forward to working with Airtel Africa to enhance their mobile money services, broaden its use cases, and grow into new markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this investment in Airtel Africa’s mobile money operations, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand The Rise Fund’s global fintech portfolio and continue to deepen our focus on improving financial inclusion in Africa and around the world,” he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Last year, TPG which has more than <span style="font-weight: 400;">$91 billion in assets under management </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/13/indias-reliance-jio-platforms-to-sell-600-million-stake-to-tpg/">invested $600 million</a> in Reliance Jio. The telecoms operator is a competitor to Airtel Africa&#8217;s parent company, Bharti Airtel. That&#8217;s one interesting detail although both investments target different markets and are from separate funds within TPG.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.asteya.world/">Asteya</a>, a Miami-based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disability insurance startup that is geared toward small business owners and gig workers, launched today with a seed round of $10 million. Co-founder and CEO Alex Williamson, who was Bumble’s chief brand officer, describes Asteya as an “income insurance” startup. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/bumble-prices-ipo-at-43-per-share/">Bumble’s IPO last month</a>, signaling that former executives are already taking their cash and betting that they themselves can build the next unicorn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she was at Bumble, Williamson took medical leave. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Had Bumble not been so generous with me with medical leave, I would have needed disability insurance,” she said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Williamson, 51% of U.S. employers offer disability insurance to their employees. The other 49% are left unprotected should something happen to them. In today’s changing workforce, many of these people are small business owners and gig or freelance workers. It’s this class of worker that Asteya is targeting with its first product. It offers up to $500,000 in protection through a one-time payout for a monthly fee that starts at $6/month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people get sick and need to take time off work to get back on their feet, worrying about how they are going to pay rent or cover any other regular financial responsibilities can be a hardship in itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If your finances aren’t in order, you can’t focus on getting help,” Williamson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People not covered by disability insurance &#8212; once they fall ill &#8212; have the option of applying for federal disability. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main distinction here is that disability insurance starts paying immediately, while federal disability only pays after you get approved by the government, but the process can be cumbersome and is known to take several months. Many people who attempt to file for federal disability on their own are often denied and then subsequently need to use a lawyer to get approved. And after all that, payments &#8212; which range from only several hundred to a couple thousand dollars a month &#8212; kick in six months after you’re approved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signing up &#8212; and getting approved &#8212; for disability insurance with Asteya takes minutes, the company said. Like many other startups, Asteya, through its hassle-free approach in a sector that’s known to be tangled in bureaucracy, sees an opportunity to bring humanity into insurance, Williamson said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.doctordisability.com/why-is-disability-insurance-more-expensive-for-women/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women are often charged a significant premium for disability insurance compared to men</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; which makes them a more expensive hire for companies &#8212; adding another unnecessary difficulty for female candidates. New York and Massachusetts are a few of the states that outlawed the policy in 2019, and following their lead, Asteya’s first product is gender-neutral, Williamson said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">managing general agent (MGA) and broker’s license, and through its MGA license, all policies are offered through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance heavyweights Munich Re and Lloyd’s of London. In short, if the startup doesn’t succeed, your coverage won’t be affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering Williamson’s contacts and those of the founding team members, they were able to line up funding pre-launch, and Bumble’s founder and CEO, Whitney Wolfe Herd, is an angel investor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include I2BF Ventures, Capital Factory, Cap Meridian Ventures, Northstar.vc, Atrum, and angel investor Geeta Sankappanavar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is planning to offer a product for longer-term disability, as well as one that covers people with pre-existing conditions.</span></p>
