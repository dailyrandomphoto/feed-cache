										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cloverly.com/">Cloverly</a>, an Atlanta-based early stage startup, has developed an API that helps companies measure and then offset their carbon emissions. Today the company announced a $2.1 million seed round.</p>
<p>TechSquare Ventures led the round with participation from SoftBank Opportunity Fund and Panoramic Ventures along with Circadian Ventures, Knoll Ventures, and SaaS Ventures .</p>
<p>While it was at it, the company announced that founder Anthony Oni has stepped back from running the company day-to-day, but will remain on the board as advisor. The company has hired former eBay exec Jason Rubottom as CEO in his place.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a Sustainability as a Service company that helps other companies measure and reduce their carbon footprint. Our API measures the carbon emissions from various activities or processes within a business and allows that business or its customers to offset those emissions. And then it provides comprehensive reporting on that,&#8221; Rubottom explained.</p>
<p>Rudy Krehbiel, who runs operations for the company says that the API is designed to be flexible to meet the needs of each company accessing the services, but once developers create an application, it works automatically to measure emissions and purchase the offsets. &#8220;The solution itself is automated. Most of the work happens up front, and once we get integrated it becomes a fully productized and operationalized ongoing measurement and offsetting solution,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Corporate sustainability initiatives may open doors for carbon offset startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/corporate-sustainability-initiatives-may-open-doors-for-carbon-offset-startups/embed/#?secret=sD8xoS9PUL" data-secret="sD8xoS9PUL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As customers build solutions using the tool, they can then offset their carbon usage by buying carbon offsets from the public markets, and this can be automated based on the usage of a given company. Cloverly monitors the offset market to ensure that the sources are credible and are adding new ones as they develop.</p>
<p>The company is working with over 6000 brands, which have offset over 55 million pounds of carbon to this point. The API was originally conceived by Oni when he was working at the <a href="https://www.southerncompany.com/">Southern Company</a> and spun out as a startup on Earth Day in 2019.</p>
<p>Oni, who is Black, is moving away from day-to-day operations as he hands the baton to Rubottom, but he recognizes the significance of this funding from a diversity perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a Black tech founder of a climate tech company, it&#8217;s incredibly validating to have TechSquare Ventures and Softbank&#8217;s Opportunity Fund as investors. It will take diverse people and teams to find solutions to create a more sustainable future,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Daniel Simon </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alliance-data-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-bread-301162702.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold Bread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a consumer purchase finance and payments startup he’d co-founded, to Alliance Data Systems for over $500 million late last year, he quickly set his sights on building another startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pandemic, Simon says he observed how much strain was placed on what he described as ‘real-world’ businesses and their employees &#8212; such as truck drivers, plumbers, HVAC installers and last-mile delivery people &#8212; “and how little the last decade of innovation in fintech has done to meet the needs of the vast and vital fleets segment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So he teamed up with former Bread COO (and former Lyft exec) Andrew Woolf to found </span><a href="https://coastpay.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company that is aiming to meet those needs with the mission of becoming “the financial platform for the future of transportation.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the New York-based company is announcing it has raised $6 million in an “oversubscribed” seed round of funding led by Better Tomorrow Ventures. Avid Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, BoxGroup, Colle, Foundation Capital, Greycroft, and Max Levchin’s SciFi VC &#8212; as well as more than a dozen angels including founders of Plaid, Flexport, Marqeta, Bread, Albert, Addi, Lithic, and other fintech and logistics startups &#8212; also put money in the round.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses that operate fleets need to enable their drivers to pay for vehicle-related expenses when they’re on the road, such as maintenance, roadside assistance and gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But once a fleet reaches a size of more than just a few vehicles, traditional small business credit cards are no longer sufficient because they lack the line-item level security, visibility, and controls necessary with a mobile workforce, according to Simon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fleet owners need transactions to be authorized, for instance, for buying gas for the company van, not the personal car, and for filling up at the pump, not making other purchases in the gas station convenience store,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, fleets have turned to specialized fleet and fuel credit cards which provide controls like restricting purchases to only fuel products of a particular grade or tracking expenses on a per-vehicle basis. But Simon argues that the companies that sell such cards were founded decades ago with very little innovation since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast’s goal is to use technology to provide fleet business owners and their employees payments products that are intuitive and easy to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They need their employee and vehicle payments integrated into the rest of their operations, and they need fair and transparent financial products that are simple to understand,” Simon said. Bottom line, he wants to bring the “same sort of ease of use and transparency that Bread brought to e-commerce consumers and retailers to a category of business and employee that is often overlooked in tech.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coast’s first product, which is set to launch later this year, is a commercial fuel charge card. Drivers will be able use a physical Coast card they keep in their wallet or a shared Coast card in the vehicle, and when they swipe it at a pump at any merchant that takes Visa, Simon says Coast will conduct a “rapid review of a complex set of rules to enforce the fleet business’s policies and flag potentially fraudulent transactions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No need for entering data prompted by the pump &#8211; the driver fills up and is on their way,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fleet owners and managers can use Coast’s web portal to assign drivers and vehicles, set policies and rules about who can purchase what, how much, how often, and when. They can also get reporting and alerts on their expense policies and potential abuse. At the end of the month, they will be able pay their Coast balance in full.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down the line, the company plans to add integrations into major accounting platforms as well as into telematics platforms that provide real-time data on vehicle status and location “so it can provide actionable spending insights back to fleet managers.” Over time, Coast also plans to expand into more categories of fleet businesses’ spending as it seeks to become more of a holistic platform for the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheel Mohnot of Better Tomorrow Ventures, who took a seat on Coast’s board as part of the financing, says his firm was impressed by both the size of the opportunity and the team at Coast that’s tackling it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The space is one of those massive unsexy categories with huge incumbents that most people have never heard of but customers &#8212; who are forced to use them &#8212; universally despise. It&#8217;s the perfect recipe for a startup to come in and disrupt it with a much better experience,” Mohnot told TechCrunch via e-mail. “Similar to what Ramp or Brex do for startups, Coast does for fleet operators &#8211; it helps them control their spending so they can focus on growing their business.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to detecting events transpiring anywhere in the world, few companies hold a candle to <a href="https://www.dataminr.com">Dataminr</a>. Founded in 2009, the company has raised more than $1 billion over the past 12 years (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/dataminr-raises-475m-on-a-4-1b-valuation-for-real-time-insights-based-on-100k-sources-of-public-data/">including $475 million at a $4.1 billion valuation just this past March</a>) to build out a data-gobbling platform that transforms raw inputs into actionable event intelligence.</p>
<p>Those events are sent to a variety of customers — corporate security professionals, supply chain risk analysts, even journalists — for whatever purpose they need in their work. CEO and co-founder Ted Bailey said that the company has made event detection its core skillset. It’s “all been geared to the detection of events,” he said. “What we have never built into our corporate product is an advanced geospatial platform,” that would allow users to visualize risks rather than just getting a push notification or an email.</p>
<p>That’s about to change, as the company announced today its first acquisition in its corporate history with the purchase of UK-based <a href="https://watchkeeper.com">WatchKeeper</a>. WatchKeeper’s platform was designed to help corporate physical security executives visualize how events could affect a company’s assets. For instance, a bank with branches in Florida needs to understand what happens if a hurricane is heading toward the peninsula.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed, although Bailey said that “it’s a mature product — this is by no means an acquihire.” WatchKeeper, which was founded in 2018, previously raised £1 million from venture capitalists, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/watchkeeper-international/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>“Different organizations have extremely different needs, and these events have extremely different impacts on these corporations given the geographical footprint of their physical assets and their moving assets,” Bailey said. “This is something that we have zeroed in on [at Dataminr] more and more over the past couple of years.”</p>
<p>The startup had been on Dataminr’s radar even prior to the company inception. Hugh Farquhar, the founder and CEO of WatchKeeper, formerly worked at Citibank where Bailey said he built out a platform for contextualizing Dataminr alerts for the bank’s executives. After he left, Farquhar decided to build a similar platform for all companies.</p>
<p>As word got out about WatchKeeper’s product, Bailey saw an opportunity to bring Dataminr closer to the nascent company. “We were aggressively exploring a partnership with them for the last 6-12 months where we were scoping and imagining the possibilities of working together,” he said. “We had already selected them as the key innovator in data visualization, the one that was most tuned to corporate needs,” and eventually the partnership discussion became an acquisition conversation.</p>
<p>WatchKeeper’s entire team will move to Dataminr, and they will remain in the UK. Dataminr opened its European headquarters in the UK a few years ago, and the company has ambitious plans to spend heavily from its last round of capital on international expansion in Europe and in APAC.</p>
<p>WatchKeeper will be integrated into Dataminr Pulse later this year, the company’s product focused on business risk clients. Bailey said that from a data perspective, the acquisition pushes Dataminr into a new direction. “We have never taken that step of using public data outside of just detecting events,” he said. “We have a bunch of ideas on how to go beyond detecting events early,” which has been Dataminr’s main objective, to “real-time contextual data.” In addition, WatchKeeper integrates corporate internal data in a way that Dataminr hasn’t previously explored.</p>
<p>This is Dataminr’s first M&amp;A transaction, and while future transactions could be in the offing, there isn’t a specific strategy to hit a growth target through acquisitions in the future. The company continues to be headed toward an intended IPO, given that it dubbed its March round a “pre-IPO round.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ZeroFox, a cybersecurity startup that helps companies detect risks found on social media and digital channels, has announced it has acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/dark-web/">dark web</a> threat intelligence company Vigilante.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Vigilante — not to be confused with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/controversial-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-banned-from-app-store/">controversial crime reporting app</a> — scours the dark web to source intelligence that helps to protect organizations from cyberattacks. The deal, terms of which were not announced, will see ZeroFox take on Vigilante’s global team of operatives and analysts to create “the industry’s most robust” dark web intelligence solution.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Building on Vigilante’s decades-old dark web monitoring tools, the joint solution will combine datasets from the two companies to deliver risk intelligence on compromised credentials and botnets, network intelligence on infected and vulnerable hosts, and intelligence on threat actors and indicators of compromise (IOCs). The product, which will have ZeroFox&#8217;s AI processing capabilities baked-in, will also provide botnet exposure monitoring, threat monitoring, and client-specific investigations and incident response on threat actor engagement and asset recovery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The combination of our otherwise inaccessible datasets, our team of researchers and operatives, along with ZeroFox’s scale and artificial intelligence, provides a compelling dark web intelligence service,” said Mike Kirschner, co-founder of Vigilante.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The acquisition, which the firms claim will help better protect organizations at an even greater scale, comes amid a huge rise in criminal activity on the dark web, according to recent research. As a result of pandemic-fueled cybercrime, Risk Based Security said in <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/01/21/new-research-no-of-records-exposed-increased-141-in-2020/">its recent annual data breach report</a> that the number of comprised records surpassed 37 billion in 2020, a 141% increase over 2019, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> was up by 100%.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The dark web and criminal underground are critical requirements of modern threat intelligence programs,&#8221; said James C. Foster, CEO of ZeroFox. &#8220;Our customers need a clear view of the underground economy, how bots may be attacking them or if their credentials, credit cards, personally identifiable information (PII) and other information could be traded there, as well as understanding emerging tactics, exploits and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Foster said the acquisition of Vigilante increases &#8220;the scale and comprehensiveness&#8221; of its dark web intelligence gathering capabilities, which helps to protect customers&#8217; information.</p>
<p>In February last year, ZeroFox announced it had raised $74 million in a Series D funding round led by Intel Capital, which it planned to use to accelerate its global expansion and product strategy. Prior to this, in 2017, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/zerofox-secures-40m-series-c-to-help-manage-social-media-risk/">the startup raised $40 million Series C led by Redline Capital Management and Silver Lake Waterman</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Several widely used opioid treatment recovery apps are accessing and sharing sensitive user data with third parties, a new investigation has found.</p>
<p>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce transmission in the U.S, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/telehealth/">telehealth services</a> and apps offering opioid addiction treatment have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/boulder-care-opioid-treatment-platform-picks-up-traction-during-coronavirus/">surged in popularity</a>. This rise of app-based services comes as addiction treatment facilities face budget cuts and closures, which has seen both investor and government interest turn to telehealth as a tool to combat the growing addiction crisis.</p>
<p>While people accessing these services may have a reasonable expectation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/privacy/">privacy</a> of their healthcare data, a <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com/digital-security-lab/opioid-telehealth-research?=06072021">new report</a> from ExpressVPN’s Digital Security Lab, compiled in conjunction with the Opioid Policy Institute and the Defensive Lab Agency, found that some of these apps collect and share sensitive information with third parties, raising questions about their privacy and security practices.</p>
<p>The report studied 10 opioid treatment apps available on Android: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bicycle-health-the-virtual-opioid-use-disorder-therapy-service-will-soon-be-available-in-25-states/">Bicycle Health</a>, Boulder Care, Confidant Health. DynamiCare Health, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kaden-health">Kaden Health</a>, Loosid, Pear Reset-O, PursueCare, Sober Grid, and Workit Health. These apps have been installed at least 180,000 times, and have received more than $300 million in funding from investment groups and the federal government.</p>
<p>Despite the vast reach and sensitive nature of these services, the research found that the majority of the apps accessed unique identifiers about the user&#8217;s device and, in some cases, shared that data with third parties.</p>
<p>Of the 10 apps studied, seven access the Android Advertising ID (AAID), a user-generated identifier that can be linked to other information to provide insights into identifiable individuals. Five of the apps also access the devices’ phone number; three access the device&#8217;s unique IMEI and IMSI numbers, which can also be used to uniquely identify a person&#8217;s device; and two access a users&#8217; list of installed apps, which the researchers say can be used to build a &#8220;fingerprint&#8221; of a user to track their activities.</p>
<p>Many of the apps examined are also obtaining location information in some form, which when correlated with these unique identifiers, strengthens the capability for surveilling an individual person, as well as their daily habits, behaviors, and who they interact with. One of the methods the apps are doing this is through Bluetooth; seven of the apps request permission to make Bluetooth connections, which the researchers say is particularly worrying due to the fact this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/07/a-dozen-popular-iphone-apps-caught-quietly-sending-user-locations-to-monetization-firms/">can be used to track users</a> in real-world locations.</p>
<p>“Bluetooth can do what I call proximity tracking, so if you’re in the grocery store, it knows how long you’re in a certain aisle, or how close you are to someone else,” Sean O’Brien, principal researcher at ExpressVPN’s Digital Security Lab who led the investigation, told TechCrunch. “Bluetooth is an area that I’m pretty concerned about.”</p>
<p>Another major area of concern is the use of tracker SDKs in these apps, which O&#8217;Brien previously warned about in a recent investigation that revealed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/x-mode-location-google-apple-ban/">hundreds of Android apps were sending granular user location data to X-Mode</a>, a data broker known to sell location data to U.S. military contractors, and now banned from both Apple and Google&#8217;s app stores. SDKs, or software development kits, are <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/7/8/21311533/sdks-tracking-data-location">bundles of code</a> that are included with apps to make them work properly, such as collecting location data. Often, SDKs are provided for free in exchange for sending back the data that the apps collect.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Confidentiality continues to be one of the major concerns that people cite for not entering treatment&#8230; existing privacy laws are totally not up to speed.&#8221; <cite>Jacqueline Seitz, Legal Action Center</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>While the researchers keen to point out that it does not categorize all usage of trackers as malicious, particularly as many developers may not even be aware of their existence within their apps, they discovered a high prevalence of tracker SDKs in seven out of the 10 apps that revealed potential data-sharing activity. Some SDKs are designed specifically to collect and aggregate user data; this is true even where the SDK&#8217;s core functionality is concerned.</p>
<p>But the researchers explain that an app, which provides navigation to a recovery center, for example, may also be tracking a user’s movements throughout the day and sending that data back to the app’s developers and third parties.</p>
<p>In the case of Kaden Health, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/stripe/">Stripe</a> — which is used for payment services within the app — can read the list of installed apps on a user&#8217;s phone, their location, phone number, and carrier name, as well as their AAID, IP address, IMEI, IMSI, and SIM serial number.</p>
<p>“An entity as large as Stripe having an app share that information directly is pretty alarming. It’s worrisome to me because I know that information could be very useful for law enforcement,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien tells TechCrunch. “I also worry that people having information about who has been in treatment will eventually make its way into decisions about health insurance and people getting jobs.”</p>
<p>The data-sharing practices of these apps are likely a consequence of these services being developed in an environment of unclear U.S. federal guidance regarding the handling and disclosure of patient information, the researchers say, though O&#8217;Brien tells TechCrunch that the actions could be in breach of 42 CFR Part 2, a law that outlines strong controls over disclosure of patient information related to treatment for addiction.</p>
<p>Jacqueline Seitz, a senior staff attorney for health privacy at Legal Action Center, however, said this 40-year-old law hasn&#8217;t yet been updated to recognize apps.</p>
<p>“Confidentiality continues to be one of the major concerns that people cite for not entering treatment,&#8221; Seitz told TechCrunch. &#8220;While 42 CFR Part 2 recognizes the very sensitive nature of substance use disorder treatment, it doesn’t mention apps at all. Existing privacy laws are totally not up to speed.</p>
<p>“It would be great to see some leadership from the tech community to establish some basic standards and recognize that they’re collecting super-sensitive information so that patients aren’t left in the middle of a health crisis trying to navigate privacy policies,&#8221; said Seitz.</p>
<p>Another likely reason for these practices is a lack of security and data privacy staff, according to Jonathan Stoltman, director at Opioid Policy Institute, which contributed to the research. “If you look at a hospital&#8217;s website, you’ll see a chief information officer, a chief privacy officer, or a chief security officer that’s in charge of physical security and data security,” he tells TechCrunch. “None of these startups have that.”</p>
<p>“There’s no way you’re thinking about privacy if you’re collecting the AAID, and almost all of these apps are doing that from the get-go,&#8221; Stoltman added.</p>
<p>Google is aware of ExpressVPN’s findings but has yet to comment. However, the report has been released as the tech giant prepares to start limiting developer access to the Android Advertising ID, mirroring Apple&#8217;s recent efforts to enable users to opt out of ad tracking.</p>
<p>While ExpressVPN is keen to make patients aware that these apps may violate expectations of privacy, it also stresses the central role that addiction treatment and recovery apps may play in the lives of those with opioid addiction. It recommends that if you or a family member used one of these services and find the disclosure of this data to be problematic, contact the Office of Civil Rights through Health and Human Services to file a formal complaint.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is this is a general problem with the app economy, and we’re watching telehealth become part of that, so we need to be very careful and cautious,&#8221; said O&#8217;Brien. &#8220;There needs to be disclosure, users need to be aware, and they need to demand better.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Information and Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar resigned from their roles on Wednesday, adding to the list of high-profile local politicians who have vacated their positions ahead of India Prime Minister Narendra Modi reshuffling his cabinet.</p>
<p>The resignations of Prasad &#8212; who also served as the minister of Law and Justice &#8212; and Javadekar &#8212; who also oversaw Environment, Forest, Climate Change, Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises &#8212; come at a time when they were at the centre of a tough discourse with American technology firms over South Asian’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new IT rules</a>, which went into effect late May.</p>
<p>There’s no evidence that Prasad and Javadekar’s enforcement of the new IT rules and public exchanges with American technology giants are linked to their resignations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“All social media platforms are welcome to do business in India. They can criticize Ravi Shankar Prasad, my Prime Minister or anyone. The issue is of misuse of social media. Some of them say we are bound by American laws. You operate in India, make good money, but you will take the position that you’ll be governed by American laws. This is plainly not acceptable,” Prasad had said at a virtual conference last week.</p>
<p>The new IT rules &#8220;will impact the data privacy and security of Indian internet users, as well as the technology sector&#8217;s hitherto tremendous contribution to India&#8217;s economic growth by imposing onerous compliance frameworks on both local and international digital media companies, said Jeff Paine, MD of Asia Internet Coalition, an industry body that represents all major tech companies, in May.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it is important to uphold user internet and accountability of online platforms, we urge the government to work closely with industry to ensure that these rules are implemented in ways that mitigate the impact on online platforms&#8217; operations in India, and ultimately, on individuals, startups, and the country&#8217;s technology ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others ministers to resign today include Health minister Harsh Vardhan and his deputy Ashwani Chaube, both of whom were criticised for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic measures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The President, as advised by the Prime Minister, has accepted the resignation &#8230; with immediate effect,&#8221; said Ajay Kumar Singh, Press Secretary to the President, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based smartphone subscription startup <a href="https://www.raylo.com">Raylo</a> has tucked $11.5 million in Series A funding into its top pocket, led by Octopus Ventures.</p>
<p>The equity round follows a debt raise last year &#8212; and brings Raylo&#8217;s total raised since being founded back in 2019 to $40M (in equity and debt). Its roster of investors to date also includes the Macquarie Group, Guy Johnson of Carphone Warehouse and the co-founders of Funding Circle.<u></u></p>
<p>The new funding will be used to charge up a subscription smartphone play that nudges consumers never to own their own mobile device &#8212; but just pay a monthly fee to lease a new or refurbished SIM-free device instead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Raylo says it&#8217;s seen 10x YoY growth of customers and revenues, and plans to plough the Series A into accelerating its growth in the UK &#8212; including by doubling its headcount and further developing its tech. And while it suggests it&#8217;s entertaining the idea of a future global rollout it remains firmly UK focused for now.</p>

<p>Consumers opting to get the latest smartphone hardware through Raylo will pay a lower cost than the full RRP for a device since they won&#8217;t actually own the hardware at the end of the contract.</p>
<p>Environmental considerations aside, that may be an increasingly important consideration, given the inflating price of premium handsets like the top-of-the-range iPhone which has broken $1,000 for a few years now.</p>
<p>Plus the fact that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/the-vast-majority-of-us-consumers-arent-spending-1000-on-phones/">most consumers simply won&#8217;t shell out so much</a> for a handset. Leasing and returning offers an alternative way for people to get to use such expensive high-end devices.</p>
<p>With Raylo, the leased mobile is typically returned after the end of the 12 or 24-month contract &#8212; with the returned device refurbished for reuse via a second (or third) leased life with another user.</p>
<p>End of life devices are recycled (by partners), per Raylo. So it&#8217;s touting a circular model that promotes sustainability via device usage longevity vs the more typical upgrade scenario, via a carrier, where a consumer may just toss their old unused handset into a drawer, wasting its further potential utility.</p>
<p>Albeit, many people do pass on old devices to other family members or even sell or trade them in. But Raylo claims there are an estimated 125M smartphones in unused &#8216;hibernation&#8217; across the UK. So, the suggestion is, plenty of smartphone users don&#8217;t bother ensure their old handset gets a second life.</p>
<p><span class="il">Raylo</span> reckons each of its subscription leased device can be used by a total of three customers over 6-7 years – which, if achieved, would mean a lifespan that it says is almost 2x longer than the UK average (of 2.31 years).</p>
<p>To further the longevity goal, all the phones it supplies come with a free case and screen protector.<u></u></p>
<p>Users also need to weigh up whether they want to shell out for insurance too, though, since they need to make sure they don&#8217;t damage the leased handset or risk having to shell out for expensive repairs or a non-return fee. (Raylo sells its own flavor of device insurance to users as an optional extra which slightly bumps up the monthly cost.)</p>
<p>Raylo competes with carriers&#8217; own device subscription plans, of course. But again the claim is it&#8217;s cheaper to lease its way &#8212; although that&#8217;s as it should be since the consumer doesn&#8217;t own the hardware at the end of the contract (so won&#8217;t automatically have anything of value they could sell or trade in elsewhere).</p>
<p>If a user doesn&#8217;t want (or fails) to return a device at the end of the contract they have to pay a non-return fee &#8212; which varies depending on the handset hardware and how long they&#8217;ve been paying for it. But the fee can stretch to over £600 at the premium end &#8212; after 12 months of use of a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G with 512GB of storage or an iPhone 12 Pro Max, for example.</p>
<p>While consumers that want to continue using the same device rather than upgrading after their contract ends can opt to continue paying their usual monthly fees &#8212; with payments continuing up to a maximum of 36 months, after which the non-return fee drops to a token £1.</p>
<p>All Raylo&#8217;s leased devices come with a 24 month warranty, under which it says it will freely repair faults not related to user damage or accidents, or else supply a replacement device if the handset can&#8217;t be fixed.</p>
<p>Commenting on Raylo&#8217;s Series A in a statement, Tosin Agbabiaka, early-stage fintech investor at Octopus Ventures, said: “The subscription economy is rapidly transforming the way we access products and services &#8212; yet the smartphone, an individual&#8217;s most valuable device, is still locked behind a bundled, ownership-based model. This means most people are trapped in a buy-and-dispose cycle, with a steep financial and environmental costs.</p>
<p>“Raylo solves these problems by offering access to premium consumer devices at lower, subscription-based prices, helping to widen access to the latest technology. By repurposing its devices at the end of their cycle, Raylo is also the sustainable choice in this market and has built a product loved by its customers &#8212; the opportunity here is massive, and we believe that [co-founders] Karl [Gilbert], Richard [Fulton], and Jinden [Badesha] have the vision and depth of expertise to transform the way we all access our devices.”</p>
<p>A number of refurbished electronics businesses have been attracting investor attention in Europe in recent years where lawmakers are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/european-lawmakers-propose-a-right-to-repair-for-mobiles-and-laptops/">considering right to repair legislation</a>.</p>
<p>Recent fundings in the space include a $335M round for French refurbished device marketplace startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/back-market-raises-another-335-million-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">Back Market</a>; a $71m round for Berlin-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/grover-raises-71m-to-grow-its-consumer-electronics-subscription-business/">Grover</a>&#8216;s subscription electronics business; and a $40.6M round for Finland-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/swappie-bags-40-6m-to-sell-more-secondhand-iphones-across-europe/">Swappie</a>, which refurbishes and sells secondhand iPhones, to name a few.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been quite the year for crypto capital, what with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/coinbase-opens-at-381-per-share-valuing-the-crypto-exchange-at-nearly-100b/">Coinbase’s blockbuster debut earlier this year in a direct listing</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">A16Z raising $2.2 billion</a> for its third crypto-focused fund. But as the numbers in this frenetic market continue to skyrocket to dizzying highs, there is an open question for a lot of crypto founders: who exactly can work with me at the earliest possible stage?</p>
<p>That’s the investment thesis of Ash Egan, the current solo GP of Brooklyn-based <a href="http://acrylic.co">Acrylic</a>, which today announced a $55 million debut fund that will be focused on what he dubs “inception capital.” Among the LPs who invested are fund-of-funds firm Cendana, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/cendana-has-raised-a-30-million-fund-of-funds-for-vcs-managing-15-million-or-less/">known for backing emerging VC managers</a>, Accolade Partners, which <a href="https://medium.com/accolade-partners/accolade-partners-launches-a-blockchain-fund-of-funds-359e751510ce">launched a blockchain-focused fund-of-funds in 2020</a>, VC firms Accomplice and DCG as well as individuals like Chris Dixon, Marc Andreessen, Jim Pallotta, and others.</p>
<p>Egan, who was formerly a partner at Accomplice and an investor at ConsenSys Ventures, and Converge, has been heavily focused on the crypto space since 2015, backing early winners like Chainalysis, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/chainalysis-raises-100m-doubles-valuation-to-over-2b/">which was valued at $2 billion in March</a>, and BlockFi, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/blockfi-lands-a-350m-series-d-at-3b-valuation-for-its-fast-growing-crypto-lending-platform/">which is now worth a pretty healthy $3 billion for the four-year-old company</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He sees an opportunity to be the earliest capital for crypto founders — perhaps even before they have started a company. He wants to “be that first investor in a company or a protocol before they raise those large rounds, even being an outsourced team member,” he said. He says he is focused on “the founders who are taking massive risks, creating entirely new markets, evolving the status quo.”</p>
<p>The firm’s name has a few sources according to Egan. “As a painter, my medium is acrylic,” he said. “It’s a real cool media since it meshes with all other mediums really well.” He also noted that “acrylic is generally painted in layers … and crypto is layers of protocols.” Finally, he feels the name relates to his style of investing. You “can’t just plug in a formula and rely on one kind of strategy,” he said. “Crypto investing is not a science yet, it’s still very much an art.”</p>
<p>While there is some poetry there, the reality of the crypto markets is that they are incredibly subsumed by the huge financial vagaries of the markets on any given today (and let’s be frank, every given minute). Egan wants to focus on longitudinal investing without constantly looking at the daily minutia of ticker prices. “The hope is that at scale, you are in a position where you are in early enough and cycles don’t really matter,” he said. “You want to partner with founders who are not swayed by macro inertia [and who are] building something with a ton of value in both bull and bear markets.”</p>

<p>The firm will invest in both traditional equity as well as tokens, and he sees the firm’s Brooklyn headquarters as a unique asset. “Brooklyn is so well-positioned to be a focal point for this next chapter in crypto given that every company has people in New York or who spend some part of the year here,” he said. “Wall Street is here, media is here… being local is huge.”</p>
<p>So far, the firm has invested in a couple of startups and protocols, including low-cost North American Bitcoin miner <a href="https://www.usbtccorp.com">US BTC Corp</a>, governance token protocol <a href="https://twitter.com/AutomataFinance/status/1348997992339169280?s=20">Automata</a>, smart contract auditing company Arbitrary Execution, decentralized investing network <a href="https://www.syndicateprotocol.org">Syndicate Protocol</a>, and two other unannounced investments.</p>
<p>While Egan says he is quite open to projects across the vast universe of crypto, there is one area where he won’t invest today. “One area that I am less excited at this point is generalized Layer 1 smart contract platforms aka your Ethereum killers,” he said. “There are a slew of contenders here including Ethereum, and I think it is very difficult to gain market share if you aren’t already building or in market today as a generalized smart contract platform.”</p>
<p>Right now, Egan is investing solo, but is in the process of building a team, saying that he is interviewing candidates but hasn’t hired. He believes a total focus on crypto will ultimately pay dividends over time. “At scale, you have network effects within the portfolio,” he said. “The portfolio actually works with each other.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacuna Technologies, a startup that helps cities create and enforce transportation policies by building and managing open-source digital tools, has raised $16 million in a Series A round, bringing the company’s total investment to $33.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the startup was founded in 2018, Lacuna has invested in helping cities like Los Angeles, Seattle and Miami build digital twins, or software models of real world cities – including all forms of mobility from delivery to rideshare to drones to regular traffic. City planners and transportation agencies can use these models to monitor the current environment and implement new regulations, as well as run simulations to provide a clearer picture of how certain policies could address congestion, pollution, accessibility and safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the fresh cash, Lacuna CEO Hugh Martin says the company is focusing on expanding to new markets and building out the applications that can be placed on top of the digital twins, like adjusting freight or delivery curb parking rates to reflect demand or putting a cap on the number of drones allowed down a given street per day. That means first hiring new engineering teams to build digital twins and connect applications in order to help cities get revenue flowing.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The federal government collects billions of dollars in gasoline taxes, which is largely used to fund departments of transportation at the federal, state and local levels, and that’s headed for zero,” Martin told TechCrunch. “What are we going to do? The gas tax has been a good proxy, but we need to find a new way to effectively monetize the public right of way, as well as get control of it. And I define the public right of way as not just 2D, but 3D. Where are the drones going to fly, where are the aerial taxis going to take off and land and how is the city going to communicate policy to those devices in real time?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cities focus on real world public right of way, including all the street connections, speed limits and parking rules, Martin says new mobility companies like Uber or FedEx are building up digital models of cities and operating their businesses on top, and the city has no way of accessing them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What would be super powerful is if instead of just having the physical world, the city has a digital copy of itself, with digital policies that could then be used by all operators,” said Martin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than using historical data to plan out cities, Martin says Lacuna’s services have a more operational focus. For example, Waze routes cars based on congestion using its own digital twin. This can cause hundreds of cars to go down a little side street when the highway is clogged up, which might annoy those who live there. If the city had a digital twin, it could assess the width of the street, whether it’s residential or commercial and the speed limit, and put a cap on the number of cars Waze can reroute down that street, thus preserving quality of life for those living on that street. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our objective is to give cities the tools they need so that they can use their authority to make sure that the users of the public right away are compliant with whatever their policy is,” said Martin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Los Angeles, for example, Lacuna built a system to help LA manage its scooter fleets back in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Venice Beach was a mess, there were scooters all over the boardwalk and the beach and being thrown in the water,” said Martin. “So we helped LA establish a geofence 200 feet off the boardwalk. LA gave scooter operators a two month grace period, but warned them if at the end of those two months, if riders cross that geofence, the city would start lowering the total number of units each operator could have on the streets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure observance, the city council rewrote the regulatory language for getting a scooter permit, requiring operators to be compliant with the city’s </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20872421/lacuna-startup-mds-scooter-tracking-ladot-data-collection"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobility data specification program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meaning operators would have to transmit and receive information digitally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, it&#8217;s night and day,” he said. “The scooters are all lined up 200 feet away from the boardwalk. And what was amazing for the city is that it was just 15 lines of code. They didn&#8217;t have to put a bunch of officers out, put signs up, write tickets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round was led by Xplorer Capital Management, and includes Playground Global, the company’s founding investor. Along with the funding news Lacuna is announcing the addition of Keith Nilsson, MP and co-founder of Xplorer, to the company’s board. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.outbrain.com">Outbrain</a>, an adtech company that provides clickbait ads below news articles, has raised $200 million in funding — Outbrain didn&#8217;t disclose the valuation of the company for this deal. The Baupost Group is investing in the company — it’s a Boston-based hedge fund. Outbrain filed for an initial public offering <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/29/2255239/0/en/Outbrain-Announces-Filing-of-Registration-Statement-for-Proposed-Initial-Public-Offering.html">just last week</a>. Today’s funding round should be the last traditional private investment round before going public.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Outbrain, you may have seen its content recommendation widgets on popular news websites, such as CNN, Le Monde and The Washington Post. They mostly feature sponsored links that lead to third-party websites.</p>
<p>“We are excited to announce this investment from The Baupost Group, who share our vision and commitment for our business, our team and our future prospects” co-CEO David Kostman said in a statement.</p>
<p>Outbrain is often compared with its rival <a href="https://www.taboola.com">Taboola</a>. While both startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/taboola-outbrain/">planned to merge</a> at some point, they had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/taboola-and-outbrain-call-off-their-850m-merger/">cancel</a> their merger. Taboola already went public after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/taboola-is-going-public-via-spac/">merging with a SPAC</a> — a special purpose acquisition company. Taboola shares started trading last week.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://sec.report/CIK/0001454938">IPO filing</a>, Outbrain reported $767 million in revenue for 2020 and $228 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2021 alone. In 2020, Outbrain managed to generate $4.4 million in net income. During Q1 2021, the company reported $10.7 million in net income.</p>
<p>“We proudly lead the recommendation space we created. We have bold plans for the future to continue delivering critical innovation to our premium media partners worldwide and expanding our powerful open web global advertising platform” Outbrain co-CEO Yaron Galai said in a statement.</p>
<p>The advertising market has recovered from the global health pandemic and there has been plenty of initial public offerings during the first half of 2021. Everything seems to be lining up for Taboola and Outbrain, which means it’s time to reach the next level and become public companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian fintech and lending startup <a href="https://www.lidya.info/">Lidya</a> today announced that it has completed its $8.3 million pre-Series B funding round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.thealitheia.com/">Alitheia Capital</a> led the investment via its <a href="https://www.goodwell.nl/fund/umunthu/">uMunthu Fund</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors that participated include Bamboo Capital Partners, Accion Venture Lab and Flourish Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the $1.3 million seed round secured in 2017 and $6.9 million Series A a year later, Lidya has raised a total of $16.5 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This investment will see Lidya grow its lending operations for small and medium businesses across its markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for Lidya came about in Nigeria when <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/tunde-kehinde-048aa635">Tunde Kehinde</a> and <a href="https://pl.linkedin.com/in/ercineksin">Ercin Eksin</a> saw the need to offer lending services while at their previous company Africa Courier Express (ACE)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACE was a last-mile e-commerce delivery company that provided logistics services to businesses and consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders, who also held founding and executive roles at Jumia Nigeria, noticed that most of the businesses ACE worked with had credit and financing issues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And although options existed, the founders felt these platforms could not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cater to their ever-growing needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As co-CEOs, the pair launched Lidya as a digital SME lending platform in 2016. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the platform, businesses can create accounts and apply for loans ranging from $500 to $50,000, with decisions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within 24 hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidya claims to use 100 data points to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> each applicant and build a credit score for them to assess credit risk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company announced its raise in 2018, it had disbursed 1,500 business loans and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enter new African markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it chose Europe instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2019, Lidya <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tobyshapshak/2019/10/15/nigerian-sme-digital-lender-lidya-expands-to-europe/">announced that it had launched new lending operations</a> in Poland and the Czech Republic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it was not until March and April 2020 the company&#8217;s activities in Eastern Europe fully kickstarted. Since then, Lidya claims to have disbursed over $3 million to SMEs in the two countries. To date, the company has disbursed over 25,000 loans and claims to have more than a 90% customer repeat rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what was behind the decision to expand to Europe instead of other African markets? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to build a global business from day one given the size of the problem where there is a $3 trillion credit gap,&#8221; CEO Kehinde said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We challenged ourselves not to limit ourselves to one market and went through some data before expanding to Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this raise, Lidya wants to solidify its presence in the three markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The investment has also brought a change to the company&#8217;s leadership structure. Per a statement released by the company,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eksin has left Lidya to pursue other projects while Kehinde takes over as the sole CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, both European markets represent about 30% of Lidya disbursement volume while the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> default rate is less than 1%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. U</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nlike most lending companies that raise debt financing to fund loans, Lidya uses equity to fund its loan book</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite the unconventional method, but Kehinde points why the company thought that path was necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The idea was for us to show that our algorithms work and that we can disburse money into the market and get it back. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we can transition to using debt for our lending operations,&#8221; the CEO said as the company looks to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">finalize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deals with banks, family offices, and hedge funds in the coming months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the $300,000 line of credit Lidya has secured from Bamboo Capital Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidya began lending in Europe at the height of the pandemic. Kehinde recounts how tough it was for the team, especially in a period that was so unusual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is difficult enough to attempt to launch in two new countries but try doing that remotely,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re so decentralized. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had operations in Nigeria, and we were launching in Eastern Europe </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remotely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making sure the puzzle stays together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stepped up. Everyone doubled down on the mission and we came out of the year without having any deterioration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO adds, &#8220;Now the focus is to get back to gear. We want to be able to do 5x what we&#8217;ve done historically by this time next year. If we do that, we&#8217;ll be successful, and our customers will be successful as well.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lidya will grow out its teams in Lagos, Prague and Warsaw and use a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the funds to support lines of credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking on the investment, Alitheia Capital co-founder and managing director Tokunboh Ishmael said, “Lidya is tackling the fundamental challenge of providing access to credit for dynamic small and growing businesses that otherwise have limited options for financing working capital to scale their businesses in Africa and Europe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alitheia Capital and Goodwell are  pleased to be backing a team whose mission aligns with our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">objective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of driving growth  and social impact by enabling access and inclusion to finance and financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s quite rare to see expansion moves from Nigerian or African startups to Europe. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An exception to that might be South African startups who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">frequently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open offices in the U.K. and the Netherlands</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kehinde relishes the company&#8217;s achievement so far, having </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gained some foothold in both the Czech Republic and Poland. He says there is more to expect from the five-year-old digital lender</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> excited about the fact that we started in Nigeria and now our product is live in two European countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people come into Nigeria from other parts of the world but we&#8217;ve gone from Nigeria to other parts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We&#8217;re proud of the traction we&#8217;ve gotten in our push to build the biggest finance house for SMEs in our markets.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Planet, which operates a network of around 200 satellites that provides Earth imaging, as well as analytics of the data derived from that observation, is going public in a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) dMY Technology Group IV. The deal has a post-transaction equity value of $2.8 billion, and will provide Planet with $545 million in cash balance at close, including $345 million from dMY IV&#8217;s contribution, and a $200 million PIPE provided by BlackRock-managed funds, Koch Strategic Platforms, Marc Benioff&#8217;s TIME Ventures and Google.</p>
<p>After a bit of a lull, Planet is now the second significant private space company this week to take the SPAC route to public markets. Both are in the business of Earth observation, though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">Satellogic, which announced its own SPAC merger on Tuesday,</a> operates on a much smaller scale at the moment. Planet, founded in 2010, has raised around $374 million to date, and operates the largest Earth imaging satellite constellation in operation.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s mission has been to transform the way Earth imaging data is collected and provided to commercial interests here on Earth. Planet&#8217;s network can provide a complete scan of all of the Earth&#8217;s landmass on a daily basis, and it offers that to customers &#8220;via a Bloomer-like terminal for Earth data,&#8221; as Planet founder and CEO Wiill Marshall puts it. Access is provided on a subscription basis, and Planet says it generated over $100 million in revenue during its most recent fiscal year, which ended in January.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Planet intends to use the funds resulting from the merger in part to pay down its existing debt, and also to fund its existing operations and &#8220;support new and existing growth initiatives.&#8221; The aim to to complete the merger sometime later this year, at which point the combined entity will trade under the ticker &#8220;PL&#8221; on the NYSE.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facial recognition has been one of the more conflicted applications of artificial intelligence in the wider world: using computer vision to detect faces and subsequent identities of people has raised numerous questions about privacy, data protection, and the ethics underpinning the purposes of the work, and even the systems themselves. But on the other hand, it&#8217;s being adopted widely in a wide variety of use cases. Now one of the more controversial, but also successful, startups in the field has closed a big round of funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.anyvision.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AnyVision</a> &#8212; an Israeli startup that has built AI-based techniques to identify people by their faces, but also related tech such as temperature checks to detect higher temperatures in a crowd &#8212; has raised $235 million in funding, the company has confirmed.</p>
<p>This Series C, one of the bigger rounds for an AI startup, is being co-led by SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 and Eldridge Industries, with previous investors also participating. (They are not named but the list includes Robert Bosch GmbH, Qualcomm Ventures and Lightspeed.) The company is not disclosing its valuation but we are asking. However, it has to be a sizable hike for the company, which had previously raised around $116 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/153417-70/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a>, and has racked up a big list of customers since its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200903005868/en/AnyVision-Raises-43-Million-as-the-Demand-for-Safe-Seamless-Access-to-Shared-Spaces-and-Remote-Services-Skyrockets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last round in 2020</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Worth noting, too, that AnyVision&#8217;s CEO Avi Golan is a former operating partner at SoftBank&#8217;s investment arm.</p>
<p>AnyVision said the funding will be used to continue developing its SDKs, specifically to work in edge computing devices &#8212; smart cameras, body cameras, and chips that will be used in other devices &#8212; to increase the performance and speed of its systems.</p>
<p>Its systems, meanwhile, are used in video surveillance, watchlist alerts, and scenarios where an organization is looking to monitor crowds and control them, for example to keep track of numbers, to analyse dwell times in retail environments, or to flag illegal or dangerous behavior.</p>
<p>“AnyVision’s innovations in Recognition AI helped transform passive cameras into proactive security systems and empowered organizations take a more holistic view to advanced security threats,” Golan said in a statement in the investment announcement. “The Access Point AI platform is designed to protect people, places, and privacy while simultaneously reducing costs, power, bandwidth, and operational complexity.”</p>
<p class="font_8">You may recognize the name AnyVision because of how much it has been in the press.</p>
<p class="font_8">The startup was the subject of a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/why-did-microsoft-fund-israeli-firm-surveils-west-bank-palestinians-n1072116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report in 2019</a> that alleged that its technology was being quietly used by the Israeli government to run surveillance on Palestinians in the West Bank.</p>
<p class="font_8">The company denied it, but the story quickly turned into a huge stain on its reputation, while also adding more scrutiny overall to the field of facial recognition.</p>
<p class="font_8">That led to Microsoft, which had invested in AnyVision via its M12 venture arm, to run a full audit of the investment and its position on facial recognition investments overall. <a href="https://www.anyvision.co/2020/03/27/ethics-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimately, Microsoft divested its stake</a> and pledged not to invest in further technology like it.</p>
<p>Since then, AnyVision has been working hard to spin itself as the &#8220;ethical&#8221; player in this space, acknowledging that there is a lot of work and shortcomings in the bigger market of facial recognition. But controversy has continued to court the company.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/exclusive-why-us-hospital-oil-company-turned-facial-recognition-2021-04-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> in April of this year highlighted just how many companies were using AnyVision&#8217;s technology today, ranging from hospitals like Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles to major retailers like Macy&#8217;s and energy giant BP. AnyVision&#8217;s connections to power go beyond simply having big customers: it also turns out that the White House Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, once served as a communications consultant to the startup.</p>
<p>Then, a report published <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/07/06/this-manual-for-a-popular-facial-recognition-tool-shows-just-how-much-the-software-tracks-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just yesterday in The Markup</a>, combed through various public records for AnyVision, including a user guidebook from 2019, which also painted a pretty damning picture of just how much information the company can collect, and what it has been working on. (One pilot, and subsequent report resulting from it, involved tracking children in a school district in Texas: AnyVision collected 5,000 student photos and ran more than 164,000 detections in just seven days.)</p>
<p>There are other cases where you might imagine, however, that AnyVision&#8217;s technology might be deemed helpful or useful, maybe even welcomed. Its ability to detect temperatures, for example, and identify who may have been in contact with high-temperature people, could go a long way towards controlling less obvious cases of Covid-19, for example, helping contain the virus at mass events, providing a safeguard to enable those events to go ahead.</p>
<p>And to be completely clear, AnyVision is not the only company building and deploying this technology, nor the only one coming under scrutiny. Another, the U.S. company Clearview AI, is used by thousands of governments and law enforcement agencies, but earlier this year it was deemed &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illegal</a>&#8221; by Canadian privacy authorities.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems that the story is not complete, either in terms of how these technologies will develop, how they will be used, and how the public comes to view them. For now, the traction AnyVision has had, even despite the controversy and ethical questions, seems to have swayed SoftBank.</p>
<p class="font_8">“The visual recognition market is nascent but has large potential in the Western world,&#8221; said Anthony Doeh, a partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. &#8220;We have witnessed the transformative power of AI, biometrics and edge computing in other categories, and believe AnyVision is uniquely placed to redefine physical environment analytics across numerous industries.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/all-84-startups-from-y-combinators-s19-demo-day-1/">Y-Combinator-</a>backed <a href="https://www.localyzeapp.com">Localyze</a> has nabbed $12 million in Series A funding led by Blossom Capital for a SaaS that supports staff relocations and hiring across borders.</p>
<p>Previous investor Frontline Ventures also participated,with a number of angel investors joining the round &#8212; including Andrew Robb (ex-Farfetch); Des Traynor, co-founder and CSO at Intercom; Hanno Renner, co-founder and CEO at Personio; David Clarke, former CTO at Workday; and Michael Wax, CEO of Forto.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2021, the Hamburg, Germany-based startup &#8212; which was founded in 2018 by a trio of women: CEO Hanna Asmussen, COO Lisa Dahlke, and CTO Franzi Löw &#8212; saw a record 300% revenue bump.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Localyze&#8217;s current roster of customers include the likes of Free Now, Trade Republic, Babbel, Thoughtworks, Tier Mobility, DeepL, Forto and Personio.</p>
<p>The startup suggests the pandemic-triggered rise in remote working is helping to drive demand for relocations as employees reassess where they want to be physically based. Its SaaS aims to streamline immigration-related admin tasks like visa applications; work and residence permits and registration; as well as providing help with housing and banking in the destination country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very interesting, we did of course see a negative impact from COVID-19 in 2020 but the main reason why we never worried about our business model is that we knew the businesses have never been the only driver of relocations,&#8221; Asmussen tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did a survey among the internationals we relocated and 98% stated that they wanted to relocate, and weren’t forced by the company. I of course believe that some people will choose not to relocate but at the same time, the increased flexibility [of remote working] opens many more doors for other people to relocate &#8212; and also for different time frames.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, Localyze says it&#8217;s helped more than 2,000 people from over 100 countries relocate internationally. But it reckons that&#8217;s just the start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Relocation is becoming a benefit at some companies, and the overall number of people moving across borders during their working life is increasing drastically,&#8221; argues Asmussen.</p>
<p>Before COVID-19 hit and reconfigured so much of how we live, almost two million people relocated for work within Europe each year. But Localyze cites a PwC study on mobility in the global skilled workforce that suggests employee relocation is set to increase by 50% as we emerge from the pandemic.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;While the percentage of the global skilled workforce that is mobile &#8212; meaning that they work or worked abroad &#8212; is currently still very low, around 20% I think, it is expected to grow to up to 80% in the next decade,&#8221; she suggests. </span></p>
<p>Localyze&#8217;s SaaS is designed to simplify and support staff relocations or cross-border hiring, offering digital tools to automate admin and case tracking, helping companies and employees navigate what can be complex, bureaucratic and even stressful immigration requirements.</p>
<p>&#8220;We developed a software that automates large parts of the relevant processes around global mobility,&#8221; explains Asmussen. &#8220;The core of our technology is a pipeline system that maps out all possibilities of how the employee can enter a country and matches the pipeline with the characteristics of that employee (e.g. nationality, family status or education). This guarantees that the employee gets all the relevant information throughout his/her process and that our case managers can focus on more individual questions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;One big advantage of this pipeline system is that we built a no-code solution to manage it. Together with our CMS to edit the content of the steps, we are able to quickly expand the usability of our software to new countries and use cases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;On the HR side our software helps to manage and track the process of all employees with the ease of mind that we notify them about changes or required actions. The HR manager can simply add a case, or transfer information over through our integration with their HRIS and we take it from there.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Asmussen says the core of the platform is the automation of the paperwork with the startup supplementing that by providing a level of (human) support &#8212; in the form of case workers, who can field users&#8217; questions and/or troubleshoot issues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Case types its platform handles &#8212; such as obtaining a new visa, getting an extension etc &#8212; get broken down into a series of individual tasks that need to be carried out (and checked off), with the individual set of &#8216;dos&#8217; determined by the characteristics of the person (origin, family, salary, etc.).</p>
<p dir="ltr">So essentially it&#8217;s built a decision tree with 30-50 variations per country, based on the specificity of each set of rules.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The employee is seeing this as a personalized set of to do’s in her/his dashboard and can then go through them,&#8221; notes Asmussen, adding: &#8220;The case managers are there for questions and to give additional guidance when problems occur.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Thanks to the automation engine, we can operate at 80% gross margin today.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Localyze also offers a &#8220;pre-check&#8221; feature that give companies the opportunity to get information on a case that&#8217;s being considered &#8212; such as showing information on applicable conditions like the salary limits associated with a role when it comes to the visa of a new hire and the timeline that may be involved &#8212; to  make it easier for them to understand the complexity of a case. (Which may in turn help them make an informed decision on a start date for a particular hire.)</p>
<p>The startup says it&#8217;s been seeing growth rates hitting, on average, more than 30% month-on-month, as employer demand for its services accelerates.</p>
<p>The Series A funding will be used to capitalize on growing demand by expanding into new regions &#8212; with Localyze saying it will start by focusing on &#8220;major hubs&#8221; for international talent, in Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and the UK, so it can target more high-growth companies with offices across Europe.</p>
<p>Currently it has over 120 customers &#8212; and it&#8217;s expecting that to double by the end of the year.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also predicts existing accounts will expand in value &#8212; with Asmussen saying it&#8217;s closing larger ACVs (annual contract value), and seeing existing accounts &#8220;grow strongly&#8221; over time. (It offers tiered pricing for the SaaS, based on usage.)</span></p>
<p><span class="im">Europe remains the primary focus for its business currently &#8212; with all cases it supports entailing helping customers relocate staff to the region (&#8220;from all over the world&#8221;) and within Europe itself. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;The predominant destinations are Germany, Ireland, Spain and the UK,&#8221; says Asmussen. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;With the funding, we want to accelerate our expansion in the UK, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal &amp; Spain, besides our core market Germany. We’ve been operating in these markets for a while and now look at strengthening our go to market across Europe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">She says Localyze&#8217;s</span> 25-strong team will at least double by the end of the year, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">with the startup planning to hire across all teams &#8212; with a particular focus on expanding engineering and product to keep pace with the scaling business; and beefing up sales and customer support capacity to support its continued growth.  </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">On the competitor front, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Asmussen</span> names Estonia-headquartered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/refocusing-on-relocation-jobbatical-launches-new-offices-in-spain-and-germany/">Jobbatical</a> as its closest rival for relocation support with the same digital focus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also points to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/going-global-with-brynne-kennedy-topia-disrupt-berlin-2018/">Topia</a> as providing some competing services &#8212; but says it has more of a focus on software for HR professionals and integrating partners vs <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Localyze </span>providing both a HR and an employee portal plus the &#8216;glue&#8217; of its &#8220;automation engine&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Localyze also argues it differentiates vs &#8220;</span>more traditional&#8221; relocation agencies (e.g. Cartus and Graebel), per <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Asmussen, </span>because it offers &#8220;end-to-end support&#8221; in a fully digital form &#8212; giving users &#8220;full visibility and transparency at all times&#8221;, as <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">she tells it, </span>and helping to streamline and simplify processes in &#8220;what has previously been a complex and confusing space&#8221;.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Increased flexibility of work and and mobility of the global workforce looks set to be one firm (and typically welcome) legacy of the pandemic &#8212; one which <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Localyze already had a handle on supporting, putting it in a strong position to scale its SaaS as demand steps up in the coming years.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Rising levels of employee mobility may, in turn, make subscribing to a software service that assists relocations and cross-border hiring more of a &#8216;must have&#8217; than a &#8216;nice to have&#8217; for more types of businesses &#8212; especially as competition for talent heats up given the rising opportunities of remote work.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In 2021, companies will need to define how they are going to operate post-COVID-19, and many companies keep locations as part of their people strategy. Yet they try to offer more flexibility in terms of location choices, which in many cases results in the creation of different talent hubs and a mix of remote with in-person hubs/offices. This means increased operations across borders and more employee mobility, both long and short-term, because people will make use of these options,&#8221; Asmussen predicts. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on the Series A in a statement, Blossom Capital&#8217;s Ophelia Brown added: “Access to the very best talent is a huge consideration for businesses of all sizes, but for high-growth enterprises, it’s absolutely crucial that nothing gets in the way of being able to tap into the skills and abilities of staff anywhere in Europe. Localyze removes all of these barriers. Instead of being bogged down by the costly and lengthy relocation processes, enterprises can concentrate on the job at hand and their employees can feel confident and secure that their relocation – often one of the biggest decisions they’ll have to make in their career – is dealt with efficiently and without a hitch.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For years YouTube&#8217;s video-recommending algorithm has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth">stood accused</a> of fuelling a grab-bag of societal ills by feeding users an AI-amplified diet of hate speech, political extremism and/or conspiracy junk/disinformation for the profiteering motive of trying to keep billions of eyeballs stuck to its ad inventory.</p>
<p>And while YouTube&#8217;s tech giant parent Google has, sporadically, responded to negative publicity flaring up around the algorithm&#8217;s antisocial recommendations &#8212; announcing a few <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/14/in-major-policy-change-youtube-is-now-taking-down-more-videos-of-known-extremists/">policy tweaks</a> or limiting/purging the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/youtube-tightens-restrictions-on-channel-of-uk-far-right-activist-but-no-ban/">odd hateful account</a> &#8212; it&#8217;s not clear how far the platform&#8217;s penchant for promoting horribly unhealthy clickbait has actually been rebooted.</p>
<p>The suspicion remains nowhere near far enough.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New research published today by Mozilla backs that notion up, suggesting YouTube&#8217;s AI continues to puff up piles of &#8216;bottom-feeding&#8217;/low grade/divisive/disinforming content &#8212; stuff that tries to grab eyeballs by triggering people&#8217;s sense of outrage, sewing division/polarization or spreading baseless/harmful disinformation &#8212; which in turn implies that YouTube&#8217;s problem with recommending terrible stuff is indeed systemic; a side-effect of the platform&#8217;s rapacious appetite to harvest views to serve ads.</p>
<p>That YouTube&#8217;s AI is still &#8212; per Mozilla&#8217;s study &#8212; behaving so badly also suggests Google has been pretty successful at fuzzing criticism with superficial claims of reform.</p>
<p>The mainstay of its deflective success here is likely the primary protection mechanism of keeping the recommender engine&#8217;s algorithmic workings (and associated data) hidden from public view and external oversight &#8212; via the convenient shield of &#8216;commercial secrecy&#8217;.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">regulation</a> that could help crack open proprietary AI blackboxes is now on the cards &#8212; at least in Europe.</p>
<p>To fix YouTube&#8217;s algorithm, Mozilla is calling for &#8220;common sense transparency laws, better oversight, and consumer pressure&#8221; &#8212; suggesting a combination of laws that mandate transparency into AI systems; protect independent researchers so they can interrogate algorithmic impacts; and empower platform users with robust controls (such as the ability to opt out of &#8220;personalized&#8221; recommendations) are what&#8217;s needed to rein in the worst excesses of the YouTube AI.</p>

<p>To gather data on specific recommendations being made made to YouTube users &#8212; information that Google does not routinely make available to external researchers &#8212; Mozilla took a crowdsourced approach, via a browser extension (called <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/regrets-reporter/">RegretsReporter</a>) that lets users self-report YouTube videos they &#8220;regret&#8221; watching.</p>
<p>The tool can generate a report which includes details of the videos the user had been recommended, as well as earlier video views, to help build up a picture of how YouTube&#8217;s recommender system was functioning. (Or, well, &#8216;dysfunctioning&#8217; as the case may be.)</p>
<p>The crowdsourced volunteers whose data fed Mozilla&#8217;s research reported a wide variety of ‘regrets’, including videos spreading COVID-19 fear-mongering, political misinformation and “wildly inappropriate” children’s cartoons, per the report &#8212; with the most frequently reported content categories being misinformation, violent/graphic content, hate speech and spam/scams.</p>
<p>A substantial majority (71%) of the regret reports came from videos that had been recommended by YouTube’s algorithm itself, underscoring the AI&#8217;s starring role in pushing junk into people&#8217;s eyeballs.</p>
<p>The research also found that recommended videos were 40% more likely to be reported by the volunteers than videos they’d searched for themselves.</p>
<p>Mozilla even found “several” instances when the recommender algorithmic put content in front of users that violated YouTube’s own community guidelines and/or was unrelated to the previous video watched. So a clear fail.</p>
<p>A very notable finding was that regrettable content appears to be a greater problem for YouTube users in non-English speaking countries: Mozilla found YouTube regrets were 60% higher in countries without English as a primary language — with Brazil, Germany and France generating what the report said were “particularly high” levels of regretful YouTubing. (And none of the three can be classed as minor international markets.)</p>
<p>Pandemic-related regrets were also especially prevalent in non-English speaking countries, per the report &#8212; a worrying detail to read in the middle of an ongoing global health crisis.</p>
<p>The crowdsourced study — which Mozilla bills as the largest-ever into YouTube’s recommender algorithm — drew on data from more than 37,000 YouTube users who installed the extension, although it was a subset of 1,162<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> volunteers &#8212; from 91 countries &#8212; who submitted reports that flagged 3,362 regrettable videos which the report draws on directly. </span></p>
<p>These reports were generated between July 2020 and May 2021.</p>
<p>What exactly does Mozilla mean by a YouTube “regret”? It says this is a crowdsourced concept based on users self-reporting bad experiences on YouTube, so it&#8217;s a subjective measure. But Mozilla argues that taking this “people-powered” approach centres the lived experiences of Internet users and is therefore helpful in foregrounding the experiences of marginalised and/or vulnerable people and communities (vs, for example, applying only a narrower, legal definition of &#8216;harm&#8217;).</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to interrogate and explore further [people&#8217;s experiences of falling down the YouTube &#8216;rabbit hole&#8217;] and frankly confirm some of these stories &#8212; but then also just understand further what are some of the trends that emerged in that,&#8221; explained Brandi Geurkink, <span class="il">Mozilla</span>’s senior manager of advocacy and the lead researcher for the project, discussing the aims of the research.</p>
<p>&#8220;My main feeling in doing this work was being &#8212; I guess &#8212; shocked that some of what we had expected to be the case was confirmed&#8230; It&#8217;s still a limited study in terms of the number of people involved and the methodology that we used but &#8212; even with that &#8212; it was quite simple; the data just showed that some of what we thought was confirmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things like the algorithm recommending content essentially accidentally, that it later is like &#8216;oops, this actually violates our policies; we shouldn&#8217;t have actively suggested that to people&#8217;&#8230; And things like the non-English-speaking user base having worse experiences &#8212; these are things you hear discussed a lot anecdotally and activists have raised these issues. But I was just like &#8212; oh wow, it&#8217;s actually coming out really clearly in our data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mozilla says the crowdsourced research uncovered “numerous examples” of reported content that would likely or actually breach YouTube’s community guidelines — such as hate speech or debunked political and scientific misinformation.</p>
<p>But it also says the reports flagged a lot of what YouTube &#8220;may&#8221; consider ‘borderline content’. Aka, stuff that&#8217;s harder to categorize — junk/low quality videos that perhaps toe the acceptability line and may therefore be trickier for the platform&#8217;s algorithmic moderation systems to respond to (and thus content that may also survive the risk of a take down for longer).</p>
<p>However a related issue the report flags is that YouTube doesn’t provide a definition for borderline content — despite discussing the category in its own guidelines &#8212; hence, says Mozilla, that makes the researchers&#8217; assumption that much of what the volunteers were reporting as &#8216;regretful&#8217; would likely fall into YouTube&#8217;s own ‘borderline content’ category impossible to verify.</p>
<p>The challenge of independently studying the societal effects of Google&#8217;s tech and processes is a running theme underlying the research. But Mozilla’s report also accuses the tech giant of meeting YouTube criticism with &#8220;inertia and opacity&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not alone there either. Critics have long accused YouTube&#8217;s ad giant parent of profiting off-of engagement generated by hateful outrage and harmful disinformation &#8212; allowing &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/19/youtube-more-ai-can-fix-ai-generated-bubbles-of-hate/">AI-generated bubbles of hate</a>&#8221; surface ever more baleful (and thus stickily engaging) stuff, exposing unsuspecting YouTube users to increasingly unpleasant and extremist views, even as Google gets to shield its low grade content business under a user-generated content umbrella.</p>
<p>Indeed, &#8216;falling down the YouTube rabbit hole&#8217; has become a well-trodden metaphor for discussing the process of unsuspecting Internet users being dragging into the darkest and nastiest corners of the web. This user reprogramming taking place in broad daylight via AI-generated suggestions that yell at people to follow the conspiracy breadcrumb trail right from inside a mainstream web platform.</p>
<p>Back as 2017 &#8212; when concern was riding high about online terrorism and the proliferation of ISIS content on social media &#8212; politicians in Europe were accusing YouTube&#8217;s algorithm of exactly this: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/19/youtube-more-ai-can-fix-ai-generated-bubbles-of-hate/">Automating radicalization</a>.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s remained difficult to get hard data to back up anecdotal reports of individual YouTube users being &#8216;radicalized&#8217; after viewing hours of extremist content or conspiracy theory junk on Google&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>Ex-YouTube insider &#8212; Guillaume Chaslot &#8212; is one notable critic who&#8217;s sought to pull back the curtain shielding the proprietary tech from deeper scrutiny, via his <a href="https://www.algotransparency.org">algotransparency</a> project.</p>
<p>Mozilla&#8217;s crowdsourced research adds to those efforts by sketching a broad &#8212; and broadly problematic &#8212; picture of the YouTube AI by collating reports of bad experiences from users themselves.</p>
<p>Of course externally sampling platform-level data that only Google holds in full (at its true depth and dimension) can&#8217;t be the whole picture &#8212; and self-reporting, in particular, may introduce its own set of biases into Mozilla&#8217;s data-set. But the problem of effectively studying big tech&#8217;s blackboxes is a key point accompanying the research, as Mozilla advocates for proper oversight of platform power.</p>
<p>In a series of recommendations the report calls for “robust transparency, scrutiny, and giving people control of recommendation algorithms” — arguing that without proper oversight of the platform, YouTube will continue to be harmful by mindlessly exposing people to damaging and braindead content.</p>
<p>The problematic lack of transparency around so much of how YouTube functions can be picked up from other details in the report. For example, Mozilla found that around 9% of recommended regrets (or almost 200 videos) had since been taken down — for a variety of not always clear reasons (sometimes, presumably, after the content was reported and judged by YouTube to have violated its guidelines).</p>
<p>Collectively, just this subset of videos had had a total of 160M views prior to being removed for whatever reason.</p>
<p>In other findings, the research found that regretful views tend to perform well on the platform.</p>
<p>A particular stark metric is that reported regrets acquired a full 70% more views per day than other videos watched by the volunteers on the platform &#8212; lending weight to the argument that YouTube’s engagement-optimising algorithms disproportionately select for triggering/misinforming content more often than quality (thoughtful/informing) stuff simply because it brings in the clicks.</p>
<p>While that might be great for Google&#8217;s ad business, it&#8217;s clearly a net negative for democratic societies which value truthful information over nonsense; genuine public debate over artificial/amplified binaries; and constructive civic cohesion over divisive tribalism.</p>
<p>But without legally-enforced transparency requirements on ad platforms &#8212; and, most likely, regulatory oversight and enforcement that features audit powers &#8212; these tech giants are going to continue to be incentivized to turn a blind eye and cash in at society&#8217;s expense.</p>
<p>Mozilla&#8217;s report also underlines instances where YouTube&#8217;s algorithms are clearly driven by a logic that’s unrelated to the content itself — with a finding that in 43.6% of the cases where the researchers had data about the videos a participant had watched before a reported regret the recommendation was completely unrelated to the previous video.</p>
<p>The report gives examples of some of these logic-defying AI content pivots/leaps/pitfalls &#8212; such as a person watching videos about the U.S. military and then being recommended a misogynistic video entitled &#8216;Man humiliates feminist in viral video.&#8217;</p>
<p>In another instance, a person watched a video about software rights and was then recommended a video about gun rights. So two rights make yet another wrong YouTube recommendation right there.</p>
<p>In a third example, a person watched an Art Garfunkel music video and was then recommended a political video entitled &#8216;Trump Debate Moderator EXPOSED as having Deep Democrat Ties, Media Bias Reaches BREAKING Point.&#8217;</p>
<p>To which the only sane response is, umm what???</p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s output in such instances seems &#8212; at best &#8212; some sort of &#8216;AI brain fart&#8217;.</p>
<p>A generous interpretation might be that the algorithm got stupidly confused. Albeit, in a number of the examples cited in the report, the confusion is leading YouTube users toward content with a right-leaning political bias. Which seems, well, curious.</p>
<p>Asked what she views as the most concerning findings, Mozilla&#8217;s Geurkink told TechCrunch: &#8220;One is how clearly misinformation emerged as a dominant problem on the platform. I think that&#8217;s something, based on our work talking to Mozilla supporters and people from all around the world, that is a really obvious thing that people are concerned about online. So to see that that is what is emerging as the biggest problem with the YouTube algorithm is really concerning to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also highlighted the problem of the recommendations being worse for non-English-speaking users as another major concern, suggesting that global inequalities in users&#8217; experiences of platform impacts &#8220;doesn&#8217;t get enough attention&#8221; &#8212; even when such issues do get discussed.</p>
<p>Responding to Mozilla&#8217;s report in a statement, a Google spokesperson sent us this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The goal of our recommendation system is to connect viewers with content they love and on any given day, more than 200 million videos are recommended on the homepage alone. Over 80 billion pieces of information is used to help inform our systems, including survey responses from viewers on what they want to watch. We constantly work to improve the experience on YouTube and over the past year alone, we’ve launched over 30 different changes to reduce recommendations of harmful content. Thanks to this change, consumption of borderline content that comes from our recommendations is now significantly below 1%.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Google also claimed it welcomes research into YouTube &#8212; and suggested it&#8217;s exploring options to bring in external researchers to study the platform, without offering anything concrete on that front.</p>
<p>At the same time, its response queried how Mozilla&#8217;s study defines &#8216;regrettable&#8217; content &#8212; and went on to claim that its own user surveys generally show users are satisfied with the content that YouTube recommends.</p>
<p>In further non-quotable remarks, Google noted that earlier this year it started disclosing a &#8216;<a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/building-greater-transparency-and-accountability/">violative view rate</a>&#8216; (VVR) metric for YouTube &#8212; disclosing for the first time the percentage of views on YouTube that comes from content that violates its policies.</p>
<p>The most recent VVR stands at 0.16-0.18% &#8212; which Google says means that out of every 10,000 views on YouTube, 16-18 come from violative content. It said that figure is down by more than 70% when compared to the same quarter of 2017 &#8212; crediting its investments in machine learning as largely being responsible for the drop.</p>
<p>However, as Geurkink noted, the VVR is of limited use without Google releasing more data to contextualize and quantify how far its AI was involved in accelerating views of content its own rules state shouldn&#8217;t be viewed on its platform. Without that key data the suspicion must be that the VVR is a nice bit of misdirection.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would be going further than [VVR] &#8212; and what would be really, really helpful &#8212; is understanding what&#8217;s the role that the recommendation algorithm plays in this?&#8221; Geurkink told us on that, adding: &#8220;That&#8217;s what is a complete blackbox still. In the absence of greater transparency [Google&#8217;s] claims of progress have to be taken with a grain of salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google also flagged a 2019 change it made to how YouTube&#8217;s recommender algorithm handles &#8216;borderline content&#8217; &#8212; aka, content that doesn&#8217;t violate policies but falls into a problematic grey area &#8212; saying that that tweak had also resulted in a 70% drop in watchtime for this type of content.</p>
<p>Although the company confirmed this borderline category is a moveable feast &#8212; saying it factors in changing trends as well as context and also works with experts to determine what&#8217;s get classed as borderline &#8212; which makes the aforementioned percentage drop pretty meaningless since there&#8217;s no fixed baseline to measure against.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that Google&#8217;s response to Mozilla&#8217;s report makes no mention of the poor experience reported by survey participants in non-English-speaking markets. And <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Geurkink suggested that, in general, many of the claimed mitigating measures YouTube applies are geographically limited &#8212; i.e. to English-speaking markets like the US and UK. (Or at least arrive in those markets first, before a slower rollout to other places.) </span></p>
<p>A January 2019 tweak to reduce amplification of conspiracy theory content in the US was only expanded to the UK market months later &#8212; in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/youtube-to-reduce-conspiracy-theory-recommendations-in-the-uk/">August</a> &#8212; for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;YouTube, for the past few years, have only been reporting on their progress of recommendations of harmful or borderline content in the US and in English-speaking markets,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">she also</span> said. &#8220;And there are very few people questioning that &#8212; what about the rest of the world? To me that is something that really deserves more attention and more scrutiny.&#8221;</p>
<p>We asked Google to confirm whether it had since applied the 2019 conspiracy theory related changes globally &#8212; and a spokeswoman told us that it had. But the much higher rate of reports made to Mozilla of &#8212; a yes broader measure of &#8212; &#8216;regrettable&#8217; content being made in non-English-speaking markets remains notable.</p>
<p>And while there could be others factors at play, which might explain some of the disproportionately higher reporting, the finding may also suggest that, where YouTube&#8217;s negative impacts are concerned, Google directs greatest resource at markets and languages where its reputational risk and the capacity of its machine learning tech to automate content categorization are strongest.</p>
<p>Yet any such unequal response to AI risk obviously means leaving some users at greater risk of harm than others &#8212; adding another harmful dimension and layer of unfairness to what is already a multi-faceted, many-headed-hydra of a problem.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s yet another reason why leaving it up to powerful platforms to rate their own AIs, mark their own homework and counter genuine concerns with self-serving PR is for the birds.</p>
<p>(In additional filler background remarks it sent us, Google described itself as the first company in the industry to incorporate &#8220;authoritativeness&#8221; into its search and discovery algorithms &#8212; without explaining when exactly it claims to have done that or how it imagined it would be able to deliver on its stated mission of &#8216;organizing the world&#8217;s information and making it universally accessible and useful&#8217; without considering the relative value of information sources&#8230; So color us baffled at that claim. Most likely it&#8217;s a clumsy attempt to throw disinformation shade at rivals.)</p>
<p>Returning to the regulation point, an EU proposal &#8212; the Digital Services Act &#8212; is set to introduce some transparency requirements on large digital platforms, as part of a wider package of accountability measures. And asked about this <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Geurkink</span> described the DSA as &#8220;a promising avenue for greater transparency&#8221;.</p>
<p>But she suggested the legislation needs to go further to tackle recommender systems like the YouTube AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that transparency around recommender systems specifically and also people having control over the input of their own data and then the output of recommendations is really important &#8212; and is a place where the DSA is currently a bit sparse, so I think that&#8217;s where we really need to dig in,&#8221; she told us.</p>
<p>One idea she voiced support for is having a &#8220;data access framework&#8221; baked into the law &#8212; to enable vetted researchers to get more of the information they need to study powerful AI technologies &#8212; i.e. rather than the law trying to come up with &#8220;a laundry list of all of the different pieces of transparency and information that should be applicable&#8221;, as she put it.</p>
<p>The EU also now has a draft AI regulation on the table. The legislative plan takes a risk-based approach to regulating certain applications of artificial intelligence. However it&#8217;s not clear whether YouTube&#8217;s recommender system would fall under one of the more closely regulated categories &#8212; or, as seems more likely (at least with the initial Commission proposal), fall entirely outside the scope of the planned law.</p>
<p>&#8220;An earlier draft of the proposal talked about systems that manipulate human behavior which is essentially what recommender systems are. And one could also argue that&#8217;s the goal of advertising at large, in some sense. So it was sort of difficult to understand exactly where recommender systems would fall into that,&#8221; noted Geurkink.</p>
<p>&#8220;There might be a nice harmony between some of the robust data access provisions in the DSA and the new AI regulation,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I think transparency is what it comes down to, so anything that can provide that kind of greater transparency is a good thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;YouTube could also just provide a lot of this&#8230; We&#8217;ve been working on this for years now and we haven&#8217;t seen them take any meaningful action on this front but it&#8217;s also, I think, something that we want to keep in mind &#8212; legislation can obviously take years. So even if a few of our recommendations were taken up [by Google] that would be a really big step in the right direction.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just a Spotify used VC and PE backing to acquire the assets of the music industry so that we must now all rent our music via subscription, rather than own it for life, so a PropTech startup plans to follow a similar strategy for single-family homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.casafari.com/">Casafari</a>, a real estate data platform in Europe based out of Lisbon, Portugal, has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Prudence Holdings in New York. But, crucially, it has also secured a $120 million “mandate&#8221; from Geneva-based private equity investors Stoneweg, among other PE players, in order to buy-to-let residential and commercial real estate. The startup already has operations in Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy.</p>
<p>Other investors include Armilar Venture Partners (the Portuguese VC behind unicorns Outsystems and Feedzai), HJM Holdings, 1Sharpe (founders of Roofstock), and FJ Labs (Fabrice Grinda, founder of OLX Group), as well as existing investor Lakestar.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Mila Suharev, Nils Henning, and Mitya Moskalchuk in 2018, Casafari is taking advantage of Europe’s often chaotic real estate data to achieve its goals, due to the lack of a unified Multiple Listings Service (“MLS”).</p>
<p>Casafari plans to aggregate, verify and distribute this data via its platform, hunting down single-family homes as an asset class for institutional investors.</p>
<p>According to Nils Henning, CEO, “CASAFARI has built a unique ecosystem, which connects brokers, developers,  asset managers, and investors and enables sourcing, valuation, underwriting and deal collaboration on single units in all asset classes. We are very excited to represent important institutional clients like Stoneweg and others, in deploying their capital into  fragmented acquisitions at scale, bringing more liquidity to the market and generating more transactions to the broker clients of our platform.”</p>
<p>Private investors are already using the platform. Since launching in 2018, Casafari has been used by Sotheby’s International  Realty, Coldwell Banker, RE/MAX franchises, Savills, Fine &amp; Country, Engel &amp; Voelkers, Keller Williams, and important institutional investors and developers like Stoneweg, Kronos, Vanguard, and Vic Properties.</p>
<p>Mila Suharev, Casafari&#8217;s Co-CEO and CPO said: ”There are currently around 70 billion euros in dry powder in Europe that could be allocated in acquiring residential property in a buy to let strategy, and basically there&#8217;s no offer available. The property will be collected in portfolios, consisting of single units that pension funds, private equity real estate funds, want to build in Europe as they do in the US.”</p>
<p>What Casafari’s is doing is largely following the playbook of what Roofstock in the US did: an online marketplace for investing in leased single-family rental homes. Roofstock has raised  $132.3 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup founder, who hasn’t had much sleep all week, woke up on a recent Sunday to a phone call from his co-founder. A senior engineer was feeling burnt out and was contemplating leaving. For the founder, who had several calls scheduled with many high-profile Silicon Valley investors later in the day, talking this developer out of leaving the job quickly became the top agenda item for the rest of the weekend.</p>
<p>There’s a joke among many startup founders in Bangalore that hiring two to three engineers is currently more time-consuming and cumbersome than securing a fresh round of funding. Heavily-backed startups are paying big premiums to attract and retain talent, making it very challenging for their younger siblings to scale. And relying on recruiters is costly and still takes over a month to close a hire.</p>
<p>A good engineer with two to three years of experience with any recognizable startup expects $70,000 annually as salary, up from about $40,000 a year ago. A puzzled startup founder recently quizzed another peer in the industry how much a good QA engineer costs, and then answered the question himself: about $35,000, up from about $20,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most difficult to poach are those who work at unicorn fintechs CRED and RazorPay, many startup founders said. Engineers from either of the firms expect as much as $150,000 a year, if not more &#8212; often four to five times the amount founders at early stage startups draw themselves.</p>
<p>The intense competition for talent has been prompted by newly turned unicorns increasing the pool on their captables for employee stock options, a concept that was nearly elusive just three years ago. Scores of U.S. and European startups are also aggressively hiring in India as remote working begins to take off.</p>
<p>India has produced a record 16 unicorns this year as Tiger Global, Falcon Edge, and SoftBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/">cut large size checks to the nation’s promising startups</a> at a pace never witnessed before in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>Indian startups have raised a record $10.46 billion in the first half of 2021, up from $4 billion during the same period last year, and $5.4 billion in the first half of 2019, data insight platform Tracxn told me. (In all of 2020, Indian startups had raised $11.6 billion.)</p>
<p>The average size of a seed round in India was $1.1 million in the first half of 2021, up from $800,000 during the same period last year and $740,000 in 2019, per Tracxn. An average Series A check size this year has been $7.67 million, up from $4.30 million last year, and $5.92 million last year.</p>
<p>Even early-stage startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">at the centre of attraction</a> as virtually everyone is attempting to get in on a deal. Some second-time founders now have the confidence and networking to bypass Sequoia Capital India’s Surge accelerator program and Y Combinator and still gain access to some of the perks they offer.</p>

<p>Some aren’t engaging with funds at all for their seed financing rounds. Scores of startup founders from the past decade have accrued enough capital and reputation to write dozens of checks a year to early promising startups.</p>
<p>The abundance of dry powder in the market and the increased competition from some of the most reputable names in the industry have also changed the power dynamics between founders and investors. It’s becoming common for founders to negotiate from a place of strength to hold on the rights and preferential treatments from investors.</p>
<p>On a call recently, two founders discussed what many would consider a first-world dilemma: Dozens of investors had agreed to invest in them, but they no longer had so much stake to offer. So they strategize what stake to give whom and how to politely get others to reduce the size of their committed check size.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>But some investors are worried that the music may stop soon.</p>
<p>Investors at several high-profile firms told me that many startups are taking checks from Tiger Global / Falcon / SoftBank too early in their journeys.</p>
<p>They argue that many of these young startups have raised funds at such a high valuation that if they are not able to hit the metrics they have told their existing lead investors, very few in the industry would be in a position to engage with them at a later stage.</p>
<p>“And even the likes of Tiger will not back you then,” one investor said, pointing to examples such as Bangalore-based Upstox, which raised from Tiger Global in the past, but later Tiger<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/"> invested in its chief rival Groww</a>. “Tiger is backing the race, not the horse,” another investor said.</p>
<p>A down cycle is a scenario many investors are preparing for. But it appears the music, so to speak, has only gotten louder in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Bangalore-based edtech <strong>Brightchamps</strong> is in advanced stages of talks to raise at over $500 million valuation, while <strong>Ola Electric</strong> has held talks to raise at over $3 billion valuation, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Fidelity and Goldman Sachs have held talks to invest in a pre-IPO round of <strong>Paytm</strong>, one person said.</p>
<p><strong>ShareChat</strong> is about to raise $150 million to $200 million from Temasek and others at a pre-money valuation of $2.8 billion. Prosus Ventures is in advanced stages of talks to lead an investment in <strong>Upstox</strong>.</p>
<p>Sequoia is in talks to invest in <strong>Gitcoin</strong> and back <strong>Dive</strong> again, while <strong>Infra.Market</strong>, which was valued at $200 million in December last year and $1 billion earlier this year, is in talks to raise at over $2 billion valuation. Many other startups that turned unicorns this year are also in the market to finalize new rounds. <strong>BharatPe</strong>, <strong>Open</strong>, and <strong>Yap</strong> are in advanced stages of talks to finalize new rounds, TechCrunch has reported in recent weeks.</p>
<p>There are at least seven more $50 million+ rounds, and more than a dozen $20 million+ rounds that are expected to close within weeks.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Bangalore, there’s another sense of urgency.</p>
<p>Several founders in India are starting crypto startups for customers across the world, but high-profile investors in India have largely stayed away from this category, in part, because of India&#8217;s confusing stand about virtual currencies. Their absence has resulted in many of these startups secure funds from international funds and angels.</p>
<p>But this may change soon. Several venture funds including Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed, Accel, WEH, and Kalaari are currently building their thesis for investments in crypto startups, people familiar with the matter told me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.renegadepartners.com/">Renegade Partners</a> &#8212; a Bay Area-based venture firm cofounded by veteran VCs Renata Quintini and Roseanne Wincek &#8212; is taking the wraps off a $100 million debut venture fund that&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capitalists-renata-quintini-roseanne-wincek-to-raise-300-million-for-debut-fund-11568145232">capturing the imagination</a> of the business press since almost its conception in late 2019.</p>
<p>The effort is interesting for a number of reasons, not least because of the backgrounds of both Quintini and Wincek, both of whom left powerhouse venture firms to join forces. Quintini, a trained attorney, was an investment manager with Stanford University&#8217;s endowment before being recruited into Felicis Ventures, after which she was poached by Lux Capital. Across those firms, she worked closely with a number of high-flying startups, including the autonomous driving company  Cruise, the satellite startup Planet, and the clothing company Bonobos.</p>
<p>Wincek was meanwhile once set on nabbing a PhD at UC Berkeley, instead leaving the school with a master&#8217;s degree in biophysics to head to Stanford for her MBA. From there, it was on to Canaan as a principal, and from there, she headed to IVP, where she rose through the senior ranks to partner, investing across enterprise and consumer companies that include Glossier, Compass, MasterClass, and TransferWise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not a new trend, successful VCs who happen to be women leaving established firms to create their own outfits. Think Mary Meeker of Bond, Dayna Grayson of Construct Capital, and Beth Seidenberg of Westlake Village BioPartners, just to name a few. But unlike some of its predecessors, Renegade isn&#8217;t limiting itself to playing a certain role in the venture universe. It isn&#8217;t bound to any sector. It isn&#8217;t marketing itself as an early-stage venture firm. What it is looking for is a fairly specific mix of traction, team, and market &#8212; a combination that it is finding in companies that are anywhere from their Series A to Series C stage.</p>
<p>Their in-house <a href="https://www.renegadepartners.com/ismael-hishon-rezaizadeh">head data scientist</a> is helping home in on companies in Renegade&#8217;s sweet spot, say the cofounders. So is a chief people officer with a <a href="https://www.renegadepartners.com/susan-alban">powerful resume</a> of her own (Uber, eBay); principal Chloe Breider, a former IVP investor who worked closely with Wincek; and, as Renegade&#8217;s &#8220;decision scientist,&#8221; the former professional poker player and best-selling author Annie Duke.</p>
<p>We talked with Quintini and Wincek earlier today to learn more about what they have assembled &#8212; and how Renegade makes its mark in an industry that has never been more competitive. Excerpts from that chat, below, have been edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: People would probably shiv someone to get a job at either firm where you worked. What drove you to leave, and who reached out to whom when it came time to partner?</strong></p>
<p>RW: We first met when I was a Canaan and Renata was at Felicis, and back then, there weren&#8217;t many women in venture, so [women VCs were like] &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a new one, &#8216;Come meet everybody.'&#8221; Over the years, we looked at a lot of stuff together, and especially after I moved to IVP,  I was always bugging Renata about what was in her portfolio.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we were at one of those big, boozy dinners, with a bunch of people of our age at a bunch of firms. We were all having the conversation like, &#8216;Oh, if I had my own firm, I would do this, and I would do that,&#8217; and Renata and I were finishing each other&#8217;s sentences. And I remember going up to her and saying, &#8220;We should have this conversation for real but maybe with less wine.&#8221; And that was Memorial Day of 2019.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Institutional investors sometimes worry about how well an emerging manager team will get along when they&#8217;re coming from different places. How did you address this?</strong></p>
<p>RQ: We were good friends, I thought Roseanne was a phenomenal investor, but frankly, we didn&#8217;t know if we would be good cofounders and that&#8217;s the biggest risk, right? We did ask: how do we de-risk this? And we actually hired a coach for what we jokingly refer to as marriage counseling. But we did a lot of work around how we handle stress and what success looks like and what our values are. We also spent a <em>lot</em> of time in hotel rooms, and I can tell you that Roseanne is more of a morning person than I am.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You were raising this in the middle of the pandemic. How did that impact fundraising?</strong></p>
<p>RQ: We had our first close on Friday, March 13, the weekend before COVID [started shutting everything down]. The Grand Princess Cruise was <a href="https://abc7news.com/grand-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-san-francisco-bay-port-of-oakland/10362884/">coming into the Bay</a>, and we&#8217;re on the phone with the LPs, and we didn&#8217;t know if people were to going to come through. I think if we didn&#8217;t have our track records to draw from, [the fund] wouldn&#8217;t have happened. We were very lucky that we were backed by institutional LPs &#8212; an Ivy League school, endowments, foundations, family offices. But we did not factor in COVID.</p>
<p><strong>TC: I see language about the &#8220;supercritical stage&#8221; on Renegade&#8217;s site. What does that mean?</strong></p>
<p>RW: That phrase is purposely vague, because we don&#8217;t think the stage definitions mean that much anymore. I started my career as a chemist way back when, and supercritical fluid is the state of matter that is neither liquid nor gas but both at the same time, and we feel like companies can be the same. There&#8217;s a product to market, there is some data, there&#8217;s early customer love and generally a sizable team, but they&#8217;re not the big growth companies yet, right? They&#8217;re not ready to raise a big growth round and pour fuel on the fire, and that&#8217;s how we think about [our ideal targets].</p>
<p>Our sweet spot is [a startup with] early revenue &#8212; from a quarter million dollars a year up to a million dollars a month &#8212; [that have] from 20 to 100 employees [and which are] raising rounds that are between $10 million and $50 million. Our first deal was actually a Series C deal, but we have Series A and Series B companies in the portfolio, too, that all sit in that sandbox.</p>
<p>RQ: There&#8217;s so much capital today that capital is cheap. But execution is expensive, so our focus is on preparing startups to execute as big, giant companies. It&#8217;s: How do I think about the organization as it scales? How do I think about the exact team that I need? How do I think about my option pool? About my founder role design? How do you manage your capital and leverage your board? Things are working so well for some founders that the wheels are falling off the bus; meanwhile, many are thinking about these same questions [that they never had time to sort out].</p>
<p><strong>TC: If you aren&#8217;t sector or stage focused, how do you whittle down what you&#8217;re looking to fund?</strong></p>
<p>RQ: One good thing about [the types of startups we&#8217;re backing] is that they were funded by somebody else before, so it&#8217;s a known universe, if you&#8217;re thinking about it from a data science perspective.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it&#8217;s applying the heuristics that Roseanne, myself, Chloe, Susan [Alban, Renage&#8217;s chief people officer], have had from a decade plus of investing and working at outlier companies. It&#8217;s not just a number. It&#8217;s the quality of revenue. It&#8217;s a combination of other breadcrumbs that the companies put out there in terms of who have they hired and what are customers thinking of their product, and is this company building a system of record, and what is the velocity of adoption. Technology alone can&#8217;t do [the work].</p>
<p><strong>TC: There&#8217;s so much money sloshing around right now. In terms of the advice you&#8217;re giving your portfolio companies, what do you tell them about how to react when someone knocks on the door and offers more funding right after they&#8217;ve closed a round?</strong></p>
<p>RQ: There are so many dimensions here.  First, you should look at it from your company&#8217;s needs. You got to deploy this capital, and you got to provide a return on this capital, and nothing is free, so the more money you raise, the higher the valuation you receive, it catches up to you in the next round because you got to clear that watermark.</p>
<p>[We also tell them to ask themselves] do you have investments to make? Do you have team to hire? Some founders we&#8217;ve talked with have said, &#8216;I&#8217;m not going to raise any more because I cannot go faster or deploy more than my model is already supporting.  I&#8217;m actually going to execute more and then take more [capital] down the road when I&#8217;m going to get more credit for the stuff that I built, and the ROI is going to be better.&#8217;</p>
<p>The other piece, too, is when you&#8217;re in a very competitive environment, you have to look at what&#8217;s happening around you. Sometimes if your competitors are raising and pushing the market forward, it may be a reason to think [about raising more than you&#8217;d planned] because maybe they can out-hire you or they can outspend you in certain areas and can generate more traction. So you can&#8217;t look at things in absolute terms. At the same time, there is no free money and a lot of founders unwittingly create more problems for themselves [by not thinking through what that next check means].</p>
<p><strong>TC: People see a women-led venture team and wonder how focused you will be on women-led startups.</strong></p>
<p>RQ: I think we&#8217;re great investors who happen to be female. Our primary focus is on diversity of experience and thoughts. Gender is  just one of the lenses, and diversity is one of the core values of organization because we believe that provides better returns.</p>
<p>RW: One thing that&#8217;s been really fun and validating and inspiring about all this is the people who do come out of the woodwork who are so excited [about Renegade], because representation matters. At the end of the day, this is how this changes. We chip away at this and soon, you won&#8217;t ask this question anymore because it won&#8217;t be topical. That&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you feel that the diversity matters for LPs? Do you think that diversity is going to be codified in the way that LPs are looking at investing in funds?</strong></p>
<p>RQ: Some lead with it. Others say, &#8216;Let me look at past returns. They look at lagging indicators.&#8217; Today, founders are picking investors who reflect their values, who they&#8217;re proud to be associated with &#8212; people who have their same energy people and will go to bat for them and with them. These are the returns of the future, regardless of whatever Cambridge tells you today about investments that were made in the past. Leading LPs know this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce in Europe is expected to grow 30% this year to <a href="https://internetretailing.net/rxgeu/rxgeu/european-ecommerce-revenues-jump-30-to-us465bn-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$465 billion</a>, and that&#8217;s giving rise to a new ecosystem of services built to cater to e-commerce merchants. In the latest development, <a href="https://www.juni.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juni</a>, a neobank that is built specifically for companies selling online, has closed a Series A of $21.5 million, only 12 weeks after officially opening for business.</p>
<p>The Series A is being co-led by partners from D<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ST Global and Felix Capital with previous backer Cherry Ventures and other early investors also participating. Gothenburg, Sweden-based Juni had previously raised a seed round fo €2 million ($2.4 million) back in November when it was still only in waiting-list mode.</span></p>
<p>Part of the reason that the latest funding has materialized so quickly is because Juni has had very strong take-up its three short months of life: Samir El-Sabini, Juni&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that startup has signed up 300 businesses from a waitlist of 3,000, representing customer growth of around 500% month-on-month. Customers, he said, were primarily those selling their own inventory; dropshippers selling on behalf of retailers; and performance marketers who have moved into selling goods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other reason is that Juni is doing so well on both the investor and customer fronts is because of what it has identified and understood, and is building to fix.</p>
<p>El-Sabini and his two co-founders Anders Oresdal (CTO) and Jonathan Sanders (COO) all come from a background of working in e-commerce and fintech (in fact, one previously was at expenses startup Pleo, which this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/pleo-raises-150m-at-a-1-7b-valuation-for-its-new-approach-to-managing-expenses-for-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a major round of funding</a>; and two others worked at another expense management startup) and so they know all too well the shortcomings of a lot of banking services when it comes to serving businesses carry out their business online.</p>
<p>As El-Sabini described it, while traditional banks have long courted SMBs as customers, they have never truly understood the dynamics, challenges and particularities of running an e-commerce business, and that has made them less responsive to the financial profiles and needs of these companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do is that we provide insights and knowledge of the e-commerce industry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we can have a low risk profile because we understand all the cost centers. We understand what Taboola is, we know Shopify.&#8221; El-Sabini noted that typically e-commerce companies have money spread out across different services such as ad networks, payment gateways and their banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we give them a unified view of all those dashboards. Then we derive insights based on all that activity to give you &#8216;the right number&#8217;,&#8221; by which he means a real idea of what the company&#8217;s cashflow, incomings and outgoings are across all of these services so that you know how much you have to invest or use in other areas, and specifically on advertising to bring in more customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about return on ad spend and liquidity,&#8221; said El-Sabini.</p>
<p>Cashflow comes into play also with the payment cards that Juni provides as part of its service, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need a card with high spending limits,&#8221; primarily to account for how you spend money over the month and then pay it back in in a delayed way (due to the time taken for revenues to clear payment gateways, etc). Without the high limits, your card might get rejected when you use it to pay for marketing and ad campaigns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ad campaigns will not do well if you get a card decline,&#8221; he said, since Google and others typically demote you in its algorithms when that happens. &#8220;My previous company used to switch cards every quarter because we had so many declines.&#8221; That, of course, is a pain to sort out and definitely not what you want to be spending your time doing if you&#8217;re trying to grow your e-commerce business.</p>
<p>And, when there is a problem, El-Sabini notes that its customer service people speak the same language as the customers, so will be able to address and cope with their issues better.</p>
<p>To sum up all of the above, Juni simply built the kind of bank that the founders wished they had at their previous companies, and that has resonated with others, resulting in what El-Sabini called &#8220;tremendous, fund and hopeful growth.&#8221; Case in point: the press release I was sent for the story last week noted that Juni had 250 customers across Europe, but by the time we talked the number had grown to over 300.</p>
<p>There is something else interesting about what Juni is doing, which points to a bigger trend in fintech that is probably worth watching, too.</p>
<p>Neobanks have made significant inroads into the world of finance, providing consumers with a better and more modern user experience, more personalization and often better rates than their larger, incumbent counterparts, and we have seen some major developments on that front: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/chime-adds-485m-at-a-14-5b-valuation-claims-ebitda-profitability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge valuations</a>,<a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/19756/why-neobanks-have-refocused-from-skyrocketing-growth-to-reaching-profitability" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> big customer growth</a>, and now, slowly, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chime-ipo-exclusive-idUSKBN2B82TG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first </a>of them<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-is-going-public-and-were-very-excited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> going public</a>.</p>
<p>Now we are seeing a very strong second wave of neobanks emerging, which are less widely targeted and aiming at more specific, vertical opportunities. These could be something like targeting the <a href="https://www.oxbury.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agricultural community</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/lili-a-neobank-aimed-at-freelancers-raises-55m-as-it-passes-200k-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freelancers</a>, or SMBs, or specifically companies working in e-commerce as Juni has.</p>
<p>On that note, there really are a lot of fintech startups targeting smaller businesses with banking services now. They include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/small-business-challenger-bank-finom-raises-another-12-million-to-expand-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Finom</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/wise-locks-down-5-7-million-to-scale-its-challenger-bank-designed-for-small-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wise</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/hatch-a-neobank-for-smbs-launches-with-20m-in-funding-from-investors-like-kleiner-perkins-foundation-and-plaids-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hatch</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/novo-a-neobank-for-smbs-banks-41m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Novo</a>, and many others. There is even some competition specifically within e-commerce neobanks, with companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/greeces-viva-wallet-raises-80m-for-its-neo-bank-targeting-small-business-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viva Wallet</a>, <a href="https://www.incard.co/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incard</a> (which appears yet to launch), <a href="https://yanbank.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yan</a>, and likely more also attempting to cater to the same people that Juni is.</p>
<p>For now it is standing out partly because of how quickly it&#8217;s getting adopted, and how they have set out to own this space. That will see Juni also moving into a wider range of products to fill out more of the needs of running an e-commerce business, be it more kinds of credit products to keep cash flowing, one reason why storied investors like DST are interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;In just three months, Juni has already proven that it has the potential to become the next big technology solution for merchants worldwide. The product resonates strongly with their customers by solving a clear pain point and putting time back in the hands of digital entrepreneurs,&#8221; said Joseph Pizzolato and Susan Lin, investors at Felix Capital, in a joint statement. “As investors, we look for signs of ‘customer love’ and ‘digital queues’ in all our investments, and a waitlist of over 3,000 SMEs for Juni’s product is as good as we’ve seen! We immediately connected with the team and we firmly believe in their vision. Their attention to detail and understanding of their customer’s needs puts them in an ideal position to win this market.”</p>
<p>“Samir, Anders, Jonathan, and the team continue to amaze us,&#8221; added Sophia Bendz, a partner at Cherry Ventures. &#8220;Since Juni’s beta launch, they’ve experienced an extremely impressive month-on-month transaction volume in such a short period. They have also built a world class team across compliance, finance, tech, and marketing functions as well as fostered a deep commitment to building community and trustworthiness. They are well on their way to becoming the go-to financial companion for e-commerce entrepreneurs globally. This is only the beginning and we couldn’t be more excited to continue to back this team.”</p>
