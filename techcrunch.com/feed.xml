										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora, the autonomous vehicle startup scheduled to make its debut on Nasdaq next week, is turning to a team of Pixar veterans to help make the computer simulation tool used to test and train its self-driving system more like the real world.</p>
<p>The three-person computer graphic imagery startup <a href="http://colrspace.com/">Colrspace</a>, which has been operating in stealth, is joining Aurora&#8217;s perception team. Aurora will also own Colrspace&#8217;s IP, specifically technology that combines CGI and machine learning. The trio, which includes <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-fu-11966982/">Michael Fu</a>, Allen Hemberger and Alex Harvill, has developed a technique that can reconstruct 3D objects and materials from a photo or image. Essentially, it makes the simulation more &#8220;realistic,&#8221; which Aurora and other autonomous vehicle developers contend helps make testing more effective.</p>
<p>Fu, Hemberger and Harvill will join Aurora&#8217;s perception team, which already includes people from 7D, a simulation startup founded by former Pixar software engineer Magnus Wrenninge. TechCrunch learned in 2019 that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/">had acquired 7D</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225543" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Aurora and competitors like Argo AI, Cruise and Waymo regularly conduct real-world tests on closed courses and public roads, computer simulations are seen as an essential tool to test, train and validate their autonomous vehicle technology. Simulation can be used to help the self-driving system test various scenarios or play back what happened in the real world. The end game is to train and evaluate the software stack so it&#8217;s safe in the real world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for the biggest AV companies to run through thousands, even millions, of simulations daily. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Aurora, for instance, estimates its simulator is the equivalent of running more than 50,000 trucks driving continuously.</span> Aurora&#8217;s computer simulator, called the Virtual Testing Suite, runs through a diverse range of driving conditions as well as common and unusual (edge case) scenarios to catch errors early and before it is deployed in vehicles operating on public roads. Data captured while driving on public roads is also fed back into the simulator.</p>
<p>This year, Aurora has put more effort and resources to scale up its simulation program. Aurora said this month that it expects to have driven the equivalent of over 9 billion simulated miles by the end of the year, with 6 billion of these miles clocked so far in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Going to the Moon is a laudable ambition, but what are you going to do when you get there? NASA and the private space industry aim to make the most of the lunar surface, and to do so they need to study the environment in the next frontier — as leaders from ispace, Lockheed Martin, and Masten Space will explain at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true">TC Session: Space</a> on December 14-15.</p>
<p>The challenge of safely landing on the lunar surface, once the domain of global superpowers, has become accessible to deep-pocketed private space companies, and it seems certain that the next decade will see landers of numerous &#8220;brands&#8221; touching down on regolith.</p>
<p>Japan&#8217;s ispace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/japanese-space-company-ispace-aims-to-send-landers-to-the-moon/">recently unveiled the Hakuto-R lander</a>, which is scheduled to launch aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 in 2022 and deliver a set of Canadian, Japanese, and UAE payloads to the surface. Then the company will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/japanese-startup-ispace-raises-46m-to-support-planned-moon-missions/">sending its own rover</a> to the Moon in 2023 — assuming the timelines don&#8217;t shift at all, which they generally do. Director &amp; COO Takahiro Nakamura will join us to speak to the challenge of going to the moon as a startup — and one outside the popular U.S. ecosystem as well.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224383" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Masten Space will soon have a prominent presence both on and off the moon&#8217;s surface: it&#8217;s being tapped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/nasa-selects-masten-space-systems-to-deliver-cargo-to-the-moon-in-2022/">bring a set of eight payloads there in late 2022</a>, and we&#8217;ll check in with CEO Sean Mahoney on how that mission is shaping up. Beyond that the company plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/masten-space-systems-to-develop-a-gps-like-network-for-the-moon/">create a GPS-like system</a> for surface operations on the moon, which future colonists will be sure to thank them for.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin will be participating in the Artemis program in a number of ways, some underway, others in the future, and the VP &amp; GM of Commercial Civil Space, Lisa Callahan, will be returning to tell us how things have progressed since last year. The news of a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/general-motors-lockheed-martin-to-develop-new-lunar-rover-for-nasa-artemis-missions-to-the-moon/">lunar vehicle</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/spacex-blue-origin-awarded-nasa-contracts-to-develop-moon-lander-concepts-for-future-artemis-missions/">lander concept</a>, and potentially a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/nanoracks-lockheed-martin-and-voyager-space-plan-to-launch-crewed-commercial-space-station-by-2027/"> commercial space station</a> should provide more than enough fodder for a fascinating conversation.</p>
<p>That’s just one example of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#56c4ffdf-04f9-4404-a33a-522de0e81ba5"> stellar speakers</a> we have on tap at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true">TC Sessions: Space</a>. We’re talking folks like Natalya Bailey, Accion Systems co-founder and CTO, who will talk about advancements in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/learn-why-in-space-propulsion-systems-are-essential-for-a-sustainable-space-economy-at-tc-sessions-space-2021/"> in-space satellite propulsion systems</a>. Plus, Chad Anderson (Space Capital), Jonathan Fentzke (Techstars), Tess Hatch (Bessemer Venture Partners) and Lisa Rich (Xplore) will have a lot to share about investing in space startups from the earliest stages and beyond.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?display=true"> Buy your pass</a> now and learn from leading experts how lunar samples may hold the key to living beyond the stars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has now <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=n5jlz7ox">launched</a> a beta version of its &#8220;App Privacy Report,&#8221; a new feature that aims to provide iOS users with details about how often their everyday apps are requesting access to sensitive information, and where that information is being shared. The feature was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-the-wwdc-2021-keynote/">introduced</a> at Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference in June, amid other privacy-focused improvements, including tools to <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-mail-privacy-protection-iphf084865c7/ios">block tracking pixels</a> in emails, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614">a private VPN</a>, and more. Apple explained at the time the new report would include details about an app&#8217;s access to user data and sensors, including the user&#8217;s location, photos, contacts, and more, as well as a list of domains that the app contacts.</p>
<p>Though announced as a part of the iOS 15 update, the App Privacy Report was not available when the new version of iOS rolled out earlier this fall. It&#8217;s still not accessible to the general public but has entered into a wider beta test with the release of the iOS 15.2 and iPadOS 15.2 betas.</p>
<p>The new report goes beyond the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/29/apple-privacy-nutrition-label/">potentially fallible</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">App Privacy labels</a>, which detail what sort of sensitive data an app collects and how it&#8217;s used. Developers may not always fill out their labels accurately &#8212; either by mistake or with a desire to mislead end users &#8212; and Apple&#8217;s App Review team may not always catch those ommissions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead, the new App Privacy Report works to collect information about how apps are behaving more directly.</p>
<p>When enabled by users in their device&#8217;s Privacy Settings, the App Privacy Report will create a list of their apps&#8217; activity over the past seven days. You can then tap on any app to see further details about when the app last accessed sensitive data or one of the device&#8217;s sensors &#8212; like the microphone or location, for example. This information is available in a list where each access is logged with a timestamp.</p>
<p>In another section, &#8220;App Network Activity,&#8221; users will be able to see a list of domains apps have communicated with over the past seven days. This list could include domains used by the app itself to provide its functionality, but will also reveal those from third-party trackers and analytics providers the app works with for analytics and advertising purposes, for example.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Website Network Activity&#8221; offers a similar list, but focuses on websites that contacted domains, some of which may have been provided by an app. You can also view the most contacted domains and drill down into individual domains to see which trackers and analytics they may be using as well as which apps have been contacting them, and when.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ahead of the beta launch, Apple made a feature called &#8220;Record App Activity&#8221; available, which allowed developers to preview what users would see when the App Privacy Report became available. This option produced a JSON file where they could confirm their app was behaving as expected. Already, this feature produced some interesting findings. For instance, Chinese super app <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3151762/tencents-wechat-stop-routine-scans-photos-after-tech-influencer">WeChat was found to be scanning users&#8217; phones</a> for new photos every few hours.</p>
<p>While the App Privacy Report will put into users&#8217; hands a treasure trove of data, it could present complications for developers who may have to now explain to users that some of these data requests are not truly privacy violations &#8212; they&#8217;re about providing the promised app functionality. A weather app, for example, may need to pull a users&#8217; location on a regular basis if the user has requested push notifications about changing weather patterns, like storm updates, to help them prepare for travel.</p>
<p>When presenting the app to developers, Apple said the report would give them an opportunity to &#8220;build trust&#8221; with users by providing transparency about what their app is doing. The company also suggested it could give the developers themselves better insight into the SDKs they&#8217;ve chosen to install, to ensure their behavior aligns with what the developer wants and expects.</p>
<p>Apple has not said when the new feature may exit beta, but it&#8217;s possible it will ship when iOS 15.2 becomes publicly available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As urban rental markets recover and people flock back to cities, people are once again finding themselves with plenty of new neighbors in communities which are trying to embrace a renewed vibrancy of post-lockdown life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oneroofapp.com/">OneRoof</a> is building a social network for residential buildings. Unlike Nextdoor which organizes communities based on zip codes or neighborhoods, OneRoof wants to build up a presence inside large multi-unit buildings so that neighbors can get to know each other in smaller, tighter-knit circles.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Nextdoor] goes by zip codes and in a city like San Francisco or New York&#8230; that encompasses tens of thousands of people,&#8221; OneRoof CEO Selin Sonmez tells TechCrunch. &#8220;These people have less in common at that point because it&#8217;s too large of a pool and it&#8217;s not relevant anymore.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225237" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sonmez notes that it&#8217;s not just about having things in common, people feel more safe communicating with a handful of neighbors rather than thousands of them. Sonmez and her co-founder (and husband) Nikolaos Georgantas hope the app can help people be more comfortable talking to the people they meet in their building&#8217;s elevator or in the hallways, fostering the relationships with relative strangers that the pandemic made so difficult in major cities.</p>
<p>The app has raised a small <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">$1.25M seed raise to carry out this vision, led by General Catalyst with participation from</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Kleiner Perkins&#8217; discovery fund, </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Dream Machine, Script Capital and Urban US.</span></p>
<p>The app is organized around messaging, giving users a Slack-like hub to discuss various topics with neighbors while organizing their own sub-communities based on interests. Notably, OneRoof is not looking to foster deep partnerships with building management, noting that past efforts to create building-wide message boards have largely failed because of the reliance of building managers to moderate the groups.</p>

<p>Operating on such a small scale has its challenges. Their model relies on so-called &#8220;super neighbors&#8221; doing much of the initial onboarding work for their building. Once a user decides they&#8217;d like to get their building on OneRoof, they are able to request that OneRoof sends fliers to their neighbors mail boxes advertising the service while giving them a proprietary code to join the private app. They are also able to request door hangers which Sonmez says the app has had particular success with.</p>
<p>The app is live in around 400 building in New York City and has plans to start expanding to other major cities soon including Boston, Miami and Los Angeles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’ll have to forgive me, I’ve been thinking a lot about farming &#8212; specifically what it might look like in the future. This is largely due to the recent publication of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1/">my Bowery Farming TC-1</a>. It’s a 12,000-word feature that really took me down the vertical-farming rabbit hole.</p>
<p>As I allude to in the piece, there are still plenty of question marks around the technology. At the top of the list are profitability and sustainability. And I fear that the former might come at the expense of the latter. What does seem certain, however, is that &#8212; if the category is going to survive and thrive &#8212; robotics and automation will need to play a major role.</p>
<p>&#8220;The automation and robotic component is a key part of [the] scalability equation, tied into the farm,&#8221; as Bowery CEO Irving Fain told me in one of our conversations. We sadly didn’t go super deep into the robotics aspect of things &#8212; a lot of this technology is still early and the company is hesitant to pull back the curtain as it looks to one-up competitors like AeroFarms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225289" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>I was, however, able to glimpse one of the robots at their Kearny, New Jersey location, which is deployed to move produce trays from place to place. That’s a key part of the BoweryOS system, which &#8212; among other things &#8212; determines the optimal growing position for a given crop. Automation is also used in the harvesting process, which is performed on-site in order to reduce the steps between the farm and consumer.</p>
<p>Robotics make a lot of sense for these sorts of indoor farms. They’re much more well regimented than their more traditional counterparts. The Bowery location I visited, for instance, was erected in a building that formerly housed a fulfilment center. And in a sense, creating automation for one isn’t entirely dissimilar than for a warehouse. Conditions like lighting are easily controlled and, for the most part, the primary goal is getting a payload from point A to point B.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/robotic-farming-firm-iron-ox-raises-53m/">Iron Ox</a> is probably the best example of a robotics company taking on indoor farming. In fact, the company is working on fully automated indoor growing solutions. But fundamentally transforming agtech is going to take more than just the indoor and vertical forms that only represent a sliver of the overall puzzle. Something I learned researching that piece. The average age of a farmer in Japan is 67. The average farmer in the U.S. is only about 10 years younger.</p>
<p>Add to that a crisis filling seasonal jobs and it becomes clear why so many companies think the answer to these problems is automation. That’s obviously a more complicated task, but there are a number of companies looking to tackle it, from startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/burro-raises-10-9m-for-autonomous-produce-field-transport/">Burro</a> to big conglomerates like John Deere, which has acquired a number of robotics firms.</p>

<p>More on that soon, probably. For now, though, we need to talk about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/fabric-200-million-robotics-fulfillment-e-commerce/">Fabric’s massive raise</a>. The company already has contracts with some massive names, including Walmart, Instacart and FreshDirect. They’re all looking for the same thing: something that will make them more competitive with Amazon. That’s a tall order, given the retail giant’s utter dominance of everything it touches. That includes automation, of course, with Amazon robotics dating back to 2012.</p>
<p>“As it is, we already have more demand than we can serve,” Fabric’s CEO notes. “At the same time, we are seeing bigger opportunities beyond the proposition beyond our micro-fulfilment centers, how they interact in the network and the supply chain.”</p>
<p>I believe it. COVID has accelerate so much of what was already on an upward trajectory. And even as things return to a semblance of normal, I don’t see that demand waning. This latest $200 million round pushes Fabric’s valuation north of unicorn status.</p>

<p>A bit of space robot news to wind things down this week. The International Space Station got a preview o<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/gitai-successfully-demos-autonomous-robot-inside-the-international-space-station/">f Gitai Japan’s S1 robotic arm</a> this week. The autonomous appendage is designed to perform maintenance tasks, including operating switches and assembling structures. It puts it well on its way to potential deployment, having hit seven of nine (not a Star Trek reference, I swear) TRL (not a 90s MTV reference, I swear) or technology readiness levels.</p>
<p>“The success of this investigation proves that the GITAI robot can be a solution for space agencies and commercial space companies looking for versatile, dexterous, relatively safe (less exposure to life threatening risks for humans), and inexpensive labor force,” NASA said in a statement. “Providing this option furthers the goals of commercialization of space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://neuralight.ai/">NeuraLight</a> has launched from stealth with $5.5 million in seed funding to apply AI to advance drug development for neurological disorders. The company was co-founded by Micha Breakstone, the co-founder and former president of Chorus.ai, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zoominfo-drops-575m-on-chorus-ai-as-ai-shakes-up-the-sales-market/">sold to ZoomInfo</a> for $575 million earlier this year. Breakstone now leads NeuraLight as the company&#8217;s CEO alongside co-founder and CTO Edmund Ben-Ami.</p>
<p>The seed funding round included participation from MSAD, Kli, Tuesday, Operator Partners, and VSC Ventures. Angel investors include Trax Retail’s CEO Tamara Minick-Scokalo, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo, Clover Health CEO Vivek Garipalli, and Noam Soloman, the CEO of Immunai.</p>
<p>NeuraLight, which has dual headquarters in Austin and Tel Aviv, aims to help people suffering from neurological disorders by digitizing neurological evaluation and care. Breakstone and Ben-Ami have recruited talent from the research and pharmaceutical industries, along with alumni from Google, Chorus.ai and Viz.ai.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225098" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The team has built a platform that automatically extracts microscopic eye movement measurements that serve as reliable digital endpoints for neurological disorders. The platform is able to remove light and movement from videos using AI and machine learning to get a more precise video.</p>
<p>“We’re able to extract ocular metrics from this highly augmented precise video to predict the progression of neurological disorders from microscopic movements. Then we’re able to sell that to pharma companies as a means to develop drugs in a better way for neurology,” said Breakstone in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The platform is ultimately meant to help accelerate clinical trials and increase the probability of success of future therapies for Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Multiple Sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Given that the platform doesn&#8217;t require a dedicated device, Breakstone says pharmaceutical companies will be able to integrate NeuraLight into clinical trials and in remote settings. By gathering de-identified data from thousands of patients, NeuraLight aims to build the largest, proprietary, de-identified oculometric database and apply AI to gain insights from the data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2225114" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225114" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2225114" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/neuralight-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/neuralight-2.jpg 8256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/neuralight-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/neuralight-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/neuralight-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/neuralight-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/neuralight-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/neuralight-2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/neuralight-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225114" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NeuraLight</p></div></p>
<p>Breakstone says there aren’t many competitors within that space and that those that do exist require dedicated devices, such as camera eye-trackers and pupilometers. He notes that what sets NeuraLight apart from these companies is that its platform only relies on video from a standard smartphone or webcam. The company has submitted a provisional patent to protect the technology that it’s developing.</p>
<p>NeuraLight notes that more than 1 billion people worldwide suffer from neurological disorders and that current neurological evaluation is highly subjective and depends on a manual examination of symptoms, which is why pharmaceutical companies haven’t had effective tools to develop precise therapies.</p>
<p>“Having worked in the pharmaceutical industry for the last two decades, I can confidently say that digital endpoints are the future of neurology,” said Rivka Kretiman, the chief innovation officer at NeuraLight, in a statement. “This technology has been the missing piece pharma has needed to make drug development for neurological diseases effective and ultimately more successful, and will create a new standard of measurement for these companies’ drug development pipelines.”</p>
<p>As for the $5.5 million in seed funding, NeuraLight is looking to partner with pharma companies to help them increase the success rate in developing new drugs and reduce development costs. The company also aims to help pharma companies shorten the time it takes for drugs to reach the market. Breakstone says NeuraLight has started its own measurements in Israel for Parkinson’s disease and is in the process of working with three pharma companies, the names of which have not yet been disclosed.</p>
<p>“We want to transform neurology entirely and allow the new generation of drugs to be developed. We made sure to hire and bring on people that actually care about transforming the world and want to help us build an iconic company that will transform the way neurological care assessment is done today,” Breakstone said.</p>
<p>NeuraLight&#8217;s scientific advisory board will be led by Ruth Djaldetti, the head of the movement disorder center at the Rabin Medical Center in Israel. Further, Nobel Prize winner Alvin Roth, ex-Flatiron Health&#8217;s CTO Gil Shklarski and Pomelo Care CEO Marta Bralic Kerns will advise the company’s scientific vision as members of the board.</p>

But luckily for us, Allbirds&#8217; IPO pricing not only reprises its own value, but also provides a bit more context concerning what related startups may be worth.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s thanks to its status as a &#8220;tech-enabled company,&#8221; as opposed to a pure technology outfit. To reiterate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/rent-the-runways-ipo-pricing-indicates-bullish-market-for-unicorns-of-all-stripes/">our notes</a> concerning the distinction between the two, we consider Allbirds tech-<em>enabled</em> instead of tech <em>proper</em> because it uses technology methods (e-commerce, in its case) to improve on a traditional business (making and selling shoes), instead of, say, operating a purely digital marketplace where others sell wearable goods.</p>
<p>You can use a gross-margin test for this sort of distinction, if you want to be technical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tech-enabled&#8221; may sound like a pejorative, but it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s a descriptor, and one that is only rude if you are hoping that tech-enabled businesses will attract pure-tech valuations, and, implicitly, larger revenue multiples than may be truly warranted.</p>

A key topic, given that we just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/rent-the-runways-ipo-pricing-indicates-bullish-market-for-unicorns-of-all-stripes/">saw Rent the Runway price its IPO quite well</a> and we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/heavily-vc-backed-salad-chain-sweetgreen-heads-toward-public-markets/">have Sweetgreen in the wings</a>.</p>
<p>With lots of pure tech companies going public, and enough tech-enabled unicorns debuting at the same time, we can break the two groups into distinct cohorts.</p>
<p>With that, let&#8217;s talk Allbirds and what its expected revenue multiple tells us about how such companies are valued. Hint: We appear to be narrowing on a price range.</p>
<h2>Allbirds&#8217; IPO valuation</h2>
<p>In an S-1/A filing this week, Allbirds disclosed that it expects its IPO to price between $12 and $14 per share. The company is selling 15,384,615 shares itself, with an option to sell another 360,415 shares under certain conditions. That works out to as much as $220.4 million in gross receipts for the company itself, not including shares being sold by existing stockholders.</p>
<p>After its IPO, Allbirds expects to have 143,480,229 shares outstanding, inclusive of the full whack of shares offered to underwriters that they may or may not purchase. Using that max share count, and the upper end of Allbirds&#8217; current IPO price range, the company would command a valuation of $2.0 billion.</p>

Labs will give Twitter Blue subscribers early access to features that Twitter is testing as a part of that bundle, which is currently only available in Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>Now, Labs subscribers now have the ability to upload videos that are up to 10-minutes long from their desktop. Standard users currently only have the option to upload videos that are up to 2 minutes and 20 seconds long. Additionally, iOS users can now swipe to pin their favorite conversations to the top of their direct message inbox.</p>

<p>Today, we’re rolling out Labs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f52c.png" alt="🔬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, giving you *early access* to some new features we’re building before everyone else like: <br /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f539.png" alt="🔹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Pinned Conversations on iOS<br /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f539.png" alt="🔹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Longer video uploads on desktop only </p>
<p>Here are some questions you might be asking:</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1453457352426803202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter says features that are released via Labs may eventually roll out to the rest of Twitter, become a static feature of Twitter Blue, or be scrapped altogether based on feedback it hears from subscribers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Labs also provides an opportunity for other internal product teams to submit features, get early quantitative and qualitative data, and then later release to a wider audience. What&#8217;s featured in Labs will change as we develop new features,” the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">had said last month</a> it planned to be more experimental as it released new products, noting that it would share its progress publicly along the way and scrap ideas that didn&#8217;t work &#8212; as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/twitter-is-shutting-down-fleets-on-august-3-citing-low-usage/">recently did</a> with Fleets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that if we’re not winding things down every once in a while, then we’re not taking big enough bets,&#8221; said Twitter Head of Consumer Product Kayvon Beykpour at the time.</p>
<p>In Canada and Australia, a Twitter Blue subscription currently costs $3.49 CAD or $4.49 AUD, respectively. The subscription gives Twitter users access to premium features, including tools to organize bookmarks and an “Undo Tweet” feature, which seems to be the closest thing Twitter will offer in relation to the long-requested “edit” button. Twitter Blue also comes with a reader mode feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://hingehealth.com/">Hinge Health</a>, the San Francisco-based company that offers a digital solution to treat chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, like back and joint pain, closed on $400 million in Series E funding to give the company a $6.2 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Tiger Global and Coatue Management, which co-led the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">$300 million Series D round</a> back in January, are back again to lead this one. They are joined by Alkeon Capital and Whale Rock, which put in a $200 million secondary investment to acquire some ownership in Hinge. Tiger, Coatue and Alkeon were also recently an investment team in Abacus.ai, which announced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/abacus-ai-snags-50m-series-c-as-it-expands-into-computer-vision-use-cases/"> $50 million round this week.</a></p>

<p>The new investment, which brings Hinge Health’s total funds raised to date at over $1 billion, will be funneled into technology and product development to improve access, outcomes and patient experiences, Daniel Perez, co-founder and CEO of Hinge Health, said in a written statement. The company also touts that it is &#8220;now one of the most valuable companies in digital health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hinge Health’s technology aims to reduce MSK pain, surgeries and opioid use through the use of advanced wearable sensors and computer vision technology that is monitored by a clinical care team of physical therapists, physicians and board-certified health coaches.</p>
<p>So far this year, the company, which is approaching 1,000 employees, more than doubled its customer base to now serve over 575 enterprise customers. It also rounded out its leadership team with new hires Lalith Vadlamannati, who joined as chief technology officer after spending 13 years at Amazon, and Vincent Lim, chief people officer, who has previous experience scaling teams at Google, Medium and JUUL Labs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle charging companies depend on reliable internet access to sell electricity to customers, track usage data, authenticate users and receive over-the-air updates. If a WiFi connection is unreliable, drivers could find themselves in a sticky situation.</p>
<p>“If the phone loses service, the charger loses service, the environment loses service or the server is down, the charging session never occurs and you&#8217;re stranded,” EV charging startup <a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/9f1e221bf5ba19014a1a314cae7e6ef7e51acb8e?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xealenergy.com&amp;userId=5405119&amp;signature=32c192a397a94f29">Xeal</a> co-founder Alexander Isaacson said in a recent interview. “That&#8217;s the status quo: if you want smart functions it comes at the dependence on someone else&#8217;s connectivity.”</p>
<p>Two-year-old Xeal, founded by Isaacson and Nikhil Bharadwaj, aims to solve this tricky problem by bypassing WiFi connectivity entirely, at least at the point of sale. It does so through a patent-pending protocol called Apollo, which uses time-bound cryptographic tokens and distributed ledgers – a mouthful of buzzwords but the centerpiece of Xeal’s technology.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224401" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2224413" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224413" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2224413" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-PGkA86VrV0I3OV.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-PGkA86VrV0I3OV.jpg 8000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-PGkA86VrV0I3OV.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-PGkA86VrV0I3OV.jpg?resize=300,113 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-PGkA86VrV0I3OV.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-PGkA86VrV0I3OV.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-PGkA86VrV0I3OV.jpg?resize=1536,576 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-PGkA86VrV0I3OV.jpg?resize=2048,768 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-PGkA86VrV0I3OV.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224413" class="wp-caption-text">Left: Alexander Isaacson, Right: Nikhil Bharadwaj<strong> Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://xealenergy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xeal <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The tech has gotten the attention of investors, to the tune of an $11 million Series A and a previously unannounced $3 million seed round. The Series A saw participation from an interesting mix of investors from climate tech and proptech, including ArcTern Ventures and Moderne Ventures, with additional funding from LPC Ventures, the venture arm of Lincoln Property Company, Harrison Street, Hunt Companies, and Align Real Estate. The seed round was co-led by Ramez Naam and Pasadena Angels.</p>
<p>In practice, the Apollo protocol looks like a closed loop system between the driver’s phone and the EV charger, which has no IT infrastructure, modems, ethernet cables or SIM cards. To establish that closed loop, drivers must download the app (on WiFi, of course), enter personal information, payment details and vehicle information. At that point, the driver’s phone receives a cryptographic token to access all of Xeal’s public charging stations. This is the point at which the system authenticates the user.</p>
<p>When the driver goes to charge her car at a station, the station accesses the digital token embedded in the phone – no WiFi required. The cryptographic tokens are &#8220;time-bound&#8221; because they dissolve after they are used. The charger has something akin to a local server that reads the token and authenticates the session. When the session ends, the charger imparts to the phone a distributed ledger with details on the charging session, like how much electricity was used and the fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To get another token – for another charging session – the driver would need to eventually access WiFi, Isaacson explained. In a way, drivers exchange the distributed ledger, with their fee details, for another token. But even if, theoretically, a driver threw their phone into a lake or never reconnected it to WiFi, perhaps hoping to steal a bit of kilowatts, the details of that charging session are distributed to the other chargers nearby, too, and imparted to other users’ phones. That means that even if a single phone does not reconnect to WiFi, other phones that inevitably do can update the ledger over the network.</p>
<p>Xeal says its protocol is much more secure than conventional smart chargers on the market. Isaacson likened the internet to a public highway, with information travelling along it vulnerable to interception and manipulation.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re not going anywhere outside of the charger and the phone,” he said. The company also says Apollo makes for more cost savings too, because real estate owners don’t have to pay for data plans or incur costs associated with installing internet access in hard-to-accommodate places that are convenient for drivers, like a parking garage.</p>
<p>Xeal launched the Apollo protocol in July, after working on it for around two years. Isaacson said the company is on-track to install 2,000 charging stations by the end of the year and 10,000 in 2022. The main catalyst for growth, he added, was through targeting major real estate groups, particularly apartment building owners, who are looking to provide EV charging on their properties.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Xeal aims to use the $11 million funding to hit its target of installing 10,000 charging stations next year. The company will also be hiring more engineers and possibly even expand the self-reliant offline protocol to other use-cases.</p>
<p>“Everything you do in life, to perform well, you need to have someone else performing well,” Isaacson said. “That just wasn&#8217;t the reality that we wanted. That&#8217;s the whole theme of central network dependence in general because when you&#8217;re depending on a central focal point, and it ever goes down, the entire system breaks.”</p>

<p>The Benioffs&#8217; portion is divided into two tranches, with $100 million going to the Benioff Time Tree Fund and the other $100 million going to Time Ventures, the couple&#8217;s venture firm, to invest in promising startups working to build products and services that battle climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Benioff Time Tree Fund will focus on indigenous and community-based forest management and mitigating the increasing impacts of climate change on the most at-risk communities and natural ecosystems in emerging and developing countries,&#8221; the organization said in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225638" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Marc Benioff said that it&#8217;s going to take a concerted and combined effort by various constituencies to fight climate change, and tree-planting efforts are a big part of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can succeed in arresting climate change if every government, company and individual makes it a priority to protect and preserve our planet. We have to sequester 100 gigatons of carbon and reforestation is critical in making it happen,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition, the Time Ventures component plans to invest $100 million in eco-focused startups. This comes on top of another $100 million the couple&#8217;s firm has invested since 2014 in companies like DroneSeed, Loam Bio and Mango Materials, according to the firm.</p>
<p>Salesforce has already stated that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/salesforce-reaches-net-zero-energy-usage-announces-updates-to-sustainability-cloud/">it has achieved Net Zero</a> and announced commitments to grow 30 million trees this year at Dreamforce, the company&#8217;s customer conference, in September. This additional $100 million is being distributed to several initiatives, including grants over the next decade to help nonprofit organizations working in areas like ecosystem restoration and climate justice. Furthermore, the company plans to donate technology and commit to 2.5 million in volunteer hours at organizations working on climate action.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Suzanne DiBianca, chief impact officer at Salesforce, said that the company&#8217;s actions to achieve Net Zero is a first step, but the additional money is aimed at helping other groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to empower those who are working to accelerate climate action and help those who are most impacted by climate change. We need bold and urgent action if we are to reduce emissions and deliver a healthier, more resilient, Net Zero world,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The company has achieved <a href="https://netzeroclimate.org/what-is-net-zero/">Net Zero</a> emissions through a combination of using renewable energy and purchasing carbon offsets when that&#8217;s not an option.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What do you do to build a deck that can’t be ignored? To answer that question, we assembled a group of three exceptional venture capitalists on the Extra Crunch stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thousands of pitch decks, and only a handful of winners. Such is the math of the VC industry right now, what with an explosion of startups and dreams of glory launching every year. VCs are overwhelmed with pitches, which means that crafting the perfect deck and connecting with a reader in the few seconds you have their attention is critical.</p>
<p>So what do you do to build a deck that can’t be ignored? To answer that question, we assembled a group of three exceptional venture capitalists on the Extra Crunch stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> who have probably read more decks collectively than any group of humans should ever be expected to. Mar Hershenson is founding managing partner at <a href="https://www.pear.vc">Pear VC</a>, Mercedes Bent is a partner at <a href="https://lsvp.com">Lightspeed</a>, and Saba Karim is the head of global startup pipeline at <a href="https://www.techstars.com">TechStars</a>.</p>
<p>In our discussion, we covered what’s changing with pitches as the world moves toward a hybrid in-person and virtual pitch model, discussed how deep tech startups should think about pitches, and then we wrapped by exploring how each panelist reads decks — and what that portends for founders who don’t want to be ignored.</p>
<h2 id="The changing nature of reading pitches in 2021 and standardizing formats">The changing nature of reading pitches in 2021 and standardizing formats</h2>
<p>We got right into the crux of the matter at the top of the panel: What does reading pitch decks feel like in 2021? For Hershenson, there’s just always more under the sun:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would say the volume of pitches that we receive has increased and continues to increase at some form of exponential rate. For us, we have to become far more efficient at sorting and reading through these decks. The actual reading of the individual deck hasn&#8217;t changed, but the rate and volume have increased dramatically. <em><b>(Timestamp: 1:01)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Bent noted that the bar has gone up for the quality of decks that she reads.</p>
<blockquote><p>The decks are getting better and better in terms of design. I think more and more people have realized that the visual representation of your deck is just as important as the material and the content that&#8217;s in there. There&#8217;s these instinctive milliseconds that an investor looks at your deck and almost makes a snap judgment about whether it&#8217;s even in the realm of something they want to look at it. Unfortunately, it shouldn&#8217;t be like that, but we&#8217;re human. So I&#8217;m seeing decks that are super polished, and I don&#8217;t know where everyone is getting these great graphics from, but they&#8217;re amazing. <em><b>(Timestamp: 1:48)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Most pitch decks are based off templates, and therein lies a key trade-off: How much should you rely on a template versus being “original,” but different and perhaps harder to read? Karim noted that sometimes originality can pay off:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best pitch deck that I got in a different format would be from a company that recently got into TechStars — it was actually a podcast version of their pitch deck that had my face on it. I went into Apple Podcasts and it said, “Hey, Saba, here&#8217;s my pitch.” That was amazing! But the second or third time that happens, it might not be as impressive because I&#8217;ve seen it before. <em><b>(Timestamp: 3:41)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Hershenson pushed founders to consider keeping to the standard templates because it can help VCs focus on what makes each business unique.</p>
<blockquote><p>For us, having the pitch in a format that we are able to consume in an efficient way is super important. There are a lot of templates online, we all know the key points that need to be hit on in a deck. So your job as a founder is to hit those in a deck of 10 to 15 slides and kind of do the hard work of synthesizing your business in a short format. I think you can be original, but sometimes being original is to your detriment.</p>
<p>I can tell you my own story. When we were first fundraising for Pear, we decided we were going to be really original: We&#8217;re going to use Prezi to send decks to LPs. And that was just totally the wrong call, because it&#8217;s almost like, “What did they just send me?” <em><b>(Timestamp: 4:29)</b></em></p></blockquote>
<p>One of the interesting dynamics that has shown up in the last year has been the rise of Notion as a form for fundraising. Responses from our panel were muted. Hershenson said Notion isn’t an excuse for not being succinct.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/alchemy-raises-80m-at-a-505m-valuation-to-be-the-aws-for-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $80 million</a> at a $505 million valuation, blockchain and Web3 development SaaS startup <a href="https://www.alchemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alchemy</a> has raised $250 million in a Series C funding round that values the company at $3.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) led the financing, which was extremely competitive with a number of large venture firms clamoring to not only back the company, but lead the investment, according to sources familiar with the transaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the fact that Alchemy increased its valuation by a staggering 7x over a six-month period (that’s a gain of more than $1 billion in value per month), the round is notable for a few other reasons. For one, it represents one of a16z’s largest Web3/blockchain investments to date. In June, the firm revealed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.2 billion crypto fund</a>, illustrating its serious commitment to the space. (For the unacquainted, Web3 refers to a</span><span class="s1"> set of protocols led by blockchain, that intends to reinvent how the Internet is wired in the backend).</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225311" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s also interesting is that Alchemy has managed to achieve something that remains elusive for most startups: profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO and co-founder Nikil Viswanathan, the company is in fact “very profitable.” It turned that corner over the past few months, he said, as demand for its offering has exploded and revenue grew 15x since its last raise in April. The startup has been doing so well that it hasn’t even touched the $80 million it raised in its Series B, according to Alchemy CTO and co-founder Joe Lau.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All that money is still in the bank,” he said. “We didn’t need the money but we saw the value in bringing on great partners, such as Andreessen, which has an incredible team with deep technical expertise in the blockchain space.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Alchemy wants to do for blockchain and Web3 what AWS (Amazon Web Services) did for the internet. ​​</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s goal is to be the starting place for developers considering building a product on top of a blockchain or mainstream blockchain applications. Its developer tool aims to remove the complexity and costs of building infrastructure while improving applications through “necessary” developer tools. It launched its offering in August of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Alchemy powers a range of transactions across nearly every blockchain vertical, including financial institutions, exchanges, billion-dollar decentralized finance projects and multinational organizations such as UNICEF. It has also quickly become the technology behind every major NFT platform, including MakersPlace, OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, SuperRare and CryptoPunks. Other customers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dapper Labs, Axie Infinity, Fortune 500s building on blockchain such as the recently signed Adobe, PricewaterhouseCoopers. It also serves “the majority of DeFi.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alchemy powers over $45 billion in transaction volume for companies around the globe. That’s up from $30 billion at the time of its April raise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the company has also expanded the number of blockchains that it powers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our platform was more or less on Ethereum, but we’ve seen a lot of demand and have since expanded to include Polygon, Optimism and Flow,” Lau said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alchemy has also seen a lot of new developers, noted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Viswanathan</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve had many more teams and companies join Alchemy, and more developers per team or per company are using our platform,” he added. “So we’re seeing growth across all axes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its explosive growth, Alchemy remains a lean team. It currently has 37 employees, up from 22 in April. It is based in San Francisco, with an office in New York and remote employees globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital mostly to invest in building a community around blockchain. Alchemy started at the right time, in the execs&#8217; view &#8212; in 2017 when the market was tiny and many still doubted the opportunity in the space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimate goal is to bring the promise of blockchain to life,” Lau said. “We want to fulfill its potential by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creating more resources for developers to come into the space and more effectively and more quickly build blockchain products.”</span></p>
<p>Viswanathan believes Alchemy is playing a crucial role in the recent surge and popularity of blockchain.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As blockchain has been growing, not only has Alchemy grown, but we have helped the blockchain ecosystem grow because,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s this kind of virtuous cycle &#8212; the more we provide better tooling, the easier it is for developers to build products, and then more users come, so then more developers come so that we make the tooling better, and so on and so forth. So we like to think of ourselves as helping spin that flywheel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225526" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225526" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225526 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Alchemy.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225526" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alchemy</p></div></p>
<p><span class="s1">Ali Yahya, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz (16z), described Alchemy as &#8220;a key driver&#8221; of the growth of blockchain and Web3, and said the startup is already &#8220;the de facto developer platform&#8221; for Web3.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">&#8220;Just as Microsoft and AWS built platforms that powered the computer and internet industries, Alchemy’s platform enables developers to build blockchain products used by millions globally,&#8221; he wrote via email, adding that </span><b></b><span class="s2">Alchemy&#8217;s growth across all relevant metrics has been &#8220;staggering.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google chairman and Stanford University President John L. Hennessy &#8212; who invested in the company&#8217;s last round &#8212; echoed Yahya&#8217;s sentiments. But he also made another, noteworthy comparison: </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alchemy is powering the growth of the blockchain industry the same way Amazon Web Services did for the cloud,&#8221; he wrote via e-mail. &#8220;The excitement about their technology reminds me of the early days of Google.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series C financing also included participation from new investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Redpoint. Existing backers Coatue, Lee Fixel’s Addition, DFJ and Pantera Capital doubled down on their investments in Alchemy, which has now raised about $345 million in total since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other previous investors in the company includ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e the Chainsmokers’ Mantis, actor Jared Leto and the Glazer family (owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Manchester United), Yahoo co-founder and former CEO Jerry Yang, Coinbase, SignalFire, Samsung, Stanford University, Charles Schwab, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and others.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazilian grain trading marketplace <a href="https://www.tarken.ag/en.html#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tarken</a> secured $3.5 million in a seed round, co-led by Monashees and Maya, to continue developing its technology that connects grain buyers and sellers and operates an artificial intelligence tool for commodity pricing.</p>
<p>Joining them was Gilgamesh Ventures and individual investors, including Kavak founder Carlos Garcia, Ualá founder Pierpaolo Barbieri, Zap VivaReal Group’s Brian Requarth and DoorDash’s Gokul Rajaram.</p>
<p>Luiz Tângari and Carlos Neto founded Tarken this year after working together in agriculture for the past eight years at Strider, a crop protection systems company they co-founded and later sold to Syngenta in 2018.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After integrating the company, they left and started Tarken, which is initially focused on corn, which Tângari estimates to be a $30 billion market. The National Supply Company (CONAB) from the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture estimated <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/blogs/agriculture/092221-brazil-corn-crop-extreme-weather" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corn production in Brazil</a> at 102.6 million metric tons for the 2020-21 growing year.</p>
<p>“The biggest problem in commodity trading is that it is not liquid,” he added. “If you are a farmer growing corn and soy, if you want to sell in a hurry you have to sell at a discount, or you are waiting for weeks for the right prices.”</p>

<p>He said the United States figured out price variations a decade ago. To give similar transparency to grain trading in Brazil, Tarken set up an AI tool that pulls in data from different sources and generates a price for every Brazilian city, something Tângari said was a mystery before. Buyers and sellers can search a map to see who is selling, at what price and the freight cost to get the product.</p>
<p>The farmer can communicate with the seller and the freight operators, which are vetted by Tarken, and execute the transaction right from the platform, which Tângari said “removes risk from the table.” A process that used to take about 12 weeks — between figuring out the prices, negotiations and product delivery — can now take just days, he added.</p>
<p>“This is a tool combined with education to draw scenarios for strategies to buy and sell,” Tângari added. “Currently, farmers have zero help, and we want to level that. We want to help market players be smarter, have smaller price variations and better liquidity. If we are successful, we will see chicken prices in the market go down 3%.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since Tarken launched four months ago, it has facilitated over 1,000 negotiations and has several hundred open bids for products. The number of negotiations is growing 50% per day, and Tângari expects to close the year with 10,000 registered customers.</p>
<p>Half of the new funding will go toward engineering to continue developing the product, including finishing out the AI tool. The other half will be invested in marketing for the marketplace to attract new customers, building content and education to help growers and buyers understand about trading and sales.</p>
<p>Tângari also notes that Tarken is on track to begin raising a Series A round and expects that to begin in six months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marcelo Lima, partner at Monashees, said in a statement that he previously knew Tângari and Neto through an investment in Strider and is backing Tarken for its approach to the agricultural commodities market, which has not seen innovation in recent years.</p>
<p>“We strongly believe in the ability to use technology and data to aggregate supply and demand, improve the user experience and build a great marketplace in the region,” Lima said. “We’ve already seen this happening across multiple spaces and asset types. We are on the ideal timing and we have the perfect team to lead this movement in agribusiness.”</p>

<div class="bcontainer bcontainer_1">
<p id="speakable-summary">Transit planning app Moovit is now featuring Bird&#8217;s shared e-scooters and e-bikes in its app. As of Thursday, Moovit users in 65 cities across 12 countries — including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom — will be able to locate nearby Bird vehicles in real time, gauge how long it will take to walk there and see the battery range of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Moovit says it plans to open the Bird integration to U.S. cities in the near future but didn&#8217;t specify when.</p>
<p>Bird has around 20 mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) integrations, including with smaller entities like myCicero in Italy and Skipr in Belgium and France, with planned integration with Germany&#8217;s Jelbi. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/bird-is-the-latest-operator-to-integrate-its-e-scooters-and-e-bikes-with-google-maps/'">recently also integrated with Google Maps</a>, alongside competitors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/spins-electric-scooters-and-bikes-are-now-on-google-maps/">Spin</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/moovit-integrates-lime-electric-scooters-bikes-mopeds-into-transit-planning-app/">Lime</a>, both of which are already featured in the Moovit app.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225356" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bird&#8217;s vehicles can be found in over 300 cities globally, and the company is always looking for ways to increase its reach. In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/bird-launches-shared-e-bikes-and-opens-its-app-to-local-shared-operators/">the operator launched a &#8220;Smart Bikeshare&#8221; platform</a> that allows local shared e-bike and e-moped providers and transit apps to feature their vehicles on the Bird app. As micromobility increasingly becomes an integral part of the transport ecosystem, these types of cross-platform integrations are bound to continue surfacing.</p>
<p>Moovit, which says it has served over 1 billion urban users in over 1,500 cities across 112 countries, has about 300 mobility providers integrated into its app, including Tier, Voi, Beam, Helbiz, Beryl, Zwings, Revel and many more, according to the company. As part of the integration, Bird and Moovit plan to collaborate on urban mobility research in these regions to gain local perspectives on mobility trends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moovit&#8217;s goal is to simplify urban mobility around the world and make it more efficient, accessible and sustainable,&#8221; Sharon Kaslassi, global corporate communications manager at Moovit, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Integrating private sector companies such as Bird and Lime help support that goal by encouraging riders toward car-free, multimodal trips. It also provides people returning to their pre-COVID routines with easily accessible first- and last-mile options to choose from for more hassle-free travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moovit wants to be a true MaaS platform and that means offering more forms of alternative transport. Aside from micromobility integrations, Moovit On-Demand, the company&#8217;s shared mobility planning feature, is integrated into the Moovit consumer app in certain regions. Last November, Moovit partnered with SMART, a dial-a-ride transport operator outside Detroit, to modernize its service and reduce wait times. Now, locals can use the Moovit app to book those on-demand transit rides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moovit also powers a white label app for transport agencies and cities that want to offer on-demand shared mobility. Just this year, Australian bus provider Ventura launched a new on-demand service and app to Melbourne residents, called FlexiRide, which is powered by Moovit On-Demand, and two Scottish regions, the <a href="https://moovit.com/press-releases/moovit-partnership-scottish-borders-council/">Scottish Borders</a> and <a href="https://moovit.com/press-releases/moovit-aberdeenshire-council-partnership/">Aberdeenshire</a>, also launched similar services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Public and shared transportation is the backbone of society, and Moovit&#8217;s goals are to harness the power of MaaS, driven by big data, to create a world with simpler, more intuitive ways of accessing and consuming transportation,&#8221; said Kaslassi. &#8220;Moovit aims to reduce congestion, grow ridership and increase mobility efficiency by guiding people in getting around using any mode of transport (except for using private vehicles).&#8221;</p>
<p>Moovit can be downloaded on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moovit-train-bus-times/id498477945">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tranzmate&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Google Play</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fat tire e-bike manufacturer Rad Power Bikes just raised another $154 million. The Series D raise from existing investors, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $329 million, comes just eight months after Rad raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">$150 million.</a> The Seattle-based startup aims to use the funds to boost investments in product and technology innovation and beef out its distribution network, according to founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>Rad’s latest round is led by institutional investors Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, with investments from funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), Vulcan Capital, Durable Capital Partners LP and The Rise Fund, TPG&#8217;s multisector global impact investing strategy.</p>
<p>“I think the fact that some of the world’s most respected investors are doubling down just shows this competence in our business, both with the scale advantage that we have and also just the overall potential in the e-bike market,” Radenbaugh told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s Rad’s scale that the company is leaning on now in order to really become a powerhouse. Rad Power has launched dozens of new bike accessories and multiple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/rad-power-bikes-reveals-more-user-friendly-next-gen-e-bike-radrover-6-plus-for-1999/">new e-bikes</a> this year, despite the supply chain shortages that have caused delays on product releases across industries. That’s in part due to the company’s diversified and dedicated supply chain. Rad has multiple source suppliers and manufacturing partners across continents to fall back on and has even started chartering its own vessels to ensure bikes are delivered, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/rad-power-bikes-founder-mike-randenbaugh-on-fueling-the-e-bike-revolution/">Radenbaugh told TechCrunch in a previous interview</a>.</p>
<p>Rad has also opened up multiple distribution centers this year, and by the end of the year, expects to triple its capacity to deliver bikes and accessories to customers within five days. The plan is to keep that momentum going into next year by adding more distribution centers in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Europe in order to strengthen its logistics and fulfillment capabilities.</p>
<p>“I think of our business more like a solutions business, so it’s also our buy online experience and pickup in store experience, our integrations with our retail stores and mobile service centers and making all that a seamless customer experience,” said Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>The company says it will triple the number of physical locations of mobile service and retail stores by the end of next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our business has been largely break-even or profitable, and it kind of fluctuates around break-even, so this is all growth capital,” said Radenbaugh. “It&#8217;s all just designed to flow into expansion of our operations, customer service and innovation.”</p>
<p>For Radenbaugh, the guy who started building e-bikes at 15 years old, expanding Rad Power Bikes isn’t just about growing his business. It’s about making green transportation more accessible. It’s about getting people out of their cars and back outside.</p>
<p>“E-bikes are really the solution to a lot of our toughest challenges for the environment, and it’s the direct reason why customers are picking them up,” he said. “It could be teens and professionals commuting to school or work, running errands, retirees reliving the joy of riding again, commercial last-mile customers. These people are buying the product because it’s a better tool for everyday life and mobility, but there’s the environmental side, too, which gets our investor base really energized around the business.”</p>
<p>Rad Power Bikes has 350,000 customers, so it has plenty of data on how people use its vehicles. The company found that more than 70% of customers ride their bikes more than several times per week. In addition, Rad’s number one acquisition channel is word of mouth and repeat customers.</p>
<p>“The richness of our data is starting to show something bigger happening here, a kind of consumer-led movement by passionate, high-use customers,” said Radenbaugh.</p>
<p>These are heartening statistics because they signal a shift in modes of transportation that we’re starting to see mirrored in the way cities look at cycling infrastructure. Radenbaugh said the company initially built powerful utilitarian bikes with throttles, big batteries and fat tires in large part to overcome poor infrastructure. Now as the company tries to become a brand that is synonymous with the future of mobility, it’s doubling down on government affairs and lobbying for better accessibility.</p>
<p>“We believe that as an industry leader, Rad Power Bikes has a compelling market opportunity to fulfill the potential of e-bikes as an effective transportation and mobility solution globally,” said Andrew Davis, director of private investments at T. Rowe Price, in a statement. “In our view, they have the management team, technology strength and operational expertise to succeed over the long term and to play an important role in addressing the world’s current and future climate challenges.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Barcelona-based mobile keyboard software maker, <a href="https://www.fleksy.com/">Fleksy</a>, has bagged a $1.6 million Series A to cement a pivot to b2b for its white-label SDK for Android and iOS.</p>
<p>The round is led by Spanish asset management firm, Inveready, with follow on funding from some of the startup&#8217;s existing investors: SOSV and Simile Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The Series A brings the team&#8217;s total raised to date to just under $3M (€2.5M) since the business was founded back in 2015.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The AI keyboard maker has been a long time player in the third party smartphone keyboard space, initially developing a productivity-focused keyboard called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/04/thingthing-keyboard/">ThingThing</a> &#8212; before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/25/fleksy-keyboard-to-get-major-reboot-under-thingthing-dev-team/">acquiring the assets of better known US-based custom keyboard Fleksy</a> (which had gone into stasis after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/pinterest-acquires-the-team-behind-fleksy-a-custom-ios-and-android-keyboard/">dev team got acquired by Pinterest</a>) and making developing Fleksy the full focus.</p>
<p>However monetizing in the consumer custom keyboard space is tough going, with features like next word prediction and swipe inputting now baked into native smartphone keyboards, reducing the value of a third party add-on.</p>
<p>Tech giants like Apple and Google also throw their weight around in peculiar ways. (See, for eg, the flaky implementation of third party keyboards on iOS which helps dissuade users from switching away from Apple&#8217;s native keyboard. Or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/googles-play-store-is-giving-an-age-rating-finger-to-fleksy-a-gboard-rival/">this unfun thing Google&#8217;s Play Store did for a while</a>.)</p>
<p>So, last year, Fleksy rolled out an SDK &#8212; licensing its keyboard tech to other app makers and businesses who want powerfully predictive, context-specific, custom AI keyboard software which they can tint, brand and adapt in all sorts of ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The keyboard SDK could also be used by third parties to learn more about their users and/or seek to drive their own sales.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jkrccOXqAk"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/fleksy-rolls-out-an-sdk-for-its-ai-keyboard/">Fleksy rolls out an SDK for its AI keyboard</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fleksy rolls out an SDK for its AI keyboard&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/fleksy-rolls-out-an-sdk-for-its-ai-keyboard/embed/#?secret=jkrccOXqAk" data-secret="jkrccOXqAk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Among potential features which clients can implement via the SDK that it lists on its <a href="https://www.fleksy.com/solutions/">website</a> are the ability to bake context-specific advertising into the keyboard (aka, &#8220;hyper-contextually suggest products and services or set triggers to show your brand in any app at the opportune moment&#8221;); and a forthcoming CRM feature that Fleksy says will &#8220;enable shops to send marketing materials, invoices, updates, tasks, and even collect payment from the keyboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security focused features are also touted as &#8220;coming soon&#8221; &#8212; with custom tweaks that it says could be used to &#8220;prevent data leaks and sensitive information from getting out, monitor at-risk employees, Secure messages, prevent fraud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside this b2b play, Fleksy continues playing in the consumer space &#8212; where it strongly emphasizes user privacy as a differentiator for its software vs alternatives like Google&#8217;s Gboard (which sends users&#8217; search data to Google) &#8212; and most recently it was trying to entice consumers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fleksy-adds-an-art-marketplace-to-spice-up-its-keyboard-app/">art keyboards</a>.</p>
<p>But its center of gravity has clearly shifted to b2b. Hence foregrounding &#8216;Fleksy for Business&#8217; branding on its website, which has also had a deeptech aesthetic design makeover.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.app.fleksy.com/fleksy-product">consumer keyboard</a> will still stick around, though &#8212; for the hardcore fans and, doubtless, as a useful showcase/testbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumer is hard when the giants don&#8217;t compete equally. See Apple mess and Google mess around that. So we found our profitable niche: Helping others build an outstanding keyboard experience and beyond, via license fees,&#8221; says Fleksy&#8217;s CEO Olivier Plante, who was also CEO and co-founder of ThingThing. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to build what we have built, so it&#8217;s now a no brainer for these digital companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fleksy SDK gives all the tools that a company needs to thrive in their own rationale,&#8221; he also tells us when we raise the (privacy) question of how third parties might seek to use its keyboard tech to data-mine their own users. &#8220;Fleksy plays a technological role here only. We are not associated with a client&#8217;s own privacy stance.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he adds: &#8220;To be clear, Fleksy Consumer Apps will always be private &#8212; we don&#8217;t change our rationale there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fleksy says it now has &#8220;dozens&#8221; of companies licensing its tech &#8212; and touts 50 more in its &#8220;pipeline&#8221;. It also says revenue for its SDK business has grown 10x in a year.</p>
<p>This uplift explains the relatively modest size of the Series A, per Plante.</p>
<p>&#8220;We only needed this because we are generating quite a lot of money at the moment,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch, adding that the reason for raising a Series A now is to &#8220;expand faster&#8221;.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used for growth, hiring (to build out its 13-strong team) and to expand its portfolio of clients.</p>
<p>Fleksy&#8217;s best markets for licensing the keyboard tech to currently are the US and Europe but Plante says it has customers all over the world.</p>
<p>The SDK is also attracting a broad mix of customers &#8212; from digital health and fintech to gaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have so many leads looking for a keyboard experience &#8212; as you can see under /<a href="https://www.fleksy.com/solutions/">solutions</a>/ on the website &#8212; these industries &#8212; and even more will all be powered by Fleksy tech,&#8221; he suggests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have clients from all types with different needs and because we have built everything in-house &#8212; no third party&#8217;s black-box &#8212; we are able to modify everything for them. Which no other company can provide today. So companies in digital health for example have a profitable company to partner with who has full control over its tech stack,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fleksy SDK can be modified in many ways: From the layout, dictionary all the way to the core engines that power our autocorrect, predictions, sentiment and more. It&#8217;s what makes us the right choice but, as you know, the vision is much larger &#8212; &#8216;Typing on a screen will be typing on Fleksy&#8217; in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the Series A funding round, Inveready&#8217;s Ignacio Fonts is joining Fleksy&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Fonts said: “We are thrilled to join the <span class="il">Fleksy</span> team, which has been able to conquer a worldwide leadership position in keyboard technology, one of the control points of personal computing (phone, mobile, desktops) devices. This round will help them accelerate the development of a very compelling roadmap that will unveil to users new ways to interact with their devices and will provide companies new insights about their customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s world is run on data, and the amount of it that is being produced, managed and used to power services is growing by the minute &#8212; to the tune of some 79 zettabytes this year, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one estimate</a>. Today, a company called <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yugabyte</a>, which has built an open-source distributed SQL database model to help handle all that volume, is announcing that it has raised $188 million at a valuation of over $1.3 billion &#8212; a big round of funding and big valuation that underscore the market demand for better tools, and the demand that Yugabyte is in particular is seeing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Series C is being led by <span class="s1">Sapphire Ventures</span>, with <span class="s1">Alkeon Capital </span>and <span class="s1">Meritech Capital</span>, <span class="s1">Wells Fargo Strategic Capital</span>, and previous backers <span class="s1">Lightspeed Venture Partners</span>, <span class="s1">8VC</span>, <span class="s1">Dell Technologies Capital</span>, and <span class="s1">Wipro Ventures</span>, all also participating, among other unnamed backers. It was only seven months ago that the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/yugabyte-announces-48m-series-c-as-cloud-native-database-makes-enterprise-push/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed its Series B round</a> (which totaled $78 million).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Wells Fargo is one of Yugabyte&#8217;s key commercial customers, alongside Kroger, Hudson River Trading, Plume and <a href="https://www.yugabyte.com/success-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other organizations</a> that handle large amounts of data in their businesses, and in particular are looking for SQL-based solutions that can be used across multi-cloud, heterogeneous environments. The company tells me it is approaching 50 commercial customers currently. There are more using its open-source, free version, and it says that some 1,200 organizations &#8220;have signed up for&#8221; its fully-managed solution, Yugabyte Cloud, since its beta launch last year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225620" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re at an inflection point in enterprise IT at the moment, where a years-long trend of organizations gradually migrating to the cloud &#8212; and in particular more complex hybrid and multi-cloud environments &#8212; has seen a massive acceleration, in large part due to Covid-19. The pandemic precipitated a bigger shift to companies producing more data internally due to working in more remote and distributed environments, in many cases using more cloud-based digital tools to do so; and it also led to a huge surge in the world at large using more digital services. The knock-on effect is a much greater need among organizations for better database solutions to manage and work with that data, but also the realities, and complexities, of how it exists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Large enterprises are really only just starting to hit critical mass of workloads,&#8221; Bill Cook, Yugabyte&#8217;s CEO, said in an interview, added that those enterprises also are balancing that with some key priorities: &#8220;They are thinking a lot about infrastructure, and they don’t want to get locked into a particular cloud provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yugabyte&#8217;s pitch is that it addresses that challenge with a framework that can scale easily and securely as needed. It currently provides three SQL products to the market covering different use cases: YugabyteDB, its free, open source distributed SQL database; Yugabyte Platform, its self-managed cloud database-as-a-service product; and Yugabyte Cloud, the fully-managed cloud DBaaS launched just in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921005390/en/Yugabyte-Delivers-Effortless-Distributed-SQL-With-Cloud-Database-as-a-Service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September</a>.</p>
<p>Yugabyte itself was borne out of first-hand experience of how other systems didn&#8217;t work as well. The startup&#8217;s founders &#8212; Kannan Muthukkaruppan (president), Karthik Ranganathan (CTO) and Mikhail Bautin (software architect) originally worked together at Facebook. There, they built the NoSQL database that powered Messenger, where they came away realising some of the shortcomings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Initially very taken with the NoSQL &#8220;market success, we then realized the limitations of it,&#8221; said Ranganathan, who is Yubabyte&#8217;s CTO. &#8220;It&#8217;s very different to deal with these databases in production.&#8221; Specifically, as Cook described it, trends in microservices, containerization, services distribution, open source and API usage (and thus high latency and availability), are best addressed not through NoSQL but a distributed SQL database.</p>
<p>Jai Das, the president of Sapphire who is joining the board with is round, said that this is also what motivated him to lead this round.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;There hasn’t been any SQL innovation since MySQL,&#8221; he said, in particular to address the fact that many of the largest entprises now work with distributed databases, either because they have opted to do so, or they are required to because of regulatory demands or simply because that is how their networks and systems have evolved. Das believes that SQL will be at the heart of how databases will continue to evolve. &#8220;It is the lingua franca of how all applications will be built in the back end, and Yugabyte is the next generation.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Co-founder and CEO Grant Lee refers to building content in Gamma like “choosing your own adventure.”]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grant Lee has been living in slide decks for most of his career, but it wasn’t until he was doing some advisory work last year that relied heavily on slides that he aimed to reimagine the format.</p>
<p>“Slides were built for a different era of work,” he told TechCrunch. “They were more of a visual aid. You had to have a presenter because they have little standalone power without the person.”</p>
<p>Previously, people would print off slides or watch the presentation together on one screen, but the overall problem of people sharing and communicating their work has existed for a long time. Lee said. Slides have been around for over 30 years, and now everyone has their own screen.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225065" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So Lee and his co-founders, James Fox and Jon Noronha, all former Optimizely employees (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/episerver-acquires-optimizely/">Optimizely was acquired by Episerver in 2020</a>), started <a href="https://gamma.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamma</a>, a software that enables users to build stacks of cards that fit a brand’s aesthetic and prioritize design by linking different bits of content, like videos and embeddable forms that can be filled out in real time.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225076" style="width: 1090px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225076" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225076 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg" alt="Gamma" width="1080" height="810" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gamma-Team-Photo-.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225076" class="wp-caption-text">The Gamma team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gamma</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for Gamma was to create something that still feels familiar to the traditional slide, but that also “unlocks a whole new set of super power,” Lee said. He refers to building content in Gamma like “choosing your own adventure,” and the content can be dragged, dropped uploaded and fit into the cards. And though the presenter is guiding the conversation, watchers can explore the content themselves and then go back to following the presentation.</p>
<p>The company was founded last November, launched in private beta in August and is now announcing $7 million in seed funding led by Accel. Other participants in the round include Zoom CEO Eric Yuan; former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner; founders at Airtable, Patreon, Segment, Honey and Optimizely; and early-stage funds including Script Capital, South Park Commons, LocalGlobe, Afore and Hustle Fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When we came out of stealth in August, we were talking to Accel and thought they were the right partner,” Lee said. “Investing in a new medium can be difficult, but we were excited about crafting the right building blocks. The new funding will allow us to build out the team and the product, and it will help having the right partner.”</p>
<p>Gamma is now out of private beta and Lee said there are thousands of people on the waitlist to be onboarded. It is too early to discuss growth metrics, due to the company not yet having paying customers, but there will be some paid plans down the road, he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new funding will accelerate the company’s goal of doubling its stores in the U.S. and Europe.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish food tech company <a href="https://nicks.com/">N!CK’S</a> is taking on the world, one healthy ice cream pint at a time.</p>
<p>The company on Thursday announced $100 million Series C funding toward creating additional healthy snacks and ice cream products that have a proprietary blend of sweeteners and ingredients, but with a fraction of the calories and no added sugar.</p>
<p>Kinnevik, Ambrosia and Temasek co-led the round and were joined by Gullspang. The latest funding gives the company $160 million in total investments, Carlos Altschul, N!CK’S CEO North America, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225407" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>N!CK’S got started in 2017 in Europe when founder and head of R&amp;D Niclas Luthman’s mother was diagnosed as a diabetic, and Luthman diagnosed as pre-diabetic, according to Altschul.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“He recognized that there was not a lot of food science bringing better-for-you solutions to the space,” he added. “He found that it was easier to change the food versus change the way we eat.”</p>
<p>In Europe, the company makes ice cream, snack bars and confectionery products. However, Altschul says N!CK’S is a snacking brand that is “a platform for changing culture.” The innovation and ingredients, all rooted in the company&#8217;s R&amp;D, are what differentiates the company from its competitors, he added.</p>
<p>The company has been busy over the past two years. At the end of 2019, N!CK’S entered the United States with ice cream and is now leading in velocity per store in that category, he added. It also launched a vegan dairy line featuring Perfect Day’s proprietary animal-free dairy proteins and plant-based alternative fat.</p>
<p>Its direct-to-consumer business launched in 2020 and has remained at the top of the DTC ice cream delivery space since July, Altschul said. This year, the company launched a line of Keto protein bars, starting on its direct-to-consumer and Amazon channels, with plans to expand into retail stores by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Between 2020 and 2021, N!CK’S expanded from 4,500 U.S. stores to 6,700, and expanded in the U.K. through a partnership with WHSmith.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Yamo scores €10.1M Series A to offer healthier food choices for young children&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/yamo/embed/#?secret=1Lrsjci0Jc" data-secret="1Lrsjci0Jc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new funding will accelerate the company’s goal of doubling its stores in the U.S. and Europe, hiring additional talent, marketing and making investments in R&amp;D so that it can launch new products.</p>
<p>Magnus Jakobson, investment director at Kinnevik, said he has been investing in the food space for a few years and says the industry is attractive due to the multiple tailwinds of sustainability and health happening at the moment, which is driving demand and the upstream ability to build brands.</p>
<p>He considers it “an exciting point in time,” that the traction N!CK’S has shown to date “is impressive,” especially having done it on its own initially, and that strategy has now attracted other food technology partners.</p>
<p>“How people live and consume food is changing and is what is enabling new brands to be built,” Jakobson said. “Companies like Oatly, Beyond and Impossible started the industry, but we have seen more breakouts in technology and new ways of reaching consumers with standalone brands. N!CK’S is a super exciting one, and even in the early days of the industry, is showing promise.”</p>
