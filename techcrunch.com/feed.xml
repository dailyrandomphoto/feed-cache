										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/looking-glass" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="looking-glass">Looking Glass Factory <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> introduced the Portrait, its first offering for a more general audience. The device utilizes the company’s impressive holographic imaging technology for a far more accessible form factor – a technically impressive digital photo frame, put simply.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the biggest question marks for technology like this is always content. More specifically, how do the people who buy the $349 product actually create 3D images to use with it? Then startup announced its solution to that issue today in the form of HoloPlay Studio. The company’s proprietary software was created to convert 2D images to 3D.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pJxdNRA1CM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Now extremely realistic holographic memories of all sorts can be created and enjoyed by more people than ever before, getting us one step closer to a world in which we’re creating in, communicating with, and reliving our memories through holograms,” CEO Shawn Frayne said in a release.</p>
<p>The company promises a low barrier of entry here. Users just need to upload images to the software. Results will likely vary depending on a number of factors. This is the kind of thing I’d normally like to see in person, first, but it’s been a bad couple of years for hands-on experiences.</p>
<p>The tech is set to go live through Looking Glass’s site at some point in the Spring. After that, it will be bundled with the new portrait devices. Backers get 20 conversions for free and then it’s $20 for 100 photos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a year of video calls and Slack messages, the definition of workplace is set to shift again. In a post pandemic world, some will return to the office, many will remain remote, and regardless of where an employee sits, Florent Crivello, the co-founder of Teamflow, has raised millions for what he views as a trillion-dollar idea to make their work day easier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teamflowhq.com/">Teamflow</a>, formerly Huddle, is creating a virtual headquarters to help distributed teams collaborate and communicate from a singular platform. The startup, which has been in private beta for six months, today announced it has raised $3.9 million in a seed financing round led by Menlo Ventures.</p>
<p>It’s good timing, as Crivello notes, as the competition is red hot. There are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">dozens of other virtual HQ platforms</a>, some venture-backed and some bootstrapped, similarly mixing gamification and productivity into a service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I think every engineer and every tech person in the Valley has been having a very first-hand experience of this problem over the last year,” Crivello said. “A lot of small brains are thinking about this issue right now.”</p>
<p>Crivello, who previously led teams at Uber, sees Teamflow’s focus on virtual work, instead of virtual socializing, as its competitive advantage against other platforms. Competitors include <a href="https://branch.gg/">Branch</a>, which has a more social feel, and Hopin, a platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">last valued at $2 billion</a> which produces digital conferences.</p>
<p>“We’re not pokemon kind of fun,” he said. “We’re still very work-focused.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2092771" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png?resize=768,327 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png?resize=680,290 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>A quick tour through Teamflow illustrates its emphasis on productivity over aesthetic. When you enter the virtual space, you’re greeted with a sidebar of options: ranging from white boards, countdown timers, and soon integrations with Notion and Google Docs.</p>
<p>Crivello views Teamflow as being a response to the very “app-centric” world of remote work right now. The platform can be the collaboration layer that brings all the apps out of unorganized tab hell and into one place.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2092109" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/huddle-2020-12-21-at-12.28.44-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="582" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/huddle-2020-12-21-at-12.28.44-PM.png 3338w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/huddle-2020-12-21-at-12.28.44-PM.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/huddle-2020-12-21-at-12.28.44-PM.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/huddle-2020-12-21-at-12.28.44-PM.png?resize=768,436 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/huddle-2020-12-21-at-12.28.44-PM.png?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/huddle-2020-12-21-at-12.28.44-PM.png?resize=1536,872 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/huddle-2020-12-21-at-12.28.44-PM.png?resize=2048,1163 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/huddle-2020-12-21-at-12.28.44-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Teamflow uses spatial technology to give employees the feel of spontaneity. If you walk &#8211; or toggle &#8211; past a co-worker, you’ll be able to join in conversation. The farther you move, the less you hear. There are also breakout rooms where people can enter to have focused, invite-only meetings.</p>
<p>The product has shown some signs of growth since launching its beta. There is 30% growth in hours on the platform week over week, bringing a total of over 50,000 hours of user testing into the platform experience. There are 1,000 users on the waitlist.</p>
<p>“We believe that we are this thing you open in the morning and leave open all day,” Crivello said.</p>
<p>While Teamflow is focusing heavily on productivity, user design does matter when you’re trying to convince consumers to spend an entire work day on your app. Teamflow will need to make more investments in its experience to give it the feel and culture of a virtual HQ, versus another place for employees to spend screen time. It&#8217;s why some competitors are opting for a gamified approach.</p>
<p>Any virtual HQ company will have to convince users to exist passively on its platform for a meaningful amount of time, every single day.</p>
<p>If all goes well, Teamflow is looking to be a remote work solution that can replace Slack and Zoom. Crivello says that he has “several customers” who have stopped using both apps altogether, and Teamflow is currently building an internal chat feature that rivals Slack.</p>
<p>The cost for a subscription, per seat, <a href="https://www.teamflowhq.com/">starts at $20 a month</a>.</p>
<p>“There’s so much more to remote work collaboration than communication,” Crivello said. Slack and Zoom’s primary features are connecting employees to each other to talk; while he hopes that Teamflow allows employees to talk and work in one place.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the opportunity for a platform that can get widespread adoption around distributed teams is grandiose. Pandemic or not, Teamflow thinks that the world has experienced a tipping point which will bring distributed work mainstream. Founders will be looking for solutions to keep their teams happy, and productivity high.</p>
<p>“Now, if you don’t offer remote work, you’re at a competitive disadvantage [as a company],” Crivello said.</p>
<p>The beauty of early-stage startups is that long-term success doesn’t need to be obvious from the get go. Yet, when it comes to Teamflow, or any virtual HQ platform, the validation will be simple to prove (or disprove) the moment that post-pandemic consumer habits materialize.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this morning announced it&#8217;s bringing the full-service creative agency <a href="https://ueno.co/">Ueno</a> in-house to work alongside Twitter&#8217;s own design and research teams. The move, an acqui-hire of sorts, is one where Twitter is essentially buying the agency with which it already had a close working relationship, as Ueno had previously partnered with Twitter on various design and product experiences in the past.</p>
<p>The agency itself was founded by Haraldur Thorleifsson in Reykjavik, Iceland in 2014. Today, it has dozens of employees working in Reykjavik, San Francisco, New York and LA.</p>
<p>Over the years, Ueno has worked on a number of projects for large brands and startups alike, including Google, Facebook, Reuters, Uber, ESPN, Sotheby&#8217;s, Walmart, Visa, NYT, Apple, Slack and others. Startups that contracted the agency include Zero, Checkout.com, Superhuman, Tagomi, Strava, Cruise, Credit Karma, Boosted and many more. (Ueno also <a href="https://ueno.co/work/clubhouse/">worked</a> on Clubhouse per its website, but not the same Clubhouse that&#8217;s competing with Twitter Spaces.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Also among its clients were those that had other Twitter ties: Medium and Jelly. The former is the publishing platform from Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, and the latter was a Q&amp;A app created by Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, which later sold to Pinterest.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to share that today we’re welcoming the <a href="https://twitter.com/uenodotco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@uenodotco</a> team to Twitter! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/1f44b-1f3fe.png" alt="👋🏾" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter Chief Design Officer Dantley Davis <a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1346818827204481024?s=20">announced</a> the news of Ueno&#8217;s joining on Twitter this morning, saying Ueno has a &#8220;highly experienced and innovative team of designers, strategists, and producers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said the team will help Twitter to &#8220;accelerate the quality and execution of Twitter&#8217;s product experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ueno&#8217;s founder, meanwhile, also announced the news, then <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">teased</a> Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey about the edit button.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter tells TechCrunch that Ueno will wind down its agency and will complete its existing projects for other clients over the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>The company also said it will be meeting with Ueno&#8217;s 50 global employees over the weeks ahead to learn more about their professional backgrounds and goals &#8212; essentially, to determine if they can fit inside Twitter&#8217;s design and research orgs. That means Twitter may or may not end up hiring all 50.</p>
<p>Twitter isn&#8217;t publicly sharing what projects it has in mind for Ueno, but we understand the Ueno staff will end up embedded across key teams within the design and research organizations so they can work on top of product initiatives, including &#8220;conversational tools&#8221; and other upcoming features. Reading between the lines, this seems to indicate that Twitter Spaces, the company&#8217;s new audio-based conversations tool, will benefit from the acqui-hire.</p>
<p>The company also noted it will continue to be on the lookout for other talent to help it accelerate its work in a similar way, so this may not be the last acqui-hire deal to come.</p>
<p>The news of Ueno&#8217;s acqui-hire follows that of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">Twitter&#8217;s acquisition of social podcasting app Breaker,</a> announced just this week, also with the goal of staffing up on Twitter&#8217;s new audio-based networking project and Clubhouse rival (the audio app), Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p>Deal terms were not shared.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2020, venture capitalists unceremoniously broke up with D2C brands and product-based businesses.</p>
<p>Many watched as the consumer brands in their portfolios <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/startups/coronavirus-fallout-tracking-the-layoffs-furloughs-and-cuts-at-retail-startups/">rushed to make hefty layoffs and eke out more runway</a> and <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/professional/direct-to-consumer-coronavirus-recession-dtc">grew more concerned</a> with their business models.</p>
<p>Some simply monitored the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/technology/casper-ipo.html">“lackluster”</a> Casper IPO or skimmed articles about Brandless and others <a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-all-the-warby-parker-clones-are-now-imploding-44bfcc70a00c">“imploding”</a> and started pulling a slow fade on D2C brands — not taking pitches, not following up.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Many product-based brands, as it turns out, are no longer interested in chasing venture capital.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Last year, investors adopted a wait-and-see approach to all new investments and prayed portfolio brands could cut their burn significantly enough, stay relevant and ride things out.</p>
<p>Product-based businesses fell out of favor and venture capitalists, if they did invest last year, mainly <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/how-covid-19-changed-the-vc-investment-landscape-in-the-us/">focused</a> on AI startups, or companies focused on data collaboration, data privacy and healthcare (mostly <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-to-female-founders/">founded by men</a>, might I add).</p>
<p>From a distance, it sounds like direct-to-consumer founders were left destitute and desperate for financing, wounded by every slow fade or hard pass, beholden as ever to the whims of Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>But as Hal Koss so eloquently <a href="https://builtin.com/e-commerce/dtc-dnvb-brand-growth">shared</a> in his “DTC playbook” post-mortem, this wasn’t a one-way breakup; this parting of ways is actually mutual. Many product-based brands, as it turns out, are no longer interested in chasing venture capital, playing the “grow-at-all-costs” game and relinquishing partial control to investors, despite the pandemic and the uncertain circumstances many founders find themselves facing.</p>
<p>Through my work running and scaling <a href="bulletin.co">Bulletin</a>, I’ve followed thousands of product-based businesses ranging from indie beauty brands selling clean serums and cleansers to sex tech companies making couples&#8217; vibrators and foreplay accessories. I’ve followed them on Instagram, in the press and across various platforms, and in many cases, I’ve spoken to their founders directly.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, I interviewed executives at more than 30 women-owned businesses for my upcoming book, <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-to-build-a-goddamn-empire-ali-kriegsman/1136396448">&#8220;How to Build a Goddamn Empire,&#8221; </a>and had long phone calls with dozens of independent brands and makers as Bulletin got a handle on how the pandemic was impacting customers. And I noticed something new and remarkable about what founders want now, in 2021, compared to what they wanted in years past.</p>
<p>Back then, I’d get dozens of cold emails and DMs asking how I successfully raised VC and what the unspoken rules might be. I’d hear from business owners who were considering a raise or gearing up for one. Product-based entrepreneurs approached me at panels or Bulletin events and say they wanted to be the “Glossier for X” or the “Away for Y.” Many younger founders didn’t even know what venture capital really was, but they saw it as symbolic validation for the business, or the only way to get “big.”</p>
<p>Now, brands would rather scrape by than pursue an injection of funding on someone else’s terms; just ask the <a href="https://www.glossy.co/fashion/gorjanas-co-founders-jason-and-gorjana-reidel-on-prioritizing-profitability-over-growth">Gorjana founders</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/06/magazine/fashion-sweatpants.html">Scott Sternberg</a>. Many brands that saw astronomical growth in 2020, like <a href="https://www.rosenskincare.com/">Rosen</a>, <a href="https://golde.co/">Golde</a>, <a href="https://theentireworld.com/">Entireworld</a> and others that spurred similar growth for Etsy and Shopify are fully bootstrapped businesses, and proudly so.</p>
<p>Some founders I’ve spoken to have even outright rejected offers for investment. A lot of D2C brands are interested in learning about alternative forms of financing like bank loans, lines of credit and crowdfunding, and ask about iFundWomen or Kickstarter, observing the success of other fully crowdfunded brands like <a href="https://www.dameproducts.com/">Dame</a> and <a href="https://www.wearpepper.com/">Pepper</a>.</p>
<p>Venture capital, from my vantage point, has lost its sheen for a lot of product-based brands. They’re not destitute and desperate for financing. They’re actually scoffing at the prospect and trusting they can succeed, scale and maintain long-term profitability without swapping equity for cash. They’re tripped up by <a href="https://marker.medium.com/why-all-the-warby-parker-clones-are-now-imploding-44bfcc70a00c">what they’ve been reading in the media</a>, or they’ve survived or even thrived during COVID, as a fully bootstrapped company, and feel more conviction than ever that the “grow slow” approach is the right move.</p>
<p>They’re reading the same stories about <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/startups/coronavirus-fallout-tracking-the-layoffs-furloughs-and-cuts-at-retail-startups/">layoffs and tenuous unit economics at massive D2C companies</a> and agreeing with Sam Kaplan that the old playbook &#8212; pricey customer acquisition practices, rapid scale, endless rounds of funding &#8212; is out of date. It’s 2021 and we’re midpandemic. These brands want to turn a profit.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The New York Stock Exchange announced this morning that it will be delisting three major Chinese telecom companies, a move that it first announced last week before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/nyse-reverses-plans-to-delist-chinas-three-big-telcos/">seeming to reverse course on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>This is all happening in response to the Trump Administration&#8217;s broader order barring U.S. investment in companies that support the Chinese military. (Trump has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/second-federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administrations-tiktok-ban/">trying to ban TikTok </a> through a separate order.)</p>
<p>Why the double reversal? To be fair to the NYSE, in its first reversal, the exchange had only said it would allow the telecoms to continue trading while it evaluates whether the executive order applies to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now it seems that the further evaluation is complete. In <a href="https://ir.theice.com/press/news-details/2021/NYSE-Announces-Suspension-Date-for-Securities-of-Three-Issuers-and-Proceeds-with-Delisting/default.aspx">today&#8217;s announcement</a>, the NYSE said it&#8217;s making the decision after receiving &#8220;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/864">new specific guidance</a>&#8221; confirming that yes, the executive order does apply to China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom.</p>
<p>As a result, trading of all three stocks will be suspended on the exchange as of 4am Eastern time on Monday, January 11. The move is seen as largely symbolic, since the telecoms&#8217; trading volume via the NYSE only represents a small percentage of their total tradable shares.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Loosely, then: at the low end of its valuation range, Poshmark is worth 8.6x its current run rate, and at the top-end a richer 10.9x.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new year is off to a busy IPO start. As The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/looking-ahead-to-2021-venture-fundraising-liquidity-and-the-everything-bubble/">reported a few weeks ago</a>, investors anticipate a busy Q1 IPO cycle, followed by a slower Q2 and a busy Q3 and Q4.</p>
<p>With Affirm releasing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/affirm-targets-up-to-38-per-share-in-ipo-pushing-its-valuation-above-9b/">an initial IPO price range last night</a> and Poshmark repeating the feat this morning, private-market investor expectations are holding up thus far.</p>
<p>Secondhand fashion marketplace <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/poshmark" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="poshmark">Poshmark <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1825480/000119312521002416/d66583ds1a.htm">anticipates</a> its IPO could price between $35 and $39 per share. Using its simple share count, the former startup could be worth nearly $3 billion. So, we&#8217;ve seen two multiunicorns set early pricing terms this week. That&#8217;s comfortably busy.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>As we did with Affirm, we&#8217;ll dig into Poshmark&#8217;s new pricing interval, calculate valuations for the company using both simple and fully diluted share counts, and figure out how they compare to its most-recent financial results and final private valuation. For the last bit, we&#8217;ll pull from <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook data</a> and the S-1/A filing itself.</p>

<p>If you want to read our first dig into the company&#8217;s IPO filing that is more focused on performance than pricing, head <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/unpacking-poshmarks-ipo-filing/">here</a>. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>Poshmark&#8217;s hugely &#8220;up&#8221; IPO</h2>
<p>Poshmark&#8217;s $35 to $39 per-share IPO price interval could change, but even if it fails to rise, the company&#8217;s implied valuation is a dramatic step up from prior rounds.</p>
<p>For example, the company&#8217;s S-1 filings note that during its 2017 venture round — the last that it raised per the IPO filing and PitchBook data — Poshmark sold shares at $8.37 per share. That&#8217;s a fraction of the price that the company now expects public-market investors to pay.</p>
<p>As with Affirm, let&#8217;s calculate Poshmark&#8217;s valuation using both simple and fully diluted share counts. The latter takes into account shares that have been earned, but not yet exercised or converted.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the company&#8217;s valuation range using a simple share count, <em>inclusive</em> of its underwriters&#8217; option to purchase 990,000 shares at its IPO price:</p>
<ul>
<li>Poshmark valuation, low-end of range: $2.6 billion.</li>
<li>Poshmark valuation, high-end of range: $2.9 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we expand the company&#8217;s share count to include vested options and RSUs, the numbers go up. Again, the following math is inclusive<em> </em>of the underwriters&#8217; option:<sup>1</sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Poshmark valuation, low-end of range: $2.95 billion billion.</li>
<li>Poshmark valuation, high-end of range: $3.29 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, are those good numbers? Yes.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2020, when the entire world was laser-focused on the coronavirus pandemic, we realized that startupland was in unprecedented territory. How should startups navigate fundraising, operations, and better understand the market? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a matter of a couple weeks, we spun up a little series called Extra Crunch Live, giving Extra Crunch members the chance to hear from and connect with leaders across the industry. We brought on some of the biggest names in tech and VC, including likes of Roelof Botha, Kirsten Green, Zach Perret, Charles Hudson, Aileen Lee, Mark Cuban, Howard Lerman, Niko Bonatsos, Alexa Von Tobel, Aileen Lee and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/extra-crunch-live/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the list could go on and on and on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, we did 44 episodes of the show in 2020, the year of our Lord. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By any measure, it’s been a huge success. But we’re not ones to rest on our laurels here at TechCrunch. Which is why I’m thrilled to announce Extra Crunch Live 2.0. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, we’ll be tweaking the format of ECL to provide even more interactivity between founders and audience members and the speakers we host on the show. You’re going to love it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s New: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Series A</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Learn how others have fundraised! We’ll have a segment dedicated to hearing from founder/investor duos who walk us through the Series A pitch deck that led to investment. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pitch Deck Teardowns</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Extra Crunch members will have the opportunity to submit their pitch deck and get feedback from our guests, which will include VCs and founders (</span><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC members can submit their pitch decks right here!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Live Pitch-offs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Audience members can raise their hand to practice their elevator pitch in front of the audience and get real-time feedback from VCs.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Networking!!</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; The Extra Crunch membership is a community. ECL will be an opportunity to meet your fellow audience members, even in a virtual environment. Who knows? Maybe you’ll meet your next cofounder or investor! </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Consistency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; ECL will always be at </span><b>12pm PT/3pm ET on Wednesdays</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When it comes to your calendar, set it and forget it. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re super excited about our ECL plans for 2021 and we hope you are, too. More on upcoming speakers soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, Extra Crunch Live events are for EC members only, so if you haven’t joined Extra Crunch, </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=ECL2LAUNCH"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get over here!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple this morning <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/apple-services-entertain-inform-and-connect-the-world-in-unprecedented-year/">offered</a> an updated look at its App Store business with the release of its holiday sales figures. The company said App Store customers spent $1.8 billion in apps during the week of Christmas Eve and New Year&#8217;s Eve, driven largely by games. And App Store customers also hit a new single-day spending record on New Year&#8217;s Day of over $540 million.</p>
<p>What Apple didn&#8217;t fully spell out was to what extent the pandemic played a role in increased app spending over the course of 2020. It did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/apple-releases-its-best-of-2020-app-store-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/">again </a>note that top apps during the year had included those that helped customers stay connected and be entertained, like Zoom and Disney+, as well as games that brought people together, like Roblox and Among Us.</p>
<p>However, the company didn&#8217;t detail how much customers spent on apps and games over 2020. That leaves us to look to third-party estimates for those figures. According <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-2020">to Sensor Tower&#8217;s year-end report,</a> global consumer spending on the App Store reached $72.3 billion in 2020, up 30.3% year-over-year from $55.5 billion in 2019. App Annie came up with a similar figure in <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2020-mobile-recap-how-to-succeed-in-2021/">a preliminary estimate</a> ahead of its annual report.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple, on the other hand, noted that App Store developers have now earned over $200 billion to date since the App Store began in 2008, a figure that&#8217;s up from the $155 billion it <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/01/apple-rings-in-new-era-of-services-following-landmark-year/">announced last year.</a></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s holiday week last year had also set a new record with $1.42 billion spent on apps and games, a 16% increase over the year prior. Given that consumers in 2020 spent $1.8 billion, it seems a new record has now been set as well, but it&#8217;s unclear why Apple didn&#8217;t highlight that today.</p>
<p>Apple also shared a few updates related to its other services businesses in its 2020 wrap-up. It said Apple Music had a &#8220;record year&#8221; without sharing specifics. Instead, it only noted that 90% of iOS 14 listeners had tried out its new features, like Listen Now, the updated Search, personal radio stations, and Autoplay. Apple also said engagement with its lyrics feature doubled in 2020.</p>
<p>Apple additionally noted the Apple TV+ app is now available across 1 billion screens in over 100 countries, and customers can now buy or rent over 100,000 new release and classic movies and shows.</p>
<p>Apple Pay, meanwhile, is now available at over 90% of U.S. stores, 85% of stores in the U.K., and 99% of stores in Australia.</p>
<p>Apple News, iCloud, and its new service, Fitness+ were mentioned, but Apple didn&#8217;t offer any new metrics related to user adoption or growth.</p>
<p>The company also said Apple Arcade had reached over 140 games, Apple Books now has 90+ million monthly active users, and Apple Podcasts is now available in over 175 countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s competition and markets regulator is seeking views on Nvidia&#8217;s takeover of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/arm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="arm">Arm Holdings <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as it prepares to kick off formal oversight of potential competition impacts of the deal.</p>
<p>The US-based chipmaker&#8217;s $40BN purchase of the UK-based chip designer, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">last September</a>, has triggered a range of domestic concerns &#8212; over the impact on UK jobs, industrial strategy/economic sovereignty and even national security &#8212; although the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)&#8217;s probe will focus solely on possible competition-related impacts.</p>
<p>It said today that the probe will likely to consider whether, post-acquisition, Arm would have an incentive to &#8220;withdraw, raise prices or reduce the quality of its IP licensing services to Nvidia&#8217;s rivals&#8221;, per a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-nvidia-s-takeover-of-arm">press release</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cma-2067" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cma-2067">CMA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is inviting interested third parties to comment on the acquisition before January 27 &#8212; ahead of the launch of its formal probe. That phase 1 investigation will include additional opportunities for external comment, according to the regulator, which has not yet provided a date for when it will take a decision on the acquisition.</p>
<p>Further details can be found on its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/nvidia-slash-arm-merger-inquiry">case page &#8212; here</a>.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Andrea Coscelli, the CMA&#8217;s chief executive, said: “The chip technology industry is worth billions and critical to many of the products that we use most in our everyday lives. We will work closely with other competition authorities around the world to carefully consider the impact of the deal and ensure that it doesn’t ultimately result in consumers facing more expensive or lower quality products.”</p>
<p>Among those sounding the alarm about the impact on the UK of an Nvidia-Arm takeover is the original founder of the company, Hermann Hauser.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Arm co-founder starts &#8216;Save Arm&#8217; campaign to keep independence amid $40B Nvidia deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/arm-co-founder-starts-save-arm-campaign-to-keep-independence-amid-40b-nvidia-deal/embed/#?secret=2plupIca1x" data-secret="2plupIca1x" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/arm-co-founder-starts-save-arm-campaign-to-keep-independence-amid-40b-nvidia-deal/">September</a> he wrote to the prime minister saying he&#8217;s “extremely concerned” about the impact on UK jobs, Arm’s business model and the future of the country’s economic sovereignty.</p>
<p>A website Hauser set up to gather signatures of objection &#8212; called <a href="https://www.savearm.co.uk">savearm.co.uk</a> &#8212; states that more than 2,000 signatures had been collected as of October 12.</p>
<p>As well as the CMA, a number of other international regulators will be scrutinizing the deal, with Nvidia saying in September that it expected the clearance process to take 1.5 years.</p>
<p>It has sought to preempt UK concerns, saying it will double down on the country as a core part of its engineering efforts by expanding <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Arm’s offices in Cambridge &#8212; where it said it would establish &#8220;a new global center of excellence in AI research&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>On wider national security concerns that are being attached to the Nvidia-Arm deal from some quarters, the CMA noted that the UK government could choose to issue a public interest intervention notice &#8220;if appropriate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Arm was earlier bought by Japan&#8217;s SoftBank for around $31BN back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/05/softbank-has-completed-its-24b-cash-acquisition-of-arm-holdings/">2016</a>.</p>
<p>Its subsequent deal to offload the chip designer to Nvidia is a mixture of cash and stock &#8212; and included an immediate $2BN cash payment to SoftBank. But the majority of the transaction&#8217;s value is due to be paid in Nvidia stock at close of the deal, pending regulatory clearances.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Now that the U.S. has a new president coming in whose policies are more welcoming to immigrants, I am considering coming to the U.S. to expand my company after COVID-19. However, I’m struggling with the morass of information online that has bits and pieces of visa types and processes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can you please share an overview of the U.S. immigration system and how it works so I can get the big picture and understand what I’m navigating?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Resilient in Romania</strong></p>
<p>Dear Resilient:</p>
<p>We welcome you to the U.S.! Our country greatly benefits from international entrepreneurs like you who expand here to innovate, create jobs and bolster the global economy.</p>
<p>I followed in my father’s footsteps to become an immigration attorney to fulfill my personal mission of helping people live the life of their dreams in the United States. A big part of making that happen is to give individuals the information and the tools they need to clearly set their immigration goals and to reach them quickly.</p>
<p>Check out my recent <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/051-u-s-immigration-explained/">podcast</a> where I provide a brief, high-level overview of the U.S. immigration system. The United States is a nation founded by immigrants. The immigration system is based on many of the same values and principles enshrined in our Constitution.</p>
<p>In 1965, the U.S. Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, the foundation of all of our immigration laws today. Although some amendments to the act have been made over more than 50 years since then, the immigration system still operates under the same framework created back then. One of the things I appreciate about this framework is that there are so many legal routes to immigrate to the U.S. that are available.</p>
<p>There are many visa and green card categories you can use to chart your course. As a creative lawyer with plenty of lead time before somebody moves to the U.S., it provides many options to work with. Law doesn’t just place restrictions on people; it can be used as a tool for creation.</p>
<p>So, even though the system has its challenges and can be greatly improved, successfully navigating the system is doable. Everyone from individuals to founders, CEOs at startups and HR and Global Mobility at giant companies, families and couples in love &#8212; you just need to know the right questions to ask and the information to empower you to find the right immigration path.</p>
<p>My father used to always say there are five main areas of immigration law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business immigration</li>
<li>Family immigration</li>
<li>Asylum</li>
<li>Appeals</li>
<li>Removal and deportation</li>
</ul>
<p>I have worked on cases in each of these areas, but my firm focuses primarily on business and family immigration. Business immigration encompasses both visas and green cards, whereas family immigration only involves green cards that are based on an individual’s relationship to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (green card holders), including fiance visa and different pathways to green cards.</p>
<p>At a high level, the U.S. offers two types of visas: nonimmigrant visas and immigrant visas. Immigrant visas are also called green cards.</p>
<p>Nonimmigrant visas allow for a temporary stay in the U.S. Each nonimmigrant visa that allows its holder to work in the U.S. requires an employer to sponsor the individual and hire them after approval and arrival. Each nonimmigrant is designed to allow an individual with certain skills, education or expertise that will benefit the employer, the employer’s industry or the U.S in general, such as a multinational executive (L-1) an individual in a specialty occupation (H-1B) or with extraordinary ability (O-1).</p>
<p>Some nonimmigrant visas are based on the candidate’s home country or whether the individual’s home country has a trade agreement with the U.S. Each work visa has different requirements for renewals. I discuss these and other startup-friendly visas and green cards in more detail in a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/044-7-of-the-most-startup-friendly-visas-explained/">podcast</a> on the most startup-friendly visas and green cards.</p>
<p>A green card allows its holder to live and work permanently in the U.S. and is the first step to obtaining U.S. citizenship. Some nonimmigrant visas lead directly to a green card. However, many do not. So it’s important to be creative and strategic from the beginning of your U.S. immigration journey.</p>
<p>Most employment-based green cards require an employer sponsor. The two exceptions are the EB-1A green card for extraordinary ability and the EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) for exceptional ability. Individuals can apply for these green cards on their own without an employer sponsor or job offer. We cover both of these green cards, as well as the O-1 nonimmigrant visa in <a href="https://alcorn-immigration-law.teachable.com/p/extraordinary-ability-bootcamp">Extraordinary Ability Bootcamp</a>, an online course that takes a deep dive into the O-1A nonimmigrant visa, and the EB-1A and EB-2 NIW green cards, for which you may be eligible to apply.</p>
<p>Most international founders and entrepreneurs typically qualify for an E-2, L-1 or O-1 visa, or an EB-1A, EB-1C or EB-2 NIW green card. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Alcorn-Immigration-Options-for-Talent-Investors-Founders.pdf?acd0a8&amp;acd0a8">immigration options chart</a> we created that outlines the most common visa and green card categories that apply to founders, investors and talent.</p>
<p>In addition to the various visa and green card options, you should know that you can apply for a visa or green card while living outside the U.S. or while living inside the U.S. Living outside the U.S., you can apply for a visa or green card at a U.S. embassy or consulate, which is called consular processing. Once living in the U.S., you can apply for change of status to another visa or adjustment of status to a green card. For more information about specific visas and green cards and how to navigate the U.S. immigration system, check out my weekly <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/">podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Even during COVID, I’m confident you’ll find your way to the U.S. to begin your journey of expanding your company. I wish you good health and much success in 2021!</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Sophie</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Pages are being redesigned. The social network announced today a significant change to the Facebook Page experience for creators and public figures, which includes a new look-and-feel, updated navigation, the introduction of a dedicated News Feed, a new Q&amp;A format for engaging fans, and other tools and insights. Notably, the redesign will also do away with the &#8220;Like&#8221; button to instead focus on Followers &#8212; a more direct measurement of how many people a Page is currently reaching.</p>
<p>TechCrunch first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/facebook-tests-a-new-page-design-with-a-cleaner-layout-and-no-more-like-button/">reported the company&#8217;s plans</a> to overhaul Facebook Pages this past summer, when it began to test the updated look with a select number of high-profile individuals, including actors, authors, creators, followed by English-language business Pages.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/introducing-the-new-page-experience/">Facebook says</a> the new experience will officially begin to roll out to all Facebook Pages over the months ahead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>One of the biggest changes about the new Page design is that it does away &#8220;Likes.&#8221; This came about because Likes were misrepresenting a Page&#8217;s true popularity. Many Facebook users had once &#8220;Liked&#8221; a Page, but later unfollowed the Page to remove its updates from their News Feed as they outgrew their interest. Or they had &#8220;Liked&#8221; a Page as a favor to a friend after receiving a request, but declined to receive its updates.</p>
<p>Facebook now says Followers of a Page will be the metric at the forefront of the new experience, as it&#8217;s a better indication of how many people are fans who are receiving updates from the Page.</p>
<p>Another notable change is that Pages will get their own News Feed. That means the Page itself can participate in conversations as the public figure or the brand, follow trends, and interact with their fans. This dedicated News Feed will also suggest other public figures, Pages, Groups and trending content for the Page or the public figure to interact with, as well.</p>
<p>When you follow a Page, you&#8217;ll see their comments on others&#8217; posts bumped up to the top of the comments section, giving them better visibility, alongside a more visible blue-check that indicates the Page is verified. The posts they&#8217;ve commented on may also be more visible in users&#8217; News Feeds, too.</p>
<p>Other people will be able to follow Pages directly from the comments and recommendations posts, Facebook says.</p>
<p>Facebook is also introducing<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/860818064672471?helpref=search&amp;sr=1&amp;query=Q%26A&amp;search_session_id=4de488f24d633eb44995edc36c03d427&amp;rdrhc"> a new Q&amp;A format</a> that allows Pages to better engage with fans. This is somewhat inspired by the Instagram trend, where creators would take questions from fans and answer them in Stories. In this case, however, followers can ask the Page questions about a topic and when the Page answers, those become a stack of questions that people can swipe through to learn more. This could be particularly useful for businesses who want to answer common questions in a fun way for fans to get to know a creator they like, among other things.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2092686" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New_Page_Experience_inline2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New_Page_Experience_inline2.jpg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New_Page_Experience_inline2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New_Page_Experience_inline2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New_Page_Experience_inline2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New_Page_Experience_inline2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New_Page_Experience_inline2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>In addition to these handful of major changes, there are a few updates on the backend which are aimed at those who manage Facebook Pages. For example, Page admins will be able to assign access permissions more granularly, to focus on giving people varying levels of access to perform specific tasks across Insights, Ads, Content, and Community Activity, and Messages.</p>
<p>Based on feedback Facebook received during the testing phase, it built a set of new admin tools interface that now has a direct entry point for managing permissions, adding new admins and accessing insights for Page admins. This is available from the &#8220;manage&#8221; button on the Page. It also launched full support for the Creator Studio mobile app.</p>
<p>Moderation is also being improved, Facebook says, as it&#8217;s updated its ability to detect and filter &#8220;hate speech comments, violent, sexual, spammy content, impersonator accounts, and phishing.&#8221; Other improvements in this area are still in the works, Facebook notes, but declined to provide specifics when asked for details.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the test, Facebook heard from users they liked the new, more simplified user interface, as well as the ease of switching between their public and private profiles and Pages, as well as the better ways to engage fans.</p>
<p>Facebook says the updated Pages will roll out in the &#8220;coming months.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spending on cosmetics has usually weathered economic crises, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/18/how-covid-19-upended-the-lipstick-index-pandemic-cosmetic-sales-makeup-skincare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that changed during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, with stay-at-home orders and masks tempering people’s desire to wear makeup. This forced retailers to accelerate their online strategies, finding new ways to capture shoppers&#8217; attention without in-store samples. Virtual beauty try-on technology, like the ones developed by Perfect Corp., will play an important role in this shift to digital. The company announced today it has raised a Series C of $50 million led by Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Based in New Taipei City, Taiwan and led by chief executive officer Alice Chang, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/perfect-corp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="perfect-corp">Perfect Corp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. is probably best known to consumers for its beauty app, YouCam Makeup, which lets users &#8220;try on&#8221; virtual samples from over 300 global brands, including ones owned by beauty conglomerates Estée Lauder and L’Oreal Paris. Launched in 2014, YouCam Makeup now counts about 40 million to 50 million monthly active users and has expanded from augmented selfies to include live-streams and tutorials from beauty influencers, social features and a &#8220;Skin Score&#8221; feature.</p>
<p>Perfect Corp.&#8217;s technology is also used for in-store retail, e-commerce and social media tools. For example, its tech helped create a new augmented reality-powered try-on tool for Google Search that launched last month (its was previously used for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/youtubes-new-ar-feature-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-while-watching-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube’s makeup try-on features</a>, too). It also <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201210005585/en/Perfect-Corp.-and-Snap-Inc.-Partner-to-Support-Interactive-AR-Try-On-Experiences-for-Beauty-Brands" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">worked with Snap </a>to integrate beauty try-on features into Snapchat.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google now lets you virtually try on makeup using AR, shop from influencer videos&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/google-now-lets-you-virtually-try-on-makeup-using-ar-shop-from-influencer-videos/embed/#?secret=r5eLp1WDiT" data-secret="r5eLp1WDiT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new funding brings Perfect Corp.’s total raised so far to about $130 million. Its last funding announcement <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171018005623/en/Beauty-App-Developer-Perfect-Corp.-Closes-25-Million-Series-A-Funding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was a $25 million Series A in October 2017</a>. The Series C will be used to further develop Perfect Corp.’s technology for multichannel retail and open more international offices (it currently has operations in 11 cities).</p>
<p>In a press statement, Xinyi Feng, a managing director in the Merchant Banking Division of Goldman Sachs, said, &#8220;The integration of technology through artificial intelligence, machine learning and augmented reality into the beauty industry will unlock significant advantages, including amplification of digital sales channels, increased personalization and deeper consumer engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perfect Corp. will also be part of the investment firm’s <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/investing-and-lending/launch-with-gs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Launch with GS</a>, a $500 million investment initiative to support a diverse, international cohort of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The company uses facial landmark tracking technology, which creates a &#8220;3D mesh&#8221; around users’ faces so beauty try-ons look more realistic. In terms of privacy, chief strategy officer Louis Chen told TechCrunch that no user data, including photos or biometrics, is saved, and all computing is done within the user’s phone.</p>
<p>The vast majority, or about 90%, of Perfect Corp’s clients are cosmetic or skincare brands, while the rest sell haircare, hair coloring or accessories. Chen said the goal of Perfect Corp’s technology is to replicate the experience of trying on makeup in a store as closely as possible. When a user virtually applies lipstick, for example, they don’t just see the color on their lips, but also the texture, like matte, glossy, shimmer or metallic (the company currently offers seven lipstick textures, which Chen said is the most in the industry).</p>
<p>While sales of makeup have dropped during the pandemic, interest in skincare has grown. A <a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2020/more-u-s--women-are-using-facial-skincare-products-today--reports-the-npd-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 2020 report from the NPD Group</a> found that American women are buying more types of products than they were last year, and using them more frequently. To help brands capitalize on that, Perfect Corp. recently launched a tool <a href="https://www.perfectcorp.com/consumer/news/detail?id=1457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called AI Skin Diagnostic solution</a>, which it says verified by dermatologists and grades facial skin on eight metrics, including moisture, wrinkles and dark circles. The tool can be used on skincare brand websites to recommend products to shoppers.</p>
<p>Before COVID-19, YouCam Makeup and the company’s augmented reality try-on tools appealed to Gen Z shoppers who are comfortable with selfies and filters. But the pandemic is forcing makeup and skincare brands to speed up their adaption of technology for all shoppers. As a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Consumer%20Packaged%20Goods/Our%20Insights/How%20COVID%2019%20is%20changing%20the%20world%20of%20beauty/How-COVID-19-is-changing-the-world-of-beauty-vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McKinsey report about the impact of COVID-19 on the beauty industry </a>put it, &#8220;the use of artificial intelligence for testing, discovery and customization will need to accelerate as concerns about safety and hygiene fundamentally disrupt product testing and in-person consultations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Depending on the geography of the brand, in the past probably only 10%, no more than 20%, of their business was direct to consumer, while 80% was going through retail distribution and distribution partnerships, the network they already built over the year,&#8221; said Chen. But beauty companies are investing more heavily in e-commerce now, and Perfect Corp. capitalizes on that by offering its technology as a SaaS.</p>
<p>Another way Perfect Corp. has adapted its offerings during the pandemic is offering remote consultation tools, which means beauty and skincare consultants who usually work in salons or a store like Ulta can demonstrate makeup looks on clients through video calls instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every single thing we are building now is not a siloed technology,&#8221; said Chang. &#8220;It’s now always combined with video-streaming.&#8221; In addition to one-on-one chats, this also means live-cast shopping, which is extremely popular in China and gradually taking off in other countries, and the kind of AR technology that was integrated into YouTube and Snapchat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eating less meat is the easiest way for anyone to lower their carbon footprint and the prepared food delivery startup, <a href="https://www.thistle.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thistle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has just raised $10.3 million to make that choice even easier for consumers. </span></p>
<p>The company delivers plant-based full menus (with meat options available for customers that want them) for its customers along with a range of juices and sides.</p>
<p>That pitch of making tweaks to customer behavior for more conscious consumerism and healthy eating was enough to attract Series B funding from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/powerplant-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="powerplant-ventures">PowerPlant Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Siddhi Capital, Alumni Ventures Group, and the venture arm of Rich Products Corp.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said it would use the financing to expand geographically &#8212; setting up a production facility on the East Coast to bring its healthy prepared meals to potential customers along the Eastern seaboard.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With this funding, we’ll be able to support even more people through scientific, evidence-based principles of nutrition that lead to optimal wellness, enjoyable eating, and a healthier planet,&#8221; said Ashwin Cheryian, Co-Founder and CEO of Thistle in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch seven years ago, Thistle has served over 5 million meals and is intent to not just launch in new geographies, but provide more robust services for its customers. Those services will include virtual consultations with an in-house registered Thistle dietitian who can give customers guidance on the best diet for their needs, the company said.   </span></p>
<p>The new offering was born from customer feedback, according to chief operating officer and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/thistle" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="thistle">Thistle <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder Shiri Avnery.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We tested the program last fall, and the responses were overwhelmingly positive. We’re excited to be able to officially roll out the program to our customers this month, with the primary goal to further support our customers along each stage of their wellness journey,&#8221; Avnery said. </span></p>
<p>The husband and wife duo offer menu plans starting at $42 a week or $11.50 per meal, according to the company&#8217;s website and all meals are gluten and dairy free (with vegan options available).</p>
<p>The financing for Thistle comes during a plant-based food boom that&#8217;s been sweeping the nation &#8212; and the nation&#8217;s investors.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eating a plant-forward diet is the single most impactful way to reduce your overall environmental footprint, reducing climate change, pollution, resource consumption, and species extinction,” said Dan Gluck, Managing Partner of PowerPlant Ventures, in a statement. “Consumer demand for plant-based foods is outperforming total food growth today, and this trend is expected to increase over the next decade as more people realize that eating more plants is a critical component to the long-term health of both the planet and our population.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sports have been among some of the most popular and lucrative media plays in the world, luring broadcasters, advertisers and consumers to fork out huge sums to secure the chance to watch (and sponsor) their favorite teams and athletes.</p>
<p>That content, unsurprisingly, also typically costs a ton of money to produce, narrowing the production and distribution funnel even more. But today, a startup that&#8217;s cracked open that model with an autonomous, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ai">AI <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-based camera that lets any team record, edit and distribute their games, is announcing a round of funding to build out its business targeting the long tail of sporting teams and fixtures.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/veo-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="veo-2">Veo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Technologies, a Copenhagen startup that has designed a video camera and cloud-based subscription service to record and then automatically pick out highlights of games, which it then hosts on a platform for its customers to access and share that video content, has picked up €20 million (around $24.5 million) in a Series B round of funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being led by Danish investor Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, with participation from US-based Courtside VC, France&#8217;s Ventech and Denmark&#8217;s SEED Capital. Veo&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Henrik Teisbæk said in an interview that the startup is not disclosing its valuation, but a source close to funding tells me that it&#8217;s well over $100 million.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Teisbæk said that the plan will be to use to the funds to continue expanding the company&#8217;s business on two levels. First, Veo will be digging into expanding its US operations, with an office in Miami. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Second, it plans to continue enhancing the scope of its technology: </span>The company started out optimising its computer vision software to record and track the matches for the most popular team sport in the world, football (soccer to US readers), with customers buying the cameras &#8212; which retail for $800 &#8212; and the corresponding (mandatory) subscriptions &#8212; $1,200 annually &#8212; both to record games for spectators, as well as to use the footage for all kinds of practical purposes like training and recruitment videos. The key is that the cameras can be set up and left to run on their own. Once they are in place, they can record using wide-angles the majority of a soccer field (or whatever playing space is being used) and then zoom and edit down based on that.</p>

<p>Now, Veo is building the computer vision algorithms to expand that proposition into a plethora of other team-based sports including rugby, basketball and hockey, and it is ramping up the kinds of analytics that it can provide around the clips that it generates as well as the wider match itself.</p>
<p>Even with the slowdown in a lot of sporting activity this year due to COVID &#8212; in the U.K. for example, we&#8217;re in a lockdown again where team sports below professional leagues, excepting teams for disabled people, have been prohibited &#8212; Veo has seen a lot of growth.</p>
<p>The startup currently works with some 5,000 clubs globally ranging from professional sports teams through to amateur clubs for children, and it has recorded and tracked 200,000 games since opening for business in 2018, with a large proportion of that volume in the last year and in the US.</p>
<p>For a point of reference, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/veo-raises-6m-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2019</a>, when we covered a $6 million round for Veo, the startup had racked up 1,000 clubs and 25,000 games, pointing to customer growth of 400% in that period.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has indeed altered the playing field &#8212; literally and figuratively &#8212; for sports in the past year. Spectators, athletes, and supporting staff need to be just as mindful as anyone else when it comes to spreading the coronavirus.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not just led to a change in how many games are being played, but also for attendance: witness the huge lengths that the NBA went to last year to create an extensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_Bubble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">isolation bubble in Orlando, Florida</a>, to play out the season, with no actual fans in physical seats watching games, but all games and fans virtually streamed into the events as they happened.</p>
<p>That NBA effort, needless to say, came at a huge financial cost, one that any lesser league would never be able to carry, and so that predicament has led to an interesting use case for Veo.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, the Danish startup was quietly building its business around catering to the long tail of sporting organizations who &#8212; even in the best of times &#8212; would be hard pressed to find the funds to buy cameras and/or hire videographers to record games, not just an essential part of how people can enjoy a sporting event, but useful for helping with team development.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a perception that football is already being recorded and broadcast, but in the UK (for example) it&#8217;s only the Premier League,&#8221; Teisbæk said. &#8220;If you go down o<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ne or two steps from that, nothing is being recorded.&#8221; Before Veo, to record a football game, he added, &#8220;you need a guy sitting on a scaffold, and time and money to then cut that down to highlights. It’s just too cumbersome. But v</span>ideo is the best tool there is to develop talent. Kids are visual learners. And it&#8217;s a great way to get recruited sending videos to colleges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those use cases then expanded with the pandemic, he said. &#8220;Under coronavirus rules, parents cannot go out and watch their kids, and so video becomes a tool to follow those matches.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8216;We&#8217;re a Shopify, not an Amazon&#8217;</h2>
<p>The business model for Veo up to now has largely been around what Teisbæk described as &#8220;the long tail theory&#8221;, which in the case of sports works out, he said, as &#8220;There won’t be many viewers for each match, but there are millions of matches out there.&#8221; But if you consider how a lot of high school sports will attract locals beyond those currently attached to a school &#8212; you have alumni supporters and fans, as well as local businesses and neighborhoods &#8212; even that long tail audience might be bigger than one might imagine.</p>
<p>Veo&#8217;s long-tail focus has inevitably meant that its target users are in the wide array of amateur or semi-pro clubs and the people associated with them, but interestingly it has also spilled into big names, too.</p>
<p>Veo&#8217;s cameras are being used by professional soccer clubs in the Premier League, Spain&#8217;s La Liga, Italy&#8217;s Serie A and France&#8217;s Ligue 1, as well as several clubs in the MLS such as Inter Miami, Austin FC, Atlanta United and FC Cincinnati. Teisbæk noted that while this might never be for primary coverage, it&#8217;s there to supplement for training and also be used in the academies attached to those organizations.</p>
<p>The plan longer term, he said, is not to build its own media empire with trove of content that it has amassed, but to be an enabler for creating that content for its customers, who can in turn use it as they wish. It&#8217;s a &#8220;Shopify, not an Amazon,&#8221; said Teisbæk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not building the next ESPN, but we are helping the clubs unlock these connections that are already in place by way of our technology,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to help help them capture and stream their matches and their play for the audience that is there today.&#8221;</p>
<p>That may be how he views the opportunity, but some investors are already eyeing up the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Vasu Kulkarni, a partner at Courtside VC &#8212; a firm that has focused (as its name might imply) on backing a lot of different sports-related businesses, with The Athletic, Beam (acquired by Microsoft), and <a href="http://courtsidevc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many others</a> in its portfolio &#8212; said that he&#8217;d been looking to back a company like Veo, building a smart, tech-enabled way to record and parse sports in a more cost-effective way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent close to four years trying to find a company trying to do that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been a believer in sports content captured at the long tail,&#8221; he said. Coincidentally, he himself started a company called Krossover in his dorm room to help somewhat with tracking and recording sports training. <a href="https://www.hudl.com/blog/krossover-joins-hudl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Krossover eventually was acquired by Hudl</a>, a competitor to Veo.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never have the NBA finals recorded on Veo, there is just too much at stake, but when you start to look at all the areas where there isn&#8217;t enough mass media value to hire people, to produce and livestream, you get to the point where computer vision and AI are going to be doing the filming to get rid of the cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that the economics are important here: the camera needs to be less than $1,000 (which it is) and produce something demonstrably better than &#8220;a parent with a Best Buy camcorder that was picked up for $100.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kulkarni thinks that longer term there could definitely be an opportunity to consider how to help clubs bring that content to a wider audience, especially using highlights and focusing on the best of the best in amateur games &#8212; which of course are the precursors to some of those players one day being world-famous elite athletes. (Think of how exciting it is to see the footage of Michael Jordan playing as a young student for some context here.) &#8220;AI will be able to pull out the best 10-15 plays and stitch them together for highlight reels,&#8221; he said, something that could feasibly find a market with sports fans wider than just the parents of the actual players.</p>
<p>All of that then feeds a bigger market for what has started to feel like an insatiable appetite for sports, one that, if anything, has found even more audience at a time when many are spending more time at home and watching video overall. &#8220;The more video you get from the sport, the better the sport gets, for players and fans,&#8221; Teisbæk said.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The decision to suspend the account of a high-profile national broadcaster appears to have been related to its policies on COVID-19 misinformation. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-talkradio-youtube/uk-broadcaster-talkradio-reinstated-on-youtube-idUSKBN29A1MO">Reuters</a> reports that some of its presenters have been critical of government measures to slow the spread of coronavirus as excessive or ill-targeted.</p>
<p>However, the tech giant&#8217;s decision to ban a national broadcaster was quickly criticized by cabinet minister Michael Gove, who went on TalkRadio yesterday to defend its right to ask questions about government policy vis-à-vis the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The ban also triggered an intervention from News Corp.&#8217;s executive chairman Rupert Murdoch, according to the <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/media/youtube-talkradio-ban-rupert-murdoch-google-coronavirus-817954">i newspaper</a>, which reports that Murdoch accused the Google-owned service of setting a &#8220;dangerous precedent&#8221; and &#8220;censorship of free speech and legitimate national debate&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a statement today confirming it has reinstated TalkRadio&#8217;s account, a YouTube spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>TalkRadio’s YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated. We quickly remove flagged content that violate our <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.youtube.com_about_policies_-23community-2Dguidelines&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=tq9bLrSQ8zIr87VusnUS9yAL0Jw_xnDiPuZjNR4EDIQ&amp;r=QG4rkcc0D0I4SyAPUH8dxPk-FdbvhI19Et6JtUy6WK8&amp;m=m2TQMTm-yb1Th9dgpnh3GDMcQQVYvYeEhUa4OlY7EXk&amp;s=AaLzoOqFX4Oia0zXLRymTgf3BAYyvc5GYhXRUtmv3qM&amp;e=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u%3Dhttps-3A__www.youtube.com_about_policies_-23community-2Dguidelines%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3Dtq9bLrSQ8zIr87VusnUS9yAL0Jw_xnDiPuZjNR4EDIQ%26r%3DQG4rkcc0D0I4SyAPUH8dxPk-FdbvhI19Et6JtUy6WK8%26m%3Dm2TQMTm-yb1Th9dgpnh3GDMcQQVYvYeEhUa4OlY7EXk%26s%3DAaLzoOqFX4Oia0zXLRymTgf3BAYyvc5GYhXRUtmv3qM%26e%3D&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1610014445764000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqqWPC6f8o5SqlZwR_96kfeo356A">Community Guidelines</a>, including COVID-19 content that explicitly contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization. We make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear which type of exception YouTube is applying in TalkRadio&#8217;s case to justify reinstating the station &#8212; given opinionated radio could span all categories, depending on the specific content.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/media/youtube-talkradio-ban-rupert-murdoch-google-coronavirus-817954">i</a>, TalkRadio had received earlier strikes in October and December for YouTube policy breaches. The third strike that led to its (brief) suspension is thought to relate to an interview between one of its hosts, Julia Hartley-Brewer, and former National Education Union president Amanda Martin about whether teachers should be given the highest priority for COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The TalkRadio ban-reversal is just the latest in a long-running saga of tech giant moderation decisions colliding with concerns for freedom of expression &#8212; even as the stuff that platforms choose to leave up can often be no less controversial. (Although concern about risks to public health from coronavirus misinformation spreading and being amplified online have undoubtedly added extra pitfalls to platform moderation business as usual.)</p>
<p>The common thread of concern is powerful, private entities &#8212; which are not regulated in the same way (U.K.) broadcasters are &#8212; continue to have their hands on the &#8220;acceptable speech&#8221; lever.</p>
<p>Change is coming in the U.K., though: The government is working on a legislative proposal that will bring big tech under <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ofcom" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ofcom">Ofcom&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> regulatory umbrella. (And as TalkRadio points out in its earlier statement, its output is already regulated by Ofcom.)</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Under the plan Ofcom will oversee platforms&#8217; compliance and get the power to block non-compliant digital services from being accessed, as well as the ability to levy huge fines for breaches.   </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sentibio.com/">Senti Biosciences</a>, a company developing cancer therapies using a new programmable biology platform, said it has raised $105 million in a new round of financing led by the venture arm of life sciences giant Bayer.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology uses new computational biological techniques to manufacture cell and gene therapies that can more precisely target specific cells in the body.</p>
<p>Senti Bio&#8217;s chief executive, Tim Lu, compares his company&#8217;s new tech to the difference between basic programming and object-oriented programming. &#8220;Instead of creating a program that just says &#8216;Hello world&#8217;, you can introduce &#8216;if&#8217; statements and object-oriented programming,&#8221; said Lu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By building genetic material that can target multiple receptors, Senti Bio&#8217;s therapies can be more precise in the way they identify genetic material in the body and deliver the kinds of therapies directly to the pathogens. &#8220;Instead of the cell expressing a single receptor&#8230; now we have two receptors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is initially applying its gene circuit technology platform to develop therapies that use what are called chimeric antigen receptor natural killer (CAR-NK) cells that can target cancer cells in the body and eliminate them. Many existing cell and gene therapies use chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, which are white blood cells in the body that are critical to immune response and destroy cellular pathogens in the body.</p>
<p>However, T-cell-based therapies can be toxic to patients, stimulating immune responses that can be almost as dangerous as the pathogens themselves. Using CAR-NK cells produces similar results with fewer side effects.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s independent of the gene circuit, said Lu. &#8220;The gene circuit gets you specificity&#8230; Right now when you use a CAR-T cell or a CAR-NK cell&#8230; you find a target and hope that it doesn&#8217;t affect normal cells. We can build logic in our gene circuits in the cell that means a CAR-NK cell can identify two targets rather than one.&#8221;</p>
<p>That increased targeting means lower risks of healthy cells being destroyed alongside mutations or pathogens that are in the body.</p>
<p>For Lu and his co-founders &#8212; fellow MIT professor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jim-collins-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jim-collins-3">Jim Collins, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boston-university" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boston-university">Boston University <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> professor Wilson Wong and longtime synthetic biology operator Phillip Lee &#8212; Senti Bio is the culmination of decades of work in the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;I compare it to the early days of semiconductor work,&#8221; Lu said of the journey to develop this gene circuit technology. &#8220;There were bits and pieces of technology being developed in research labs, but to realize the scale at which you need, this has to be done at the industrial level.&#8221;</p>
<p>So licensing work from MIT, Boston University and Stanford, Lu and his co-founders set out to take this work out of the labs to start a company.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company was started it was a bag of tools and the know-how on how to use them,&#8221; Lu said. But it wasn&#8217;t a fully developed platform. </span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the company now has and with the new capital from Leaps by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bayer-ag-germany" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bayer-ag-germany">Bayer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and its other investors, Senti is ready to start commercializing.</p>
<p>The first products will be therapies for acute myeloid leukemia, hepatocellular carcinoma and other, undisclosed, solid tumor targets, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Leaps by Bayer’s mission is to invest in breakthrough technologies that may transform the lives of millions of patients for the better,” said Juergen Eckhardt, MD, head of Leaps by Bayer. “We believe that synthetic biology will become an important pillar in next-generation cell and gene therapy, and that Senti Bio’s leadership in designing and optimizing biological circuits fits precisely with our ambition to prevent and cure cancer and to regenerate lost tissue function.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lu and his co-founders also see their work as a platform for developing other cell therapies for other diseases and applications &#8212; and intend to partner with other pharmaceutical companies to bring those products to market.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Over the past two years, our team has designed, built and tested thousands of sophisticated gene circuits to drive a robust product pipeline, focused initially on allogeneic CAR-NK cell therapies for difficult-to-treat liquid and solid tumor indications,&#8221; Lu said in a statement. &#8220;I look forward to continued platform and pipeline advancements, including starting IND-enabling studies in 2021.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new financing round brings Senti&#8217;s total capital raised to just under $160 million and Lu said the new money will be used to ramp up manufacturing and accelerate its work partnering with other pharmaceutical companies. </span></p>
<p>The current time frame is to get its investigational new drug permits filed by late 2022 and early 2023 and have initial clinical trials begun in 2023.</p>
<p>Developing gene circuits is a new and expanding field with a number of players, including Cell Design Labs, which was acquired by Gilead in 2017 for up to $567 million. Other companies working on similar therapies include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crispr-therapeutics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crispr-therapeutics">CRISPR Therapeutics, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Intellius and Editas, Lu said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic and specifically need for social distancing to slow the spread of the virus have continued to keep many of us away from the office. Now, increasingly, many organizations and people believe that it could usher in a more permanent shift to remote, distributed and virtual work. Today, a startup that has built a set of tools specifically to help salespeople with that change &#8212; by way of digital sales &#8212; has raised a substantial growth round to meet that demand.</p>
<p><a href="http://salesloft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SalesLoft</a>, a sales platform based out of Atlanta, Georgia that provides AI-based tools to help salespeople run their sales process virtually &#8212; from finding and following up on leads, through to helping them sell with virtual coaching tools, and then assisting in the post-sales process &#8212; has closed $100 million in funding.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Kyle Porter confirmed to TechCrunch that the company is now valued at $1.1 billion post-money, a substantial hike on its previous valuation. In April 2019, well before any global health pandemics, the company had raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/25/salesloft-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Series D of $70 million at around a $600 million valuation</a> (a figure we confirmed at the time with sources close to the company).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest round is being led by Owl Rock Capital, with previous investors Insight Partners, HarbourVest, and Emergence Capital &#8212; a VC focused specifically on enterprise startups, which notably was an early backer of Zoom and many others &#8212; also participating.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesloft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesloft">SalesLoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has now raised some $245 million, an impressive sum for any startup, but also worth pointing out for the fact that it&#8217;s not based out of the Valley but Atlanta, Georgia (a state in the news for other reasons at the moment, as the focus of a hotly contested U.S. Senate runoff election).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Emergence&#8217;s Jason Green thinks some of the tech backlash is justified, but the B2B opportunities still outweigh the challenges&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/emergences-jason-green-thinks-some-of-the-tech-backlash-is-justified-but-the-b2b-opportunities-still-outweigh-the-challenges/embed/#?secret=Ip0L2yakyj" data-secret="Ip0L2yakyj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company has been on a growth tear for several years now, as one of the big players in the area of so-called sales engagement: tools to help salespeople sell better to clients (or would-be clients), which can include real-time monitoring of interactions to provide coaching to improve the process, suggestions for supplementary content to enhance the pitch and more basic software simply to manage records and communications.</p>
<p>Even before the pandemic hit, this was a key growth area in enterprise software, with both in-person and online/digital salespeople relying on these kinds of products to help them get more of an edge with their work, but a lot of the focus had really been on inside sales (B2B sales focusing on bigger purchases). Porter described the effect of COVID-19 as a &#8220;tailwind&#8221; propelling that already strong trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;The effects of COVID have been a tailwind due to the effects of digital selling,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All sellers immediately became remote. But now the genie is out of the bottle and not going back in. It&#8217;s meant that inside sales are now all sales. Whether the opportunities are mid-funnel or upgrades or renewals, we are establishing ourselves as the engagement platform of record because it&#8217;s all becoming digital and all sellers are finding more success.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that SalesLoft&#8217;s own sales cycle has improved by 40% since the pandemic, a reflection, he said, of the &#8220;urgency and need&#8221; for tools like those that the startup develops.</p>
<p>Another shift has been in terms of the kinds of customers SalesLoft works with. The company originally was focused on the mid-market, but that has changed with more larger enterprises also coming on board. Google, LinkedIn (which backs SalesLoft and is in a strategic partnership with it), Cisco, Dell and IBM are all customers, and Porter said that more &#8220;mainstream&#8221; businesses like Cargil, 3M and Standard &amp; Poor are also increasingly becoming clients.</p>
<p>That is leading the startup to building out bigger solutions, beyond the basic pitch of &#8220;sales engagement&#8221; that has been SalesLoft&#8217;s mainstay up to now. The company competes against a plethora of others, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/06/clari-platform-aims-to-unify-go-to-market-data/">Clari</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/chorus-ai-rings-up-33m-for-its-platform-that-analyses-sales-calls-to-close-more-deals/">Chorus.ai</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/gong-an-ai-based-language-tool-to-help-sales-and-customer-service-reps-nabs-20m/">Gong</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/conversica-which-uses-ai-to-replicate-sales-agents-raises-31m-now-valued-around-300m/">Conversica</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/afiniti-crm-ai/">Afiniti</a> and <a href="https://www.outreach.io/">Outreach</a>, as well as biggies like Salesforce. Outreach, notably, had a big mid-COVID round of its own, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/outreach-nabs-50m-at-a-1-33b-valuation-for-its-sales-engagement-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raising at a $1.3 billion valuation in June last year</a>, a mark of that wider market demand. Porter notes that SalesLoft&#8217;s big selling point is that it offers an increasingly end-to-end sales solution to customers, meaning less shopping around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Business-to-business marketplace <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/udaan" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="udaan">Udaan <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has raised $280 million from new and existing investors as the Indian startup builds a war-chest to accelerate its growth and fend off rivals.</p>
<p>The new capital is not part of a new financing round but is an extension of its Series D. The Bangalore-based startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/udaan-series-d/">secured $585 million prior to the new capital</a> as part of its Series D round and has overall raised $1.15 billion to date, is now valued at more than $3.1 billion, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/octahedron-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="octahedron-capital">Octahedron Capital <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Moonstone Capital are financing the fresh capital, with participation from existing investors <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-financial" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lightspeed-financial">Lightspeed <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Venture Partners, partners of DST Global, GGV Capital, Altimeter Capital and Tencent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Much of the business-to-business market in India remains unorganized. This means that merchants in the nation today have to travel to other cities &#8212; where all the major dealers operate &#8212; to stock up their inventory. But these merchants don’t have much leverage to negotiate, so they struggle to find best-value for money and access to a wider selection of catalog.</p>
<p><a href="https://udaan.com/">Udaan</a>, co-founded by three former Flipkart executives, is solving this problem by connecting small retailers with wholesalers and traders. The startup today serves more than 3 million retailers and small and medium-sized businesses and it has signed up thousands of brands, including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/indian-electronics-and-lifestyle-brand-boat-raises-100-million-from-warburg-pincus/">Boat Lifestyle</a>, Micromax, HP, LG, ITC, HUL and P&amp;G.</p>
<p>Amod Malviya, co-founder of Udaan, said in a statement that the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to order a nationwide lockdown and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/amazon-prioritizes-essential-products-in-india-temporarily-discontinues-lower-priority-items/">put restrictions on e-commerce firms</a>, underscored the significance of small businesses and mom-and-pop shops (popularly known as kiranas) in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Udaan is at the forefront of this uniquely Indian e-commerce opportunity, emerging in the last four years as one of the largest e-commerce platforms in India, while taking an India-first mobile-first approach to e-commerce. This financing enables us to further our journey of taking e-commerce to the depth and breadth of the country, with Udaan’s unique low-cost model for core middle India,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Other than the inventory problem, Udaan also helps merchants secure working capital. Small businesses, especially mom-and-pop shops, rely on money they secure from selling their existing inventory for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/drip-capital-seriesb/">buying their next batch</a>. Because Udaan is able to see the engagement of different merchants on the platform, it is able to determine to whom it could safely grant working capital.</p>
<p>These decades-old challenges also present a massive potential reward to firms. &#8220;The unaddressed SME credit demand in India is ~US$300-$350 billion, with more than 90% of current demand being met by banks. A typical digital SME lender focusses on Rs1-5 million ($13,575 to $67,875) ticket size with no collateral, average tenure ~12-18 months, and with some ecosystem anchor,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a recent equity research report, obtained by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;While growth potential in theory is high, despite much higher yields, we don’t find their economics to be much superior to banks even in a steady state. Overall, steady state ROE (return on equity) for an average digital SME lender is unlikely to be much more than 18% levels — not meaningfully higher than a big private bank,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>Udaan said it will deploy the fresh capital in further creation of the market, and expanding the selection of products and categories it offers. Additionally, the four-year-old startup said it will expand its financing capabilities for small businesses and extend its supply chain network.</p>
<p>The fresh fundraise &#8220;reflects the long-term truly transformative and fundamental value creation potential that Udaan platform offers for the lives and businesses of Indian MSMEs, who are major job creators and form the backbone of our economy and the society,&#8221; said Malviya. “Participation of existing and new investors in this financing highlights the increasing recognition of capital markets of this unique nature of the Indian market, and the opportunity it offers.</p>
<p>In the past two years, scores of startups and giants such as Reliance and Amazon have started to explore the business-to-business market in India, which is currently dominated by Udaan.</p>
<p>For instance, India&#8217;s largest retail chain Reliance Retail, which serves more than 3.5 million customers each week through its nearly 10,000 physical stores in more than 6,500 cities and towns in the country, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/30/reliance-retail-jiomart-launch/">entered the e-commerce space with JioMart</a> in late 2019 through a joint venture with sister subsidiary telecom giant Jio Platforms. By mid last year, JioMart had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities/">established presence in over 200 Indian cities and towns</a> &#8212; though currently its reach within those cities and customer service leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Reliance Retail also maintains a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/26/reliance-and-facebook-pilot-jiomart-orders-on-whatsapp/">partnership with Facebook for WhatsApp integration</a>. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, </a>which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms earlier this year</a>, has said that it will explore various ways to work with Reliance to digitize the nation’s mom and pop stores, as well as other small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>For JioMart, Reliance Retail is working with retail shops, giving them a digital point-of-sale machine to make it easier for them to accept money electronically. It is also allowing these shops to buy their inventory from Reliance Retail, and then use their physical presence as delivery points. The platform is currently largely focused on grocery delivery, however. In a recent report to clients, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated that Reliance could become the largest player in online grocery within three years.</p>

As an example of market potential, the company cites data from the Indonesian Stock Exchange and Indonesia Central Securities Depository that showed the number of retail investors in the country grew 56% year-over-year in 2020, with about 92% of new investors aged between 21 to 40. But only about 2% of Indonesians have participated in the stock market.</p>
<p>Kouwagam said most Indonesians invest their money in term deposit bank accounts or leave it in low-yield checking accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, they also invest in real estate or physical gold bars,&#8221; he added, but millennial and Gen Z investors are shifting toward &#8220;higher-yielding liquid investments that are also convenient to manage and can be started with a lower ticket size.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pandemic has also prompted more users tp build an emergency fund, with more Indonesians looking at the capital market for higher-yielding assets as an alternative to low-interest bank accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the world continues to await the arrival of safe, reliable and cost-effective self-driving cars, one of the pioneers in the world of autonomous vehicle software has raised some substantial funding to double down on what it sees as a more immediate opportunity: providing technology to industrial companies to build off-road applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://oxbotica.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxbotica</a>, the Oxford, England startup that builds what it calls &#8220;universal autonomy&#8221; &#8212; flexible technology that it says can power the navigation, perception, user interfaces, fleet management and other features needed to run self-driving vehicles in multiple environments, regardless of the hardware being used &#8212; has picked up $47 million in a Series B round of funding from an interesting mix of strategic and financial investors.</p>
<p>Led by bp ventures, the investing arm of oil and gas giant <a href="http://bp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bp</a>, the round also includes BGF, safety equipment maker Halma, pension fund HostPlus, IP Group, Tencent, Venture Science and funds advised by Doxa Partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oxbotica-ltd" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oxbotica-ltd">Oxbotica <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said it plans to use the capital to fuel a raft of upcoming deployments &#8212; several that will be coming online this year, according to its CEO &#8212; for clients in areas like mining, port logistics and more, with its lead investor bp an indication of the size of its customers and the kinds of projects that are in its sights.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The question, CEO Ozgur Tohumcu said in an interview, is &#8220;Where is the autonomy needed today? If you go to mines or ports, you can see vehicles in use already,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We see a huge transformation happening in the industrial domain.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The funding and focus on industry are interesting turns for Oxbotica. The startup has been around since about 2014, originally as a spinout from Oxford University co-founded by academics Paul Newman and Ingmar Posner &#8212; Newman remains at the startup as its CTO, while Posner remains an AI professor at Oxford.</p>
<p>Oxbotica has been associated with a number of high-profile projects &#8212; early on, it <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a52821f6-d368-11e6-b06b-680c49b4b4c0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">provided sensor technology</a> for Nasa&#8217;s Mars Rover, for example.</p>
<p>Over time, it has streamlined what it does to two main platforms that it calls Selenium and Caesium, covering respectively navigation, mapping, perception, machine learning, data export and related technology; and fleet management.</p>
<p>Newman says that what makes Oxbotica stand out from other autonomous software providers is that its systems are lighter and easier to use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where we are good is in edge compute,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our radar-based maps are 10 megabytes to cover a kilometer rather than hundreds of megabytes&#8230; Our business plan is to build a horizontal software platform like Microsoft&#8217;s.&#8221; That may underplay the efficiency of what it&#8217;s building, however: Oxbotica also has worked out how to efficiently transfer the enormous data loads associated with autonomous systems, and is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oxbotica-and-cisco-to-solve-autonomous-vehicle-data-challenge-with-pioneering-openroaming-platform-301012266.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working with companies like Cisco</a> to bring these online.</p>
<p>In recent years Oxbotica has been synonymous with some of the more notable on-road self-driving schemes in the U.K. But, as you would expect with autonomous car projects, not everything has panned out as expected.</p>
<p>A self-driving pilot <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/21/addison-lee-and-oxbotica-ink-self-driving-deal-will-offer-autonomous-car-services-in-london-by-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxbotica kicked off with London-based car service Addison Lee in 2018 projected that it would have its first cars on the road by 2021</a>. That project was quietly shut down, however, when <a href="https://www.addisonlee.com/addlib/a-new-chapter-for-alg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addison Lee was sold on by Carlyle last year</a> and the company abandoned costly moonshots. Another effort, the publicly backed <a href="https://www.projectendeavour.uk/partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Endeavour</a> to build autonomous car systems across towns in England, appears to still be in progress.</p>

<p>The turn to industrial customers, Newman said, is coming alongside those more ambitious, larger-scale applications. &#8220;Industrial autonomy for off-road refineries, ports and airports happens on the way to on-road autonomy,&#8221; he said, with the focus firmly remaining on providing software that can be used with different hardware. &#8220;We’ve always had this vision of &#8216;no atoms, just software,&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;There is nothing special about the road. Our point is to be agnostic, to make sure it works on any hardware platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may claim to have always been interested in hardware- and application-agnostic autonomy, but these days it&#8217;s being joined by others that have tried the other route and have decided to follow the Oxbotica strategy instead. They include FiveAI, another hyped autonomous startup out of the U.K. that originally wanted to build its own fleet of self-driving vehicles but instead last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/five-the-self-driving-startup-raises-41m-and-pivots-into-b2b-away-from-building-its-own-fleet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pivoted</a> to providing its software technology on a B2B basis for other hardware makers.</p>
<p>Oxbotica has now raised about $80 million to date, and it&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation but is optimistic that the coming year &#8212; with deployments and other new partnerships &#8212; will bear out that it&#8217;s doing just fine in the current market.</p>
<p>“bp ventures are delighted to invest in Oxbotica &#8211; we believe its software could accelerate the market for autonomous vehicles,&#8221; said Erin Hallock, bp ventures managing partner, in a statement. &#8220;Helping to accelerate the global revolution in mobility is at the heart of bp’s strategy to become an integrated energy company focused on delivering solutions for customers.&#8221;</p>
