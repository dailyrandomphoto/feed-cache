<h2>The next chapter of the new space economy: Destinations</h2>
<p>I spoke with Voyager Space Holdings CEO Dylan Taylor, Nanoracks CEO Jeffrey Manber and Lisa Callahan, Lockheed Martin’s VP of commercial civil space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">to discuss the companies&#8217; plans to launch a commercial space station in 2027.</a></p>
<p>“NASA as a customer has unleashed this extraordinary revolution in space transportation,” Manber said. “Building on the success that NASA had with cargo, building on the success of commercial crew, one can anticipate that with the markets interested in space, we&#8217;re going to see the same thing with smaller private space stations.”</p>

<h2>Starship fires up as SpaceX awaits regulatory approval</h2>
<p>For the first time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/elon-musk-says-starship-should-be-ready-for-first-orbital-launch-next-month-pending-regulatory-approval/">SpaceX completed two test firings</a> of its Raptor vacuum engines while they were attached to a Starship rocket. CEO Elon Musk later said the next-gen, heavy-lift rocket will be ready for its first orbital launch attempt next month, pending approval from regulators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">First firing of a Raptor vacuum engine integrated onto a Starship <a href="https://t.co/uCNAt8Kwzo">pic.twitter.com/uCNAt8Kwzo</a></p>
<p>— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1451350259729420288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>SpaceX still needs approval from the Federal Aviation Administration before it can attempt to send a fully stacked version of its Starship and Super Heavy booster to orbit. This past week, the regulator heard public comment in two separate sessions on its draft environmental assessment of the proposed launch site, a normal part of the licensing process. It&#8217;s unclear when the FAA is likely to release a final decision on the license. The public comment period on the draft EA is open until November 1.</p>
<h2>NASA and Boeing: Starliner grounded until first half of 2022</h2>
<p>The beleaguered Starliner spacecraft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/nasa-and-boeing-confirm-starliner-wont-fly-until-first-half-of-2022-as-valve-investigation-continues/">will not fly until sometime during the first half of next year at the earliest, NASA and Boeing executives confirmed</a>. While Boeing is still unable to identify the root cause of why 13 of the 24 valves in the propulsion system remained stuck in the closed position during routine pre-mission activities, the company is suspecting Florida humidity and corrosion as the main culprit.</p>
<p>Boeing emphasized during a media briefing that it had conducted multiple tests on these valves prior to Starliner making it to the launch pad, and yet it still didn&#8217;t catch the issue. Nevertheless, NASA&#8217;s manager of the Commercial Crew program Steve Stich said the agency maintains “every confidence that Boeing will be flying crew soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ll get this problem solved and then we’ll have two space transportation systems like we want, with Boeing and SpaceX both flying [ … ] I have no reason to believe Boeing won’t be successful.”</p>

<h2>Senate committee to NASA: Pick two developers for lunar lander program</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/senate-budget-committee-tells-nasa-to-select-two-developers-for-lunar-lander-program/">Senators have directed NASA to select two teams</a> to develop lunar landers under the Human Landing System program, according to a draft appropriations bill for the agency&#8217;s fiscal year 2022 budget. The catch? They&#8217;re only giving the agency an additional $100 million to do so.</p>
<p>NASA has maintained that it selected SpaceX &#8212; and only SpaceX &#8212; to develop a lander because it submitted the lowest-cost bid: only $2.9 billion, compared to the price tags of Blue Origin’s proposal ($5.9 billion) and Dynetics ($9 billion). Given the significant difference in cost between the three proposals, it’s unclear how the Senate’s increase to the HLS program &#8212; which is only $100 million &#8212; will enable NASA to select an additional team.</p>

<h2>News from around the web</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://spacenews.com/leolabs-western-australia-radar/">LeoLabs</a>, a startup developing a global tracking network for objects in orbit, has announced the sixth site for its next two ground phased-array radars: Western Australia. The site will help the company track launches from Asia, as well as orbital objects traveling over the southern hemisphere.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/spacex-to-become-more-valuable-than-tesla-morgan-stanley-survey.html">Morgan Stanley Research</a> released a survey showing that institutional investors and industry experts expect SpaceX to hit a higher valuation than Tesla.

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 25, 2021. What a <em>day</em>. We kicked off with news that a major, multibillion-dollar tech deal was kaput and closed out the trading day on news that another tech firm had reached the trillion-dollar market cap threshold. Facebook also reported earnings right after the bell, and TechCrunch dropped a host of hardware reviews. Tired yet? It’s <em>Monday</em>. – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<p><em>P.S. Our </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/announcing-the-final-agenda-for-techcrunch-sessions-saas-2021/"><em>SaaS event is in two days</em></a><em>; get hype.</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223756" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/equity-monday-paypal-punts-on-pinterest-as-facebooks-hell-month-continues/"><strong>PayPal calls off Pinterest deal:</strong></a> So much for the fintech-social media tie-up of the decade. U.S. fintech giant PayPal has killed off its potential buy of Pinterest. Shares of PayPal rose. Shares of Pinterest cratered. I suppose our general skepticism of the deal wasn’t <em>too </em>far off the market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/tesla-hertz-shares-rise-electric-vehicle-order/"><strong>Tesla reaches $1T market cap:</strong></a> You may have missed it, but Tesla is now worth more than Facebook these days, cresting the $1 billion market cap market today during regular trading, while the social network closed the day worth a few dozen billion less. What drove Tesla’s gains? Hertz, amazingly enough.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-reports-revenue-miss-plans-to-break-out-ar-vr-top-lines/"><strong>Facebook misses revenue expectations, promises reporting changes:</strong></a> After the bell today, Facebook reported its Q3 2021 earnings, including a revenue miss, a per-share profit beat, and news that it intends to break out its AR and VR revenues into a separate category from here on out. The latter is good news, though we’d appreciate more granular financial reporting from across the Empire of Zuck now that we know the company is capable of it. Shares of Facebook are up slightly, if still underwater from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">their Friday declines that came in the wake of Snap’s Q3 report</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get truly underway with all of our startup coverage, we have a new item from Unicorn Land: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/braze-set-to-put-points-on-the-board-for-new-yorks-startup-scene-in-impending-ipo/">New York tech company Braze is going public</a>. While it was not a unicorn when it last raised capital, the company will nearly certainly crash through the $1 billion valuation mark when it debuts on the public markets.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/blue-origin-boeing-and-others-join-sierra-space-to-build-commercial-space-station/"><strong>All hail our commercial space future:</strong></a> A consortium of firms are coming together to build a commercial space station. Given how rapidly the ISS is showing its age, this is a good thing. Sierra Space announced that “Blue Origin and Boeing would be joining the team to send the [private space station] to orbit in the second half of the decade.” We are closer and closer to our Bond-villain future that we’ve all long awaited.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/selfbook-raises-25m-at-a-125m-valuation2222709/">Selfbook raises capital, pivots to business focus:</a> </strong>The pandemic shook up quite a lot. Where we work. How we socialize. For hotel-booking company Selfbook, it shook up its business model. Now working for other companies, Selfbook “claims that its software gives hotels a way to accept ‘one-click’ payments directly on their websites while eliminating fraud and reducing chargebacks.” The startup is now worth $125 million.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/cameo-represent-acquisition/">Cameo books acquisition:</a> </strong>The celebrity-booking service Cameo has proven to have a popular model. You can pay a fee and have a celebrity or other notable figure record a message for you. I once got one from an Eagles player that a friend commissioned for me. Fun times. Anyhoo, the company has made its first acquisition, picking up Represent, which TechCrunch describes as “a marketing and merch company that helps celebrities and brands set up individualized online storefronts.” You can see the synergies, obviously.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/data-platform-y42-raises-31m/"><strong>Are all the startup names taken?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Here at TechCrunch, we joke that there are too many venture capital firms, so much so that they are starting to double-up on names. For Example, <a href="http://shinecap.com/index.html">Shine Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.shine.vc/">Shine Capital</a>. Regardless, a startup called Y42 has raised funds, showing the world how to avoid using someone else’s name. The Berlin-based startup has built a low-code data platform and just raised a $31 million Series A.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/"><strong>Even more money to roll-up e-commerce brands:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The race to buy e-commerce sellers continues this week with Boston-based Thrasio raising $1 billion more for its efforts. The company is now worth $10 billion. That’s a <em>lot</em> of money. Per TechCrunch, the company is buying more than a brand each week, and has 200 in its portfolio. Wild.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/routine-is-a-new-productivity-app-that-combines-task-management-and-notes/"><strong>New task app aims to tell you what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing right now:</strong></a> Meet <a href="https://www.routine.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Routine</a>, a new startup working on a productivity tool that should help you manage your work day more efficiently. It’s a brand new take on to-do lists as it combines both tasks, non-actionable notes and a daily planner.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fintech’s growing role in the healthcare revolution</h2>
<p>Health care spending accounts for almost 18% of U.S. GDP, so it&#8217;s no surprise that digital health is attracting record levels of investment. This year, VCs have flowed $14.7 billion to health tech startups, compared to $14.6 billion in all of 2020.</p>
<p>Given the high cost of care in the United States compared to other nations, pairing fintech with health tech is just good business.</p>
<p>Simon Wu, an investment director with Cathay Innovation, says he&#8217;s paying close attention to these areas of convergence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data and the transition to value-based care.</li>
<li>Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses.</li>
<li>Fintech for affordability and reducing friction.</li>
</ul>

This raises questions, like, &#8220;If YouTube can tell which kids-focused videos are low quality, why did it let them onto its platform in the first place?&#8221; And, &#8220;Is demonetization enough?&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chicago-based Promus Ventures has closed a €120 million ($139 million) space fund, dubbed Orbital Ventures, focused on early-stage space companies.</p>
<p>The new fund, which will be based in Luxembourg, grew out of a mix of public and private investment. The European Investment Fund, the financing arm of the European Union’s European Investment Bank Group, committed €40 million, with additional participation by Luxembourg’s Ministry of the Economy and the National Credit and Investment Institution.</p>
<p>While Promus Ventures’ invests across a range of industries, its track history in the space sector includes investments in Rocket Lab, Spire and Swift Navigation. Orbital Ventures, which made its first close in January 2020, has also made several investments, including in satellite terminal developer Isotropic Systems, geospatial data company Ellipsis Drive, and Denmark’s Fernride.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223803" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We continue to witness terrific growth and developments in the New Space industry, and we are excited to deploy this new sector-specific space fund,” Promus Ventures partner Pierre Festal said in a statement. “We are thankful to our investors for their trust and support in this endeavor. […] It’s a pivotal time for global space players and the outlook is strong.”</p>
<p>The new fund is just the latest sector-specific space fund to emerge in recent years, as investor interest in the burgeoning orbital market continues to rise. Last week, Space Capital reported that investors – including VCs, angel investors, corporate investors, private equity and others – poured $8.7 billion into the industry in the third quarter of 2021 alone, positioning this year to beat 2020’s investing record.</p>
<p>Much of the capital raised went to space companies that went public via mergers with blank-check firms. These deals accounted for $1.2 billion of the $3.9 billion of venture funding during the third quarter of this year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[U.S. social networking giant Facebook reported its Q3 financial results today after the bell. It reported $29.0 billion in total revenue and earnings per share of $3.22, calculated on a diluted basis.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. social networking giant Facebook <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/facebook-reports-third-quarter-2021-results-301407881.html">reported its Q3 financial results</a> today after the bell. It reported $29.0 billion in total revenue and earnings per share of $3.22, calculated on a diluted basis. Investors had expected the company to report revenues of $29.58 billion, per data <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB/analysis?p=FB">collected by Yahoo Finance</a>, and earnings per share of $3.19.</p>
<p>Shares of Facebook are up modestly in after-hours trading, indicating that the street is not shocked that it came in slightly light on top-line.</p>
<p>That lack of surprise may be due to the fact that Facebook&#8217;s report comes in the wake of Snap&#8217;s digest, which dropped last week. Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">shares fell after the company indicated</a> that it anticipated a far more modest Q4 than the market had, blaming Apple and supply-chain woes for its revenue growth troubles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223723" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In its letter to investors, Facebook provided guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021, including revenues that will land between $31.5 billion and $34 billion. The market expects $34.89 billion, above what Facebook signaled.</p>
<p>The gap between Facebook forecasts and market expectations appears to come from expected sources. The social giant wrote the following in its earnings note regarding its Q4 guidance:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our outlook reflects the significant uncertainty we face in the fourth quarter in light of continued headwinds from Apple&#8217;s iOS 14 changes, and macroeconomic and COVID-related factors. In addition, we expect non-ads revenue to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter as we lap the strong launch of Quest 2 during last year&#8217;s holiday shopping season.</p></blockquote>
<p>Changes to how Apple&#8217;s mobile operating handles privacy and the related downstream effects, along with issues stemming from COVID, were anticipated.</p>
<p>Facebook also reported in its investor digest that it will &#8220;break out Facebook Reality Labs, or FRL, as a separate reporting segment.&#8221; Citing that it expended &#8220;significant resources toward our augmented and virtual reality products and services,&#8221; the company thinks that it is time to have a second revenue category.</p>
<p>Starting next quarter, Facebook will have two segments. The first, its &#8220;Family of Apps&#8221; grouping, will feature results from &#8220;Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other services.&#8221; In contrast, FRL will include &#8220;augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software and content.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is fine. Perhaps even good. But my <em>god,</em> Facebook, why not break out reporting on your social apps into more granular buckets as well? That would have been shareholder-friendly.</p>
<p><em>More to come; we&#8217;re still reading.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seems like the goal of every startup is to exit via IPO, and if you can&#8217;t do that, by way of acquisition. In many cases, a sale gives a founder the opportunity to pay back investors and reward long-time employees, but what happens after the ink dries on the contract, and the reality of being owned by a larger company settles in?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to get the inside scoop from three founders who sold their companies, on a panel called &#8216;What Happens After Your Startup is Acquired&#8217; this Wednesday, October 27th, at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=startupaquisitionpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=startupaquisitionpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS</a>.</p>
<p>Panelists include Monica Sarbu, who founded a startup called Packetbeat in 2013, which she <a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-acquires-packetbeat">sold to Elastic in 2015</a>. She stuck around and ran the Beats team for almost three years. She is currently founder and CEO at <a href="http://xata.io">Xata</a>, and also runs <a href="http://tupo.io">Tupo.io</a>, a startup she launched last year to offer underrepresented folks in tech free mentorship</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223338" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We also have Jyoti Bansal, who sold his company, <a href="http://appdynamics.com">AppDynamics</a> to Cisco <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/">the week it was going to IPO</a> in 2017 for $3.7 billion. Bansal actually didn&#8217;t hang around, leaving the company upon the sale. Today, he runs two startup, <a href="http://harness.io">Harness</a> and <a href="https://www.traceable.ai/">Traceable</a>, and also founded the venture capital firm, <a href="https://www.unusual.vc/">Unusual Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we will talk to current <a href="https://www.gainsight.com/">Gainsight</a> founder and CEO Nick Mehta, who sold his former company LiveOffice to Symantec <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/16/symantec-buys-cloud-based-email-archiving-company-liveoffice-for-115m/">in 2012 for $115 million</a>. He stayed around for a brief period of time, but wasn&#8217;t really involved with the company after the sale closed.</p>
<p>One thing is clear from these three founders: Each acquisition experience is going to be different, and selling your company is definitely not the end of the story. We are going to discuss what goes into selling your company, how and why founders decide to do it, and if you join another team, what it&#8217;s like to go from being in charge to being an employee.</p>
<p>Further we are going to talk about the emotional side of selling and what it&#8217;s like to walk away from something you put so much time and energy into building. Finally, we will cover what each founder learned from that experience of selling the company, how it helped them grow as business people, and what you can learn as founders looking at your company&#8217;s startup journey.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The panel is part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=startupaquisitionpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=startupaquisitionpost&amp;display=true">a full agenda</a> for the day-long session looking at the impact of SaaS. In addition to this panel, we&#8217;ll have panels on open source, the value of data and the role of automation. Other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#ab40f8e4-b236-4c11-8767-8fd7d75a618c">speakers</a> include Microsoft&#8217;s Jared Spataro, Puppet&#8217;s Abby Kearns and Google&#8217;s Javier Soltero. We hope you&#8217;ll join us. It&#8217;s going to be a full day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube is rolling out a designated <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/132416851/new-to-you-discover-more-content-on-the-youtube-homepage?hl=en">&#8220;New to you&#8221; tab</a> on its platform after testing the feature earlier this year. The new tab is now available on the YouTube homepage across mobile, desktop and TV devices. YouTube says the feature will help users discover new creators and content beyond the recommended videos they usually see.</p>
<p>The new tab surfaces content that aligns with your viewing preferences from channels that you haven’t previously encountered. It&#8217;s meant to go a step further than YouTube’s Explore listings, which help users find content in specific topics, such as gaming or beauty, but doesn’t take users’ specific interests into account.</p>
<p>YouTube notes that &#8220;New to you&#8221; is personalized to the viewer, as it’s trying to strike a balance between content it thinks users might be interested in, along with content that is a bit different than what they&#8217;d typically watch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223616" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“You&#8217;ve told us that you want to see new creators and new videos after you&#8217;ve caught up on your recommendations, so we hope this new option keeps things fresh, while also helping creators connect with new audiences,” YouTube outlined in a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/132416851/new-to-you-discover-more-content-on-the-youtube-homepage?hl=en">blog post.</a></p>
<p>On mobile, you&#8217;ll see the tab when you refresh the YouTube homepage. The company says you may also see the tab as you scroll through your feed.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After dragging in the same companies and their reticent, overtrained executives time and time again, Congress is turning its attention to two of the tech industry’s fresh but important faces: TikTok and Snap.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, lawmakers on the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security will question policy leads from those two companies and YouTube on how their platforms affect vulnerable young users. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before the same committee on parallel issues in early October, shortly after revealing her identity.</p>
<p>The hearing will air on Tuesday at 7AM PT, featuring testimony from Snap VP of Global Public Policy Jennifer Stout, TikTok’s VP and Head of Public Policy Michael Beckerman and Leslie Miller, who leads government affairs and public policy at YouTube.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223677" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies before the Senate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/embed/#?secret=oRNmctY6kx" data-secret="oRNmctY6kx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Subcommittee chair Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) will lead the hearing, which will focus on social media’s detrimental effects on children and teens. “The bombshell reports about Facebook and Instagram—their toxic impacts on young users and lack of truth or transparency—raise serious concerns about Big Tech’s approach toward kids across the board,” Blumenthal said, connecting reports about Instagram’s dangers for teens to social media more broadly. The subcommittee’s ranking Republican Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) has signaled that she’s particularly interested in privacy concerns around TikTok.</p>
<p>We’d expect topics like eating disorders, harassment, bullying, online safety and data privacy to come up as members of the subcommittee take turns pressing the three policy leads for answers. The group of lawmakers also plans to discuss legislation that could help protect kids and teens online, though how solutions-oriented the hearing will be remains to be seen. Some of those potential solutions include <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-rep-castor-reintroduce-legislation-to-protect-children-and-teens-from-online-manipulation-and-harm">the KIDS Act</a> (Kids Internet Design and Safety), which would create new online protections for people under the age of 16. Blumenthal and fellow Democratic Senator Ed Markey reintroduced the bill last month.</p>
<p>The mental health of kids and teens isn’t the only pressing societal crisis that social platforms are implicated in at the moment, but it’s one Republicans and Democrats are both rallying around. For one, it’s a rare arena of criticism with plenty of political overlap for both sides. Both parties do seem to agree that tech’s biggest companies need to be controlled in some way, though they generally play up different parts of the why: for conservatives it’s that these companies have too much decision making power when it comes to what content gets wiped from their platforms. On the opposite side of the aisle, Democrats are generally much more worried about the kind of content that gets left up, like extremism and misinformation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Tuesday&#8217;s hearing will also likely dive into how algorithms amplify harmful content. Because social media companies play their cards close to the chest when it comes to how their algorithms work, hearings are a rare opportunity for the public to learn more about how these companies serve their users personalized content. Ideally we’d be learning a lot about that kind of thing in the often lengthy, repetitive tech hearings Congress has held in the last couple of years, but between lawmakers pushing uninformed or irrelevant lines of questioning and evasive tech executives with hours of media training under their belts, the best we can usually hope for is a few new tidbits of information.</p>
<p>While Facebook won’t appear at this particular hearing, expect recent revelations around that company and Instagram to inform what happens on Tuesday. All three social media companies set to testify have had an eye on the public response to leaked Facebook documents and more reporting on that data<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/technology/facebook-files.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-facebook&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc"> just landed on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Just after the initial reports that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">Instagram is aware of the risks it poses to teen users</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/tiktok-expands-mental-health-resources-as-negative-reports-of-instagrams-effect-on-teens-leak/">TikTok introduced a new set of safety measures</a> including a well-being guide, better search interventions and opt-in popups for sensitive search terms. Last week, Snap announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/snapchat-to-introduce-family-safety-tools-to-protect-minors-using-its-app/">new set of family-focused safety tools</a> to give parents more visibility into what their kids are up to using the platform. Both social networks skew heavily toward younger users compared to platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, making robust safety tools even more of a necessity. Leading into the hearing, YouTube announced some changes of its own around what kind of kids content will be <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/132408074/creators-update-regarding-quality-principles-for-made-for-kids-content?hl=en">eligible for monetization</a> while also highlighting its other kid-centric safety measures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Frances Haugen, one of (now) multiple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/leaked-memo-excoriates-facebooks-slapdash-and-haphazard-response-to-global-political-manipulation/">Facebook whistleblowers</a> who have come forward in recent years with damning testimony related to product safety, gave testimony in front of the <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/cddf75b6-4279-43db-9ac9-9146ef5fe03f">UK parliament today</a> &#8212; where, in one key moment, she was invited to clarify her views on end-to-end encryption following a report in the British newspaper the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/10/24/facebook-whistleblower-warns-dangerous-encryption-will-aid-espionage/">Telegraph</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>The report couched Facebook&#8217;s plan to extend its use of e2e encryption as &#8220;controversial&#8221; &#8212; aligning the newspaper&#8217;s choice of editorial spin with long-running UK government pressure on tech giants not to expand their use of strong encryption in order that platforms can be ordered to decrypt and hand over message content data on request.</p>
<p>In its interview with Haugen, the Telegraph sought to link her very public concerns about Facebook&#8217;s overall lack of accountability to this UK government anti-e2ee agenda &#8212; claiming she had suggested Facebook&#8217;s use of e2e encryption could disrupt efforts to protect Uighur dissidents from Chinese state efforts to inject their devices with malware.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223415" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The reported remarks were<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> quickly seized upon by certain corners of the Internet (and at least <a href="https://twitter.com/AlecMuffett/status/1452309142257950723">one other ex-Facebook staffer</a> who actually worked on adding e2e encryption to Messenger and is now self-styling as a &#8216;whistleblower&#8217;) &#8212; with concerns flying that her comments could be used to undermine e2e encryption generally and, therefore, the safety of scores of Internet users. </span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sounding unimpressed with the Telegraph&#8217;s spin, Haugen told UK lawmakers that her views on e2e encryption had been &#8220;misrepresented&#8221; &#8212; saying she fully supports &#8220;e2e open source encryption software&#8221;; and, indeed, that she uses it herself on a daily basis.</p>
<p>What she said she had <em>actually</em> been querying was whether Facebook&#8217;s <em>claim</em> to be implementing e2e encryption can be trusted, given the tech giant does not allow for full external inspection of its code as is the case with fully open source e2ee alternatives.</p>
<p>This is another reason why public oversight of the tech giant is essential, Haugen told the joint committee of the UK parliament which is scrutinizing (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/ex-minister-predicts-huge-battleground-over-uks-plan-to-set-internet-content-rules/">controversial</a>) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">draft online safety legislation</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I want to be very, very clear. I was mischaracterised in the Telegraph yesterday on my opinions around end-to-end encryption,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am a strong supporter of access to open source end to end encryption software.</p>
<p>&#8220;I support access to end-to-end encryption and I use open source end-to-end encryption every day. My social support network is currently on an open source end-to-end encryption service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of why I am such an advocate for <em>open source</em> software in this case is that if you&#8217;re an activist, if you&#8217;re someone who has a sensitive need, a journalist, a whistleblower &#8212; my primary form of social software is an open source, end-to-end encryption chat platform,&#8221; she also said, without naming exactly which platform she uses for her own e2ee messaging (Signal seems likely &#8212; a not-for-profit rival to Facebook-owned WhatsApp which has benefited from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/signal-expands-into-the-signal-foundation-with-50m-from-whatsapp-co-founder-brian-acton/">millions of dollars of investment from WhatsApp founder Brian Action</a>, another former Fb staffer turned critic; so maybe &#8216;meta&#8217; would in fact be a perfect <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/facebook-reportedly-plans-to-change-its-name-to-focus-on-the-metaverse/">new brand name for Facebook</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;But part of why that open source part is so important is you can see the code, anyone can go and look at it &#8212; and for the top open source end-to-end encryption platform those are some of the only ways you&#8217;re allowed to do chat in say the defence department in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s plan for end-to-end encryption &#8212; <em>I</em> think &#8212; is concerning because we have no idea what they&#8217;re doing to do. We don&#8217;t know what it means, we don&#8217;t if people&#8217;s privacy is actually protected. It&#8217;s super nuanced and it&#8217;s also a different context. On the open source end-to-end encryption product that I like to use there is no directory where you can find 14 year olds, there is no directory where you can go and find the Uighur community in Bangkok. On Facebook it is <em>trivially easy</em> to access vulnerable populations and there are national state actors that are doing this.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I want to be clear, I am not against end-to-end encryption in Messenger but I do believe the public has a right to know what does that even mean? Are they really going to produce end-to-end encryption? Because if they say they&#8217;re doing end-to-end encryption and they don&#8217;t really do that people&#8217;s lives are in danger. And I personally don&#8217;t trust Facebook currently to tell the truth&#8230; I am concerned about them misconstruing the product that they&#8217;ve built &#8212; and they need regulatory oversight for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In additional remarks to the committee she further summarized her position by saying: &#8220;I am concerned on one side that the constellation of factors related to Facebook makes it even more necessary for public oversight of <em>how</em> they do encryption there &#8212; that&#8217;s things like access to the directory, those amplification settings. But the second one is just about security. If people <em>think</em> they&#8217;re using an end-to-end encryption product and Facebook&#8217;s interpretation of that is different than what, say, an open source product would do &#8212; because an open source product we can all look at it and make sure that what is says on the label is in the can.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if Facebook claims they&#8217;ve built an end-to-end encryption thing and there&#8217;s <em>really</em> vulnerabilities people&#8217;s lives are on the line &#8212; and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m concerned about. We need public oversight of anything Facebook does around end-to-end encryption because they are making people feel safe when they might be in danger.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Haugen, a former Facebook staffer from the civic integrity team, is the source for a tsunami of recent stories about Facebook&#8217;s business after she leaked thousands of pages of internal documents and research reports to the media, initially providing information to the Wall Street Journal, which published a slew of stories last month, including about the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">toxicity of Instagram for teens</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (aka the &#8216;</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">Facebook Files</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8216;), and subsequently releasing the data to a number of media outlets which have followed up with reports today on what they&#8217;re calling </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/internal-facebook-documents-highlight-its-moderation-and-misinformation-issues/">the Facebook Papers</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.   </span></p>
<p>The tl;dr of all these stories is Facebook prioritizes growth of its business over product safety &#8212; leading to a slew of harms that can affect individuals, other businesses and the public/society more generally whether as a result of inadequate AI systems that cannot properly identify and remove hate speech (leading to situations where its platform can whip up ethnic violence), or which allow engagement based ranking systems to routinely amplify extreme, radicalizing content without proper mind to risks (such as forming conspiracy-theory touting echo chambers forming around vulnerable individuals, isolating them from wider society), or overestimation of its ad reach leading to advertisers being systematically overcharged for its adtech.</p>

<p>During her testimony today, Haugen suggested Facebook&#8217;s AIs were unlikely to even be able to properly distinguish dialectal distinctions and nuances of meaning between UK English and US English &#8212; let alone the scores of languages in countries where it directs far less resource.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians probed her on myriad harms during around 2.5 hours of testimony &#8212; and some of her answers repeated earlier testimony she gave <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">to lawmakers in the US</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the UK committee&#8217;s questions asked for her view on what might be effective regulatory measures to close the accountability gap &#8212; both on Facebook and social media more generally &#8212; as MPs sought to identify profitable avenues for amending draft online safety legislation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The danger with Facebook is not individuals saying bad things, it is about the systems of amplification that disproportionately give people saying extreme polarising things the largest megaphone in the room,&#8221; argued Haugen.</p>
<p>Her list of suggestions for fixing a system of what she couched as broken incentives under Facebook&#8217;s current leadership included mandatory risk assessments &#8212; which she warned need to cover both product safety and organisational structure since she said much of the blame for Facebook&#8217;s problems lies with its &#8220;flat&#8221; organizational structure and a leadership team that rewards (and thus incentivizes) growth above all else, leaving no one internally who&#8217;s accountable for improving safety metrics.</p>
<p>Such risk assessments would need to be carefully overseen by regulators to avoid Facebook using its customary tactic in the face of critical scrutiny of just marking its own homework &#8212; or &#8220;dancing with data&#8221; as she put it.</p>
<p>Risk assessments should also involve the regulator &#8220;gathering from the community and saying are there other things that we should be concerned about&#8221;, she said, not just letting tech giants like Facebook define blinkered parameters for uselessly partial oversight &#8212; suggesting &#8220;a tandem approach like that that requires companies to articulate their solutions&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s a flexible approach; I think that might work for quite a long time. But it has to be mandatory and there have to be certain quality bars because if Facebook can phone in it I guarantee you they&#8217;ll phone it in,&#8221; she also told the committee.</p>
<p>Another recommendation Haugen had was for mandatory moderation of Facebook Groups when they exceed a certain number of users.</p>
<p>Whereas &#8212; left unmoderated &#8212; she said groups can be easily misappropriated and/or misused (using techniques like &#8216;virality-hacking&#8217;) to act as an &#8220;amplification point&#8221; for spreading discord or disseminate disinformation, including by foreign information operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I strongly recommend that above a certain sized group they should be required to provide their own moderators and moderate every post,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This would naturally &#8212; in a content-agnostic way &#8212; regulate the impact of those large groups. Because if that group is actually valuable enough they will have no trouble recruiting volunteers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haugen also suggested that Facebook should be forced to make a firehose of information available to external researchers (as Twitter, for example, already does) &#8212; in a <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancesHaugen/status/1452727344855146497">privacy-safe way</a> &#8212; which would allow outside academics and experts to drive accountability from the outside by investigating potential issues and identifying concerns freed from Facebook&#8217;s internal growth-focused lens.</p>
<p>Another of her recommendations was for regulators to demand segmented analysis from Facebook &#8212; so that oversight bodies get full transparency into populations that disproportionately experience harms on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience &#8212; the real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,&#8221; she suggested.</p>
<p>She went on to argue that many of Facebook&#8217;s problems result from the sub-set of users who she said get &#8220;hyper exposed&#8221; to toxicity or to abuse &#8212; as a consequence of an engagement-driven design and growth-focused mindset that rejects even small tweaks to inject friction/reduce virality (and which she suggested would only mean Facebook giving up &#8220;small slivers&#8221; of growth in the short term and yield a much more pleasant and probably more profitable product over the longer term).</p>
<p>&#8220;As we look at the harms of Facebook we need to think about these things as system problems &#8212; like the idea that these systems are designed products, these are intentional choices and that it&#8217;s often difficult to see the forest for the trees. That Facebook is a system of incentives, it&#8217;s full of good, kind, conscientious people who are working with bad incentives. And that there are lack of incentives inside the company to raise issues about flaws in the system and there&#8217;s lots of rewards for amplifying and making things grow more,&#8221; she told the committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I think there is a big challenge of Facebook&#8217;s management philosophy is that they can just pick good metrics and then let people run free. And so they have found themselves in a trap where in a world like that how do you propose changing the metric? It&#8217;s very very hard because 1,000 people might have directed their labor for six months trying to move that metric and changing the metric will disrupt all of that work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any of it was intentional &#8212; I don&#8217;t think they set out to go down this path. And that&#8217;s why we need regulation &#8212; mandatory regulation, mandatory actions &#8212; to help pull them away from that spiral that they&#8217;re caught in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Legislation that seeks to rein in online harms by applying regulations to platform giants like Facebook must also not focus only on individual harms &#8212; but needs to respond to societal harms, she also emphasized.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is a grave danger to democracy and societies around the world to omit societal harm. A core part of why I came forward was I looked at the consequences of choices Facebook was making and I looked at things like the global south and I believe situations like Ethiopia are just part of the opening chapters of a novel that&#8217;s going to be horrific to read. We have to care about societal harm &#8212; not just for the global south but for our own societies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When an oil spill happens it doesn&#8217;t make it harder for us to regulate oil companies. But right now Facebook is closing the door on us being able to act &#8212; we have a slight window of time to regain people-control over AI; we have to take advantage of this moment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital lenders that share personal data of loan defaulters, with third parties, risk license withdrawal in Kenya after lawmakers added a <a href="http://www.parliament.go.ke/sites/default/files/2021-10/SUPPLEMENTARY%20ORDER%20PAPER%20THURSDAY%20OCT%2014-10-2021%20AFTERNOON.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clause</a> &#8212; granting the banking regulator the mandate to revoke permits of operators who breach customer confidentiality &#8212; to the new law passed by the country&#8217;s National Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, loan apps collect borrowers&#8217; phone data, including contacts, and demand access to messages to check the history of mobile money transactions &#8212; for credit scoring and as conditions for disbursing loans. Rogue lenders then use some of the contact information collected to recover the loans disbursed in cases where borrowers default.</span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57985667" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicate that digital lenders resort to debt-shaming tactics, like calling friends and family, to compel their borrowers to repay the loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change adds to a raft of measures taken by Kenyan lawmakers to protect citizens from rogue digital lenders who offer high-priced collateral-free loans. It grants the regulator, Central Bank of Kenya, power to oversee the operations of standalone digital lenders (not affiliated with banks) after a period of self-regulation. Digital lenders will, going forward, be required to obtain licenses to operate in Kenya, unlike previously, when they just had to register &#8212; which led to the proliferation of rogue apps. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221359" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Central Bank of Kenya amendment 2021 bill also gives the regulator the power to cap interest rates and to suspend or revoke the licenses of digital lenders that breach “the conditions of the Data Protection Act or the Consumer Protection Act.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya’s Data Protection Act requires firms to disclose to customers the reasons for collecting their data. It also ensures that borrowers&#8217; confidential information is safe from infringement by unauthorized parties. This comes as consumer lobbies accuse loan apps of sharing customer information with data and marketing companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital lenders will also be required to reveal all the information concerning their products, and this includes details on pricing, penalties for defaulters and means of debt recovery. This is in line with the country’s Consumer Protection Act which requires sellers to disclose to consumers all the terms and conditions pertaining to the purchase of goods or services. Almost all lending apps were found to use debt-shaming tactics to recover debt in Kenya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenya is home to about 100 mobile lending apps, including Okash and Opesa, both owned by the Chinese-owned browsing giant Opera, and which have</span><a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/opera-phantom-of-the-turnaround/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">faced claims of using predatory lending tactics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Kenya. Okash and Opesa are some of tens other loan apps that were found to charge exorbitant interest rates and to have exploitative terms &#8212; like issuing 30-day loans instead of the 60 days stipulated by Google Play Store policies. The interest rates of the two Chinese loan apps were exorbitant, reaching up to 876% annualized, rates yet banks&#8217; yearly rates rarely exceed 20%. Other apps, including the San Francisco-based Branch International Ltd., and PayPal-backed</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/tala-grabs-145m-to-offer-more-financial-services-in-emerging-markets/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tala</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, were found to charge extortionist rates, with annualized interest rates of 156-348% and 84-152.4%, respectively. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lenders’ lobby, which represents 25 digital lenders disbursing about $40 million a month, told TechCrunch that members expressed their concern over capping of the interest rate but said they were happy with the new law especially because their feedback was taken. The association lobbied for the removal of minimum capital requirements, deposit rations and for the regulator to cede control of innovation or new products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are happy that the space is regulated now and that we are able to access the Central Bank (regulator) and mechanisms for dispute regulations have also been put in place. But price control is what concerns us and we are not happy with that &#8212; the moment you put an interest rate cap then there won’t be any lending. We are nervous about that but it is fair,” said the Digital Lenders Association of Kenya chairman, Kevin Mutiso.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But having regulations in place, Mutiso said, is going to help grow the lending space in the country as the lenders collaborate with partners including the regulator to make it more robust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lack of regulation was making the market unpredictable, now we know what we can do and not do. And also, we are going to have better debt collection practices,” said Mutiso. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The law, we believe, is going to make Kenya to be the number one fintech market in the world because everything is clear now &#8212; from what is expected from the lenders and the borrowers. We are also going to see better products for our customers especially the MSMEs (micro and small medium enterprises),” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apps offer collateral-free loans making them attractive to borrowers looking for quick cash, and who are often locked out by banks due to prerequisites such as account history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While digital credit is easily accessible, its short tenure makes it expensive, while ease of access has led to borrowing from multiple apps resulting in debt distress and the reduction of credit scores &#8212; affecting the borrowers’ ability to obtain credit from banks in future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://www.kba.co.ke/downloads/WPS-08-2019.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Kenya Bankers Association shows that convenience and ease of access are the predominant reasons that customers take into account when making decisions on the platforms to access credit from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It found that self-employed people prefer digital to conventional credit attributable to liquidity changes that they encounter while in their line of business, pointing to how loan apps are preferred during emergencies too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new law gives the regulator powers to determine the pricing parameters that will be followed by the digital lenders when setting the cost of credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exorbitant interest rates are not unique to Kenya; in India, loan apps were found to charge interest rates as high as</span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/1/11/loan-apps-remain-on-india-google-play-despite-violations-deaths" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 60% per week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There were reports of people committing suicide after harassment by loan-recovery agents in the south Asian country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West African countries have also witnessed the proliferation of loan apps, with Nigeria among the largest markets in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), a research and advocacy organization, also found digital loan default rates and delinquency high among 20 million borrowers in Tanzania. It reported that most borrowers used the loans for daily needs instead of emergencies or for investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the most important things regulators can do to reduce these numbers is to improve transparency on loan terms and conditions, making it easier for customers to make informed decisions,”</span><a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/how-regulators-can-foster-more-responsible-digital-credit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said CGAP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization recommended more stringent rules to govern loan apps and called for transparency on loan terms among lenders.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Radio has long been described as the most intimate of media. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGy5SGTuAGI&amp;list=RDBzAdXyPYKQo&amp;t=157s">Quips about putting radio on the internet</a> aside, the persistent popularity of podcasting and the cockamamie climb of Clubhouse shows that audio-based platforms will continue to echo around the upper echelons of the ecosystem for a while yet. Joining the fray is <a href="https://www.hearttoheartapp.com/">Heart to Heart</a>, an audio-first dating app aiming to bring back some intimacy to the process of finding the right person for your next foray, whether that&#8217;s a saucy encounter or a mate for life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to act, and from my time in acting, I saw how much voice, and audio experiences drive intimacy between people,&#8221; explains Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart. &#8220;When it came down to the dating apps, it was never something I could get into. I felt like you needed to come up with a textual one-liner. That was never my way of approaching romantic conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heart to Heart is pushing back against the endless swiping and messaging of many of its competitors, offering a contrasting experience to sending the same opening line to dozens of people or typing with your thumbs until deep into the night.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221317" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I believe that the best consumer investments come from people who have unique insights on consumer behavior and ways that new tech products can allow new forms of social interaction,&#8221; said Charles Hudson from <a href="https://precursorvc.com/">Precursor Ventures</a>, who led the pre-seed investment round. &#8220;I have been a big fan of Josh&#8217;s TikTok videos for some time and his ability to poke at the tech industry with timely, relevant videos really showcased his creativity and ability to communicate via short-form video. I think the idea around confirming photos, storytelling, and audio will yield a product that really speaks to people&#8217;s unmet needs around communication and will create a whole new way for people to connect.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Precursor doesn&#8217;t particularly focus on audio-first startups, the team has seen a number of opportunities in that space. It was an early investor in Howard Akumiah&#8217;s company, Betty Labs (acquired by Spotify), as well as Isa Watson&#8217;s company (Squad), Falon Fatemi&#8217;s company (Fireside) and several others that are still in stealth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that there is a major wave of interesting activity happening around non-music audio and I believe that we are still in the early innings of non-music, audio-driven social experiences,&#8221; says Hudson. &#8220;The last two companies that I feel really innovated in this category were Tinder and Bumble. I think Josh and his team have a new mechanic that feels differentiated and unique and I think it has the potential to be the foundation for a new way for people to meet and get to know each other in ways that aren&#8217;t easily accomplished today.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222242" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222242" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2222242 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?w=680" alt="Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg 1869w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Potential-Profile-Pic-5.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222242" class="wp-caption-text">Joshua Ogundu, co-founder and CEO of Heart to Heart (Photo provided by Heart to Heart)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company raised the pre-seed round of $750,000. The round was led by Precursor Ventures, and Bryce Roberts of OATV &amp; Angelica Nwandu of The Shade Room partnered on the investment, as well as Marie Rocha at Realist Ventures. In addition, a number of angel investors joined the round, including Chris Bennett (Wonderschool), Andy Weissman (USV) and Gregory Levey (Robinson Huntly).</p>
<p>&#8220;The main thing we are trying to accomplish with the $750K, is to focus on building our iOS app, and making LA our first launch market,&#8221; says Ogundu. &#8220;Dating is such a local experience, and it makes sense to us to build and improve locally, then scaling it up from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Voice is so intentional and intimate, and that is exactly what we&#8217;re building here at Heart to Heart,&#8221; says Ogundu, suggesting that the voice mechanic is helpful in a dating context because it helps slow people down. &#8220;I think that because it takes more energy to send that voice snippet to someone, you&#8217;ll be more intentional with who you even look to strike up conversations with.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founding team consists of Joshua Ogundu, who wears the CEO hat. He is joined by Arihant Jain and Komal Shrivastava, who have been heading up the engineering and design efforts. The company hopes to get its product to market by the end of the year.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The quest to provide more affordable and accessible healthcare, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic, has spurred an explosion of innovation, which in turn has attracted massive amounts of capital. To put this into perspective, consider this: In 2019, digital health saw $7.7 billion in VC investment, and that number rose to $14.6 billion in 2020. However, the<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/startups-cash-in-as-venture-funding-for-digital-health-rises-11626346800"> first half of 2021 alone saw $14.7 billion</a> in VC investment.</p>
<p>Its marriage with fintech is the catalyst for the transformation of the healthcare industry. Similar to the <a href="https://medium.com/cathay-innovation/where-east-meets-west-consumer-fintech-at-a-crossroads-a-south-east-asia-story-4e2468ffac20">unbundling of financial services</a> and how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/from-startups-to-starbucks-the-embedded-api-opportunity/">fintech is scaling vertical SaaS</a>, the pandemic-fueled disaggregation of healthcare has created new players that are taking a page out of the fintech revolution book — all starting with payments.</p>
<p>A growing number of startups are now leveraging the <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/08/04/fintech-scales-vertical-saas/">fintech playbook</a> to solve a key part of the healthcare problem — the shifting dynamics between patients, payers and providers, and how payments and related electronic health records (EHRs) flow between them. Not only is the onus of payments and data flow moving from payers to patients, but providers are now facing a monumental shift to new billing and engagement models, requiring new technologies and platforms to help with the change.</p>
<p>Through the lens of fintech, here are three key areas to watch in healthcare.</p>
<h2>Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses</h2>
<p>One of the largest trends impacting the population today is the steady rise of chronic illnesses. It is estimated that <a href="https://www.fightchronicdisease.org/sites/default/files/docs/GrowingCrisisofChronicDiseaseintheUSfactsheet_81009.pdf">nearly half the U.S. population</a> will have a chronic illness by 2025. People are getting sicker for longer periods of time, which leads to a constant spending streak. Patients not adhering to medical guidance is a major factor and is responsible for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045499/#b1-18-033">$100 billion of healthcare spending and over 100,000 deaths annually</a>. With around <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/poll-nearly-1-in-4-americans-taking-prescription-drugs-say-its-difficult-to-afford-medicines-including-larger-shares-with-low-incomes/">a fifth of patients</a> never filling their prescriptions, it has become a priority to educate and incentivize patients to complete care and avoid readmissions or ER visits.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>To curb the rise of chronic illnesses and the associated recurring costs, many startups are using behavioral economics and gamification to incentivize patients and build healthy habits. For example, companies like <a href="https://paceline.fit/">Paceline</a> in the U.S., <a href="https://sweatco.in/">Sweatcoin</a> in Europe and <a href="https://gobetterfly.com/en/">Betterfly</a> in Latin America gamify wellness by combining fitness and financial rewards.</p>
<p>On the other hand, startups like <a href="https://www.semprehealth.com/">Sempre Health</a> and <a href="https://www.wellthapp.com/">Wellth</a> are tackling medical non-adherence with behavioral economics. For example, Wellth financially rewards actions like on-time prescription intake or regular A1c tests for diabetic patients.</p>
<h2>Fintech for affordability and reducing friction</h2>
<p>Looking at payers, there’s a major shift stemming from the rise of high-deductible healthcare plans (HDHP) — enrollment has risen <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/enrollment-changes-to-high-definition-health-insurance-plans">43% in the last five years</a> — emphasizing an increase in premiums and patient financial responsibility. Out-of-pocket expenses threaten the financial stability for many, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/20/heres-why-so-many-americans-cant-handle-a-400-unexpected-expense.html">40% of Americans</a> unable to pay an unexpected bill of $400.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-responsibility-approach-protecting-kids-and-families-youtube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> it will soon begin to demonetize some of the channels on its platform that market themselves as &#8220;made for kids&#8221; if the content they produce is low-quality, encourages negative behavior or attitudes, or is heavily commercial. The company had previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">warned</a> this sort of content would no longer be eligible for inclusion in its dedicated YouTube Kids app, but starting next month YouTube <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/132408074/creators-update-regarding-quality-principles-for-made-for-kids-content?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also begin to enforce</a> new monetization <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies</a> as well, which may impact the creators&#8217; eligibility for or possible removal from the YouTube Partner Program.</p>
<p>YouTube first announced its plans to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/"> increase its protections for minors</a> in August, saying that some of the updates would directly address upcoming regulations, while others were going beyond what would be required by law. At the time, YouTube said it would shift the default settings on videos for users ages 13 to 17 to private, would enable &#8220;take a break&#8221; and bedtime reminders for minors, would stop leveraging &#8220;interests&#8221; data for targeting teens and kids with ads, and more.</p>
<p>Among the changes was a warning to those creators specifically making content aimed at kids, noting the company planned to remove &#8220;overly commercial content&#8221; from its standalone YouTube Kids app aimed at younger children.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223476" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ahead of this move, a number of consumer advocacy groups <a href="https://www.democraticmedia.org/article/ftc-complaints-filed-campaign-commercial-free-childhood-and-center-digital-democracy-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had been pressuring</a> YouTube and regulators alike to put an end to these types of videos, saying they blurred the lines between content and advertising. Plus, they argued, some creators weren&#8217;t disclosing that they had brand relationships behind the scenes that were fueling this sort of content production.</p>
<p>But without enforcement and guidelines around what&#8217;s appropriate for kids, some of YouTube&#8217;s largest creators were channels like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/24/949926198/9-year-old-boy-is-named-highest-earning-youtube-star-of-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multimillionaire</a> Ryan Kaji of Ryan ToysReview (now Ryan&#8217;s World), which focused heavily on consumerism and toy unboxings.</p>
<p>YouTube in August said that it would remove content from YouTube Kids that incited viewers to buy a product and &#8220;content focused on the excessive accumulation or consumption of products.&#8221; Now, YouTube is warning that any channel targeting younger audiences or those that are classified as &#8220;made for kids&#8221; could be at risk of demonization if they put out other sorts of low-quality content.</p>
<p>This includes content that <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392#kids-quality&amp;zippy=%2Cquality-principles-for-kids-and-family-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener">encourages negative behavior and attitudes</a> (like bullying, dishonestly, disrespect to others, dangerous pranks, unhealthy eating habits and more); content that&#8217;s deceptively educational; content that hinders comprehension; content that&#8217;s sensational or misleading; and content that includes strange use of children&#8217;s characters. (The latter had been a particular problem in recent years, such as videos featuring <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/22/youtube-tightens-rules-on-kid-related-content/">characters like Peppa Pig</a> in situations that were not kid-friendly).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Starting in November, YouTube says it will begin to enforce <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">additional monetization policies</a> with these quality principles in mind for channels designated &#8220;made for kids&#8221; or that frequently create content that&#8217;s made for kids.</p>
<p>If the creators are making low-quality content, according to these principles, they may be removed or blocked from joining the YouTube Partner Program. Other videos that fall under the low-quality principles may receive limited or no advertising. Initially, <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/132408074/creators-update-regarding-quality-principles-for-made-for-kids-content?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube says</a> it will start with videos that encourage negative behavior. Others that have a strong focus on low-quality &#8220;made for kids&#8221; content will also go under review, the company added.</p>
<p>These negative principles were already factors that determined if the content is appropriate for YouTube Kids and informed the larger YouTube algorithm. But monetization changes are a much more powerful tool to shape what sort of content creators actually produce.</p>
<p>YouTube says creators whose channels could be impacted by the monetization changes will receive an email before the changes go into effect. In addition, even those channels that aren&#8217;t immediately impacted but produce low-quality kids&#8217; content may receive a yellow icon in a warning to advertisers. The company didn&#8217;t say how many channels may be impacted as a result of its new policy.</p>
<p>On the flip side, content that adheres to high-quality <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/10774223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">principles</a> will be recommended more by the YouTube algorithm going forward, in addition to being included in the YouTube Kids app.</p>
<p>The high-quality principles include things like content that encourages kids to be a good person; content that encourages learning and curiosity; content focused on creativity, play and a sense of imagination; content that focuses on interaction with real-world issues; and content that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion.</p>
<p>The announcement arrives on the heels of an increased examination of the role tech companies are playing when it comes to the well-being of minors using their services. Already, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">Google and YouTube</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">TikTok</a> have announced updates that place more emphasis on the safety and privacy of their younger users. YouTube also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/youtube-to-launch-parental-control-features-for-families-with-tweens-and-teens/">launched</a> new parental controls. This week, Snap and TikTok will have to face their first Congressional hearing, too.</p>
<p>YouTube says it will continue to reevaluate and update its principles going forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year and a half has been a major eye opener for countless industries. As many white-collar employees have moved from offices to remote work, it has drawn into sharp focus just how ill-equipped many home setups are for hour after hour of Zoom calls.</p>
<p>Even as sales of PCs and tablets saw a major spike in 2020, consumer electronics companies weren’t particularly swift to react &#8212; not especially surprising, as the timeline to bring products to market is long, with many unannounced products still in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Arriving today, as a free update on compatible systems, macOS 12 Monterey (in part) introduces some key features introduced in an era of remote work &#8212; and life. And it’s likely not a coincidence that the new operating system arrives as Apple hardware, like the MacBook Pro and M1-powered iMac, is finally getting long-overdue upgrades to their camera and microphone setups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223463" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For Apple, that means FaceTime. The company is in a bit of peculiar position on the teleconferencing front, in that &#8212; unlike, say Microsoft or Google &#8212; it doesn’t have a business teleconferencing platform. Last year, Apple added the ability to host up to 32 people on a call, which certainly opens things up, but as it stands, there’s no “FaceTime for Business.” This is a friends and family deal.</p>
<p>Apple’s video calling app gets some key upgrades this time around. The top of the list addition is SharePlay, which unfortunately has been delayed on desktop and is currently set for a release at some point later this fall. It’s also largely expected to arrive on the soon-to-drop iOS 15.1. The feature is effectively a built-in version of the watch-together features that rolled out last year for streaming services at the height of the pandemic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223465" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2223465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg 2176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1158 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The feature is custom made to support Apple’s own services TV+ and Apple Music, and will work with a handful of launch partners, including Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, the NBA app, Twitch, TikTok, MasterClass, Zillow, Paramount+ and ESPN+. It’s a healthy cross section of services, but there are some bigger names that are notably absent, including Netflix, Amazon and Spotify.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature effectively syncs up video and audio content, allowing users in the group to react to what they’re seeing/hearing in real time. Volume adjusts around speakers’ audio and playback is synced when a user plays/pauses/fast forwards/rewinds. Users will also be able to extend the feature onto a set with an Apple TV.</p>
<p>Also new is a share screen feature, similar to what you’ll find on a service like Zoom, letting you present windows to other viewers on the call. Spatial Audio comes to FaceTime, as well. I recently tried it out while testing the latest AirPods and dug the feature, which uses the position of a speaker’s window to place their audio in that approximate location. It’s a little gimmick for now, but it’s a neat one.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting additions this time out is the ability to join a FaceTime call outside of the Apple ecosystem.

<p>Also new is Portrait Mode &#8212; which, again, works similarly to the blur background function we’ve seen on the leading teleconferencing services. Apple says the addition uses the Neural Engine found on the M1. Both this feature and Spatial Audio are only available on systems with the M1 chip, though the blurring of the line the new chips represent for developers seems to point to an acceleration in the adoption of iOS features on macOS. This is a nice change from the days of waiting a couple of updates to see mobile features hit the desktop.</p>

<p>Once again, Safari receives some of the biggest updates here, along with its rethink on mobile. The biggest aesthetic change is a fairly radical move away from the universal search bar.</p>

<p>The new “compact tab bar” moves tabs into small, discrete windows as a space saver. Given how much of a pain such a change can be, Apple is smartly leaving this something you can enable or disable in settings.</p>

<p>Understanding that this is currently a browser tab world and we’re just living in it, Tab Groups lets users share them in bunches, so you can, say, have a “work” or “home” collection. Depending on how you work, that’s either a boon to creativity or another opportunity to cram a bunch of bookmarks away.</p>

<p>Highlighting and right clicking text on a page now lets you add a “Quick Note,” collating all of that information into a single place. It’s a nice addition for those who do a lot of online research.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223475" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="845" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png 2028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=768,634 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=680,561 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=1536,1268 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Focus, which was announced as part of iOS 15, let’s you mediate distractions based on activities or times of day. You can, say, limit notifications when you’re meditating, reading, working, etc. These settings are automatically synced across Apple devices. Silenced notifications will also be noted in your messenger app, so people know when you don’t want to be disturbed.</p>
<p>AirPlay to Mac is a long-awaited new feature that, well, does what it says on the tin, effectively letting you cast music, movies and the like to a Mac using AirPlay 2. Makes sense, particularly if you’ve got an iMac and a perfectly good screen and speakers.</p>
<p>Universal Control &#8212; one of the more eagerly awaited additions here &#8212; is also coming later in the fall. The feature will further blur the line between iPadOS and Mac, letting users drag and drop items between the two for a more seamless AirDrop experience. The two devices can also be controlled by the same peripheral simultaneously, including a keyboard, trackpad or mouse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223477" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="741" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png 1496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=768,555 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The other big addition here is Shortcuts, the latest feature to be ported over from iOS. The app is effectively replacing long-time favorite Automator, which will be going away at some point in the future. As it stands, shortcut is simpler but may ultimately lack the sophistication of Automator, so Apple is cushioning the blow by letting users convert Automator sequences into Short Cuts. It will keep Automator around for a while, however, as it solicits feedback from users.</p>
<p>MacOS Monterey is available now for iMacs from 2015 and older, iMac Pro 2017 and later, MacBook Air/Pro early-2015 and later, Mac Pro 2013 and later, Mac mini 2014 and later and MacBook early-2016 and later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla&#8217;s market valuation hit and then surpassed the $1 trillion mark Monday, a milestone reached by the company 11 years after it became a publicly traded company. It also puts Tesla in select company with Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, all of which have market caps above $1 trillion.</p>
<p>Tesla met the $1 trillion market cap mark around midday Monday when shares hit $998.22. Share prices hovered just below $1,000 and then suddenly shot past it — another first for Tesla. Shares closed up 12.66%, at $1,024.86. This is the first time the company&#8217;s share price reached $1,000 a share.</p>
<p>Shares pushed higher Monday on several news stories related to Tesla, including that rental giant Hertz, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, had agreed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/tesla-hertz-shares-rise-electric-vehicle-order/">buy 100,000 EVs</a> from the automaker. The deal, which will push the car rental giant’s EV offerings to 20% of its global fleet, is reportedly worth $4.2 billion. Tesla Model 3 vehicles will show up in the Hertz rental inventory as early as next month in major U.S. markets and select cities in Europe, according to the rental company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223471" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other news that provided bullish updates on Tesla also helped lift the share price, including a research note from Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas that the firm was raising its price target to $1,200 (from $900 previously) and reiterating its overweight rating.</p>
<p>Separately, a report from JATO Dynamics also determined that the Tesla Model 3 was the top-selling vehicle in Europe last month, making it the first time a full-electric car has outsold combustion engine models, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-model-3-becomes-first-ev-top-european-monthly-sales-2021-10-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p>The popping share price Monday builds off momentum from last week when Tesla reported net income of $1.62 billion in the third quarter, a nearly fivefold increase from the $331 million it earned in the same period last year. The record-setting profit came thanks to record sales and despite a global chip shortage and supply chain constraints that have affected the industry.</p>
<p>Notably, Tesla was able to earn that record net income (on a GAAP basis) even as the vast majority of its sales came from its cheaper Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles. The company also generated $13.76 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 56% increase from the $8.77 billion it reported the same period last year. Revenue was also 15% higher than $11.96 billion reported in the second quarter of 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla stock has had a history of volatility, sometimes enflamed by CEO Elon Musk and his tweets. However, the stock has been steadily rising — with a few notable dives — for the past year. A year ago, Tesla shares were a bit over $420 a share.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy has called on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-charges-forward-with-a-third-quarter-profit-of-1-6-billion/">Tesla</a> to change the design of its advanced driver assistance system to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to the company&#8217;s CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p>The letter, which TechCrunch has viewed, expressed concern that Tesla has yet to implement two safety recommendations that the NTSB issued more than four years ago. The urgency to address those safety recommendations has increased now that Tesla is rolling out more automated driving functions through its so-called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/24/elon-musk-rolls-back-newest-full-self-driving-beta-due-to-software-issues/">&#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221;</a> software beta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our crash investigations involving your company&#8217;s vehicles have clearly shown that the potential for misuse requires a system design change to ensure safety,&#8221; Homendy wrote. Tesla has not responded to request for comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223416" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The NTSB can only make recommendations and does not have the authority to enforce existing laws or make policy.</p>
<p>While Homendy did thank Tesla for cooperating with NTSB investigators following various crashes and incidents that the agency has examined, she spent the bulk of the letter addressing her deep concerns on Tesla&#8217;s inaction to &#8220;implement critical NTSB safety recommendations.&#8221;</p>
<p>One excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>You have stated that &#8220;safety is always the primary design requirement for a Tesla.&#8221; Now that statement is undercut by the announcement that Tesla drivers can request access to &#8220;Full Self-Driving Beta technology,&#8221; operational on both highways and city streets, without first addressing the very design shortcomings that allowed the fatal Williston, Delray Beach, and Mountain View crashes to occur.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you are serious about putting safety front and center in Tesla vehicle design, I invite you to complete action on the safety recommendations we issued to you four years ago.</p>
<p>The NTSB has long advocated for implementation of myriad technologies to prevent tragedies and injuries and save lives on our nation&#8217;s roads, but it&#8217;s crucial that such technology is implemented with the safety of all road users foremost in mind. I look forward to receiving an update on our safety recommendations.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2017, NTSB issued two safety recommendations to the automaker based on its investigation of a fatal crash, in which Joshua Brown was killed when his Tesla Model S sedan struck a tractor-trailer that crossed his path. Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system, known as Autopilot, was engaged at the time. The agency found that Brown was using Autopilot on roadways that the system was not designed to handle and that he went extended periods of time without having his hands on the wheel. Autopilot is not a hands-free system.</p>
<p>NTSB determined that Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot system did not effectively monitor and respond to the driver&#8217;s interaction with the steering wheel to ensure driver engagement. The agency recommended Tesla establish safeguards that would limit Autopilot to conditions for which they were designed and to develop ways to more &#8220;effectively sense the driver&#8217;s level of engagement and alert the driver when engagement is lacking while automated vehicle control systems are in use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla has argued that operational design domain limits are not applicable for so-called Level 2 driver assist systems, such as Autopilot, because the driver determines the acceptable operating environment. Homendy pushed back on that argument in her email to Musk, noting that the agency&#8217;s crash investigations have &#8220;clearly shown that the potential for misuse requires a system design change to ensure safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Homendy also noted that it sent five other automakers that have vehicles with Level 2 driving automation systems a recommendation to apply ways to engage and alert the driver. Those five manufacturers responded to NTSB and described the action they planned to take or were taking to better monitor a driver&#8217;s level of engagement, according to Homendy&#8217;s letter to Musk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tesla is the only manufacturer that did not officially respond to us about the recommendation,&#8221; she wrote.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">At the beginning of the pandemic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RianPhin/videos">Rian Phin</a>, recently furloughed from her stressful job and struggling to create content, was living in a poorly lit townhome in Brooklyn with five roommates. When she moved into her own artist loft, replete with aesthetically pleasing high ceilings and big windows, natural sunlight filling the white room, she could finally create lifestyle content aestheticizing her life.</p>
<p>Phin, who was a Tumblr-famous fashion blogger in her youth and presently boasts over 70,000 followers on YouTube, identifies as an aesthete. Aesthetic vlogging for her and others is a demonstrated savvy for infoglut &#8212; the ability to rapidly process a huge volume of information into an “aesthetic.” Some of the most popular aesthetic vlog titles follow the lifestyle formula: “Get Ready With Me,” “What I Eat in a Day,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pinterest+room+tour">“Room Tour,”</a> “Morning Routine” and “My Quarantine Morning Routine.” At the core of these vlogs, whether categorized as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg">van life</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nkvi0UX8Os">booktube</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFezyvkeuFw">studying</a>, wellness or fashion, is an aestheticization that rejects the more explicitly mediated, aspirational presence cultivated by mainstream influencers, even while their strategies and aims are similar.</p>
<p>But Phin’s personal style, Ssense-bought silhouettes and a lot of black, deviates greatly from her fellow aesthetic vloggers. Over email, she told me her sensibility still overlaps with other players in the space, but that she’s just made a conscious effort to avoid anything cute or girly because it’s inherently “marketable” and “saleable”: “Then, brands start developing products and digital and other ad campaigns around video styles.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222941" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While we all occasionally note the way information and images are presented, most people tend to prioritize function over aesthetic value. But not aesthetic vloggers. Viewing and evaluating the internet as chiefly an aesthetic object &#8212; how aesthetically pleasing, beautiful or cute something is displayed/presented &#8212; is what unifies them.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of endless customizability (Myspace, Tumblr, Neopets, Live Journal), so aesthetes are tasked with creatively filling the content void left by mid-to-late aughts fashion bloggers (<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93yawp/flookbooknu-to-home-renovation-the-evolution-of-the-millennial-influencer">Lookbook.nu, The Sartorialist, Style Bubble, etc</a>.) and 2010s beauty gurus.</p>
<p>Limitless content accelerated by the shorter trend cycles caused by fast fashion and the digital shopping experience no longer demand that fashion bloggers serendipitously document their outfits of the day in front of walls in public places or beauty vloggers exclusively discussing makeup. Aesthetic vlogging, a mutant form, combines all of these while overlapping with other fashion-focused corners of the internet, from subcultures like <a href="https://stayhipp.com/glossary/high-fashion-twitter-hft/">High Fashion Twitter</a> to seller platforms like Etsy and <a href="https://www.nylon.com/fashion/depop-captions-are-becoming-the-new-blogs-to-read">Depop</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is to collage together new aesthetics from what’s out there, yet there is a unified underlying aesthetic: colorful thumbnail fonts that often mimic the exacting fine line script produced by mechanical pencils or chunky, finger-drawn cursive scribble; high-spirited color stories; and pretty garments and interiors.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpIQF07HOSI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=7&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Among many aesthetic vloggers, there’s also an implied belief in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=camille+rowe+french+girl+">the myth of French Girl coolness</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour">girlboss self-optimization</a> (see: the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/life/what-does-that-girl-mean-tiktok-viral-trend">“That Girl” trend</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/9ZeF7njSQ3s">Notion app tutorials</a>).</p>
<p>Yet it is dissatisfied with the hustle (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=i+don%2527t+dream+of+labor">“I Don’t Dream of Labor” trend)</a> despite all manners of self-care being indistinguishable from productivity and work: the day-to-day labor of feminine preening and aspirational-yet-relatable “influencing” that captures daily tasks like eating, running errands, socializing, applying makeup and exercising on camera. What sets aesthetic vloggers apart from other kinds of influencers, the more explicit hustlers, is their sense of ease and a disavowal of labor that is in fact a form of labor, as it yields the same outcome: income.</p>
<p>Separated by age, geography and cultural milieu, the most visible aesthetic vloggers, Elena Taber, Jenny Welbourn and Orion Carloto, among others, present themselves as an aggregate of their commodities and interests, marrying sprezzatura (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprezzatura" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprezzatura&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635200115643000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFyJK5rhj2GkSjstNN6WnPzghXFOQ">“studied carelessness”</a>) with cuteness. The personality and history of their objects &#8212; whether thrifted, designer, upcycled or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0dLspavXXM" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dh0dLspavXXM&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635200115643000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNpxYGSo2uk-R1Oj7orKMTCkKTYg">Coach-gifted</a> (like whimsical knickknacks or Detroit Floyd beds) &#8212; and interests like yoga, reading and film photography, amount to simulacrum.</p>
<p>The sprezzatura communicates: “Oh, this intentional design and curation that looks like it requires the effort of a 15th century courtier, Alexa Chung and a cutting-edge design firm? I don’t know how any of that got here, haha.” Evidence of effort is failure, and the point is to appear like you didn’t try.</p>
<p>This is achieved through the minimalist white walls contrasted against the dark wood trims of their dwellings; exposed brick; textures; a downtown-cool vibe; laminated glass tables; lacquered wood floors; <a href="https://twitter.com/fasshionlover/status/1441881702104719364?s=21">books splayed and stacked across pine wood floors</a>; elements of 1960s-1980s Parisian and Italian modernist design; midcentury-modern furniture and knickknacks; asymmetry; high ceilings; the organized nonchalance of Instagram “photo dumps”; layering; the hand drawn or handmade; film preservation; art collecting; record collecting; woven throw pillows; curated clutter; unfiltered, low-res selfies; the spectrum of browns and beiges; natural lighting; an appreciation for things found in nature like plants and flowers; <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22570006/cool-consumer-identity-gen-z-cheugy">hyperreal individualism</a>; trend-omnivorousness; and countersignaling with vintage clothes.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwhBTrzzqeg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The cuteness is exemplified by personality-driven and fussily girly flourishes, intimate moments and commodities, as well as a marked lack of reticence when it comes to color — pinks, viridescent hues, yellows — never bordering on camp or kitsch, but flirting with maximalism.</p>
<p>Cute aesthetic objects like B21 Koya plush dolls and mushroom lamps juxtaposed next to the eclecticism and novelty of a bohemian design. It’s the documentation of their lives among their casually beautiful commodities, collaging and curating aesthetics; the “make Instagram casual again” movement; and the final, adult form of disparate styles of the alterna-girl aesthetics. (Aesthetic vloggers with a more educational than lifestyle bent to their channels have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=types+of+aesthetics">obsessively limned and doggedly cataloged</a> every existing alterna-girl aesthetic.)</p>
<p>One of the most popular aesthetic vloggers, Madelynn De La Rosa, 29, who is known for her sublime video content, grew up in Europe. A childhood moving to a new military base every three years expanded De La Rosa’s perspective on beauty. She developed a geographically and culturally adaptable interest in all things makeup, film, fashion and art.</p>
<p>Her YouTube channel often showcases her deeply aestheticized, hyperstylized vlogs that artfully romanticize her life. They feature her sumptuously decorated Spanish-style apartment, beach outings with friends and well-spoken articulations of topics ranging from sustainable fashion to veganism.</p>
<p>For De La Rosa, recording videos of herself might have begun as a way to document and aestheticize the mundanity &#8212; and the thrills &#8212; of womanhood, but an artful documentation materialized.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ES6qmNWmif8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>De La Rosa was delighted when, after amassing her first 100,000 followers, the Michelle Phan-owned company Ipsy gave her a three-year contract to do beauty content and moved her out to Los Angeles, where she has resided for the last six years.<br />
But last year, while under lockdown, De La Rosa struggled to produce beautiful content like Phin had. Was it frivolous &#8212; “now more than ever!” &#8212; to focus on what’s beautiful in her life? She believes that this unprecedented time was an opportunity for growth, a way of vlogging that emphasizes self-care, promoting a lifestyle that’s as health-conscious and socially distanced as it is beautiful.<br />
“How do you make your life look like this?” De La Rosa told me over the phone, playfully mimicking the people who praise her for her idyllic content: “I’ve lived here my whole life and I’ve never seen LA like this!”</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AMBdP85JY5U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=547&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>In 2019, aesthetic vlogging migrated to TikTok and Instagram, gaining in popularity at the start of the global pandemic, especially the “main character energy” videos emphasizing romanticization of everyday life.</p>
<p>Aesthetic vlogging content &#8212; mostly propagated by Gen Z kids &#8212; is a departure from the less-curated lifestyle vlogging that propelled Emma Chamberlain to the top. “Emma Chamberlain is almost the definition of, like,‘that girl” &#8212; but it’s as if it was something given to her that she didn’t even want,” <a href="https://www.patreon.com/tiffanyferg">Tiffany Ferg</a>, an expert on media and YouTube, tells me.</p>
<p>And most of the aesthetics innovated by Gen Z also use lingo they’ve created and popularized: Cringe-y/“cringe” replaced <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/182/cringe">cringeworthy</a>. “Aesthetic,” once a misnomer, now denotes beautiful, aesthetically pleasing, cute. If something is “aesthetic,” it’s not ugly, <i>intentionally so</i>. And “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/style/cheugy.html">cheugy</a>,” coined by Gaby Rasson, became interchangeable with the word “try-hard.” All of these terms correspond with aesthetics, as well as describe attitudes and people the same way that, say, the “starter pack” meme attached general descriptors to aesthetics.</p>
<p>The usage of this new slang is confusing at first, but eventually, one adapts to the youths’ consensus reality driving the culture. One learns to reconfigure their subjectivity in favor of the thoughts, feelings, preoccupations, anxieties and tastes of Gen Z and Z-llenials, obliterating the long-opined generational divide.</p>
<p>Now, millennials who observe the prevailing market trends dictated by people born in the mid-90s to early 2000s can reasonably pass, culturally speaking, for much younger. This has resulted in a mimesis predicated on young people influencing millennials &#8212; thus collapsing demographics &#8212; and an overprioritization of femininity under late capitalism.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4IqNDlZmXs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The fixation on the cultural production of youth, in a culture that historically prizes youth, has exacerbated for women the already fraught nature of femininity and beauty that exists along a continuum inextricable from youth. Cute-sprezzatura, while fundamentally feel-good, disrupts that a bit, privileging an affectedness that’s not usually associated with the feminine. This ultimately abates the inexorable modern crisis of fatigue and cringe brought upon by encountering &#8212; after scrolling to the bottom of our social media feed &#8212; an uncool or distasteful past version of ourselves by removing the appearance of effort, thus the sense of having failed.</p>
<p>Mass-produced design associated with the <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/will-the-millennial-aesthetic-ever-end.html">millennial aesthetic</a> like blush pink art prints and terrazzo, and the gaucheness of overrefinement, luxury and conspicuous consumption inevitably produces the opposite effect.</p>
<p>At the core, however, it’s still about easy consumption, especially when “cuteness” is interpolated. Rian Phin’s inclination to roughen up the cuteness to make her aesthetics less assimilable to marketers feels correct.</p>
<p>But cuteness is a lot more complex than meets the eye. According to theorist Sianne Ngai, who, in her book &#8220;<a href="https://bookshop.org/books/our-aesthetic-categories-zany-cute-interesting/9780674088122">Our Aesthetic Categories: Cute, Zany and Interesting</a>,&#8221; asserts that cuteness &#8212; a highly consumable, copyable, uniquely feminine aesthetic category &#8212; “aestheticizes” and “eroticizes” powerlessness. The reason we find old people so cute &#8212; for their presumed frailty &#8212; is the same reason we foist cuteness upon girls and women, and girls and women package themselves as so, consciously and unconsciously.</p>
<p>The titular character of Amelie played by Audrey Tautou, Hello Giggles’ creator Zooey Deschanel and Sanrio’s Hello Kitty, to name a few, have exceedingly accessible “cute” presentations. Anyone can be cute like them, really. Unlike with beauty, there’s no barrier to access, which is appealing to content creators trying to eke out space in an oversaturated creator economy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2222968" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2222968" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2222968" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-12.49.16-AM.png" alt="Screen grab of YouTuber Jenny Welbourn" width="1024" height="518" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-12.49.16-AM.png 1222w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-12.49.16-AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-12.49.16-AM.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-12.49.16-AM.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-12.49.16-AM.png?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-24-at-12.49.16-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2222968" class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC56Olvxf2FznHWOHIcfxq_g">Jenny Welbourn.</a> <strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Canonical cute-girl figures like the aforementioned fictional and real women coexist, with some friction, alongside “it girls” and influencers native to the internet now. One such purveyor of cuteness is the ribald, quirked-up YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQhwPVwcP-DnbUZtIMrupw">@Bestdressed</a>, aka Ashley. Her channel is far from anodyne viewing, as it evokes rage from Gen Z scolds who don’t understand how an immigrant girl whose introduction to sustainable fashion was her frugal mother could take an <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/fans-upset-over-youtuber-bestdressed-amazon-prime-wardrobe">Amazon brand deal</a>.</p>
<p>The market demands of an information-dense culture &#8212; and the reality that Gen Z is the savviest generation of consumers &#8212; has created an expectation of a sort of individuation that appears thoughtful and <a href="https://youtu.be/yRnnAAUJB3o?t=353">well rounded</a>. It’s not enough for young would-be influencers to influence.</p>
<p>They also have to prove they’re “interesting,” which is another aesthetic category &#8212; “the aesthetic of information” &#8212; Ngai highlights in Our Aesthetic Categories, stating that a “tension between individual and system undergirds the interesting.”</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavi_Gevinson">Tavi Gevinson</a> is a possible model for these young women.</p>
<p>The verbally gifted, culturally astute Gevinson hit the scene first as a fashion blogger, and then as the editor-in-chief of Rookie Magazine, and obviously influenced equally smart, precocious stars like Yara Shahidi, Amandla Stenberg, Zendaya, Willow Smith, et al. (Smith and Stenberg are both members of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arthoecollective/?hl=en">The Art Hoe Collective</a>, a collective of young artist femmes with strong visual identities who met on Tumblr and wanted to create a space for themselves similar to Rookie, but less centralized.) This coincided with an increase in awareness of social issues, as many young girls and women began developing leftist politics not typically found in mainstream media representation. Tavi represented the emergence of a new kind of “it girl” who is distinguished ultimately for the same reasons “it girls” have always been distinguished (her appearance, considered as a package) but also for tucking all sorts of information in with the package.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/86S8hWurquM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Those who aren’t naturally endowed with interestingness seem entitled to it. This has created an <a href="https://electricliterature.com/how-ingrid-goes-west-deflates-joan-didion-the-original-millennial-white-girl/">Ingrid Goes West</a>-like standard for poseurs, across varying spheres of influence, for what I’ve started to call tastefishing: encrypting one’s philistine self with an added layer of imitation, heightening the gravity of mimesis already at play. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1xLBDnklmw">A long-sleeved shirt under a short-sleeved shirt for one’s personality</a>!</p>
<p>Case in point: Kendall Jenner recently adapted the persona of a tastemaker, someone in possession of “<a href="https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v8-12-230/">high consecration” or “high status” tastes</a>. Posing alongside trendy experimental fiction and poetry books selected by her agent Ashleah Gonzales, Jenner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPpTteb9gQU">traffics in male attention</a>, gratuitously decorates her home with artifacts she’s brought back from Art Basel and plays old songs on Zaza World, her very own Apple Radio show. What a difference from five years ago, in her Vogue 73 Questions, when the model cited <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsFPbgK1v9I">&#8220;Marley and Me&#8221; and &#8220;The Notebook&#8221; as films she likes and Tupac as her “spirit animal.”</a></p>
<p>But can we blame her, when it’s no longer enough to be pretty and rich? Now, there&#8217;s pressure to be interesting, too, if she wants to keep up with booktubers, aesthetic vloggers, Tavi Gevinson, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/style/kaia-gerber-book-club-kendall-jenner-emily-ratajkowski-belletrist.html">Kaia Gerber, Emily Ratajkowski, Emma Roberts</a> and countless other stylish, loquacious, bookish young women.</p>
<p>The necessity of an interesting performance of self, of demonstrating one’s ability to stylishly cut through an infinite and rambling internet freighted with big ideas is a remarkable thing. It turns this abundance of information into something generative rather than overwhelming. And yet its small details &#8212; organized pixels, hex codes, fonts, still and moving images, etc. &#8212;  inform our perception of the aesthetic beauty it contains.</p>
<p>The stickiness of sight and sound, of memory, the accumulation of ephemeral sensory hunches and impressions, make it a generative experience for aesthetes, especially girls and women for whom there’s a higher expectation to perform their identities in an increasingly image-based culture via performance-based platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.</p>
<p>The lifestyle influencer is aspirational because of their ability to monetize it. Fans look up to them not only because they want to live the same way but because they want to monetize their own lives.</p>
<p>The aspirational bent to aesthetic vlogging is not only about desiring to live insouciantly among beautiful things; it’s also wanting that ability to cut through all the static, to make something beautiful yet saleable out of the glut. And who better equipped to alter and curate perceptions and experiences of aesthetics online than women and girls? Women and girls, after all, have the imagination to watch others watch us, the uncanny ability to gaze upon ourselves like we’re situated in another body and experience. Our gaze surveils better than the most advanced technology &#8212; or the male gaze.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The orbital real estate rush is just getting started as Sierra Space released more details on its plans to launch a private space station, with news that Blue Origin and Boeing would be joining the team to send the spacecraft to orbit in the second half of the decade.</p>
<p>The planned station, called “Orbital Reef,” will also include tech and services from Redwire Space, Genesis Engineering and Arizona State University. It’s the third announced commercial space station to date, coming just days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">Voyager Space, Nanoracks and Lockheed Martin</a> laid out their own plans for a commercial space station, which the group says will launch in 2027. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/axiom-space-raises-130-million-for-its-commercial-space-station-ambitions/">Axiom Space</a> is also planning a commercial station.</p>
<p>Sierra Space originally announced its plans for a commercial space station in April of this year, part of a growing chorus of private companies looking to replace the soon-to-be-retired International Space Station. The company, a division of Sierra Nevada Corporation, has been developing a large inflatable LIFE (Large Integrated Flexible Environment) habitat, which will be used for Orbital Reef. This latest news builds on those earlier announced plans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223400" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Orbital Reef will operate as an “off-world mixed use business park,” Blue Origin’s senior VP of advanced development program, Brent Sherwood said during a media event Monday. The space station could be used for many commercial purposes, including scientific research, manufacturing, media, entertainment and tourism, he mused. Orbital Reef will be capable of hosting 10 people once fully operational, and its internal volume will be around 90% of the current volume of the ISS.</p>

<p>Blue Origin will be providing core modules, utility systems and, crucially, the company’s heavy-lift New Glenn launch system. Boeing will conduct station operations, the science module and provide its Starliner crew spacecraft to ferry humans to and from the station. Redwire will provide microgravity research tech and in-space manufacturing, as well as payload operations and deployable structures.</p>
<p>Maryland-based Genesis Engineering is developing a single-person spacecraft for routine operations and tourism purposes, while Arizona State University will lead a consortium to offer research advisory services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The microgravity environment provides a whole new arena for scientific and commercial discovery,” Redwire’s executive VP for civil space and external affairs Mike Gold said. “We truly believe that the countries and companies that master microgravity research, development and manufacturing will be the global economic leaders of the future.”</p>
<p>What&#8217;s less clear is how much the station is anticipated to cost. Company executives declined to specify exactly how much capital they&#8217;ll each be putting into the project, or the overall total anticipated investment. “The question you’re asking is part of our business case and [we&#8217;re] not going to give you a specific number,” Sherwood said.</p>
<p>NASA is planning on investing up to $400 million on initial space station proposals as part of its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations project, but that money will be stretched between multiple proposals, and is likely to be just a fraction of the overall cost to develop and launch even a single station. Last month, NASA told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-unveils-ocean-reef-private-space-station.html?__source=sharebar|twitter&amp;par=sharebar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a> that the agency had received &#8220;roughly about a dozen proposals&#8221; from companies vying for some of those funds.</p>
<p>The other major piece of the puzzle is the launch capabilities of Blue Origin&#8217;s New Glenn, Boeing&#8217;s Starliner and Sierra Space&#8217;s Dream Chaser spaceplane. None of these vehicles have yet reached space, though Boeing is looking to try another test launch of Starliner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/nasa-and-boeing-confirm-starliner-wont-fly-until-first-half-of-2022-as-valve-investigation-continues/">in the first half of 2022</a>. Blue Origin plans to launch New Glenn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/blue-origin-pushes-new-glenn-orbital-rockets-first-flight-to-q4-2022/">in the fourth quarter of this year</a>, while Sierra Space has a contract with NASA for seven missions to the ISS using Dream Chaser.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You only get so many Hail Mary passes in consumer electronics. Even among the biggest companies. Take a look a Microsoft’s long-standing mobile phone ambitions. Even a $7.2 billion acquisition of the once-dominant Nokia couldn’t buy the company a place at the table with Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p>Some earlier false starts aside, Google’s mobile hardware ambitions have been &#8212; on the whole &#8212; more successful. But the Pixel line has never had the major hit the company needs to justify the resources spent on the category. The devices have largely felt like, at best, a showcase for some of the cool stuff Google is working on in mobile software and ML and, at worst, a kind of also-ran.</p>
<p>It’s frankly been strange to see the company struggle to make waves, though entering a field as crowded as smartphones was never going to be easy. And it’s doubly difficult to make a dent when, on the whole, flagship smartphones are all pretty good and continued dominance in the space is largely the result of forward momentum. Adding to Google’s troubles is a long-standing insistence that the true breakthroughs are all happening on the software side.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222347" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s an interesting thesis, to be sure, that Apple, Samsung and the like are essentially wasting their time waging a war of specs. There’s something to the idea, but in its current state, at least, it’s simply not possible to be hardware agnostic. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are, undoubtedly, growing in importance, but camera lenses, displays and processors all still matter. At least for now.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219391" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219391" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2219391 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro back camera" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219391" class="wp-caption-text">Google Pixel 6 Pro</p></div></p>
<p>Last May, it was revealed that key members of the Pixel team had left the company. It was part of a big rethink, one reaching back even further. This August, CEO Sundar Pichai noted that the company has been working on its own in-house silicon for four years. As far as Hail Mary passes go, weaning yourself off chipmakers like Qualcomm is a big one. And it needs a big phone to go with it.</p>
<p>Released this time last year, the Pixel 5 was the last vestige of the old way. Big changes don’t happen overnight &#8212; or even in a year when it comes to major electronics product lines. Unfortunately for Google, news of its minor restructuring got out ahead of the phone’s release, and even the company had to acknowledge that better days were ahead. The Pixel 6 isn’t make or break for the line, but after generations of uninspiring sales, it needs to prove that things are heading in the right direction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And by those standards, the phone is a rousing success.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219387" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219387" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2219387 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0443.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219387" class="wp-caption-text">Google Pixel 6 Pro Review</p></div></p>
<p>It stands in opposition to Google’s spec agnosticism as a testament that great software still requires great hardware. The Pixel 6 isn’t a cutting-edge, overclocked spec machine, by any stretch, but it stands as an example of what Google’s ever-impressive software can do when given the proper hardware.</p>
<p>From the moment you grab the Pixel 6 Pro, it’s clear there’s something different here. The handset feels more like something produced by Samsung than of its Pixel predecessors. It’s got a size and a heft reminiscent of the Galaxy line, an aesthetic quality only enhanced by the curved glass edges.</p>
<p>One of the things that honestly surprised me most the day of the announcement was how polarizing curved glass is in the online community. Here, its usage is primarily aesthetic, rather than attempting to jam in any kind of edge functionality, à la Samsung. The biggest argument I’ve heard against it is the risk of accidentally triggering the touchscreen when picking up the phone by the sides. It’s not a problem I’ve encountered, and honestly, I’m fairly curved screen-agnostic on the whole.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219381" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219381" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2219381 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro front screen" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219381" class="wp-caption-text">Google Pixel 6 Pro review</p></div></p>
<p>The 6 Pro display is 6.7 inches, a QHD+ (3120 x 1440) OLED at 512 ppi. It’s nice, big and bright, with a max refresh rate of 120 Hz. The standard 6 sports a 6.4-inch display at 411 ppi and 90 Hz. You can’t really go wrong either way, but the Pro is a nice upgrade on that front. The front-facing camera is a pinhole design, obscured by the default wallpaper.</p>
<p>There’s also an in-screen fingerprint reader at the bottom, which unlocks the phone quickly. The display is covered with Gorilla Glass Victus, with Gorilla Glass 6 on the rear. The upper-third of the back is monopolized by a large, distinct camera bar. I like it from a design standpoint &#8212; it’s a nice change from the standard square the competition has all gravitated toward.</p>
<p>It’s a significant bump, which means the phone sits at an angle while on its back. The addition of the standard case largely negates this effect, however. The one other concern with the camera placement is that you may have to be a bit more mindful of where you place your hands while shooting in landscape mode. Again, I didn’t run into any issues on that front, and if you do, it’s easily corrected.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2222899,2222903,2222904,2222894,2222895,2222893,2222896,2222897,2222898,2222900,2222902,2222905"]</p>
<p>There’s a slight color difference in the glass above and below the camera bar. It’s really just a fun little flourish &#8212; something the company did with the power buttons on older Pixel units. It’s clear Google is still working to develop to distinguish itself from the lookalike competition. Thankfully, it’s just a subtle touch. The whole of the design language tastefully rides the line between boring and outlandish.</p>
<p>The camera system is probably the ultimate example of how good software and hardware play off each other. I was testing the Pixel 6 Pro at the same time as the Surface Duo, and particularly in mixed or low light, it really was night and day (so to speak), in spite of the Microsoft device having a solid camera rig.</p>
<p>Turns out developing your own camera system for several generations pays dividends. I really liked the shots I was able to capture on this thing. The 4x optical zoom on the Pro is a nice touch, as well. It can go up to 20x digital, but even with Google’s computational photography, you start to introduce noise into the image quickly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222892" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="378" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png 1786w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=150,55 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=300,111 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=768,284 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=680,251 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=1536,568 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132512-3.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In addition to the standard suite of Pixel camera features comes some cool new tricks. Magic Eraser is similar in principle to Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill tool. Rub your finger on top of an unwelcome background image and it will use the surrounding settings to fill up the spot, effectively “erasing” the object. It’s far from perfect. A close look will generally spot the inconsistencies, and the more complex the surroundings, the worse job it does, generally. Even so, it does an impressive job for a new feature built into the app.</p>

<p>Ditto for Action Pan. This works similarly to Portrait mode, adding a faux blur effect to the background of an object. It works well with larger, more geometrically simple objects like a car. Something like a person riding by on a bike, on the other hand, gives it more trouble around the edges &#8212; much like Portrait. Long Exposure is effectively the opposite, blurring the moving objects, while keeping the background stationary.</p>
<p>Not gonna lie, my hermetic pandemic lifestyle hasn’t afforded me the opportunity to shoot many humans. Top of the list there are Face Unblur, which cleverly uses two cameras and face detection to create a composite sharper image on a moving object. We’re going to be digging into the real tone feature a bit deeper soon, but it’s a much welcome effort to better capture a wide range of skin tones. This, again, relies on facial detection, which can occasional be an issue.</p>
<p>Also impressive are the slate of text tools arriving on the Pixel. Live translate worked will in my limited testing, and is an impressive addition to texting. Assistant voice typing works well, though it ran into occasional issues (perhaps my annunciation), including the addition of emojis via voice. All welcome addition to existing features like Recorder, which has since added German and Japanese to the mix.</p>

<p>The real star of the show is Tensor, of course. Google has joined an increasing number of companies that have eschewed Qualcomm&#8217;s silicon dominance, in favor of their own chips. This one was four years in the making, and probably as good a sign as any that the company is committed to the Pixel line for the foreseeable future. This time out, the company credits the first-party SoC with powering a number of the new features core to the Pixel 6 experience. It notes in a recent blog post,</p>
<blockquote><p>With Google Tensor, we’re unlocking amazing new experiences that require state of the art ML — including Motion Mode, Face Unblur, Speech enhancement mode for videos and applying HDRnet to videos (more on these later). Google Tensor allows us to push the limits of helpfulness in a smartphone, taking it from a one-size-fits-all piece of hardware into a device that’s intelligent enough to respect and accommodate the different ways we use our phones.</p></blockquote>
<p>In our Geekbench tests, the system scored a 1031 on single-core and 2876 on multi-core. That&#8217;s a dramatic improvement over the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">574 and </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">1522 average we saw for the Pixel 5 &#8212; but keep in mind, that system sported a middling Snapdragon 765G process. Not exactly flagship material there. Compare that to the 1093 and 3715</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> you get with the Snapdragon 888-powered Samsung Galaxy S21, and it&#8217;s clear that Google&#8217;s in-house chip has a ways to go, in terms of sheer processing firepower. Things get even worse placed against the 1728 and 4604 we got in our iPhone 13 Pro testing. </span></p>

<p>Battery was one of the biggest sticking points with earlier models, but Google has addressed that here, big time. The 6 and 6 Pro feature 4,614 and 5,003mAh batteries, respectively — representing a solid upgrade from Pixel 5’s 4,080mA. That, in turn, was a nice jump from the Pixel 4. Google says you should be able to get through 24 hours on a charge &#8212; I found I was at around 26 hours with moderate use, so good news on that front.</p>
<p>After several years of middling Pixel hardware and sales, Google really needed a device to point the way forward for a floundering mobile division. Four years of processor development, six generations of software and some shiny new hardware all come together nicely in one package. Google has long insisted that the Pixel line is more than just an opportunity to highlight new Android software, and for once, that really rings true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been half-a-decade since the original AirPods changed the game for Bluetooth earbuds. Mocked at launch by some for their long-stemmed design, it didn’t take long before they became virtually ubiquitous, the driving force in what was still an emerging category. They offered a form factor, design and user experience that tied the technology into a package that makes sense.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot can change in five years &#8212; especially in this industry. And frankly, I’m not sure I’ve seen a category come of age and capture the public imagination as quickly as Bluetooth earbuds. Every major hardware maker has at least one good or great pair of buds, and some, like Nothing, have popped up in their wake with the express mission of disrupting the status quo.</p>
<p>Apple’s line has been through its share of changes, too, of course. In 2019, a second-generation product added the H1 chip for hands-free “Hey Siri” and improved wireless functionality, a better battery and an optional wireless charging case. That same year, the company added a premium tier to the line, in the form of the AirPods Pro. The model adds active noise cancellation (plus a transparency mode), a standard wireless charging case and silicone tips &#8212; a long-standing request from Apple headphone devotees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222606" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222871" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>At the time of writing this, there are currently three AirPods buds models, plus the over-ear Max. Effectively every single model the company has sold since 2019 is currently availably for purchase on its site. Only the first-gen version has been discontinued. The newly introduced third-generation model best their predecessors with a new design, the addition of spatial audio, sweat and water resistance and an included MagSafe charging case (all shared features with the Pros).</p>
<p>They also get an added hour of battery life on the buds and six additional hours with the case, bringing the totals up to six and 30 hours of life, respectively. At $179, they’re in between the Pros ($249) and second-gen ($129), though a fair bit closer to the latter. With the Pros getting a little long in the tooth themselves, it’s not surprising that an updated standard AirPods have further blurred the lines between the two SKUs. Heck, the shorter stems and longer charger bring the design language far more in line with the Pros.</p>
<p>For the time being, the primary differentiators are: silicone ear tips, active noise canceling and, of course, pricing. The Pros are still priced at a premium and are, without question, the company’s best earbuds, along with being one of the best premium earbuds, period. But the last year or two have seen features like active noise canceling become increasingly ubiquitous among various price points.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222876" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The AirPods 3 exist in a sort of limbo, as a notable step up from their predecessors in terms of features and sound quality and a step down from the Pros that were introduced the same year. Price point, I think, is the most compelling case here. Seventy dollars is not an insignificant premium to move from the AirPods to the Pros. But as someone who has regularly used the Pros for the past couple of years, switching to the AirPods for day to day use has been a noticeable step down.</p>
<p>The more contoured third-generation buds are unquestionably more comfortable than their predecessors, but the gulf between them and the Pros feels like night and day. That’s likely to be even more the case for people with smaller ears &#8212; having different-sized, removable tips is a lifesaver for some. The seal those tips provide also create passive noise canceling through a physical seal that effectively keeps in more audio frequencies and blocks out ambient noise.</p>
<p>As a long-time proponent of the silicone tip, I was surprised to hear that there are still people out there who prefer molded plastic. But I’ve since been able to confirm that at least one TechCrunch staffer fits the description, preferring to insert anything into their ear. Fair enough, I guess &#8212; and certainly I won’t begrudge a company for offering options, even if one seemingly makes the other feel outmoded.</p>

<p>As a resident of New York City’s biggest borough, much of my life is spent immersed in street noise &#8212; and for that matter, a constant barrage of construction from the comfort of my home. The Pros’ active and passive noise cancelation make a world of difference when a street sweeper or above-ground subway train pass me on the street, not to mention a parade of emergency vehicle sirens. There were times when the podcast I was listening to was drowned out in the cacophony of city life. Though, again, there are reasons to appreciate this from a situational awareness standpoint.</p>
<p>Wireless charging is a welcome update here. You can top off the case with a MagSafe or standard Qi charger. The former has the advantage of snapping together manually. Spatial audio, meanwhile, is a nifty feature. On a FaceTime call with multiple people, their voices are assigned locations based on where their boxes sit on the call. The effect is also novel in an app like Apple Music, which adjusts sound based on your location to the source (your phone, tablet, etc.) almost as if it were the speaker.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222881" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg 970w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=146,150 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=291,300 291w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=768,792 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=660,680 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></p>
<p>The new AirPods also get support for the new Find My feature, which adds a Bluetooth beacon-style layer onto the existing functionality. That makes it easier to find the individual buds in close quarters. Anyone who’s had to rely on the beeping sound knows it can still be a headache to locate the buds in a messy room.</p>
<p>As ever, the earbuds work best with Apple products &#8212; as I tend to say in all of these reviews, your best bet is generally buying a pair of earbuds from the same company that made your phone. The pairing was certainly stronger on iOS, but the AirPods generally worked fine in use with an Android device.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222872" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Watching the lines blur between the AirPods and AirPods Pro, it seems almost inevitable that the products will eventually merge into one. For now, the new generation is definitely a step up from their predecessors, and the $70 difference between them and the Pros is something to be mindful of. If you don’t care about active noise canceling and/or prefer modeled plastic tips, then the choice is easy. For a fully premium experience, however, well, that’s an easy choice, too.</p>
