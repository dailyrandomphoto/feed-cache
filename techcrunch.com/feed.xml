										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of news that <a href="https://www.doordash.com/">DoorDash</a> is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/doordash-aims-to-add-11-billion-to-its-valuation-during-public-offering/">targeting an initial IPO valuation up to $27 billion</a>, <a href="https://c3.ai/">C3.ai</a> also dropped a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1577526/000162828020016868/c3ais-1a2.htm">new S-1 filing</a> detailing a first-draft guess of what the richly valued company might be worth after its debut.</p>
<p>C3.ai posted an initial IPO price range of $31 to $34 per share, with the company anticipating a sale of 15.5 million shares at that price. The enterprise-focused artificial intelligence company is also selling $100 million of stock at its IPO price to Spring Creek Capital, and another $50 million to Microsoft at the same terms. And there are 2.325 million shares reserved for its underwriters as well.</p>
<p>The total tally of shares that C3.ai will have outstanding after its IPO bloc is sold, Spring Creek and Microsoft buy in, and its underwriters take up their option, is 99,216,958. At the extremes of its initial IPO price range, the company would be worth between $3.08 billion and $3.37 billion using that share count.</p>
<p>Those numbers decline by around $70 and $80 million, respectively, if the underwriters do not purchase their option.</p>
<p>So is the IPO a win for the company at those prices? And is it a win for¬†<em>all</em> C3.ai investors? Amazingly enough, it feels like the answers are yes and no. Let&#8217;s explore why.</p>
<h2>Slowing growth, rising valuation</h2>
<p>If we just look at C3.ai&#8217;s revenue history in chunks, you can argue a growth story for the company; that it grew from $73.8 million in the the two quarters of 2019 ending July 31, to $81.8 million in revenue during the same portion of 2020. That&#8217;s growth of just under 11% on a year-over-year basis. Not great, but positive.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this month, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced it would soon begin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">testing its own Clubhouse rival,</a> called Audio Spaces. The new product will allow Twitter users to gather in dedicated spaces for live conversations with another person or with groups of people. While the company showed off a handful of screenshots of the product at the time of the announcement, there were few specifics about how Audio Spaces would work. Now, we know a bit more about Audio Spaces&#8217; feature set, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1332703770535366659">some digging</a> by reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong.¬†</a></p>
<p>Wong enabled the private beta in the Twitter app and took screenshots that show how Audio Spaces and its features would look in action. Of course, these features could change before the feature later rolls out to the public, but it gives an idea about how Twitter is currently thinking about the product.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The images show that users will be able to apply the same sort of conversation controls <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/twitter-now-lets-everyone-limit-replies-to-their-tweets/">that are today available for tweets</a> to Audio Spaces, as well. This will allow users to configure their Audio Space to be open to anyone who wants to join, only to people they follow, or only to people they specifically invite to join.</p>
<p>Users can invite others to their Space in a number of ways, too, including via DM (direct message), by posting a tweet, or copying a link that can be shared elsewhere.</p>
<p>When joining a space, people will enter the space with their microphone disabled to limit noise. As the conversation progresses, they can react to what&#8217;s being said with a variety of emoji, like the &#8220;100,&#8221; raised hand, fist, peace sign, and waving hand.</p>
<p>In addition, the Audio Space&#8217;s creator will be able to adjust who can speak at any time after the dedicated room has been created. From an in-app menu, they&#8217;ll be able to manage the speakers, adjust other settings, view the rules, as well as share feedback or report the space, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2079579" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2079579" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2079579 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.30-PM.jpg?w=584" alt="" width="584" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.30-PM.jpg 1188w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.30-PM.jpg?resize=129,150 129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.30-PM.jpg?resize=258,300 258w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.30-PM.jpg?resize=768,895 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.30-PM.jpg?resize=584,680 584w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.30-PM.jpg?resize=43,50 43w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2079579" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1332703770535366659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jane Manchun Wong <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> /</p></div></p>
<p>One interesting finding is that Audio Spaces will include transcriptions of the chat, according to this menu. That&#8217;s a differentiating feature, compared with some other audio chat room services. While ostensibly a feature designed for accessibility, it could also prove useful in keeping the conversations appropriate and respectful, since users would know their words were being written down.</p>
<p>This could help address one issue with the private chat room model, where live conversations have proven to be hard to moderate. Despite being in an invite-only beta, Clubhouse, for example, already experienced a handful of incidents of moderation failure, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/8/21316172/clubhouse-content-moderation-taylor-lorenz-harassment-abuse?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">harassment of a New York Times reporter</a>¬†and another conversation that¬†<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495419/clubhouse-conversation-antisemitism-content-moderation">delved into anti-Semitism</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter, which has struggled for years to combat abuse on its platform, was a questionable place to be testing this unproven new format for online socializing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2079577" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2079577" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2079577 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.42-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="352" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.42-PM.jpg 1508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.42-PM.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.42-PM.jpg?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.42-PM.jpg?resize=768,397 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.42-PM.jpg?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-30-at-12.45.42-PM.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2079577" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1332703770535366659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jane Manchun Wong <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t clear how Twitter would be approach moderation for these audio chat rooms, but it appears the transcription feature could a deterrent to toxic speech while the in-app reporting feature allows for a more direct solution to problems that crop up. When users choose the &#8220;Report this Space&#8221; option, they can then choose to report across a variety of categories, including self-harm, violence, sexual content, child safety, private information or abusive behavior.</p>
<p>Because Audio Spaces is in private beta, testers will also have access to a &#8220;Share Feedback&#8221; option that allows them to DM the account @TwitterSpaces.</p>
<p>Wong also noted Audio Spaces is using Periscope for its backend, according to her digging in the app&#8217;s code.</p>
<p>Twitter earlier said Audio Spaces would be launching to a small group of users. During tests, those users would include a group of people who are &#8220;disproportionately impacted by abuse and harm on the platform: women and those from marginalized backgrounds,&#8221; Twitter Staff Product Designer Maya Gold Patterson had noted, when introducing the feature in a briefing for reporters this month.</p>
<p>Twitter hasn&#8217;t yet commented on Wong&#8217;s findings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Chairman of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-communications-commission" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-communications-commission">FCC, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ajit-pai" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ajit-pai">Ajit Pai, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has announced he will leave his position on January 20 as President-elect Biden is sworn in. Pai&#8217;s tenure has been a controversial one, and while he would almost certainly like to be remembered for his efforts to &#8220;bridge the digital divide,&#8221; as he was fond of saying, it is the dismantling of net neutrality that will be his legacy.</p>
<p>It is traditional at the FCC for the Chairman to leave when the administration changes parties. Pai took over when Tom Wheeler, who chaired the Commission at the end of the Obama years, resigned upon Trump&#8217;s election. The Biden administration has not announced its pick for the new leader of the communications agency.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-pai-announces-intent-depart-fcc-january">In an official FCC memo</a>, Pai thanked his colleagues and summarized the accomplishments of his four years at the helm (as, it must also be said, the first Commissioner of Asian descent):</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>Together, we‚Äôve delivered for the American people over the past four years: closing the digital divide; promoting innovation and competition, from 5G on the ground to broadband from space; protecting consumers; and advancing public safety.</p>
<p>I am proud of how productive this Commission has been, from commencing five spectrum auctions and two rural broadband reverse auctions in four years, to opening 1,245 megahertz of mid-band spectrum for unlicensed use, to adopting more than 25 orders through our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative, to aggressively protecting our communications networks from national security threats at home and abroad, to designating 988 as the three-digit number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and much, much more.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notably absent from that list is Pai&#8217;s unfortunate magnum opus and arguably the effort that got him the job: the elimination of 2015&#8217;s net neutrality rules. The tremendously dishonest and partisan campaign to overturn these popular and important curbs on broadband companies put a stink on Pai&#8217;s tenure at the outset that no amount of good work could wash out.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Sbc3xZdob9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/13/commission-impossible-part-two-how-enemies-gathered-around-net-neutrality/">Commission Impossible, part two: How enemies gathered around net neutrality</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For as always, the bulk of the FCC&#8217;s duties fly under the public&#8217;s radar, and a great deal of work <em>was</em> done under Pai, as under any other administration, invisibly and thanklessly. (Though in some cases less invisibly than before ‚Äî Pai&#8217;s FCC did make improvements to transparency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/06/fcc-admits-it-was-never-actually-hacked/">in some ways anyhow</a>.)</p>
<p>Surely Pai&#8217;s greatest priority was, as indeed he often stated, ameliorating the &#8220;digital divide&#8221; that prevents millions of Americans from enjoying affordable, fast internet. Numerous new programs and funds were created to improve this situation, but Pai was hampered by bad information ‚Äî <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/fccs-broadband-deployment-report-called-fundamentally-at-odds-with-reality/">essentially provided on the honor system</a> by ISPs themselves ‚Äî and the seemingly endless rollout of 5G, which we&#8217;re all still waiting on.</p>
<p>His final effort, alas, will not much improve the opinion of him at large. As Trump raged impotently about Section 230, a law that shields internet companies from liability for the actions of their users, Pai took up that flag and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/with-absurd-timing-fcc-announces-intention-to-revisit-section-230/">announced his intention to revisit and perhaps change the interpretation of it</a> ‚Äî a month before the election. The simpering, plainly political nature of the effort, almost certain now to be aborted entirely, attracted considerable criticism, makes for a poor final chapter in an already troubling story.</p>
<p>The next step for the FCC is the nomination and confirmation of a new Chairman and replacement Commissioners, and though several names have been floated by political insiders, no one has emerged yet as the heir apparent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today Facebook made one of its biggest plays yet to build services for the businesses on its platform: it has announced that it is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/kustomer-to-join-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring Kustomer</a>, a startup founded with the aim of disrupting the customer services industry with a new approach to providing agents with better data and a more unified pictures of users by bringing together the many social media and other channels and longer history between them and the company in question.</p>
<p>Terms are not being disclosed but sources are saying it&#8217;s in the region of $1 billion. Reports of the deal were published earlier today by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-nears-purchase-of-startup-in-deal-that-values-it-at-1-billion-11606750196?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WSJ</a>.</p>
<p>Kustomer &#8212; co-founded by CEO Brad Birnbaum and Jeremy Suriel (the two worked together across a range of other places, including Airtime and AOL and had sold a previous startup to Salesforce) &#8212; had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/kustomer-raises-60m-for-its-omnichannel-based-crm-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised around $174 million</a> in private funding from investors that included Coatue, Tiger Global Management, Battery Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Cisco Investments, Canaan Partners, Boldstart Ventures and Social Leverage. It was last valued at $710 million, according to estimates from <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/gs/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PitchBook</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s interest in Kustomer is very straightforward: the company has been slowly building up a big business providing customer services to businesses on its platform.</p>
<p>There are some 175 million people using Facebook this way today, covering both those who use Facebook to engage with businesses that use Facebook as their primary online &#8220;identity&#8221; &#8212; in place of a website or mobile app of their own, companies today often simply have a Page on Facebook &#8212; and those businesses that provide conversation channels on Facebook-owned messaging apps like Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp as a complement to other ways (and sometimes the sole way) to contact them.</p>
<p>Considering that Facebook has upwards of 2 billion users, 175 million doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot.</p>
<p>But as the company starts to see more keen competition from the likes of Snapchat, TikTok and likely others over time, having a better product to sell businesses alongside their other services will give Facebook a better way of locking them into the Facebook ecosystem. It will also give the company a stronger shot at a newer revenue stream to complement advertising, which remains its biggest cash cow by a big margin.</p>
<p>Indeed, customer service is an interesting play for Facebook to be making. The company has been investing in and building a number of additional features for businesses on its messaging apps &#8212; most recently on WhatsApp, for example, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/facebook-adds-hosting-shopping-features-and-pricing-tiers-to-whatsapp-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started to make it easier for businesses let people shop and do more on the app</a>. Within that customer service is a huge industry that stretches well beyond the Facebook walled garden.</p>
<p>Indeed, the specific term Kustomer and other CRM companies use to describe what it does is &#8220;omni-channel&#8221; customer relations. That is to say, it gives the Kustomer business users a complete picture of the many disparate places where &#8220;conversations&#8221; might be happening with customers &#8212; be it on apps, on social media, in websites, via chatbots, or email, etc. The logic is that this makes the agent more efficient and gives him/her a better picture of both how the business is faring across those channels, and more context about a specific user contacting the company from one of those channels, as well as a more complete picture of the customers themselves.</p>
<p>For Facebook, it&#8217;s &#8220;customer relations&#8221; profile up to now has been about users within its app walls. This gives it a much bigger opportunity to essentially control that bigger picture and bigger relationship, regardless of the platform being used.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, it was only earlier this month that I reported that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/snap-acquired-voca-ai-which-makes-ai-based-voice-agents-for-call-centers-for-120m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snap acquired Voca.ai</a>, which makes customer support voice bots.</p>
<p>While we have no idea how Snap will use that tech &#8212; some have speculated it could be to build more voice commands and audio-based tech for its Spectacles &#8212; I wrote at the time that it would make a lot of sense to bring this into a bigger product portfolio providing more tools to businesses already using Snapchat to market themselves. This Kustomer acquisition feels very timely in that regard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A French administration in charge of consumer rights and fraud has investigated on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wish" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wish">Wish, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the mobile e-commerce platform that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/wish-ipo/">recently filed to go public</a>. While the company generated $1.9 billion in revenue in 2019, the French administration believes Wish could be selling products, such as sneakers and perfumes, with images incorrectly showing the logos of famous brands.</p>
<p>In addition to those wrongly labeled products, the administration says Wish pretends products are on sale while they aren‚Äôt. The platform could be displaying -70%, -80% or -90% on some products even though the original price is completely made up.</p>
<p>The administration in charge of the investigation is the <em> direction g√©n√©rale de la concurrence, de la consommation et de la r√©pression des fraudes</em> (DGCCRF), an administration that reports to the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance. They have transmitted <a href="https://www.economie.gouv.fr/files/files/directions_services/dgccrf/presse/communique/2020/CP-DGCCRF-wish.pdf">the report</a> to a court in Paris.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, it‚Äôs up to the court to decide whether the allegations are right or unfounded. ‚ÄúThe court can subpoena Wish or offer to plead guilty. We should know in the coming days,‚Äù France‚Äôs digital minister C√©dric O told me.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/cedric_o/status/1333298201290530817">On Twitter</a>, C√©dric O highlighted one case in particular. ‚ÄúWish already stood out during the first lockdown by selling facemasks that don‚Äôt meet safety standards. French people who are using the app to find low-cost products should know that they‚Äôll mostly find scams,‚Äù he tweeted.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If Wish is found guilty, the company could risk up to 10% of its annual revenue in France. In particular, it‚Äôs going to be interesting to see whether Wish is responsible for products sold by third-party merchants.</p>
<p>The timing of the case is a bit odd as Europe‚Äôs upcoming Digital Services Act should overhaul the e-commerce directive from 2000. All eyes are on content moderation, but the Digital Services Act should also focus on counterfeit sellers, the liability of marketplaces and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thanksgiving and Black Friday online shopping this year had big gains on 2019, but both still fell somewhat short of expectations in what is proving to be a good if more muted holiday shopping season, without the usual physical crowds to help enforce Covid-19 social distancing and many feeling the economic strain of the health pandemic.</p>
<p>Now all eyes are on &#8220;Cyber Monday,&#8221; which has for the last several years has been the biggest online shopping day of the four-day stretch. Adobe predicts that it will be the biggest shopping day yet in the US, with between $10.8 billion and $12.7 billion spent, while Salesforce&#8217;s forecast is in the middle of that range, $11.8 billion. Globally, Salesforce believes the figure will be $46 billion.</p>
<p>Adobe figure of 40% of sales on smartphones has been relative steady all week. Shopify, which typically works with smaller merchants, has put the figure closer to 70%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For some context, Black Friday came in at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/black-friday-online-sales-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$9 billion</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/thanksgiving-on-track-for-a-record-6b-in-us-online-sales-says-adobe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanksgiving at $5.1 billion</a> this year according to Adobe&#8217;s figures. And last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/cyber-monday-on-track-to-deliver-9-4b-in-u-s-online-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$9.4 billion was spent on Cyber Monday 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Salesforce was <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/industries/retail/holiday-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more optimistic</a>: it said that digital revenues on Black Friday were $12.8 billion with global figures coming in at $62 billion, while Thanksgiving was closer to $6.8 billion in online sales in the US, with the global figure around $30.4 billion.</p>
<p>‚ÄúCyber Monday is on track to break all previous records for online sales. Consumers will likely take advantage of the best discounted items today like TVs, toys and computers before price levels start creeping back up throughout the rest of the season,&#8221; said Taylor Schreiner, director, Adobe Digital Insights. &#8220;Shoppers are encouraged to do their gift buying soon as shipping in time for Christmas will get more expensive in the coming weeks.‚Äù</p>
<p>We will continue to update these figures as we get more data in. Adobe, for example, said that it believes that a whopping 29% of today&#8217;s revenue will come only between 7pm and 11pm Pacific (after work is over for the day).</p>
<p>(Part of the disparity in the two companies&#8217; figures is based on methodology. Adobe bases its figures on 80 of the top 100 retailers in the US, covering some 1 trillion transactions. Salesforce is using data gleaned from its Commerce Cloud, covering billions of engagements and millions of social media conversations, which it then combines with further analytics in its Shopping Index.)</p>
<p>One thing that is clear from both companies is that Cyber Monday continues to be the biggest day of them all. Why? It&#8217;s a perfect storm: the big rush of sales for the holiday season are up, but everyone is back at work, so they shop online instead of in person. Hence, big numbers on Cyber Monday.</p>
<p>As with the other days of the long weekend, one thing that has been impacting sales numbers is the fact that sales are starting earlier and earlier, but Adobe said that many consumers still believe that big bargains are laid on for the specific day. Some of the most popular shopping categories have included computers (marked down 30% on average), toys (20% discount), appliances (21%) and electronics (26%).</p>
<p>Bigger businesses continue to reap the biggest spoils in online shopping &#8212; not least because they still provide the best range of delivery, pick-up and return options to consumers, which become an even bigger set of priorities as you move further away from more amenable early adopters and into the more general population and potentially less experienced online shoppers. The conversion rates for big retailers (over $1 billion in revenues annually) are typically 70% higher than for smaller businesses.</p>
<p>Still, small businesses have tried to spend years catching up, boosted by various startups and companies like Shopify building tools for them to &#8220;be like Amazon&#8221; in their fulfillment, delivery and other features. Adobe said that Small Business Saturday, the newest of the Thanksgiving shopping holidays, saw $4.7 billion spent, a record for the day and up 30.2% on 2019. And to underscore just how tough times are for small businesses, Adobe said that the money small businesses were bringing in online this year was a whopping 294% higher than an average day in October.</p>
<p>So far some $23.5 billion has been spent during the holiday weekend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.joinsalut.com/">Salut</a>, an app-based service that allows fitness trainers to host classes virtually, announced that it has raised $1.25 million in a new financing event. The round was led by <a href="https://twitter.com/chudson">Charles Hudson</a>, an investor at <a href="https://precursorvc.com/">Precursor Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Founder <a href="https://twitter.com/mjdipietro">Matthew DiPietro</a>, formerly of Twitch, told TechCrunch that Salut soft-launched in mid-September, with a wider release coming today.</p>
<p>DiPietro thought up the concept behind Salut before the pandemic hit, he said during an interview, but after COVID-19 appeared the idea took on new urgency. The company put together what DiPietro described as a no-code alpha version of the service in May to test the market, allowing the then-nascent startup to validate demand on both sides of its marketplace &#8212; it&#8217;s famously difficult to jumpstart two-sided marketplaces, as demand tends to follow supply, and vice-versa.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The test allowed the company to get to confidence on demand existing from both trainers and exercise fans, and in its initial economic model.</p>
<p>With the new round in the bank and its product now formally launched, it&#8217;s up to Salut to scale rapidly. The company currently has 55 registered trainers on its platform, a reasonable start for the seed-stage startup. It will need to grow that figure by a few orders of magnitude if it wants to generate enough revenue to reach an eventual Series A.</p>
<p>But Salut is not focused on early-revenue generation, taking no cut of trainer revenue today. Indeed, per an email the company sent out to its users this morning, the startup is passing along 100% of post-Apple income that trainers generate, or 85% of the gross.</p>
<p>Currently users can donate to, or tip, trainers that host classes. DiPietro told TechCrunch that subscription options are coming in a quarter or two. The startup also announced today that trainers can now allow their classes to be replayed, what the startup called one of its &#8220;most requested features.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/peloton-interactive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="peloton-interactive">Peloton <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> understands why this matters; only a fraction of classes on the Peloton ecosystem are live at any point in time, but the bike comes with a library of content that users can simply load up whenever they like. This also allows Peloton to release more niche content than it otherwise might, as even the heavy metal-themed rides can accrete a reasonable ridership over time (something they might not be able to manage if all classes on the platform were only live once and then gone forever).</p>
<p>DiPietro is bullish on building income streams for trainers, especially during a pandemic that has locked many gyms, leaving fitness processionals with little to no income in many cases.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some early signal that users are willing to pay, the company said, with early users willing to pay $5 or $10 for an hour of fitness training. And with a focus on the long-tail of trainers who can&#8217;t attract 10,000 fans to a single class, Salut thinks there are a large number of trainers who have enough pull to generate more income from its service, in time, than they could at a traditional studio.</p>
<p>Salut supports group video classes, of course, so trainers can collect monies from cohorts of users at a time.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s fundraising is largely earmarked for engineering, with the company having what its founder called an ambitious product roadmap.</p>
<p>The startup also announced a new project with <a href="https://www.fitnessmentors.com/">Fitness Mentors</a>, a company that helps trainers get certified, to create what the two companies are calling &#8220;the industry‚Äôs first Virtual Group Fitness Instructor (V-GFI) course and certification.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can see why Salut would want the certification to exist; its existence will allow users of its service to find trainers that are worth their time on its service, and may raise the overall level of quality of classes provided.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how far Salut can get with $1.25 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;We think of diversity as a keystone issue for the cannabis industry,&#8221; said Curio WMBE Fund managing director Jerel Registre in a conversation with TechCrunch. Registre&#8217;s conviction around this program is obvious as he explains the problem the fund is addressing.</p>
<p>The new fund, started by the Maryland-based medical cannabis company <a href="https://curiowellness.com">Curio Wellness</a>, aims to help underserved entrepreneurs entering the cannabis market. With $30 million to invest, the Curio WMBE Fund is looking to invest in up to 50 women, minority and <a href="https://rewirenewsgroup.com/article/2016/09/14/say-disabled-person-instead-person-disabilities/">disabled veterans</a> seeking to open and operate a Curio Wellness franchise with a path to 100% ownership in three years.</p>
<p>Registre tells TechCrunch the goal is to create more diverse ownership through a proven business model. Participants of this program gain access to capital and operational resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Curio made a name for itself in Maryland, where it&#8217;s the largest cannabis cultivator by market share. Founded in 2014, the family-owned business operates dispensaries rooted in a patient-centric approach. While a legally separate but affiliated entity from Curio Wellness, the Curio WMBE Fund aims to give franchisees access to Curio&#8217;s secret sauce.</p>
<p>&#8220;In looking at the systemic barriers that women, minorities and disabled veterans face in accessing capital, we decided to develop a solution that directly addresses this massive economic disparity,&#8221; said Michael Bronfein, CEO of Curio Wellness. &#8220;The Fund provides qualifying entrepreneurs with the investment capital they need to become a Curio Wellness Center franchisee while ensuring their success through our best in class business operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s bottle the success we have,&#8221; Registre added. He likens the franchise model to McDonald&#8217;s, where the national corporation gives operators a proven standard operating procedure and ongoing support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our fund is unlike any other in the industry,&#8221; Registre said, &#8220;as eligible entrepreneurs will have a clear path to 100% ownership in as little as three years. Many other funds rely on a model that utilizes minority entrepreneurs as a vehicle to achieve licenses: The Curio approach flips this model by empowering diverse entrepreneurs and supporting them along the way. If something happens and an investment-funded franchisee defaults, they must be replaced by another minority or woman owner. This ensures these licensees can get the financial support they need to launch while ensuring that the fund&#8217;s ultimate mission of supporting diverse entrepreneurs is achieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Registre explained that diversity is central to Curio Wellness, too. Of the company&#8217;s 200 employees, 40% are female, and more than half are minorities. At the leadership level, 38% of management is female, and 44% identify as a member of a minority community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diversity is a core asset that we recognize as integral to our success and our future, and that is why we decided to create this investment fund,&#8221; Registre said.</p>
<p>The fund provides two phases of support. The first provides capital to franchisees to open their Curio Wellness Center and assist them in obtaining licenses, selecting a location and hiring and training employees. Once the location is operational, the fund intends to provide ongoing support around managing, sales and marketing, store operations, and ensuring employees stay updated on product information.</p>
<p>Curio sees its locations as more than cannabis dispensaries. The company calls them Wellness Centers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curio locations go beyond the traditional experience people have at a medical cannabis dispensary &#8212; they are total wellness destinations, under the leadership of a licensed pharmacist,&#8221; Registre explains. &#8220;Patient wellness is at the center of everything we do and is exemplified by a diverse array of holistic health products, services and educational programming we offer. While additive to the medical cannabis patient experience, these features open the store up to the entire community, not limiting the healthcare experience to only those with a medical cannabis card. This practice, of a patient-first mindset through a pharmacist-led model, allows us to truly lead the pursuit of wellness for everyone who walks in the front door.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of writing, the fund has raised half of its $30 million target. The company says the fund intentionally targeted, pitched and secured an investment pool that includes women and minorities. The fund expects to close by the end of 2020, and applications are expected to open in early 2021.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>For all my American readers, I hope you&#8217;re happy and satiated from the Thanksgiving holiday in this oddest of years. My hope for all Station readers, no matter where you reside, is a safe and healthy remainder of the year (and beyond!). While I took some time off last week, the news wheel kept on turning. A few of items got my attention last week, notably an EY study that examined how views on public transit, mobility as a service and car ownership are changing due to COVID-19. Let&#8217;s get reading!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Lime is adding another 1,000 scooters in San Francisco, an action it is able to take because the company also holds Jump&#8217;s permit in the city. For those who might have forgotten, Lime now owns Jump through a complex deal with Uber.</p>
<p>The company also released San Francisco scooter ridership data that shows how trip start and ends have moved outside of the downtown core and into neighborhoods like the Mission, Castro and Hayes Valley. Lime said this changing ridership pattern is consistent with its findings across the country, with more trips moving to residential neighborhoods since the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the globe.</p>

<p>Another day, another SPAC. Anyone else looking forward to a good old fashioned S-1 filing?</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/metromile" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="metromile">Metromile, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the pay-per-mile auto insurer, is credited for disrupting some of the inefficiencies of the auto insurance business model, notably how consumers are charged. Instead of a standard flat fee, the company charges customers based on their mileage, which it is able to measure via a device plugged into the vehicle.</p>
<p>That sounds like the kind of business model that might see an uptick in new customers during COVID pandemic times. And that did eventually happen. However, during the space between existing customers reducing their driving time and new drivers signing up with Metromile, the company was forced to lay off about one-third of its workforce.</p>
<p>The company has since recovered and now it&#8217;s taking the¬†SPAC path to the public markets. Metromile plans to merge with special purpose acquisition company INSU Acquisition Corp. II, with an equity valuation of $1.3 billion. The company raised $160 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, in an investment round led by Chamath Palihapitiya&#8217;s firm Social Capital.</p>
<p>Metromile plans to use those proceeds to reduce existing debt and accelerate growth, specifically to hire employees to support its consumer insurance and enterprise businesses, and grow beyond its eight-state geographic footprint to a goal of 21 states by the end of next year and nationwide coverage by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>For details on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pay-per-mile-auto-insurer-metromile-is-heading-to-public-markets-via-spac/">Metromile SPAC</a> head on over to my story.

<h3><strong>Another giant deal¬†</strong></h3>
<p>Manbang ‚Äî described as the Chinese Uber for trucks ‚Äî was formed in 2017 through a merger between rivals Yunmanman and Huochebang. The company&#8217;s app¬†matches truck drivers and merchants transporting cargo and provides financial services to truckers.</p>
<p>Apparently, investors can&#8217;t get enough of these kinds of freight app businesses. Manbang is the latest example with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/manbang-1-7-billion-funding/">$1.7 billion haul</a> from Softbank Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital China, Permira and Fidelity, a consortium that co-led the round. Other participants were Hillhouse Capital, GGV Capital, Lightspeed China Partners, Tencent, Jack Ma&#8217;s YF Capital and more.</p>
<p>This is just two years after the company raised $1.9 billion. Manbang said it achieved profitability this year. Its valuation was reportedly on course to reach $10 billion in 2018.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s raining dollars!</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1996432" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1996432" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1996432 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/GettyImages-1236085488.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1996432" class="wp-caption-text">¬†Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>For <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re all aware, but in case you missed it, Tesla&#8217;s market cap surpassed $500 billion last week. As of today (Monday), it sits at $547 billion ‚Äî a more than fivefold increase since the start of the year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely that price will push higher thanks to its imminent inclusion on the S&amp;P 500 Index.¬†When Tesla joins the S&amp;P 500 on December 21, it will be among the most valuable companies on the benchmark. Its weighting will be so influential that the S&amp;P DJI is mulling whether to add the stock at the full float-adjusted market capitalization weight all at once or in two tranches.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s addition to the S&amp;P 500 isn&#8217;t just a symbolic nod. Joining the S&amp;P 500 has real financial benefits, as investors that have index-tracked funds will be forced to buy shares. With share prices already popping, that will mean investors will have to sell other stocks to make room for Tesla.</p>
<h2>The rise of the car</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s nearing December, which means I&#8217;ve been ‚Äî and will continue to be ‚Äî flooded with year-end surveys, studies and forecasts for 2021.</p>
<p>One study from EY, which <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/automotive-transportation/how-mobility-can-help-build-a-better-post-covid-19-world">examined data from nine countries</a>, suggests that mobility as a service (MaaS) is losing momentum to the car, truck and SUV.</p>
<p>And millennials are driving the trend. The 2020 EY Mobility Consumer Index, which surveyed more than 3,300 consumers across nine countries, found that 31% of people without a car intend to buy one in the next six months with 45% of those will be millennials. The study also found that just 6% of non-car owners surveyed are looking to buy an all-electric vehicle.</p>
<p>More than three-quarters (78%) of respondents said they&#8217;re going to be more likely to use their cars for travel in a post-pandemic world with millennials making more than half of that number (52%), according to EY.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just a U.S. phenomenon. Respondents from Italy (47%) and Germany (46%) said they&#8217;re more likely to purchase a new car. Respondents from China were most likely to increase their car usage (90% of respondents), closely followed by India (85%) and Germany (81%).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, public transport use is expected to decline by around 30%.</p>
<p>John Simlett, EY Global Future of Mobility Leader, raises several questions in the study.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With more people buying cars and car usage expected to increase, this leaves policymakers with some very difficult questions to answer: How to accommodate all these cars on our roads aim for a more diverse mobility mix? How will this trend impact public transport investment? Quite simply, is this sustainable, and if not, what needs to be done and by whom?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Readers: what are your answers? Send them my way.</strong></p>
<h2>Notable reads and other tidbits</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2037863 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png" alt="the-station-delivery" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>And finally, the news smorgasbord you&#8217;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>Ford&#8217;s</strong> all-electric Mustang Mach-E has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/the-epa-says-the-ford-mustang-mach-es-electric-range-is-a-lackluster-211-300-miles/">estimated EPA range</a> of between 211 miles to 300 miles, depending on the model. While the Mach-E matched Ford&#8217;s range target, it&#8217;s well under that found in competing vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Gatik</strong>, the autonomous vehicle startup focused on the &#8220;middle mile,&#8221; is expanding into Canada through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/gatiks-self-driving-box-trucks-to-shuttle-groceries-for-loblaw-in-canada/">partnership with retail giant Loblaw</a>. The company, which also announced $25 million in fresh funding, already uses its self-driving box trucks to deliver customer online grocery orders for Walmart.</p>
<p>Gatik is deploying five autonomous box trucks in Toronto to deliver goods for Loblaw starting in January 2021. The fleet will be used seven days a week on five routes along public roads. All vehicles will have a safety driver as a co-pilot. This deployment, which follows a 10-month pilot in the Toronto area, marks the first autonomous delivery fleet in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>General Motors</strong> changed sides in a battle over whether states &#8212; and specifically California &#8212; can set tailpipe emissions regulations and other rules meant to mitigate climate change that are stricter than the federal government. The automaker said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/gm-dumps-trump-to-side-with-california-in-emissions-rules-fight/">no longer back the Trump administration&#8217;s lawsuit</a> to prevent California from setting its own rules.</p>
<p><strong>May Mobility</strong>, the autonomous shuttle startup backed by Toyota, has a new partnership with on-demand shuttle platform Via. (I missed this item in the last newsletter). The aim is for the companies to combine their expertise to expand services to new cities in 2021. May Mobility will use Via&#8217;s fleet platform for booking, routing, passenger and vehicle assignment and identification, customer experience, and fleet management of its autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p><strong><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ola" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ola">Ola</strong>, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Uber and other ride-hailing firms in India will be only able draw a fee of up to 20% on ride fares. The new rules are¬† a setback for the SoftBank-backed firms, which are already struggling to improve their finances in the key overseas market.</p>
<p>The guidelines, which for the first time bring modern-age app-based ride-hailing firms under a regulatory framework in the country, also put a cap on the so-called surge pricing, the fare Uber and Ola charge during hours when their services see peak demands, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/india-sets-rules-for-commissions-surge-pricing-for-uber-and-ola/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Manish Singh reports</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cred-6ab0" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cred-6ab0">CRED, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a two-year-old startup that is helping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/india-cred-kunal-shah/">credit card users in India improve their financial behaviour</a>, has raised $80 million in a new financing round, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The new financing round, a Series C for <a href="https://www.cred.club/">CRED</a>, was led by existing investor DST Global. Much of the round &#8212; in fact, if not all &#8212; has been financed by existing investors, including Sequoia Capital and Ribbit Capital, that are doubling down on Kunal Shah‚Äôs startup, the source said on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak to the media.</p>
<p>The new round gives CRED a post-money valuation of about $800 million, the source said. That&#8217;s up from about $450 million valuation that CRED attained after its $120 million Series B round last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A CRED spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
<p>On CRED, customers are offered a range of features, including the ability to better track their spending across various credit cards, and get reminders. Moreover, CRED incentivizes customers to pay their bill on time by rewarding them points, which they can use to subscribe to a range of premium services and get a discount on purchase of high-quality products.</p>
<p>The platform is not available to all credit card holders in India. The startup requires a customer to have a certain credit score &#8212; about 750 &#8212; to be able to sign up for the service. This way, CRED has built a customer base that comprises some of the most sought-after people in India.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CRED is 2 years old now. As a founder it‚Äôs a privilege to build a missionary company with immense support from the whole ecosystem. I am eternally grateful to everyone who‚Äôs helped us become better everyday.</p>
<p>We are far from perfect, but heading in the right direction. Thank you.</p>
<p>&mdash; Kunal Shah (@kunalb11) <a href="https://twitter.com/kunalb11/status/1331832025418850304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In recent quarters, CRED has introduced a number of additional services, including allowing customers to pay their rent using their credit card, and bulked up its e-commerce store. What other ways Shah, who previously ran mobile wallet service Freecharge and is celebrated for delivering one of the few successful exits in the nation&#8217;s 15-year-old startup ecosystem, wants to serve these customers remains a big question.</p>
<p>&#8220;CRED has the richest Indians as customers already,&#8221; <a href="https://hind.substack.com/p/cred-unicorn-or-popcorn">wrote</a> Anmol Maini, a San Francisco-based engineer, who closely tracks the Indian startup ecosystem. &#8220;Kunal Shah has the luxury of time for building CRED into the company he envisions it to be. He has that luxury because he has access to capital and talent, knows how to build and scale companies and he definitely knows how to generate returns for his investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funds come at a time when CRED is enjoying a surge in its growth. The startup, which was one of the sponsors of the recently concluded IPL cricket tournament, ran a number of clever and fun advertisements during the tournament featuring Indian legends. And those ads worked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A couple of years ago, French President <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/emmanuel-macron" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/50-tech-ceos-come-to-paris-to-talk-about-tech-for-good/">initiated</a> the Tech for Good Summit by inviting 50 tech CEOs to discuss the challenges in the tech industry and make some announcements.</p>
<p>Usually, tech CEOs meet ahead of <a href="https://vivatechnology.com">Viva Technology</a>, a tech event in Paris. This year, Viva Technology had to be canceled, which means that tech CEOs couldn‚Äôt get together, take a group photo and say that they want to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>In the meantime, dozens of tech CEOs have chosen to sign a common pledge. Despite the positive impact of some technological breakthroughs, they collectively recognize that everything is not perfect with the tech industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚ÄúRecognizing that such progress may be hindered by negative externalities, including unfair competition such as abuse of dominant or systemic position, and fragmentation of the internet; that, without appropriate safeguards, technology can also be used to threaten fundamental freedoms and human rights or weaken democracy; that, unless we implement appropriate measures to combat it, some individuals and organizations inevitably use it for criminal purposes, including in the context of conflicts,‚Äù the pledge says.</p>
<p>Among other things, companies that sign the pledge agree to cooperate when it comes to fighting toxic content, such as child sexual abuse material and terrorist content. They promise to ‚Äúresponsibly address hate speech, disinformation and opinion manipulation.‚Äù</p>
<p>Interestingly, they also agree that they should ‚Äúcontribute fairly to the taxes in countries where [they] operate.‚Äù This has been an ongoing issue between the French government and the U.S. government. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD">OECD</a> and the European Union have also discussed implementing a tax on tech giants so that they report to tax authorities in each country where they operate.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VRmce2UwcF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/france-starts-collecting-tax-on-tech-giants/">France starts collecting tax on tech giants</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;France starts collecting tax on tech giants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/france-starts-collecting-tax-on-tech-giants/embed/#?secret=VRmce2UwcF" data-secret="VRmce2UwcF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Other commitments mention privacy, social inclusiveness, diversity and equity, fighting all sorts of discriminations and more. As the name suggests, the pledge revolves around using technology for good things.</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs talk about who signed the pledge. There are some well-known names, such as Sundar Pichai from Alphabet (Google), Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook, Brad Smith from Microsoft, Evan Spiegel from Snap and Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square. Other companies include Cisco, Deliveroo, Doctolib, IBM, OpenClassrooms, Uber, etc.</p>
<p>Some nonprofit organizations also signed the pledge, such as the Mozilla Foundation, Simplon, Tech for Good France, etc.</p>
<p>But it‚Äôs more interesting to see who‚Äôs <em>not</em> on the list. Amazon and Apple have chosen not to sign the pledge. There have been discussions with Apple but the company eventually chose not to participate.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAmazon didn‚Äôt want to sign it and I invite you to ask them directly,‚Äù a source close to the French president said. The French government is clearly finger-pointing in Amazon‚Äôs case.</p>
<p>This is an odd move as it‚Äôs a non-binding pledge. You can say that you want to ‚Äúcontribute fairly to taxes‚Äù and then argue that you‚Äôre paying everything that you owe ‚Äî tax optimization is not tax evasion, after all. Worse, you can say that you‚Äôre building products with ‚Äúprivacy by design‚Äù in mind while you‚Äôre actually building entire companies based on personalized ads and micro-targeting.</p>
<p>In other words, the Tech for Good Summit was created for photo opportunities (like the photo from 2018 below). Tech CEOs want to be treated like heads of state, while Macron wants to position himself as a tech-savvy president. It‚Äôs a win-win for them, and a waste of time for everyone else.</p>
<p>Some nonprofit organizations and governance groups are actually working hard to build digital commons. But big tech companies are using the same lexicon with these greenwashing-style campaigns.</p>
<p>In 2018, hundreds of organizations signed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/12/with-the-paris-call-macron-wants-to-limit-cyberattacks/">the Paris Call</a>. In 2019, the biggest social media companies signed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/world-leaders-ask-tech-giants-to-tackle-toxic-content-with-christchurch-call/">the Christchurch Call</a>. And now, we have the Tech for Good Call. Those calls can‚Äôt replace proper regulation.</p>

		Mathew is Head of Mobility and Automotive at the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>, where he develops strategy and solutions around the use of data with distributed ledger technology-based innovations. These solutions focus on enabling flexible and privacy-centric data and value transfer within the public sector for use in smart cities, critical infrastructure, environmental and energy systems, and mobility-focused data industries.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In the United States, critical city, state and federal infrastructure is falling behind. While heavy investment, planning and development have gone into the U.S. infrastructure system, much of it is not keeping up with the pace of new technology, and some of it hasn&#8217;t had a proper update in decades, instead just adding new systems onto old systems. This can be allotted to a combination of liability structures in the U.S., difficulty in enabling interconnection between infrastructure in different jurisdictions, worry over introducing large-scale security risks and an attempt to mitigate that risk.</p>
<p>There is interest in upgrading city systems to be more efficient, to be more in line with real-time demand and to move into the 21st century, but it&#8217;s going to take work. It&#8217;s also going to take new technology.</p>
<p>Distributed ledger technology (DLT), when applied correctly, can do for a city&#8217;s infrastructure what existing technologies cannot. Where existing technologies are heavy, requiring expensive servers and a larger energy draw, distributed ledger technology is light and can be implemented on individual nodes (code environments) and directly onto things like traffic light sensors. It also allows for more oversight from a privacy perspective. The ability to bring distributed ledger technology into lightweight frameworks allows for more security and upgrades to critical infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Benefits of smart infrastructure</h2>
<p>The biggest impact of smart infrastructure is that it enables local governments to focus on the reason they‚Äôre there in the first place; to increase the quality of life of the local residents, bring stability and culture to local businesses, and create a welcoming and frictionless environment for tourists or visitors. Governments can create stability, streamline sources of revenue, and integrate a frictionless operational environment for people and organizations in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Consider transportation infrastructure. A lot of revenue in cities and states comes from things like tolls and roadside parking, and of course taxes. States control the highways, interstates, and tolling infrastructure commonly through collaboration with service providers. Cities control the local roadside and passthrough streets and the revenue accrued through parking solutions. With the pandemic, these resources have dried up due to people staying at home, social distancing, using less public transit and working remotely.</p>
<p>This now offers an opportunity for an expanded example of the desire to understand the transportation flow. If cities had more real time insights into this, they&#8217;d be able to understand the demand and have a more fluidly flowing traffic condition. This can be done through new technologies such as what are seen deployed in Singapore like green link determinings systems, parking guidance systems, and expressway monitoring systems allowing for enhanced traffic awareness and guidance.</p>
<p>There are also keen ways to incentivize traffic guidance while bringing stability to local small and medium businesses throughout cities such as using parking guidance systems to enable local businesses to offer discounts for parking nearby.</p>
<p>An open transportation grid (in the sense of data points gathered for streamlining and managing) can create smoother traffic patterns in cities with smaller road grids. Transportation centers could communicate with delivery services, understanding their routes and setting up parking reservation windows. Traffic flow could be managed so that delivery services are able to get in and out without causing back-ups on tight, busy roads.</p>
<p>Another offering of smart infrastructure can be seen with cross border connections for transportation of goods and services. The ownership of infrastructure in the U.S. is highly fragmented; with cities owning local and neighborhood roadsides, and states owning highways and interstates. This also means that the infrastructure supporting this is highly distributed, because each entity has to have it‚Äôs own systems in place to support their infrastructure, typically using different solutions, services and data structures.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/deepmind" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="deepmind">DeepMind, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the AI technology company that&#8217;s part of Google parent Alphabet, has achieved a significant breakthrough in AI-based protein structure prediction. The company announced today that its AlphaFold system has officially solved a protein folding grand challenge that has flummoxed the scientific community for 50 years. The advance inn DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold capabilities could lead to a significant leap forward in areas like our understanding of disease, as well as future drug discovery and development.</p>
<p>The test that AlphaFold passed essentially shows that the AI can correctly figure out, to a very high degree of accuracy (accurate to within the width of an atom, in fact), the structure of proteins in just days ‚Äì a very complex task that is crucial to figuring out how diseases can be best treated, as well as solving other big problems like working out how best to break down ecologically dangerous material like toxic waste. You may have heard of &#8216;Folding@Home,&#8217; the program that allows people to contribute their own home computing (and formerly, game console) processing power to protein folding experiments. That massive global crowdsourcing effort was necessary because using traditional methods, portion folding prediction takes years and is extremely expensive in terms of straight cost, and computing resources.</p>
<p>DeepMind&#8217;s approach involves using an &#8220;Attentionb-basd neural network system&#8221; (basically a neural network that can focus on specific inputs in order to increase efficiency). It&#8217;s able to continually refine its own predictive graph of possible protein folding outcomes based on their folding history, and provide highly accurate predictions as a result.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>How proteins fold ‚Äì or go from being a random string of amino acids when originally created, to a complex 3D structure in their final stable form ‚Äì is key to understanding how diseases are transmitted, as well as how common conditions like allergies work. If you understand the folding process, you can potentially alter it, halting an infection&#8217;s progress mid-stride, or conversely, correct mistakes in folding that can lead to neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.</p>
<p>DeepMind&#8217;s technological leap could make accurately predicting these folds a much less time- and resource-consuming process, which could dramatically change the pace at which our understanding of diseases and therapeutics progresses. This could come in handy to address major global threats including future potential pandemics like the COVID-19 crisis we&#8217;re currently enduring, by predicting viral protein structures to a high degree of accuracy early in the appearance fo any new future threats like SARS-CoV-2, thus speeding up the development of potential effective treatments and vaccines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rumors ignited last Thursday that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">Salesforce had interest in Slack</a>. This morning, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/salesforce-deal-to-buy-slack-expected-to-be-announced-tomorrow.html">CNBC is reporting</a> the deal is all but done and will be announced tomorrow. Chances are, this is going to a big number, but this won&#8217;t be Salesforce&#8217;s first big acquisition. We thought it would be useful in light of these rumors to look back at the company&#8217;s biggest deals.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/how-salesforce-beat-its-own-target-to-reach-20b-run-rate-ahead-of-schedule/">already surpassed $20 billion in annual revenue</a>, and the company has a history of making a lot of deals to fill in the road map and give it more market lift as it searches for ever more revenue.</p>
<p>The biggest deal by far so far was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-buying-data-visualization-company-tableau-for-15-7b-in-all-stock-deal/">the $15.7 billion Tableau acquisition</a> last year. The deal gave Salesforce a missing data visualization component and a company with a huge existing market to feed the revenue beast. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/how-salesforce-beat-its-own-target-to-reach-20b-run-rate-ahead-of-schedule/">In an interview in August</a> with TechCrunch, Salesforce president and chief operating officer Bret Taylor (who came to the company in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">$750 million Quip deal in 2016</a>), sees Tableau as a key part of the company&#8217;s growing success:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúTableau is so strategic, both from a revenue and also from a technology strategy perspective,‚Äù he said. That‚Äôs because as companies make the shift to digital, it becomes more important than ever to help them visualize and understand that data in order to understand their customers‚Äô requirements better.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Next on the Salesforce acquisition hit parade was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">the $6.5 billion Mulesoft acquisition in 2018</a>. Mulesoft gave Salesforce access to something it didn&#8217;t have as an enterprise SaaS company &#8212; data locked in silos across the company, even in on-prem applications. The CRM giant could leverage Mulesoft to access data wherever it lived, and when you put the two mega deals together, you could see how you could visualize that data and also give more fuel to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/19/salesforce-einstein-celebrates-its-first-birthday-with-a-couple-of-new-features/">Einstein intelligence layer</a>.</p>

<p>In 2013, the company made its first billion dollar acquisition when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/with-exacttarget-acquisition-salesforce-com-has-spent-close-to-3-5-billion-to-get-into-the-chief-marketing-officers-suite/">it bought ExactTarget for $2.5 billion</a>. This represented the first foray into what would become the Marketing Cloud. The purchase gave the company entree into the targeted email marketing business, which again would grow increasingly in importance in 2020 when communicating with customers became crucial during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Last year, just days after closing the Mulesoft acquisition, Salesforce opened its wallet one more time and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/salesforce-is-acquiring-clicksoftware-for-1-35b/">paid $1.35 billion for ClickSoftware</a>. This one was a nod to the company&#8217;s Service cloud, which encompasses both customer service and field service. This acquisition was about the latter, and giving the company access to a bigger body of field service customers.</p>

<p>The final billion deal (until we hear about <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> perhaps) is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/salesforce-grabs-vlocity-for-1-33b-a-startup-with-1b-valuation/">$1.33 billion Vlocity acquisition</a> earlier this year. This one was a gift for the core CRM product. Vlocity gave Salesforce several vertical businesses built on the Salesforce platform and was a natural fit for the company. Using Vlocity&#8217;s platform, Salesforce could (and did) continue to build on these vertical markets giving it more ammo to sell into specialized markets.</p>
<p>While we can&#8217;t know for sure if the Slack deal will happen, it sure feels like it will, and chances are this deal will be even larger than Tableau as the Salesforce acquisition machine keeps chugging along.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>, the SQL streaming database startup built on top of the open-source <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/timely-dataflow">Timely Dataflow</a> project, announced a $32 million Series B investment led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Lightspeed Ventures.</p>
<p>While it was at it, the company also announced a previously unannounced $8 million Series A from last year, led by Lightspeed, bringing the total raised to $40 million.</p>
<p>These firms see a solid founding team that includes CEO Arjun Narayan, formerly of Cockroach Labs, and chief scientist Frank McSherry, who created the Timely Dataflow project on which the company is based.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Narayan says that the company believes fundamentally that every company needs to be a real-time company, and it will take a streaming database to make that happen. Further, he says the company is built using SQL because of its ubiquity, and the founders wanted to make sure that customers could access and make use of that data quickly without learning a new query language.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is really to help any business to understand streaming data and build intelligent applications without using or needing any specialized skills. Fundamentally what that means is that you&#8217;re going to have to go to businesses using the technologies and tools that they understand, which is standard SQL,&#8221; Narayan explained.</p>
<p>Bucky Moore, the partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kleiner-perkins-caufield-byers" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kleiner-perkins-caufield-byers">Kleiner Perkins <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> leading the B round, sees this standard querying ability as a key part of the technology. &#8220;As more businesses integrate streaming data into their decision-making pipelines, the inability to ask questions of this data with ease is becoming a non-starter. Materialize&#8217;s unique ability to provide SQL over streaming data solves this problem, laying the foundation for them to build the industry&#8217;s next great data platform,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>They would naturally get compared to <a href="https://www.confluent.io/">Confluent</a>, a streaming database built on top of the <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> open-source streaming database project, but Narayan says his company uses straight SQL for querying, while Confluent uses its own flavor.</p>
<p>The company still is working out the commercial side of the house and currently provides a typical service offering for paying customers with support and a service agreement (SLA). The startup is working on a SaaS version of the product, which it expects to release some time next year.</p>

<p>They currently have 20 employees with plans to double that number by the end of next year as they continue to build out the product. As they grow, Narayan says the company is definitely thinking about how to build a diverse organization.</p>
<p>He says he&#8217;s found that hiring in general has been challenging during the pandemic, and he hopes that changes in 2021, but he says that he and his co-founders are looking at the top of the hiring funnel because otherwise, as he points out, it&#8217;s easy to get complacent and rely on the same network of people you have been working with before, which tends to be less diverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;The KPIs and the metrics we really want to use to ensure that we really are putting in the extra effort to ensure a diverse sourcing in your hiring pipeline and then following that through all the way through the funnel. That&#8217;s I think the most important way to ensure that you have a diverse [employee base], and I think this is true for every company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While he is working remotely now, he sees having multiple offices with a headquarters in NYC when the pandemic finally ends. Some employees will continue to work remotely, with the majority coming into one of the offices.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to¬†<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch‚Äôs venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest big news, chats about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter¬†<a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a>¬†and myself¬†<a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> ‚Äî and don‚Äôt forget to check out last Thursday&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/equity-dive-edtechs-2020-wakeup-call/">edtech deep dive from our own Natasha Mascarenhas</a>.</p>
<p>Right, now through the first of America&#8217;s national Q4 feast days, it&#8217;s time to get back to business. Namely, the business of VC and startups. Here&#8217;s what we got into this morning:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s Cyber Monday, which means that the internet is going to be annoying today, but the fake-holiday is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/black-friday-2020-live-updates.html">boosting e-commerce players like Etsy</a>. That should be good news for payments processors incumbent and startup, as well as other e-commerce businesses, again large, small and even platform-focused.</li>
<li>Zappos founder Tony Hsieh <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/tony-hsieh-iconic-las-vegas-tech-entrepreneur-dies-aged-46/">passed away this weekend</a>. It was a surprise. He was loved.</li>
<li>The U.K. is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-30/u-k-unveils-5g-plan-banning-huawei-installations-from-september?sref=gni836kR">banning China&#8217;s Huawei 5G gear next year</a> as <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorWong/status/1333274509076353024">Australia condemns China over a different matter</a>. So if you are keeping tally of countries where Chinese tech may no longer be welcome, the list is certainly longer than merely India, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/india-bans-another-43-chinese-apps/">banned all popular China-built apps from its mobile phones</a>.</li>
<li>These broader tensions are <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/grab-defence-grabs-big-hit">changing where VCs are investing their money</a>, notably.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/primed-for-accel/">Primer, the fintech helping merchants consolidate the payments stack, raises ¬£14 million Series A</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/hungrypanda-raises-70m-for-a-food-delivery-app-aimed-at-overseas-chinese-consumers/">HungryPanda raises $70 million for a food delivery app aimed at overseas Chinese consumers</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/29/firstminute-capital-launches-second-111-fund-featuring-a-whos-who-of-founders-as-lps/">Firstminute Capital launches second $111M fund, featuring a who‚Äôs-who of founders as LPs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, we are heading into a deluge of IPOs over the next few weeks. So strap in, it&#8217;s going to be messy and fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520304953/d752207ds1a.htm">filed a new S-1 document</a>, this time updating the market about the price it expects to command during its public offering. The food-delivery giant gave a range of $75 to $85 per share, which would revalue the company sharply higher <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/">than its final private price</a>, set during a June Series H that valued DoorDash at $16 billion.</p>
<p>The company intends to sell 33 million shares, raising between $2.475 billion and $2.805 billion in the process. Notably, there are no shares set aside for its underwriting banks to buy at its IPO price.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>After the public offering, DoorDash expects to have 317,656,521 shares outstanding across various classes, giving it a valuation of between $23.8 billion and $27 billion at the two extremes of its IPO range, not counting shares that have not yet vested or are set aside for future employee compensation. CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/doordash-ipo-seeks-valuation-of-up-to-30-billion.html">calculates</a> that the company could be worth up to $32 billion on a fully diluted basis.</p>

<p>What matters more than the raw dollar amounts, however, is what we can learn from them. Let&#8217;s get into the guts of the valuation range and find out if it&#8217;s bullish or if we should anticipate DoorDash to raise its range before it goes public.</p>
<h2>Valuations, ranges</h2>
<p>The new DoorDash S-1/A filing doesn&#8217;t appear to contain new financial information, so we can keep <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/doordash-files-to-go-public/">our prior notes</a> on the company&#8217;s health and performance in mind. Recall that we were generally impressed by DoorDash&#8217;s growth and its improving profitability.</p>
<p>Other on-demand food services are doing well: HungryPanda <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/hungrypanda-raises-70m-for-a-food-delivery-app-aimed-at-overseas-chinese-consumers/">just raised $70 million</a>, and on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/ubers-delivery-business-is-now-larger-than-ride-hailing/">the back of Uber Eats&#8217; growth</a>, and optimism that its ride-hailing business will return with the market-readiness of strong COVID-19 vaccines, shares of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are at all-time highs.</p>
<p>So you can taste the optimism that DoorDash is riding as it looks to list. Given our take, you would be forgiven for presuming that DoorDash is targeting an aggressive price.</p>
<p>Is it?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM is backing away from an agreement to take a stake in electric automaker Nikola Corp., marking the collapse of a deal that has been problematic since it was announced just two months ago.</p>
<p>Nikola shares were down 24.75% as of 11:12 am ET Monday morning.</p>
<p>GM has instead signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding to supply Nikola with its Hydrotec fuel cell system. This supplier agreement replaces its previous transaction announcement made on September 8, 2020 to take an 11% stake in Nikola and produce a fuel cell pickup for the company by the end 2022. The investment was valued at $2 billion at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speculation that GM would pull the plug on the deal has been rampant almost from the start. Just days after GM announced the investment, noted short-seller Hindenburg Research accused Nikola of fraud. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/sec-to-investigate-short-sellers-claims-against-nikola-report-says/">opened an inquiry</a> in the matter and within two weeks Nikola&#8217;s founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/nikolas-chairman-steps-down-stock-crashes-following-allegations-of-fraud/">Trevor Milton had stepped down</a> as executive chairman.</p>

<p>Stephen Girsky, a former General Motors executive who was already on the company‚Äôs board and who introduced Nikola to GM, took over as executive chairman.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Nikola&#8217;s troubles aren&#8217;t over. GM&#8217;s wording in its announcement suggests as much. GM describes the non-binding MoU as a &#8220;potential agreement.&#8221; If it goes through,¬†GM would engineer its Hydrotec fuel cell system to the specifications mutually agreed upon by both companies. It is expected that the potential arrangement would be &#8220;cost plus,&#8221; meaning that Nikola would pay upfront for the capital investment for the capacity. The companies are also discussing the potential of a supply agreement for GM&#8217;s Ultium battery system for Nikola&#8217;s Class 7 and Class 8 trucks.</p>

<p>Doug Parks, GM executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain, said supplying the Hydrotec fuel cell systems to the heavy-duty class of commercial vehicles is an important part GM&#8217;s growth strategy and reinforces the company&#8217;s commitment toward an all-electric, zero-emissions future.&#8221;</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s Hydrotec fuel cell system will be engineered at its Michigan technical facilities in Pontiac and Warren and manufactured at its Brownstown Charter Township battery assembly plant, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/raspberry-pi-foundation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="raspberry-pi-foundation">Raspberry Pi Foundation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-raspberry-pi-4-case-fan/">has released</a> a new product today. It‚Äôs a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-case-fan/">tiny $5 fan</a> combined with a small heatsink for the Raspberry Pi 4. It works with the official case, below the top cover. That accessory should prevent the Raspberry Pi from overheating.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre not familiar with the Raspberry Pi, it‚Äôs a cheap, single-board computer with a lot of connectors that is the size of a deck of cards. You can give it to a kid so they can play around with a terminal, you can use it for your weekend projects as the computing brain and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/23/the-raspberry-pi-foundation-unveils-the-raspberry-pi-4/">Raspberry Pi 4</a> is the most recent Raspberry Pi device in its classic form factor. And it‚Äôs a huge performance improvement over the Raspberry Pi 3.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And yet, shortly after its release last year, the community of Raspberry Pi users noticed that the single-board computer tends to get hot. In some cases, it becomes so hot that the device has no choice but to throttle the frequency of the CPU.</p>
<p>That problem is particularly noticeable if you‚Äôre using the official case, as it prevents proper ventilation. Over the past year, the foundation has released a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/thermal-testing-raspberry-pi-4/">software update</a> focused on power optimization.</p>
<p>While it solves the issue in some cases, it‚Äôs not a magic fix for all situations. Some users tend to use the computing power of the Raspberry Pi for long periods.</p>
<p>There are some <a href="https://flirc.tv/more/raspberry-pi-4-case">third-party cases</a> with a big heatsink. But the Raspberry Pi Foundation didn‚Äôt have its own solution for the issue.</p>
<p>According to the foundation, the tiny fan should be enough to prevent throttling. ‚ÄúIt draws air in over the USB and Ethernet connectors, passes it over a small finned heatsink attached to the processor, and exhausts it through the SD card slot,‚Äù the Raspberry Pi Foundation says.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a cheap stopgap solution, but I hope the Foundation will prioritize heat dissipation for the next iteration of the Raspberry Pi.</p>
