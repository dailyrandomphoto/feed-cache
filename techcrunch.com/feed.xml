										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two years into the pandemic, online conversations are for many of us still the primary interactions that we are having every day, and we are collectively having billions of them. But as many of us have discovered, not all of those are squeaky clean, positive experiences. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.spectrumlabsai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spectrum Labs</a> &#8212; which provides artificial intelligence technology to platform providers to detect and shut down toxic exchanges in real time (specifically, 20 milliseconds or less) &#8212; is announcing $32 million in funding. It plans to use the money to continue investing in its technology to double down on its growing consumer business and to forge ahead in a new area, providing services to enterprises for their internal and customer-facing conversations, providing not just a way to help detect when toxicity is creeping into exchanges, but to provide an audit trail for the activity for wider trust and safety tracking and initiatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aspire to be the leaders in language where civility matters,&#8221; CEO Justin Davis said in an interview.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Intel Capital, with Munich Re Ventures, Gaingels, OurCrowd, Harris Barton, and previous backers Wing Venture Capital, Greycroft, Ridge Ventures, Super{set}, and Global Founders Capital also participating. Greycroft led Spectrum&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/spectrum-labs-raises-10m-for-its-ai-based-platform-to-combat-online-toxicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous round of $10 million in September 2020</a>, and the company has now raised $46 million in total.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Davis, who co-founded the company with Josh Newman (the CTO), said Spectrum Labs is not disclosing valuation, but the company&#8217;s business size today speaks to how it&#8217;s been doing.</p>
<p>Spectrum Labs today works with just over 20 big platforms &#8212; they include social networking companies Pinterest and The Meet Group, dating site Grindr, Jimmy Wales&#8217; entertainment wiki Fandom, Riot Games, and e-learning platform Udemy &#8212; which in turn have millions of customers sending billions of messages to each other day, either in open chat rooms or in more direct, private conversations.</p>
<p>Its technology is based around natural language and works in real time both on text-based interactions and audio interactions.</p>
<p>Davis notes that its audio work is &#8220;read&#8221; as audio, not transcribed to text first, which gives Spectrum&#8217;s customers a significant jump on responding to the activity, and counteracting what Davis referred to as &#8220;The Wild West nature of voice,&#8221; due to how slow responses typically are for those not using Spectrum&#8217;s technology: a platform has to wait for users to flag iffy content, then the platform has to find that audio in the transcriptions, and then it can take action &#8212; a process that could take days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is all the more important since voice-based services &#8212; with the rise not just of podcasting but services like Clubhouse and Spaces on Twitter &#8212; are growing in popularity.</p>
<p>Whether text or audio, Spectrum scans these exchanges for toxic content covering more than 40 behavior profiles that it built initially in consultation with researchers and academics around the world and continues to hone as it ingests more data from across the web. The profiles cover parameters like harassment, hate speech, violent extremism, scams, grooming, illegal solicitation and doxxing. It currently supports scanning in nearly 40 languages, Davis tells me, adding that it could work with any language, , although Davis tells me that there is no language limit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can technically cover any language in a matter of weeks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The most visible examples of online toxicity have been in the consumer sphere &#8212; where they have played out in open-forum and more private online bullying and hate speech and other illegal activity, an area where Spectrum Labs will continue to do work and invest in technology to detect ever more complicated and sophisticated approaches from bad actors. One focus for Spectrum Labs will be in working on ways to improve how customers themselves can also play a role in deciding what they do and definitely do not want to see, alongside controls and tools for a platform&#8217;s trust and safety team. This is a tricky area, and arguably one reason why toxicity has gotten out of hand is because traditionally platforms have wanted to take a hands-off, free speech approach and not meddle in content, since the other side of the coin is that they can also be accused of censoring, a debate that is still very much playing out today.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a natural tension between what the policy implements and what users want and are willing to accept,&#8221; Davis said. His company&#8217;s view is that the job of a platform &#8220;is keeping the worst of the worst off, but also to provide consumer controls to make selection over what they want to see over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside that, Spectrum plans to move more into enterprise services.</p>
<p>The opportunity in enterprise is an interesting one, as it includes not just how people within a company converse with each other (which largely might take a similar form to the consumer-facing services that Spectrum Labs already provides), but also how a company interfaces with the outside world in areas like sales, customer service and marketing, and then leveraging the information that Spectrum Labs gathers in its analytics to potentially alter how each of those areas subsequently operates.</p>
<p>To be sure, this is not a market segment that has been ignored. Spectrum&#8217;s competitors here will include another startup in the conversation monitoring space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/aware-raises-60m-for-tech-that-monitors-internal-messaging-platforms-for-legal-compliance-sentiment-analysis-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aware</a>, which focuses on enterprise exclusively. (<a href="https://l1ght.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">L1ght</a>, meanwhile, is another competitor in the consumer sphere.)</p>
<p>And there will certainly be others. We noted when we last wrote about Spectrum Labs that the founders and founding team came from Krux, a marketing technology company that was acquired by Salesforce (where they worked before leaving to found Spectrum Labs). I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see Salesforce taking a more interested role in this area in the future, not least because it is building out a very wide toolset to help companies run their businesses more efficiently, not just limited to CRM; but also because Bret Taylor, who once founded another social network and used to be the CTO of Facebook, is now helping to run the show, and may well have an especially informed grip on how communications forums can be used and abused.</p>
<p>For now, to address both the consumer and enterprise issues, Intel is coming in as a strategic investor in this round, Davis tells me. The plan will be to integrate Spectrum Labs&#8217; technology to work more closely with Intel&#8217;s chip designs, which will increase the speed that it works even more, and Intel will be able to use as a unique selling point with Intel&#8217;s would-be hardware customers as they give a higher priority to trust and safety issues themselves.</p>
<p>“We believe Spectrum Labs’ Natural Language Understanding technology has the potential to become the core platform that powers the trust initiatives of thousands of companies around the world,” said Mark Rostick, VP and senior MD at Intel Capital, in a statement. “As digital trust and ethical operations emerge as a key factor to help organizations differentiate themselves, we see a huge opportunity to build a Trust &amp; Safety tech layer into enterprise operations.”<u></u><u></u></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swiggy, India&#8217;s top food delivery startup, has raised $700 million in a new financing round, just six months after securing $1.25 billion, as it aggressively expands its offerings including the instant-delivery service in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Invesco led the Bengaluru-headquartered startup&#8217;s Series K round, which according to a source familiar with the matter values the seven year-old startup at $10.7 billion. Swiggy was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-raises-1-25-billion-led-by-softbank-and-prosus/">valued at $5.5 billion in July last year</a>.</p>
<p>At a $10.7 billion valuation, Swiggy has surpassed the valuation of its 13-year-old chief rival Zomato, which went public last year and whose market cap has shrunk to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/23/paytm-zomato-nykaa-and-policybazaar-shares-drop-to-record-lows/">under $10 billion</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261033" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>New investors Baron Capital Group, Sumeru Venture, IIFL AMC Late Stake Tech Fund, Kotak, Axis Growth, Sixteenth Street Capital, Ghisallo, Smile Group, Segantii Capital as well as existing backers including Prosus Ventures, Alpha Wave Global, Qatar Investment Authority and ARK Impact also invested in the new round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported in late September that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/indian-food-delivery-giant-swiggy-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-over-10-billion-valuation/">Invesco was in talks to lead an investment of over $500 million</a> in Swiggy.</p>
<p>The new funding follows a strong year of growth for Swiggy in which the startup nearly doubled its food delivery business&#8217; gross order value, it said. Instamart, Swiggy&#8217;s instant delivery service, is set to reach an annual GMV run rate of $1 billion in the next three quarters, the startup said.</p>
<p>Instamart has become one of the major focus areas for Swiggy in the past year and a half.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which operates in over 500 Indian cities, said last year that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/swiggy-to-invest-700-million-in-express-delivery-service-instamart/">plans to invest $700 million</a> to scale Instamart&#8217;s offerings and reach. The quick delivery space, which has made inroads in several markets in recent years, is becoming competitive in India, too.</p>
<p>Y Combinator Continuity Fund led the Mumbai-headquartered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/zepto-a-10-minute-grocery-delivery-app-in-india-raises-100-million/">10-minute-delivery service Zepto&#8217;s $100 million funding late last year.</a> Zomato-backed BlinkIt (formerly known as Grofers), which like Swiggy is also backed by SoftBank, pivoted to instant delivery space last year.</p>
<p>“As long-term investors, the Invesco Developing Markets fund seeks investment opportunities in the best companies in the world, led by world-class management teams, and that have the potential for long-term structural growth,” said Justin Leverenz, Chief Investment Officer at Invesco Developing Markets Fund, said in a statement. “Our investment in Swiggy represents such an investment.”</p>
<p>Sriharsha Majety, co-founder and chief executive of Swiggy, said Instamart has reached a GMV in just 17 months what it took the core food delivery business 40 months to deliver.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to make Swiggy the platform that 100 million consumers can use 15 times a month. We will continue to invest in our people, products, and partners to create a positive impact on the ecosystem and accelerate the digital transformation in food and grocery delivery and other on-demand services,” he added.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s food services market, which is expected to reach $97 billion by March of 2026, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report to clients last year.</p>
<p>“India food services market is large and expected to reach $97 billion by FY25. Organized food service is growing faster and expected to reach 55% market share by FY25. We expect online penetration to expand to 20% by FY25 and market size to reach $20 billion growing at 46% CAGR. Significant part of the growth will be driven by new customer acquisition and penetration into smaller markets. Zomato had 10 million monthly transacting users (MTU) in FY20, expected to increase 5x by FY25 to ~50 million,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Amazon, a third player, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">entered the food delivery space in India</a> in recent years, but, as a Zomato executive mentioned in a public forum last year, the American e-commerce group has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/amazon-expands-its-food-delivery-service-across-bangalore/">yet to make inroads</a> in this category.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ola Electric said on Monday it has raised $200 million in a new financing round even as the Indian ride-hailing giant&#8217;s spin off struggles to deliver its maiden electric scooter to customers and <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/bhavish-aggarwal-is-choking-ola">questions about its work culture have been raised</a>.</p>
<p>Tekne Private Ventures, Alpine Opportunity Fund, Edelweiss are among those was financed the new round, which values Ola Electric at $5 billion, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/ola-electric-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">$3 billion in September last year</a>, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup said.</p>
<p>“I thank the investors for their support and look forward to partnering with them to take the EV revolution from India to the world,” Ola Electric co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said in a statement. The startup is looking to expand into more categories including cars, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ola Electric &#8212; which counts Tiger Global and Alpha Wave Global among its existing backers &#8212; last year announced its first electric scooter called Ola S1. Priced at about $1,350, the battery-powered scooter offers a range of 121 kilometers (75 miles) on a complete charge.</p>
<p>That’s more of a hypothetical / untested claim for most individuals as the startup has delayed the shipment of the scooter several times. And at best, only a tiny fraction of the customer base that had pre-ordered the vehicle has received it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bounce, a fellow Bengaluru-headquartered startup, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/bounce-infinity-e1-launch/">unveiled its own electric scooter</a> that many analysts say promises to pack more than Ola’s offering.</p>
<p>Two-wheelers account for more than three-fourths of all vehicles sold in India. The push by startups as well large vehicle makers, coupled with favorable government incentives in recent years, are beginning to put India&#8217;s push to EV in the right direction. Analysts at UBS wrote in a report last week that they estimate 37% of all two-wheelers in India to be powered by electric by the end of the decade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But for that projection to come true, plenty of factors need to play out the right way.</p>
<p>One of it could be the work culture at Ola, one of India&#8217;s largest startups. Ola and Ola Electric have also seen several key executive departures in recent months as a result of what Indian outlet Morning Context reported as <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/bhavish-aggarwal-is-choking-ola">toxic work culture and distrustful chief executive</a>. Aggarwal is also the co-founder and chief executive of Ola, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/indian-ride-hailing-startup-ola-valued-at-7-3-billion-in-new-funding/">raised capital at a valuation of $7.3 billion</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Paytm, Zomato, PolicyBazaar, and Nykaa &#8212; four Indian tech startups that went public last year &#8212; on Monday tumbled to their record lows since market debuts last year as analysts predict a global market correction amid US investors worrying about the prospect of high interest rates.</p>
<p>Shares of Paytm dropped over 6% to as low as ₹880 ($11.8) on Monday, the lowest since its public debut in mid-November. The market cap of mobile payments firm, which made its debut with an issue price of ₹2,150, has shrunk to $7.7 billion, less than half of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">$16 billion valuation at which it raised $1 billion</a> in a private financing round in the second half of 2019.</p>
<p>Nykaa shares dropped over 13% to ₹1,693 ($22.6) apiece, down from its all-time high of ₹2,574 ($34.5). At over 18.5% fall, shares of Zomato saw the steepest drop among the four aforementioned tech firms. The shares dropped to as low as ₹91.7 ($1.23) apiece from an all-time high of ₹169.10 ($2.27). PolicyBazaar fell over 9% to ₹766 ($10.2) apiece to nearly half of its all-time high of ₹1,470.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2261001" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The recent tumble &#8212; which hasn&#8217;t impacted other Indian stocks as severely &#8212; comes as shares of tech companies that have rallied in recent years amid the pandemic begin to see what many analysts are terming as &#8220;correction.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rally has also helped startups globally raise capital at record high valuation jumps and pace. But several investors are now publicly telling startups that those days are about to be over &#8212; for an indefinite period of time, at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;Market sentiment changes faster than startups can change operations, cost structures or monetization levers,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/singh_sequoia/status/1484449111273132034">said</a> Shailendra Singh, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital India, in a tweet last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking forward to a much needed correction in startup funding environment; thankfully, conversations are back to focusing on revenues, products, unit economics, saving dollars.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At an Axios conference last week, Rajeev Misra, chief executive of SoftBank Vision Fund, said that SaaS stocks in the US have gone down from 20 times of their revenue to 12x. &#8220;In the private markets they&#8217;re still at 20x or higher&#8230; I believe that gap is going to tighten over the next six months,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/app-stores-to-see-record-consumer-spend-of-133-billion-in-2021-143-6-billion-new-app-installs/">latest</a> year-end <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/2021-end-year-mobile-apps-recap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>. App Annie <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/">says</a> global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year-over-year to reach $295 billion.</p>
<p>In addition, consumers are spending more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258569" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apps aren&#8217;t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games generated over $100 million in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue, App Annie<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/app-annie-global-app-stores-consumer-spend-up-19-to-170b-in-2021-downloads-grew-5-to-230b/"> noted</a>. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3><strong>Epic Games kicks off its appeal</strong></h3>
<p>Both Epic Games and Apple appealed the original ruling of the lawsuit where Epic had sought to prove Apple was behaving in an anti-competitive manner by not allowing alternative payments or other means of distributing apps outside the App Store. Although <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">Apple largely won that case</a>, as the judge ruled it was not a monopolist, it was instructed to stop preventing app developers from adding links to third-party purchasing mechanisms &#8212; a decision it didn&#8217;t agree with, prompting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">its appeal</a>. Apple was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed/">given permission to hold off</a> on the App Store changes until the appeal&#8217;s ruling, in another blow to Epic. Meanwhile, Epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">appealed</a> the case since it wanted another shot at making its arguments before the court.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, Epic Games filed its opening brief appealing the District Court&#8217;s decision in the Epic v. Apple case. In it, the company attempts to lay out why it thinks the District Court erred in its original decision, noting again how Apple reduces innovation, prevents alternative app stores from competing with its own, extracts &#8220;supracompetitive&#8221; commissions while making minimal investments in the App Store, and more. It also wants the appeals court to reconsider the market definitions for deciding the case. The lower court determined the case was about the &#8220;digital mobile game transactions&#8221; market, but Epic&#8217;s brief points out that Apple&#8217;s restrictions apply to both game and non-game developers alike. And it argues the court based its market definition on a misreading of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vs-epic-games-battle-experts-gets-personal-2021-05-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Amex</em></a>, by treating two separate transactions &#8212; consumers&#8217; app downloads on the App Store and the in-app purchase itself &#8212; as a single transaction.</p>

<h3><strong>OK, we&#8217;ll just call it a &#8220;platform fee&#8221; then  </strong></h3>
<p>When the Netherlands&#8217; regulator ordered Apple to allow dating apps on the App Store to be able to process third-party payments, it looked like it might be a small win for a more open ecosystem that would allow alternatives to Apple&#8217;s own payment systems and its commissions. But anyone celebrating this did so too soon. Apple has now clarified that while<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/17/apple-app-store-dutch-antitrust-order/"> it will adhere to the letter of the law</a>, by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offering entitlements</a> to the dating apps looking to process payments on their own, it won&#8217;t adhere to the spirit. Not only will the developers have to publish a separate binary for their app they want it distributed to the Netherlands App Store, they&#8217;ll still have to pay Apple a commission on those third-party payments. And yet developers won&#8217;t be able to take advantage of any platform advantages, like getting Apple to assist with refunds, payment history, subscription management or other issues related to the purchases &#8212; as those will now take place outside its App Store. So what&#8217;s the platform fee for? I guess access to users?</p>
<p>Wrote Apple on its developer documentation page: &#8220;Consistent with the ACM’s order, dating apps that are granted an entitlement to link out or use a third-party in-app payment provider will pay Apple a commission on transactions.&#8221; But Apple didn&#8217;t say how much that commission will be. Likely, Apple will take the course that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/google-play-to-support-alternative-billing-systems-in-south-korea-following-new-law/">Google did in South Korea</a>, where it dropped the commission rate for external payments by a mere 4%.</p>
<h3>Twitter gets into NFTs</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s official, Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/twitter-blue-subscription-users-are-first-gain-access-to-a-new-nft-profile-picture-feature/">embraced NFTs</a>. Users on Twitter&#8217;s iOS app who also subscribe to Twitter Blue will be the first to take advantage of a new feature that lets them authenticate with their crypto wallet to use an NFT as their profile pic on the service. The new NFT hexagon-shaped pics will help to differentiate the crypto-enthusiasts from the rest of Twitter.</p>
<p>To use the feature as a Twitter Blue subscriber, you’ll go to your profile to change your profile photo as you would normally. Here, you’ll be presented with the new option to choose an NFT instead. You then connect with your crypto wallet.</p>
<p>At launch, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, MetaMask, Ledger Live, Argent and Trust Wallet are supported. After authenticating, you’ll select the NFT you want to showcase. Twitter says that, currently, JPEG and PNG NFTs minted on the Ethereum (ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens) can be used as NFT Profile Pictures. In a later <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1484315142875615236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1484315142875615236%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2022%2F01%2F20%2Ftwitter-blue-subscription-users-are-first-gain-access-to-a-new-nft-profile-picture-feature%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a>, Twitter said it was looking into adding support for SVGs, but can’t render them right now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting the Twitter Blue subscription service is not yet globally available, which will limit the adoption of NFT Profile Pictures to the early markets where the offering is now live — the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy with the update, which is <a href="https://observer.com/2022/01/twitters-new-nft-profile-picture-feature-is-drawing-mixed-reactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">receiving mixed reactions</a>. Some people are trolling the hexa-profiles, others are blocking people and <a href="https://twitter.com/CirenSong/status/1484301800048152576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1484301800048152576%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fobserver.com%2F2022%2F01%2Ftwitters-new-nft-profile-picture-feature-is-drawing-mixed-reactions%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Mye_Bi/status/1483211676640026626?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1483211676640026626%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fobserver.com%2F2022%2F01%2Ftwitters-new-nft-profile-picture-feature-is-drawing-mixed-reactions%2F">artists</a> claim the feature has encouraged more people to steal their art and mint it as an NFT (which to be fair, could have happened before).</p>

<li><strong>Google Play Games for PC enters beta testing.</strong> The downloadable app, which brings Android games to Windows PC users, is launching to beta testers in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan.

<h3><strong>E-commerce/Food delivery</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>TikTok kids are boosting toy retailer Learning Express&#8217; sales. </strong>The company&#8217;s online sales increased 25% in 2021, compared with massive 233% growth in 2020, amid the pandemic. Interestingly, the retailer hasn&#8217;t spent money on TikTok marketing and advertising, noting that kids are starting to find them on their own. Over the past years, the TikTok toy trends have turned toys into viral hits like Pop Its, Squishmallow, fidget spinners and more, thanks to kids sharing videos on the social app. The retailer, where individual stores are franchises, is also benefitting from some of its owners&#8217; own TikTok presence &#8212; like the Birmingham location, which has 2.3 million followers and its most popular video received 62 million views.</li>
<li><strong>Consumers may be swapping food delivery apps for grocery delivery,</strong> <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/grocery-apps-gain-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apptopia research shows</a>. Food delivery apps in Q2 2021 saw total sessions fall 10% from March, and the rest of the year showed no real gains. Meanwhile, in December, grocery delivery apps posted a 20% increase in downloads from the month prior. And DoorDash and Uber Eats adapted, the former by adding grocery and convenience stores to its app, and the latter by removing the word &#8220;restaurant&#8221; from its app&#8217;s title.</li>

Users will be able to trade 1,100 securities, including shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, as well as gain access to 200 ETFs.</li>
<li><strong>Investing app Acorns <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/investing-app-acorns-pioneer-spac-scrap-22-bln-merger-2022-01-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scrapped its $2.2 billion merger</a> agreement with SPAC Pioneer Merger Corp.</strong> The deal, announced last May, would have allowed Acorns to list on the Nasdaq, and the merger was valued at $1.5 billion pre-money. Acorns will pay $17.5 million in termination fees through December 15. The company said that &#8220;given market conditions,&#8221; it was pivoting to a private capital raise at a higher pre-money valuation instead.</li>

<li><strong>Instagram and TikTok have begun testing support for paid creator subscriptions.</strong> Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/instagram-launches-early-test-of-creator-subscriptions-in-the-u-s/">officially announced its alpha test of subscription</a>s, offering creators eight price points between 99 cents and $99.99 which they can charge users. Subscribers gain access to exclusive live videos and stories, and receive a special badge elevating them in the comments section and the DM inbox. Meanwhile, TikTok also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/tiktok-begins-testing-support-for-paid-subscriptions/">confirmed</a> it has begun testing subscriptions, but wouldn&#8217;t share details.</li>

The app now prevents 13 to 17-year-old users from showing up in Quick Add search results, unless they have friends in common with the person searching &#8212; a feature aimed at preventing users from adding people they don&#8217;t know to deter drug transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook and Instagram are working on NFT features that will allow users to display their NFTs on their social profiles.</strong> Instagram head Adam Mosseri had previously said the company was looking into NFT support. This week, a report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2745d50b-36e4-4c0a-abe0-e93f035b0628" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The FT added</a> Meta is considering its own NFT marketplace, but noted the efforts were in early stages. This is not entirely <em>new</em> information, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagram-s-mosseri-is-exploring-subscriptions-open-to-creator-fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Mosseri had said the company was considering a marketplace</a>. It has also invited NFT artists to offer feedback through panel discussions, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacksonweimer/2021/05/22/instagram-is-looking-to-create-an-nft-platform-but-is-overlooking-artists/?sh=32e7fbfa2eb2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which was discussed in the press last year</a> when some artists were upset about being asked to advise the social giant on the matter without compensation. But the report indicates the investment may extend to Facebook as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Messaging</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WhatsApp is <a href="https://www.imore.com/whatsapp-rolling-app-chat-support-out-its-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolling out in-app chat support</a> as an alternative to email.</strong> The feature had previously been available in beta testing, but has begun showing up for non-beta users.</li>
<li><strong>Meta&#8217;s Workplace service for businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/metas-workplace-will-integrate-with-whatsapp-later-this-year-to-expand-communication-with-frontline-employees/">will integrate with WhatsApp</a> later this year.</strong> The service, which now has more than 7 million users, will integrate with the messaging app so Workplace customers can share announcements with front-line employees, including deskless workers.</li>
<li><strong>Messenger Kids <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/01/teaching-internet-safety-on-messenger-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced new &#8220;internet safety&#8221; activities</a> to teach young children</strong> how to use Messenger and be safe online. In each episode of &#8220;Pledge Planets,&#8221; kids learn to make healthy decisions, stay safe online, learn to use blocking and reporting tools, and build resilience.</li>

<h3><strong>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spotify is still the top streaming music service but its market share has slipped a bit,</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/spotify-subscription-numbers-up-youtube-music-tidal/">according to new research</a> from MIDiA, as the streaming market has grown. In Q2 2021, 523.9 million people subscribed to a music streaming service globally, up 26.4% from the same time last year. Spotify&#8217;s market share, meanwhile, dropped from 34% in 2019 to 31% today, followed by Apple, then Amazon Music. YouTube Music grew by more than 50% year-over-year, making it the only Western streamer to have increased market share.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/netflixs-gaming-service-adds-two-more-titles-on-ios-and-android/">expanded its growing gaming lineup</a> this week with the launch of two more games:</strong> Arcanium: Rise of Akhan, an open-world single-player card strategy game developed by Rogue Games; and puzzle game Krispee Street developed by Frosty Pop. The additions bring Netflix&#8217;s gaming catalog to 12 titles, including Bowling Ballers, Shooting Hoops, Teeter Up, Asphalt Xtreme, Stranger Things 1984, Stranger Things 3, Card Blast, Dominos Cafe, Wonderputt Forever and Knittens.</li>
<li><strong>During its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/netflix-q4-2021-results-subscriber-numbers/">less-than-stellar earnings</a>, Netflix&#8217;s COO Greg Peters also <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/netflix-video-games-stranger-things-1235159017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said the company is open to licensing &#8220;large game IP&#8221;</a> </strong>that people would recognize as it expands its gaming business. &#8220;I think you will [see] some of that happen over the year to come,&#8221; Peters noted.</li>
<li><strong>In addition to the major news of Microsoft&#8217;s Activision Blizzard deal, the company also announced this week that its Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22406059/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-25-million-microsoft-activision?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">service has grown to</a> 25 million subscribers</strong>, up from 18 million in January 2021.</li>

So Cravotta reached out to Wordle&#8217;s developer (Josh Wardle) to note he was donating the proceeds to charity, which has totaled $2,000+ so far.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. consumer spending in mobile action games jumped up 68.9% in 2021, driven by almost entirely Genshin Impact,</strong> <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/mobile-game-genre-growth-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> Sensor Tower. Spending for the year reached $966.8 million, making Action the fastest-rising gaming genre and Open World Adventure the largest Action subgenre. MiHoYo&#8217;s Genshin Impact earned $406.3 million in the U.S. in 2021, followed by Marvel Contest of Champions by Kabam and Dragon Ball Legends from Bandai Namco.</li>

They&#8217;re also more likely to watch gaming content, often on TikTok. The group also tends to use social platforms to find new games (45% versus 32% for those who don’t use TikTok). They play on average 7.1 genres versus 4.2 genres for non-TikTok users, and are more likely to notice ad types.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">subscribe here.</a></em></p>
<p>AngelList’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/angellist-just-closed-a-25m-fund-to-back-startups-based-on-hiring-velocity/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">recently closed early-stage venture fund </a>brings back one of my favorite conversations within the world of early-stage startup fundraising: to data, or not to data. The $25 million fund bases all of its investments off of one key metric that AngelList has been tracking for years: a startup’s ability to hire.</p>
<p>When I spoke to Abraham Othman, head of the investment committee and of data science at AngelList Venture, he told me they win deals because they are less adversarial to portfolio companies than other firms. “Our approach? This is our data set, let’s see if we can put money into them,” he said. No further due diligence? No problem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260781" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, there are some challenges with leaning on such signals to make investments. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-startup-friends/">As history often reminds us</a>, due diligence matters from a human perspective — and vetting a founder beyond their ability to attract talent can save firms from headaches or legal woes. Additionally, a startup could get a ton of applicants due to pay, location or even recent coverage in a Well Known Tech Blog — which can bode well for success, but could also just be a result of great marketing. In AngelList’s case, they believe that hiring demand’s fluidity adds to its importance.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I think the future of data-driven investments will bring a double-edged sword into our Zoom rooms (or lack thereof, perhaps). Traditional investment that prioritizes pedigree and culture, or the “art” of a founder, has left out an entire class of historically overlooked individuals. But that same process, in which you spend five hours in conversation with an aspiring entrepreneur, brings a layer of humanity to decision-makers before they get millions to execute on a vision.</p>
<p>I don’t want to get into the due diligence conversation yet again, and investors leaning on data to dictate their investment decisions is anything but a new strategy. This is the song of late-stage investors, of private equity analysts and your brilliant aunt who loves a good earnings report. Early-stage startups and investors, from ClearCo to SignalFire, have spent years building up advice atop algorithms atop assumed returns.</p>
<p>However, in a bull market for even the most bullish among us, the premise of an unbiased, data-based check feels somewhat more hopeful than before. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/18/more-than-another-check-founders-need-activation-energy/">Money certainly doesn’t solve all woes</a> &#8212; the top reason startups fail today is <em>still </em>due to <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failure to raise new capital</a>. Add in the gender fundraising gap and a more automated decision-making process suddenly doesn’t sound unromantic, it sounds inevitable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about a new graduate-friendly fund, lawyer tech and Plaid’s growing patchwork of startups. As always, you can follow my thoughts on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@nmasc_</a> or listen to me on Equity, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/19/how-many-unicorns-are-just-pinatas-filled-with-expired-candy/">a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.</a></p>
<h2><strong>$1 million lasts a million times longer than before </strong></h2>
<p>Led by Flybridge founding partner Jeff Bussgang, Harvard Business School professors put together a $7 million fund to invest in recently graduated students from the university. This is the third installment of the Graduate Syndicate, which officially <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1895183/000189518322000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed this week per SEC filings</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The syndicate started a few years ago when business school professors realized that young talent within their classes was looking for activation capital. To limit conflict of interest, such as favoritism or power imbalance, Bussgang said that the syndicate only invests in founders after they graduate from school. So far, the syndicate has invested in 60 companies, with 41% of them being led or co-led by a female founder.</p>
<p><em>Bussgang on what changed in pre-seed: </em></p>
<blockquote><p>A pre-seed round, which is typically around a million dollars, is happening in a moment in time where you can make a ton of progress with just a million dollars, given the no-code, low code platforms, the cloud and reduction in costs for starting things up. The biggest trend I&#8217;ve seen is that these companies can just do so much with so little [and] because of these no code platforms…business founders can be builders, they don&#8217;t have to be software developers and that&#8217;s a great tailwind for the HBS community.</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>And the startup of the week is…</strong></h2>
<p>Lawtrades. When it comes to our newly distributed world of work, flexibility is a key but elusive term. Lucky for Raad Ahmed and Ashish Walia, the co-founders of Lawtrades, defining the term has been a conversation that’s been in the works since 2016. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/lawtrades-aims-to-change-how-your-company-utilizes-legal-resources/">Lawtrades wants to change how enterprise companies utilize legal resources</a>,and give lawyers a chance at more flexible, remote work.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> The startup raised a $6 million Series A round, led by Four Cities Capital, with participation from Draper Associates and 500 Startups. More than $11 million was earned on the platform to date by the lawyer network and over 60,000 hours of work was logged on the platform in 2021, a 200% boost from 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/lawtrades-aims-to-change-how-your-company-utilizes-legal-resources/">our own Christine Hall reports. </a></p>
<p><em>Ahmed on the moonshot:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>As a company, you&#8217;re basically meeting internet strangers and hiring them for hundreds of thousands of dollars and trusting that they’re going to do a good job. So there’s a solid amount of betting that happens on the supply side. We let about 5% to 6% of [lawyers into the platform] &#8211; but the actual hard part is how does this day look operationally? Other platforms…there isn’t a lot of work transparency, so that’s what we’re trying to work on.</p>
<p>We have this simple tool, a time tracking app, once you get hired for an engagement, you&#8217;re basically logging in every hour of work. We basically make this transparent to clients so they see what&#8217;s the equivalent of a Facebook newsfeed but it&#8217;s a work feed. So it updates on who&#8217;s working on what or how long, what project and you can react to that, comment on it and we&#8217;re coming up with more and more clever ways for us to sort of capture the data with minimal work from like our network of lawyers.</p>
<p>It actually allows you to gain even more transparency and even more detail into someone&#8217;s productivity than you would if you were side by side right.</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Plaid went in on Cognito </strong></h2>
<p>Fintech giant Plaid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/plaid-buys-cognito-to-bolster-its-feature-set-as-it-moves-beyond-simply-connecting-accounts/">acquired verification platform Cognito for around $250 million</a>, TC’s Alex Wilhelm reported this week. Plaid has been actively growing from the fabric that helps fintechs communicate, to a patchwork of services built atop those key connections.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The deal comes months after Plaid’s own acquisition, which would have seen it be owned by Visa, fell apart and landed it a lofty new valuation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/wordles-blizzard-of-transparency/">As we spoke about on the latest Equity</a>, Plaid has matured to host a growing startup accelerator, acquire companies and clearly expand its strategic ambitions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Excerpt: Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday?

<p>Hello friends, I hope you are well and warm and healthy and happy and good. If not, some of those things. If you are none, well there’s a reason we invented ice cream.</p>
<p>In good news I have a few tasty nuggets for you this fine Saturday. We’re talking the metaverse, a venture capital story that I’ve watched from its genesis, and a funding round for a very cool startup that I accidentally blanked this week, so we’re talking about it here. Ready? Let’s have some fun.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260866" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The most fun that I had this week was <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1484180969057710084">a visit to Decentraland</a>. In short, I was in edit and trying to distract myself so that I wouldn’t bother the editing team while they worked, so I fired up the social-crypto environment – metaverse, in other words – and went for a tour. Rocking a mohawk and some pretty cool pants I managed to get lost, visit an NFT gallery, and fail to gain access to an arena.</p>
<p>Look, the metaverse as it exists today looks a lot like Runescape. That’s not that big a diss, given the sheer historical footprint that the online RPG has built for itself. But what I don’t really need is a less featured MMORPG that includes, oddly, a more financial angle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/despite-blockchain-gamings-play-to-earn-angle-i-prefer-to-pay/">than I tend to like in my games</a>.</p>
<p>I am neutral at the moment, and open to the metaverse becoming sufficiently cool that I log in daily. But today it seems that some Web 2.0 properties that include community creation and social interaction are superior to what we’ve yet seen from the crypto team.</p>

<h2>Amplify’s newest general partner</h2>
<p>Roughly 1,000 years ago, a startup named Mattermark hired me to build an independent news room for their company. It was a great learning experience, frankly, and had the added edge of introducing me to some lifetime friends. <a href="https://twitter.com/ckevinliu?lang=en">Kevin Liu now of TechStars</a>, for example.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahcat21">Sarah Catanzaro</a> was another standout from the Mattermark team. Her work on the company’s data team was later translated into work in venture, first at <a href="https://www.canvas.vc/">Canvas Ventures</a>, and later <a href="https://amplifypartners.com/">Amplify Partners</a>. Amplify, for reference, last <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/fund/amplify-partners-raised-amplify-partners-iv--ade45263">announced a fund in late 2020</a> worth $275 million. Given that timeframe, I expect the group to announce a new capital vehicle in short order.</p>
<p>At Amplify, Catanzaro went from principal, to partner, to, most recently, general partner. Her journey from the lowest ranks of the VC world to its top-tier has been enjoyable to watch. And, she told TechCrunch during a call the other week, she’s the first woman to reach her level at Amplify. I highlight that to remind myself that promotions in the yet-cottage industry of venture capital are unlike startup level gains in their pace.</p>
<p>Regardless, Catanzaro told us something that I wanted to write down here, so that we can circle back to it later on. We discussed her firm’s investment approach, check size targets, and how often they enter companies at seed versus Series A maturity levels. Per the newly minted GP, Series A rounds have gotten much bigger <em>without</em> a commensurate decrease in risk. This is something that I have had as a hunch for some time, but hadn’t heard someone say out loud before.</p>
<p>This means that Series A risk, from a venture perspective, is going up as more capital is put to work at the startup stage. The math could work out in the end, provided that enough mega-exits are made in the coming years. But with the market in free-fall, and Concern now getting more column inches than Unbridled Enthusiasm, well, I wonder a bit.</p>
<h2>The pride of Rhode Island</h2>
<p>Living as I do in the Ocean State, I am slightly afield from the best-known technology hubs in the United States. But that doesn’t mean that fascinating tech companies are being built here in my small state. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/student-labor-marketplace-pangea-closes-2m-seed-round/">has spilt ink</a>, to pick an example, on <a href="https://www.about.pangea.app/">Pangea</a>, a startup founded in Providence that is building a freelance labor marketplace for college kids.</p>
<p>Another startup in Lil Rhody is <a href="https://dockwa.com/">The Wanderlust Group</a>, which has built Dockwa, a software platform for marinas and boaters. In short, the world of managing boat slip reservations was stuck floating in the world of pen and paper, and Wanderlust decided to to modernize it through software.</p>
<p>We last touched on the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/the-wanderlust-group-raises-14-2m-to-double-down-on-getting-folks-outdoors/">in 2020 when it raised $14.2 million</a>. At that time, CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/mdmelillo">Mike Melillo</a> told TechCrunch that his company had merely been on the hunt for $7 million, a figure that it doubled.</p>
<p>So I was not surprised to hear from the company recently that it has raised again. This time Wanderlust has raised a $30 million Series C at a $150 million pre-money valuation. The funding event was led by <a href="https://www.thursday.vc/">Thursday Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Happily for you and I, Wanderlust was willing to share ARR growth for 2021, which came in at 71%. More fun, after moving to a four-day workweek, the company saw its ARR expand 100% from June 2020 to June 2021; there’s a real datapoint for one of the more interesting labor experiments I am tracking in startup-land.</p>
<p>But most interesting from the company is that it’s building a fund. Not another corporate venture capital fund, but something else. Called Wanderfund, the company is funding the vehicle with $300,000 this year for what it describes as “environmental causes at the national and local level.” It’s starting, in part, with putting money in its local Boys &amp; Girls Club to help kids get out of the house and into nature.</p>
<p>The company is building a Dockwa-like product for camping, so the “go outside” theme is pretty core to what the aptly named <em>Wanderlust</em> Group is building.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">2021 will be remembered as the year that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/"> ransomware</a> gangs turned their attention to critical infrastructure, targeting companies built around manufacturing, energy distribution, and food production.</p>
<p>The Colonial Pipeline ransomware alone resulted in the shutdown of 5,500 miles of pipeline over fears that the ransomware attack on its IT network would spread to the operational network that controls the pipeline for distributing fuel.</p>
<p>Operational technology (OT) networks control the devices critical to the continued operations of production lines, power plants, and energy supplies, and as such are typically segmented from a company&#8217;s internet-facing IT networks to better isolate critical hardware from cyberattacks. Successful attacks against OT networks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/triton-malware-strike/">are rare</a>, but in the wake of the Colonial ransomware attack, CISA warned of a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/publication/ransomware-threat-to-ot">growing threat</a> for critical infrastructure owners.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260194" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now security researchers are warning of the risks posed by the embedded devices that sit on those OT networks. Red Balloon Security, a security provider for embedded devices, found in new research that it&#8217;s <a href="https://redballoonsecurity.com/ransomware-installation-on-embedded-devices-is-possible-because-weve-done-it/index.html">possible to deploy ransomware</a> on embedded systems that are used in real-world networks.</p>
<p>The company said it found vulnerabilities in the Schneider Electric Easergy P5 protection relay, a device that&#8217;s key to the operation and stability of the modern electric grids by triggering circuit breakers if a fault is discovered.</p>
<p>This vulnerability could be exploited to deploy a ransomware payload, a “sophisticated but reproducible” process that Red Balloon said it achieved. A Schneider Electric spokesperson told TechCrunch &#8220;it is extremely vigilant of cyber threats,&#8221; and that &#8220;upon learning of the vulnerabilities with the Schneider Electric Easergy P5 protection relay, we worked immediately to resolve them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ang Cui, founder and co-CEO of Red Balloon told TechCrunch that while ransomware attacks have hit IT networks of critical infrastructure providers, a successful compromise of an OT embedded device can be &#8220;far more damaging.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Companies are not used to or experienced in recovering from an attack on the embedded devices themselves,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If the device is destroyed or made unrecoverable, then a replacement device needs to be sourced, and this can take weeks as there is a limited supply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security veteran Window Snyder, who last year<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/thistle-technology-seed-security-iot/"> launched a startup to help IoT manufacturers reliably and securely deliver software updates</a> to their devices, said that embedded devices could become an easy target, particularly as other points of entry become more resilient.</p>
<p>Speaking of embedded systems: “A lot of them don’t have separation of privilege on them, a lot of them don’t have separation between code and data, and a lot of them were developed with the idea that they’d be sitting on air-gapped networks — it’s insufficient,” Snyder told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Red Balloon says its research demonstrates that the security built into these devices — many are several decades old — needs to be improved, and is calling for end-users in government and commercial sectors to call for higher standards from the vendors who make those devices.</p>
<p>“Issuing firmware fixes is a reactive, inefficient approach that will not address the overall insecurity of our most mission-critical industries and services,” says Cui. “Vendors need to bring more security down to the embedded device level.” He also believes also that more work needs to be done by the U.S. government on a regulation level, and thinks more pressure needs to be put onto device manufacturers who currently aren’t incentivized to build in more security at a device level.</p>
<p>Snyder, however, thinks a regulation-led approach is unlikely to help: “I think the thing that helps most is reducing the attack surface and increasing compartmentalization,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We’re not going to regulate our way out of more secure devices. Somebody has to go out there and build resilience into them.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The past two years have been exciting periods of growth for the cloud market, driven by increased demand for access to new technology during COVID-19 and the proliferation of the “work-from-anywhere” culture. IT leaders worked to shift workloads to the cloud to ensure business continuity for the remote workforce, leading to skyrocketing adoption of cloud computing. This momentum is expected to pick up in 2022 and beyond.</p>
<p>For many businesses, the pandemic accelerated their digital transformation plans by months, or even years. Reliance on cloud infrastructure will only continue to grow as organizations adjust to the hybrid work model. Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-08-02-gartner-says-four-trends-are-shaping-the-future-of-public-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projects</a> that global spending on cloud services is expected to reach over $482 billion in 2022, up from $313 billion in 2020.</p>
<p>As we start the new year, C2C, an independent Google Cloud community, has identified six cloud computing trends to watch in 2022.</p>
<h2>More people are harnessing new technologies</h2>
<p>The pandemic inspired a new generation of entrepreneurs. Whether out of necessity from mass layoffs, a desire for a more flexible lifestyle, or finding the inspiration to finally pursue a passion, millions have started their own ventures.</p>
<p>As their businesses grow and digitize, entrepreneurs across industries are embracing the cloud and adopting technologies like machine learning and data analytics to optimize business performance, save time and cut expenses. There are countless benefits to small businesses and startups. For one, the cloud makes data accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, enabling the seamless collaboration necessary in a hybrid work environment. Without having to spend on expensive hardware and software, entrepreneurs can invest in other areas as they scale their businesses.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In algorithmic investing, investors use a company’s metrics to decide whether to participate in a deal. But when the art of choice is factored out, it becomes more difficult to perform deep due diligence on founders who may be about to receive millions of dollars via a wire transfer.</p>
<p>In practice, attempts to remove bias can create newer, blind spots that are harder to identify.</p>
<p>In theory, algorithmic investing hedges against investors&#8217; preconceived notions and pushes emotions to the side. Fintech unicorn Clearco and venture firm SignalFire have spent years implementing data-focused investment processes, joined more recently by AngelList and Hum Capital. While this approach isn’t new, the movement against solely emotion-based decisions feels louder given the proliferation of dollars out there.</p>
<p>Metrics, even in the earliest stages, are becoming more mainstream.</p>
<p>AngelList’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/angellist-just-closed-a-25m-fund-to-back-startups-based-on-hiring-velocity/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">recently closed early-stage venture fund </a>is basing all of its investments off of one key metric that AngelList has been tracking for years: a startup’s ability to hire.</p>
<p>When I spoke to Abraham Othman, head of the investment committee and data science at AngelList Venture, he told me they win deals because they are less adversarial to portfolio companies than other firms.“Our approach? This is our data set &#8212; let’s see if we can put money into them,” he said.</p>
<p>No further due diligence? No problem.</p>
<p>It’s no small set. About 2 million individuals use AngelList Talent to apply to startups each quarter. About 35,000 companies per quarter are contenders for AngelList talent, but only half of those companies are investable early-stage businesses.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You have to begin somewhere. When Jayce Hafner and Sami Tellatin bonded as Stanford MBA classmates over their shared belief that helping U.S. farms run more efficiently would be good for the country and a great business, they decided to start with grants.</p>
<p>For her part, Hafner grew up on a cattle ranch in Virginia and knew firsthand that applying for grants &#8212; even to improve the sustainable farming practices of her family&#8217;s farm &#8212; was a confusing and time-intensive process. As for Tellatin, she studied biological engineering as an undergrad and spent three years with the USDA, researching farm economics. She knew, too, that farmers might make better choices if grants were more available to them.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://farmraise.com">FarmRaise</a>, a now 12-person, two-year-old, San Diego, Ca.-based company that has made considerable progress since the two joined forces with another cofounder, Albert Abedi, who they met through the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/check-out-these-startups-from-pears-demo-day-theres-usually-a-breakout-or-two-in-the-bunch/">accelerator program</a> of Pear VC, the Palo Alto-based firm.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to Hafner, the company already has nearly 10,000 farms on the platform thanks to word of mouth, a dash of search-engine magic, and, importantly, partnerships it has struck with agriculture giants like Cargill and Corteva (spun out of DuPont in 2018) that have carbon emission reduction goals to meet and have begun directing farmers to FarmRaise for help with grants tied to low-carbon farming.</p>
<p>FarmRaise&#8217;s platform &#8212; which asks for granular farm insights, then structures the data in a way that allows FarmRaise to quickly apply for a wide variety of grant programs on its customers&#8217; behalf &#8211; also has enough momentum that investors are now in the mix. The team just landed $7.2 million in seed funding led by Susa Ventures.</p>
<p>Still, as with so many startups, Hafner says grants &#8212; both federal and private &#8212; are just the starting point for the very broad financial services company that FarmRaise intends to become. Imagine, suggests Hafner, that once a farm has provided much of its data to the company, that FarmRaise can help it land loans, secure equipment at bulk prices, and help with the farm&#8217;s tax planning.</p>
<p>Many of these services will be provided through third parties, she says, with FarmRaise collecting finders&#8217; fees. FarmRaise isn&#8217;t looking to reinvent the wheel. But there&#8217;s also no reason that farmers shouldn&#8217;t have a &#8220;full-stack&#8221; resource to which to turn, she adds. Besides, other services can keep customers satisfied while they wait to learn whether or not they landed a grant, some of which have wait times of six to 12 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Grants are &#8220;our wedge,&#8221; Hafner says. &#8220;They are not the end of the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, FarmRaise is focused on hiring more employees, lining up more grants, and making sure its customers are happy with the services it provides currently and for which it charges a monthly subscription, along with 10% of the value of the grants it secures.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to get right. Grants are a big opportunity, suggests Hafner, including because USDA funding has &#8220;been growing like crazy,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>She points to the Trump administration, which distributed &#8220;tens of billions of dollars&#8221; in funding to support farmers who struggled with Covid-related supply-chain disruptions.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also has FarmRaise feeling encouraged, she adds, &#8220;We&#8217;re seeing this keen focus on growing the size of the pie for conservation funding and it likely doubling in the years to come.&#8221; It only makes sense, she suggests. &#8220;Not only does [sustainable farming] increase farm profitability but it also sequesters carbon and can help to address climate change. They are just many, many, many benefits that come with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other participants in the company&#8217;s seed round include Cendana Capital, Ulu Ventures, Pear, Better Tomorrow Ventures, Incite Ventures, and Financial Ventures Studio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google filed a motion Friday asking a federal court to dismiss most of the counts in an antitrust lawsuit led by the state of Texas. In the filing, the company argued that the Texas lawsuit isn&#8217;t &#8220;credible&#8221; and that the state failed to establish that the company&#8217;s ad business has run afoul of antitrust laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;AG Paxton&#8217;s allegations are more heat than light, and we don&#8217;t believe they meet the legal standard to send this case to trial,&#8221; Google Director of Economic Policy Adam Cohen <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-false-claims-still-dont-add-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in a blog post</a>. &#8220;The complaint misrepresents our business, products and motives, and we are moving to dismiss it based on its failure to offer plausible antitrust claims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the suit, which alleges that Google illegally maintained a monopoly in online advertising, in late 2020. Texas <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/14/facebook-google-ad-market-lawsuit-527108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated the suit with a new complaint</a> last week that was first filed in November but redacted at the time, before a judge ordered the details of the complaint to be made public.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260864" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Kentucky and Puerto Rico have also joined the lawsuit seeking to hold the tech giant accountable.</p>

<p>Google claims that Paxton &#8220;overlooks, or misstates, a litany of clear facts,&#8221; including allegations that the company made a deal with Facebook to maintain its online ad dominance by crushing an emerging ad buying process called &#8220;header bidding.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/technology/google-facebook-ad-deal-antitrust.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting from The New York Times</a>, Facebook announced the relationship in 2018 but did not disclose that Google granted its competitor &#8220;special information and speed advantages to help the company succeed in the auctions that it did not offer to other partners — even including a guaranteed &#8216;win rate.'&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mired in its own antitrust woes, Meta similarly asked the court to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/12/lawsuit-aiming-to-break-up-facebook-group-meta-can-go-ahead-us-court-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dismiss an antitrust lawsuit</a> that could force the company to sell Instagram and WhatsApp, but a judge ruled earlier this month that the FTC&#8217;s refiled suit would be allowed to proceed.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency and blockchain had a breakout year in 2021.</p>
<p>ust look at the numbers: 80 million unique crypto wallets; Bitcoin and Ether grew 60% and 407%, respectively; El Salvador adopted bitcoin as official currency; the NFT market generated $2.5 billion in trades. Even Burger King announced a whopper when they got in on the NFT action. Impressive? Absolutely. Have we reached a point where crypto and blockchain reach mass adoption? Well, not quite.</p>
<p>Even though DeFi, cryptocurrencies, blockchains, NFTs and a slew of other products came online in 2021, only about 1% of the world’s population has a unique crypto wallet. Media coverage, financial institutions, and companies with hefty marketing budgets jumped in and made it seem as if mass adoption was already here. But in reality, we’re not there yet.</p>
<p>However, we anticipate that changing in 2022. From more creative crypto entries to the impact of inflation and new technologies, here are five trends we expect in 2022, and what you can do to navigate the challenges ahead.</p>
<h2>Expect more diverse uses for crypto</h2>
<p>For the most part, consumers are aware that crypto exists, but they don’t understand its benefits in their day-to-day lives. For many, it’s seen as an investment tool for institutional or retail investors, a novelty, or something that caters primarily to the trendiest of the Gen Z crowd. With blockchain games and GameFi, as well as reward redemption platforms that trade airline miles into crypto on the horizon, expect this to change in 2022.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some of this already in 2021 with NFTs that cater to art collectors and sports enthusiasts. We&#8217;ll see it branch out into other areas such as wine, sneakers and other collectibles, bringing in new users.</p>
<p>For the mass consumer, understanding these technologies can be challenging, but when NFTs are tied to something they know and are enthusiastic about, it’ll start growing among that community. Keep an eye on enterprising companies pushing into these areas – specifically collectibles – as a way to broaden the reach of crypto and blockchain in 2022.</p>
<h2>A surge in crypto apps</h2>
<p>Crypto is considered technically complicated to hold, and for the layperson, even the terminology is difficult to understand. Crypto and blockchain need to be easy to use and understand before mass adoption can happen, and that’s what we’ll see in 2022.</p>
<p>Cheaper blockchains are allowing new users to onboard with DApps, which are decentralized applications that run on a P2P or blockchain network. They don’t require users to submit their personal information. It’ll start with global digital asset payments, recurring buys, or tipping, but will grow to include multiple types of transactions, which will only increase user adoption.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 21, 2022! I normally try to bring some pep to my little intros in this missive. But today I am going to avoid astroturfing my own mood to simply say, hey, what&#8217;s up with the stock market? After a period of time when things only went up, have we flipped the coin? I am not going to say that I love it, but hey, at least it’s the weekend. – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/activision-blizzard-union-raven-software/">Is Microsoft buying a union?</a> </strong>Raven Software’s quality assurance department is forming a union at Activision Blizzard. TechCrunch called the move the “first union to form at a major U.S. gaming company.” Given that Microsoft is supposed to buy Raven Software’s parent company, the union situation has an even more interesting flavor than most tech union news that we’ve seen lately.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/vcs-approached-facebook-to-fund-a-spinout-of-workplace-valued-at-over-1b-but-facebook-declined/">VCs wanted to spin-out Facebook’s Slack competitor</a>:</strong> Facebook’s internal work tool that it turned into a product won’t be leaving the confines of the Meta corporation. TechCrunch learned that VCs wanted the social giant to spin it out at a valuation north of $1 billion, but Team Zuck didn’t bite.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/netflixs-dismal-results-are-more-evidence-that-the-pandemic-trade-is-over/">Netflix’s poor results prove the pandemic trade is over</a>:</strong> After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/netflix-q4-2021-results-subscriber-numbers/">reporting numbers</a> that left Wall Street less than enthused, the value of Netflix stock tanked today. The result, and resulting investor reaction underscores our general belief that the pandemic trade is behind us. Recall that in late December, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/the-era-of-ultra-rich-software-valuations-could-be-behind-us/">TechCrunch asked</a> if the era of super-rich tech valuations was behind us. The answer? Yeah, it looks like it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/european-spend-management-platform-moss-raises-86-million/">If you are working on corporate spend, please collect your check</a>: </strong>As Ramp, Brex, and Airbase battle it out in the United States, Moss’ work to build a corporate spend behemoth in Europe is attracting allies. Rich ones, it turns out, as the company just landed $86 million. The company is now worth nearly $600 million, thanks to its latest share sale.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/cana-technology-raises-glass-to-new-capital-as-it-readies-beverage-printer-for-market/">Please print me one (1) mocktail</a>: </strong>One of the funniest bits of a Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series of novels is the silly spaceship that can’t make tea. It can, to paraphrase, make something that is <em>akin</em> to tea, but not quite. That’s a long-winded way of saying that beverage printing is not a new concept. But it is a new reality, at least to my brain. Cana Technology just unveiled what it calls “the world’s first molecular beverage printer.” To which we ask: Can it make tea? Either way, this sounds dope.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/paris-based-vc-firm-partech-unveils-chapter54-accelerator-to-help-european-startups-cross-into-africa/">Europe -&gt; Africa</a>:</strong> The African technology startup market is accelerating. That’s known. But what if you are building a company, say in Europe, and want to move into the African market? Venture firm Partech’s new Chapter54 accelerator is working on just that problem, TechCrunch reports.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/israels-entree-capital-raises-300m-for-israel-focused-fund-adi-gozes-becomes-partner/">Another Israeli VC puts together a new fund</a>: </strong>2022 is shaping up to be a hot year for the Israeli technology scene, with Entrée Capital announcing a $300 million fund. That’s the second new fund from Israel thus far this year that we can name. So much for a slowdown, yeah?</li>

<p>It’s great to have a stake in the company you’re helping to build, but when employees don’t know the optimal way to exercise their stock options, they usually end up with a raw deal.</p>
<p>Last year, startup employees paid an estimated $11 billion in avoidable taxes by exercising their options post-exit, rather than pre-exit, according to Secfi data.</p>
<p>In a post for TechCrunch+, CEO Frederik Mijnhardt shared his analysis of the biggest trends around stock options in 2021, including why, despite stellar IPOs, most employees couldn’t exercise their options until after the exit, dramatically increasing their tax liability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead to 2022, it seems that the industry’s current trend toward mega-sized rounds of funding and longer exit timelines mean that for the average startup employee, their total cost to exercise stock options will continue to rise,&#8221; says Mijnhardt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

More when the company reports earnings, as this story is far from over.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/intel-eyes-ohio-for-a-pair-of-chip-factories-amid-global-shortage/">Intel could build a huge plant in Ohio</a>:</strong> Building chips is expensive, and hard to spin up.

<h2>Software consulting</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/21/how-should-non-technical-founders-collaborate-with-software-developers/">(TechCrunch+) How should non technical founders collaborate with software developers?</a> Miranda Halpern continues the TechCrunch Experts project by interviewing CEO of Wolfpack Digital, Georgina &#8216;Gina&#8217; Lupu Florian.</p>
<p><strong>What percentage of your clients are non-technical people who have an idea, but no coding experience? How much of a limitation is that for launching an app?</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259954" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I would say probably around 50% of our clients are in this situation, either as founders of a startup, or as representatives of companies (product owners in scale-ups, or people in corporate innovation departments, for example). We are here to help with every step of the way, so we don’t see it as a limitation at all.</p>
<p>However, it’s true that having previous experience working with agencies/developers may be useful in terms of familiarity with the software development processes. But absolutely anyone, regardless of their background, can get up to speed quickly, and we are here to support them.</p>

<blockquote><p>Today, 96% of visitors to your website aren’t ready to buy. Instead, they are either becoming familiar with your brand (awareness stage) or considering your products as one of many options (consideration stage). In these initial phases, you want potential prospects to put their contact details down so that you can engage them with personalized emails in the future. Unfortunately, very few customers just hand over their data like that. This is exactly where alluring magnets enter the equation.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;ve worked at early-stage startups where we relied on our best guesses to shape product pipelines and develop marketing strategies.</p>
<p>I have also held jobs at companies where we engaged directly with current and past customers to ask them what they wanted. You can probably guess which approach generated more favorable outcomes.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s done informally via a Reddit AMA or a Twitter Space, it&#8217;s never a bad idea to interact with people who use your products and services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260745" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Well-researched personas are useful, but nothing is better than talking to a customer if you want to understand what delights them — and what they&#8217;re willing to pay for.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/how-to-build-a-product-advisory-council-for-your-startup/">With a product advisory council (PAC)</a>, early-stage startups can tap into the their users&#8217; hive mind. The benefits are many: PACs can help validate everything from marketing campaigns to future product planning.</p>
<p>But to build one, founders must first define clear goals and create value for participants. In this seven-step guide, you&#8217;ll find strategies and tactics for identifying key members and influencers, streamlining the communication process, and creating &#8220;a little FOMO.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading TechCrunch+ this week. I hope you have a relaxing weekend!</p>

<p>Risk is an essential part of gambling, so it may be improper to describe Microsoft’s planned purchase of Activision Blizzard as a “bet.”</p>
<p>Considering that Microsoft has a market cap over $2 trillion, purchasing a gaming company that pumps out titles like Call of Duty, Guitar Hero and Candy Crush for $68 billion isn’t exactly fraught with danger.</p>
<p>According to Box CEO Aaron Levie, the move solidifies Redmond’s entry into AR/VR gaming.</p>
<p>“If you believe VR and immersive computing is the future — whether for consumer or business use cases — Activision helps Microsoft build a flywheel of content and technology that gets more users on board to this future.”</p>

<p>2021 was a year like no other when it came to venture investment, and this year is poised to tread a similar path, writes 500 Global’s CEO and co-founder, Christine Tsai.</p>
<p>According to Tsai, 2022 will see web3 going mainstream, more capital flowing to underestimated founders, and broader investments in regions that have traditionally been overlooked.</p>
<p>“All signs point to a continued abundance of opportunities for startup founders and investors in the year ahead.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Quantum computing’s potential applications include machine learning and computer-aided drug design, but the industry is still very much in its early days.</p>
<p>In 2021, there were approximately 90 quantum investments that totaled $1.4 billion. A significant jump from $700 million the year before, but compared to SaaS, not even a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>Even so, we’re already seeing quantum exits: IonQ reached a $2 billion valuation after its 2021 SPAC, and Rigetti plans to do the same this year as it develops its superconducting quantum computer.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive market map of the quantum computing industry, Maria Lepskaya, a senior associate at Runa Capital, sorted the top companies in the space into 12 quadrants, “each corresponding to particular quantum technology and a stage of startups.”</p>

<p>Climate tech startups raised $32 billion in 2021, but that amount is nowhere close to the estimated $2.5-$4.8 trillion required to fund enough adaptation and mitigation projects to make a meaningful difference.</p>
<p>Private investors can&#8217;t fill the gap alone, but VCs are in a unique position to change this dynamic.</p>
<p>By backing climate startups, they can de-risk proven climate tech, build legitimacy to attract talent, help with scaling, attract new kinds of investors, and shape the overall ecosystem, write investor Jamil Wyne and climate finance researcher Abrar Chaudhury.</p>
<p>“While most VC verticals will be assessed in terms of how much they return to investors, climate tech may be unique in that its success will also be determined, essentially, by its contribution to the preservation of our livelihoods and how much it can avoid a winner-take-all dynamic.”</p>

<p>It’s great to have a stake in the company you’re helping to build, but when employees don’t know the optimal way to exercise their stock options, they usually end up with a raw deal.</p>
<p>Last year, startup employees paid an estimated $11 billion in avoidable taxes by exercising their options post-exit, rather than pre-exit, according to Secfi data.</p>
<p>In a post for TechCrunch+, CEO Frederik Mijnhardt shared his analysis of the biggest trends around stock options in 2021, including why, despite stellar IPOs, most employees couldn’t exercise their options until after the exit, dramatically increasing their tax liability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead to 2022, it seems that the industry’s current trend toward mega-sized rounds of funding and longer exit timelines mean that for the average startup employee, their total cost to exercise stock options will continue to rise,&#8221; says Mijnhardt.</p>

<p>It’s important to ask potential investors questions, but first-time founders often alienate VCs by quizzing them about the breadth and depth of their knowledge.</p>
<p>The trick, according to Prashant Fonseka, a partner at Tuesday Capital: only ask <em>easy</em> questions.</p>
<p>“Save the challenging questions for a time when you’re selecting from multiple investors who are ready to write checks after you’ve convinced them your company is fundable.”</p>

<p>From Buy Now, Pay Later to open banking and social finance, fintech has scaled rapidly since the pandemic began. Investment has kept pace with growth: last year, fintech accounted for more than 20% of all venture investments.</p>
<p>In a deeply researched post, Mary Ann Azevedo and Alex Wilhelm examine how fintech overtook and outperformed every other sector to the point where its outlines mirror that of the broader venture market.</p>
<p>“To some degree, it appears that what is true for the venture capital market is also true for the fintech market, but in a more exaggerated form. Fintech is like most venture, but simply more extreme.”</p>

<p>China has a mature venture investment ecosystem, but recent interventions by the country’s government to rein in the tech sector have left many wondering whether startup investment in the country may suffer permanently.</p>
<p>In The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm makes the case that the country’s venture market will take a hit — but not a lethal one.</p>
<p>“There are lots of non-corporate investors in China who are still active. So long as they persist, the numbers will not collapse,&#8221; writes Alex.</p>
<p>&#8220;But potential new regulatory rules regarding major tech companies could prove to be a material knock to the country’s venture scene.”</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In a guest post by Marjorie Radlo-Zandi, the veteran angel investor shared five key elements she considers before investing.</span></p>
<p>Her advice is clear and simple, which makes it particularly valuable in an environment where startup funding is flowing faster than ever.</p>
<p>Few investors expect a first-time founder&#8217;s pitch deck to be the most definitive analysis of a particular sector, but you&#8217;re better off being cautious instead of overly optimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;An extraordinarily high projection signals you’re not altogether credible, and I advise you to avoid this mistake at all costs,&#8221; says Radlo-Zandi.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s never been a better time to found a startup, but you can&#8217;t catch pennies from VC heaven if there are holes in your story.</p>

<p>NFT marketplace OpenSea largely had the field to itself, but after competitor LooksRare announced an airdrop for its $LOOKS token last week, it overtook OpenSea in trading volume.</p>

<p>South Korean conglomerate LG produces everything from flat-screen TVs to soft drinks, so the idea that it would set up a startup incubator program isn&#8217;t a huge leap.</p>
<p>To learn more about the initiative, Haje Jan Kamps interviewed Sokwoo Rhee, LG’s corporate SVP and head of its North America Innovation Center.</p>
<p>“When I say new businesses, that can mean a lot of different things,&#8221; said Rhee. &#8220;We are willing to create a new business unit if the idea, suggestions and partnership hit a home run.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Business leaders are responsible for examining and implementing technologies that are proven, cost-effective and easy to use while also offering long-term solutions that reimagine workflows, speed up processes and increase productivity.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, executives predicted that increasing the use of advanced technologies in their organizations would take more than a year-and-a-half to implement. The actual timeline for advanced implementation over the past couple of years was <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">27 days</a>. Following that digital transformation, companies across industries are looking to pinpoint tools that support long-term growth and predictable outcomes in a constantly changing landscape.</p>
<p>One such technology proved an especially vital addition to businesses that had to quickly implement tools to meet customer service and training needs while maintaining essential safety protocols. Remote visual assistance software fulfilled those demands by offering users the virtual presence of company expertise through real-time video collaboration.</p>
<p>With augmented reality-enabled solutions now projected to be a <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/press/demand-augmented-reality-enterprise-and-consumer-markets-create-us175-billion-ar-market-2026/?utm_campaign=PRs%20not%20media&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=132681345&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Gqm6Of9GPnocyF4-qq_iOkYDwQoWl2WJ_2yGRX84pBx35Rh_mRHclxAORcuwek2FQs-oFbMqcLUhE2x_rY2RPK7RNBG2r62JCt9Yw1XI6ws79Eag&amp;utm_content=132681345&amp;utm_source=hs_email">$175 billion market by 2026</a>, a technology like remote visual assistance has the potential to seamlessly integrate into current support processes and systems, with intuitive features that make it a good fit for many potential users, including customers and technicians.</p>
<p>Businesses in industries such as office equipment, medical and scientific equipment, telecommunications and industrial equipment have all seen measurable improvement in critical business metrics after adopting remote visual assistance software, particularly in their manufacturing, field service, HR, engineering and customer service departments.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			To make your sessions more effective, users should prepare to share documents, photos and other helpful files in real time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As leaders contemplate how to incorporate AR-enabled technology into their current systems, they’ll need to understand the tangible benefits of the solution, as well as how it will impact existing workflows and the environment needed to optimize its implementation.</p>
<p>Consider these factors as you assess the value of implementing remote visual assistance software into your tech stack.</p>
<h2>Workflow reviews</h2>
<p>Be prepared to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-021-06871-4">review your workflows</a> in any area where you’re planning to incorporate remote visual assistance software. While the technology will streamline many processes, it may also change who’s involved and when they join the process. The best way to prepare for any changes to those workflows is to scrutinize current processes and identify where remote visual assistance can make the most significant impact.</p>
<p>In the customer service domain, for instance, a customer service agent who can use the software to virtually reach into the customer’s field of view, quickly inspect equipment, and demonstrate how to complete a repair will offset numerous calls from being escalated to additional technicians. In another case, an agent might use the software to help identify and troubleshoot a problem remotely and, in doing so, realize the issue requires a higher level of expertise. The next step for that customer would be another remote visual assistance session, this time with an experienced technician.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most anyone who&#8217;s moved to a new apartment has had the same experience: Whatever broadband provider everyone else in the building has, you have. This kind of lock-in could become less common if <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairwoman-rosenworcel-aims-promote-broadband-choice-apartments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new proposal from the FCC</a> is adopted, preventing revenue-sharing between providers and building owners and opening the door to competitors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s largely because of the cost of wiring a building that an address tends to be served by a single broadband provider. And while investments should be rewarded to a certain extent, ISPs have found ways to keep strangleholds on whole neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Sometimes they&#8217;re (technically) above-board, like an agreement with a big apartment complex where the building management gets kickbacks. And sometimes they&#8217;re loopholes in existing rules, where an ISP arranges things so that it would be prohibitively expensive for a competitor to share infrastructure.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2260800" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new proposal, circulated internally today by FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel but summarized in a release, would prevent or mitigate some of these dirty tricks. It would ban revenue sharing agreements outright, require other arrangements (like marketing) to be disclosed to tenants and close loopholes that allow wiring to be effectively exclusive when it is meant to be leased or shared.</p>
<p>&#8220;With more than one-third of the U.S. population living in apartments, mobile home parks, condominiums, and public housing, it’s time to crack down on practices that lock out broadband competition and consumer choice,&#8221; said Rosenworcel. &#8220;Consumers deserve access to a choice of providers in their buildings. I look forward to having my colleagues join me in lifting the obstacles to competitive choice for broadband for the millions of tenants across the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission recently began looking into the issue, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-seeks-comment-broadband-access-multi-tenant-buildings-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening a comment period</a> and investigating the evidence — not surprisingly, they found &#8220;a pattern of new practices that inhibit competition, contrary to the Commission’s goals, and limit opportunities for competitive providers to offer service for apartment, condo and office building unit tenants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosenworcel&#8217;s current proposal is the result of t1his — not a sweeping new rule but a bit of problem solving aimed squarely at bad faith activity commonly undertaken by ISPs. The proposal will be made public at some point ahead of the FCC&#8217;s vote — and even if that was tomorrow, there would likely be a considerable grace period before any of these shady arrangements are revised. So if you&#8217;re hoping to switch providers soon somewhere you&#8217;ve got no choice&#8230; keep hoping. But maybe next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software consultants come in many forms, but if you cannot write your own code, finding a developer who meets your needs can be a stressful process that involves much trial and error.</p>
<p>To narrow down good consultancies, we polled experts across the world about the best software development consultants through our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/who-are-the-best-software-development-consultants-for-startups/">TechCrunch Experts</a> program. One of the most-recommended firms we learned about is <a href="https://www.wolfpack-digital.com/">WolfPack Digital</a>. We caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georginalupu/">Georgina &#8216;Gina&#8217; Lupu Florian</a>, CEO of Wolfpack Digital, to talk about her company, how they operate, and the nuances of running a consultancy.</p>
<p><em>(This interview has been edited for clarity and length.)</em></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259965" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: As a developer for hire, how involved do you get when helping clients validate ideas before they bring their apps to market?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gina Lupu Florian:</strong> Our clients often choose us as their sole product and technical partner for their project, which means that we are highly involved in helping them with idea validation. We are here to help them with product discovery and strategy, market analysis, UX/UI design, smoke testing, usability testing, and everything else that is needed to get it right. After the coding phase is completed for any iteration, we support with rolling out the app to beta-testers, and for learning iteratively from the results in a lean way so that an optimal first version reaches the targeted audience at the official launch of the product.</p>
<p>The degree to which we get involved with the idea validation may vary depending on the goals and needs of the project, the founders and/or stakeholders, and the stage at which the project is when we begin our collaboration. Developer-for-hire is a model that has been less common for us in the past few years given our product-oriented approach, although we have ongoing collaborations fitting that model too. We are open to accommodating any setup that works best for our clients and their mobile apps or web platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Can you describe the intake process for new clients? How do you assess their requirements, and what information do you need before you can share timelines and budgets?</strong></p>
<p>The intake process can vary a lot depending on the particularities of each project and collaboration. We typically assess the information provided by our clients and put together a proposal that we refine afterwards with the client as we discover more about the product along the way.</p>
<p>To get to a robust estimated project timeline and budget, we consider user stories, wireframes, and/or a requirements document as the perfect starting point. We can either collect them directly from our clients (if they have them ready after attending incubators, etc.), or we can help with putting them together and join a discovery phase, which typically takes from a few hours to a few days. From the moment we have enough information to prepare a proposal, it usually takes less than a week to deliver it.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>What&#8217;s a ballpark quote for the average project, and how frequently do you communicate with clients once the work is underway? </strong></p>
<p>In general, questions about quotes are probably amongst the most difficult and yet most common. This is because quotes for web and/or mobile projects can range all the way from a few thousand  dollars to millions. It all depends on the scope, and the more clarity there is, the more accurate the estimation. However, when we start a project, we want to make sure that we keep it agile and adapt so as to bring the best product to the market. It’s all about balancing being adaptable while keeping an eye on the budget.</p>
<p>Based on the projects we have taken on recently, the average project size has been in the $100,000 to $200,000 range. Since we are an Agile company, we communicate with clients very often, typically weekly. The communication frequency depends a lot on how hands-on the client wishes to be during the development process — we have projects where we sync with them almost daily, while on others our clients prefer fewer interactions so that they can focus on different parts of their business.</p>
<p><strong>What percentage of your clients are non-technical people who have an idea, but no coding experience? How much of a limitation is that for launching an app?</strong></p>
<p>I would say probably around 50% of our clients are in this situation, either as founders of a startup, or as representatives of companies (product owners in scale-ups, or people in corporate innovation departments, for example). We are here to help with every step of the way, so we don’t see it as a limitation at all.</p>
<p>However, it’s true that having previous experience working with agencies/developers may be useful in terms of familiarity with the software development processes. But absolutely anyone, regardless of their background, can get up to speed quickly, and we are here to support them.</p>
<p><strong>As a consultant, is helping clients avoid scope creep part of your role? If so, how do you help manage their expectations?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely! I think it’s part of our responsibility, and the most important ingredient is clarifying what the priorities are. We encourage ideation, of course, but in the end, we need to focus together on what brings the most value to the product. Besides having clarity with priorities, keeping an eye on a project’s budget and considering it in all decision-making contexts is crucial, as it can be quite eye-opening.</p>
<p>Estimating the work needed for any new feature/change so that informed decisions can be made is also part of the process. Our project managers/product owners also offer their support with relevant questions along the way, and we contribute with suggestions from our team to pragmatically reach the client’s goals with the best results given all the factors involved.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your average timeline for delivering a working app after you&#8217;ve signed a contract? What do you need to accomplish before you can share wireframes?</strong></p>
<p>If we are to start a web or mobile app from scratch, respectively, from a set of requirements, and discover it, design it, code it, validate it, etc., it usually takes anywhere from three months to over a year to get to the first version. Most often it’s around six to nine months. It has a lot to do with the complexity of the product, not just from a technical standpoint, but also from a functionalities and product experience perspective to make it attractive to users.</p>
<p>You want your app to have everything it needs so that it’s useful and gets adopted by users by turning it into a better option than whatever it is they are currently using to solve a problem. For a banking app, for example, delivering an app can take longer, because there are many integrations that need to be created, and the fintech market is quite competitive, so you need to have a strong backbone in terms of functionalities in your app. At the same time, the investment brings greater benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Do you also oversee the QA process? Can Wolfpack Digital help clients navigate the approval process for app stores?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We have an in-house QA team with a special knack for finding hidden issues, and they work closely with our developers and everyone else on the project. We have done App Store submissions hundreds of times, and we have handled a wide palette of scenarios with grace.</p>
<p>We find that approvals work seamlessly 90% of the time, but it may happen that some blockers are encountered (related to terms and conditions, for example), in which case we are ready to take on the communication on behalf of our clients and find a solution, as well as translate to accessible language what the issue and the steps needed are.</p>
<p><strong>Do you provide any marketing services?</strong></p>
<p>This has been part of our plan for a while as we actively receive requests for such services, but we are currently only marketing our own brand and don’t offer marketing execution services to clients. Based on the in-house knowledge that we have on the topic, though, we help our clients with market and audience analysis for their digital products — not just in the beginning, but also as the app scales, to suggest new features based on available data, for example.</p>
<p>So we cover marketing strategy for our clients as part of our product strategy and consultancy service. As a company, we have won awards in global competitions focusing on app concepts and product strategy, and therefore we are particularly passionate about this topic, which includes some strong marketing elements.</p>
<p><strong>Do you work on both hybrid and native apps? What can you tell us about the benefits and drawbacks of each, and when do you encourage clients to go hybrid?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we work on both native and hybrid technologies for mobile apps, and the choice depends on each project&#8217;s type and particularities. There are a few important scenarios where we believe in the power of native iOS and Android. The first one is when scalability and stability are very important right from the beginning — with fintech apps, for example. It&#8217;s very likely they will grow in both complexity and user base, so it&#8217;s crucial to have a stable app that people can rely on.</p>
<p>Native apps scale better over time, as they use the native frameworks created by Apple and Google, so you don&#8217;t have any limits in terms of what can you do. Furthermore, with each new iOS or Android update, the native tech gets updates first, so you can tackle any OS surprises upfront.</p>
<p>Another scenario would be when the app needs to use the hardware capabilities of the phone: Bluetooth, camera, GPS, gyroscope, etc. On the native side, you have direct access to those SDKs, but with hybrid, you need to write your own plugins (in native code), or rely on existing ones from the open-source community. This can become problematic, especially with certain edge-cases (auto-reconnect, change the camera&#8217;s parameters, etc).</p>
<p>Hybrid technologies are a good fit when you are looking for quick validation of an idea, or when you&#8217;re dealing with a simple mobile app that relies pretty much on the backend. If 90% of the app is just data that you input (forms or questionnaires, for example, for a healthcare app to collect feedback), or display data from the server-side (numbers, charts, or recommendations), then Flutter can be the best option because there aren&#8217;t any functionality-related surprises to expect here. Moreover, Flutter allows you to create identical UIs for iOS and Android, if that&#8217;s one of the goals, although it&#8217;s mostly better to use native elements for each one.</p>
<p>The development time to market is typically shorter if you go for native, because you can move swiftly on two tracks in parallel, while the overall budget, at least initially, is probably higher for native. In the long run, however, hybrid may raise certain challenges that bring the budget of the project to a similar level or even exceed what native offers, depending on what challenges you find on the way, or what new functionality you need to implement.</p>
<p>The maintainability of hybrid is definitely a strong pro, as you have one single code base to maintain. Nonetheless, you need to have devs working on it who are knowledgeable on the chosen hybrid technology as well as on native, in case any plugins are needed, which may make staffing difficult. Overall, there is no right or wrong answer between native and hybrid, and the best choice depends a lot on the particularities of your app.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever turned down a client? Are there kinds of apps you won’t work on, like e.g, games or dating?</strong></p>
<p>We have turned down clients, and, although our portfolio is quite diverse, it’s important for us that we work on projects that match our values and ethics. We have worked on dating apps, for example, but we’d turn down requests for websites or apps dealing with weapons, illegal drugs, etc.</p>
<p>Games represent a space we have not entered, as the technologies and design capabilities needed to develop games are quite different from our own (including the programming languages used — for example, we use Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, Swift, Kotlin, and Flutter, while Unity is used for games quite commonly). However, many of the apps we develop have a very strong gamification aspect.</p>
<p><strong>Who owns the source code once the project is complete? How is the source code managed?</strong></p>
<p>Typically the client owns the source code, and all the intellectual property rights belong to them, from day one. This is something that is also specified in our service agreement. When it comes to managing the source code, we cover different scenarios, but we usually have a private version-control (Git) repository on our side for each project. The team that works on the project has access to this repository, pushing code regularly while following the Git-flow guidelines.</p>
<p>Once the project is complete, or even at intermediate steps, we transfer the source code to a repository owned by the client. If needed, we assist them with creating a version-control account, then one or more repositories (depending on how many technologies are needed for that project — iOS, Android, backend, etc.), and finally with giving us access to transfer the source code to them.</p>
<p>They will of course also be able to see the commit history and each step along the way. In case any updates are needed, we can either continue to work on our own repositories and transfer the code updates again or push the code updates directly to their repositories. We also have collaborations where we work with the client’s in-house dev team, and therefore the entire team is active on the same repository at all times.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Breaking into Japan is often one of the biggest challenges a growing tech company will encounter. The country is home to some of the world’s most advanced software and hardware leaders. For the startups that cater to these companies, “cracking Japan” is inevitably part of their growth and expansion roadmaps.</p>
<p>But the barriers to entry are high. From language and culture differences to the need to tailor offerings for a Japanese audience, many early-stage tech companies write off Japan as impossible or too difficult to break into, even if the country is inevitably part of their growth and expansion roadmap.</p>
<p>In 2014, our company attracted its first Japanese client when we were featured on product discovery platform <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>. While this initial awareness got us on users’ radar, awareness alone wasn’t enough to sustain and grow a reliable pipeline. We grew this initial interest to 400+ of our highest paying clients over the past eight years by making community — both virtual and in-person — central to our offering and our approach to relationship-building, all without having a dedicated presence in the county.</p>
<p>As a SaaS company with a community-led growth model, our journey to breaking into Japan might be different to companies with other models, but the core tenets remain the same. Here’s what we learned along the way.</p>
<h2>Follow the first user(s)</h2>
<p>The tech community in Japan is extremely active and interconnected, so a single customer can play a disproportionately large role in facilitating your expansion there. Our experience is that if the first users like it, they’ll be your number one ambassadors. If they don’t, their indifference will also speak volumes. With this in mind, your product should be ready for prime time before you begin working with Japanese prospects. Japan is not a testing ground for MVP products.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As much as companies want to “be in Japan,” they don’t always spend enough time in the country.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Once you have even the smallest amount of traction or market adoption, consider setting up Japanese-language mention tracking. It can be surprising how quickly – and publicly – word about good technology will proliferate through social channels.</p>
<p>Our first user was a developer at one of Japan’s largest emerging tech companies. As Bitrise began spreading throughout his organization, we began seeing a number of new customers organically popping up at other companies as well.</p>
<p>Through our mention tracking service (we use <a href="https://mention.com/en/">Mention.com</a>), we were able to see how the user adoption we were experiencing directly correlated with local discussions about us on social media.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
