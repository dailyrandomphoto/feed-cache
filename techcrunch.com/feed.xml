										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cloudsmith.com/">Cloudsmith</a>, a cloud platform for software supply chain management, has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Tiger Global, which it claims is the largest ever Series A funding round in Northern Ireland since 2005 (according to PitchBook data). The company plans to use the new funding to hire 60 new employees and expand its US sales and engineering teams.</p>
<p>Other investors in the round include Shasta, Amaranthine, Sorenson, and Leadout Capital as well as previous investors Frontline, MMC, and Techstart. Docker CEO Scott Johnston, Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar, and Puppet CEO Yvonne Wassenaar also participated in the round.</p>
<p>The Belfast-headquartered startup allows businesses to manage all the incoming software it uses via the cloud, meaning you don’t have to have dedicated support staff in the office which requires dedicated staffing, VPNs, and licenses.</p>
<p>Cloudsmith says its software scans for security vulnerabilities and has customers in Europe, the US, the Middle East, and Australia, including the Internet Systems Consortium, Carta, and Font Awesome.</p>
<p>Cloudsmith was founded in 2016 by former NYSE developers Alan Carson and Lee Skillen and announced a £2.1 million seed investment round led by Frontline Ventures, MMC Ventures, and Techstart in 2019.</p>
<p>Alan Carson, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Cloudsmith, said: “Cloudsmith was built to tackle the complexity of managing software assets, which is a key challenge for any company to secure their software supply chains. Our service allows our customers to track and control the distribution of any software asset and provides tooling to minimize the risks of utilizing open-source software. It’s a massive problem for the whole industry and our investors, led by Tiger Global, understand the need for a fully managed cloud-native solution that Cloudsmith provides.”</p>
<p>Vidya Raman, Principal at Sorenson Ventures, said: “While package management is by no means a new or flashy software space, it is a critical component of the software development lifecycle. The need for both cloud-native software development and secure software supply chains has resulted in the need to reinvent package management. That’s where Cloudsmith’s Continuous Packaging platform has come in and continues to lead that market. It is in the new world that Cloudsmith truly shines.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch over a call, Carson added: “If you think about the last 10 years, it&#8217;s been about, building automated pipelines. For companies to do deployments or distribute their software to other companies, they need tools, but they also need to move the assets around and store the assets that are both being pulled into that process and generated by that process and that&#8217;s what CloudSmith ultimately does.”</p>
<p>He added: “Other companies tend to have legacy solutions. Our product is fully managed and makes it a lot easier for companies. They don&#8217;t have to put any resource behind keeping it up, we&#8217;ll handle it for them. So the total cost of ownership is lower. And they can spend more time actually crafting the software rather than worrying about how to store and distribute it within their internal systems.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global pandemic, along with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/digital-transformation/">digital transformation</a> it accelerated, broadened corporate attack surfaces exponentially. As a result, there were almost 1,800 publicly reported data breaches in the first six months of 2021 alone, accounting for the exposure of 18.8 billion records. Among these were devastating, large-scale breaches of consumer names, contact details, and financial records, such as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/the-accellion-data-breach-continues-to-get-messier/">ongoing Accellion compromise</a> that has impacted over 100 companies, organizations, and government agencies, and the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/t-mobile-says-at-least-47m-current-and-former-customers-affected-by-data-breach/">T-Mobile breach that exposed the details of 47 million customers</a>.</p>
<p>Tide Foundation, a Sydney-based, five-person startup competing in TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield this week, claims that its &#8220;first-of-its-kind&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/encryption/">encryption</a> protocol could make this so-called “cyber breach pandemic” &#8212; a tagline the non-profit was using before the global crisis struck &#8212; a thing of the past.</p>
<p>However, tackling cybercrime hasn’t always been the mission of Tide co-founders Michael Loewy and Yuval Hertzog. In fact, the startup was born out of the team’s prior business, a marketing platform called Ziva that helped to connect enterprises with consumers over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/iot/">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) devices. While the business grew quickly, attracting a number of big-name enterprise clients, Ziva soon ran into a privacy problem when architecting a campaign for Kellogg’s. The campaign in question was a “Special K Fitness Challenge,” with participants sharing data from wearables with rewards based on the number of kilometers completed.</p>
<p>“We collected accounts of tens of thousands of people, and we knew everything about their lives &#8211; way beyond what they knew themselves; their habits, health, and even their nutrition,” said Hertzog, who runs the technology side of the startup. “This was a treasure trove for enterprises, but we couldn’t avoid the fact that we’re sitting on very sensitive information.”</p>
<p>Tide realized that it needed to safeguard this data but failed to find an existing solution that ticked all of the boxes. That’s when Tide, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a>-based encryption method, was masterminded.</p>
<p>The protocol, which the startup claims is the first &#8220;true&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zero-trust/">zero trust</a> authentication method, can be deployed into an organization to encrypt sensitive data, such as customer records and financial information. Each record has its own encryption key, and each key is controlled by that specific consumer. Tide says that by giving consumers full control over their data, and allowing them to set specific parameters to determine when and for what purpose their data can be accessed, organizations cannot transfer any information to a third party without the consumer granting permission first.</p>
<p>“No one has nailed a proper zero trust model, because no one really has zero in their trust model. We are the only one offering an entirely zero trust model,” said Lowery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s “virtually impossible” to hack, too, according to the startup. The data is split between a group of nodes, and no node has access to or knowledge of the whole key, or the authority to act on its own. This makes malicious access to your key almost impossible.</p>
<p>“When &#8211; not if &#8211; you hack it, you have to invest resources to hack at least 20 computers, at 20 locations around the world, and even then you reach a fraction of the data you are after,” said Hertzog, adding that while Tide has worked to make its technology hacker-proof, it’s also been keen to ensure it passes the “grandpa test.”</p>

<p>“This link between the human world and the computer world is very challenging. We put a lot of effort into human interaction, and we built a way for human beings to engage with the system through the simplest mechanism that exists today, which is username and password,&#8221; said Hertzog. “It’s definitely not foolproof, but at least with us, it’s billions of times harder to attack you using a password. Saying that, our technology starts with supporting usernames and passwords, but it can support biometric authentication.”</p>
<p>To date, the Tide Foundation has raised the equivalent of $2 million, primarily from Angel investors, and the five-year-old startup has also secured the backing of some big names in the cybersecurity world. Willy Susilo, a distinguished professor at the School of Computing and Information Technology in Wollongong, Australia, is an adviser to the company, alongside the likes of former Microsoft director Peter Ostickand and Tom Dery, former global chairman of M&amp;C Saatchi.</p>
<p>The well-supported startup is now focused on getting Tide out to the market, and as a result of the pandemic and the cybersecurity chaos that ensued, it’s already in demand.</p>
<p>“We were talking to companies abut privacy and protection before the pandemic, and the response we got was that ‘if we get hacked, we’re in good company,'&#8221; Hertzog said. “The conversation changes after Covid. We’ve been chased down by the academic world, healthcare, law practices, and critical infrastructure &#8211; an entire area that is completely exposed.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“We’re always trying to stick something up a women’s something.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steviemichellecline/">Stevie Cline</a>, the co-founder of <a href="https://www.prenome.com/">Prenome</a>, is tired of how invasive diagnostic processes are for women, even with modern technology and broader healthcare advancements. So, she teamed up with her former co-worker, Sarah Brozio, to launch a startup all about providing actionable insights to women &#8211; no poking or prodding needed.</p>
<p>Prenome, going through TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield this week, is launching a saliva-based genetic test, paired with a behavioral app, to help women navigate gestational diabetes, a common condition that comes up while pregnant.</p>
<p>The startup’s success is rooted inextricably to data. In May, Prenome began recruiting patients who have had gestational diabetes for a clinical study, OneInSeven. The co-founders are using this data to build a more accurate pipeline of information about women’s health conditions, one that represents the actual diversity of women in the United States.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201148" style="width: 961px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201148" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2201148" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png" alt="Prenome could help pregnant women better predict and manage gestational diabetes" width="951" height="951" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 951px) 100vw, 951px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201148" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Prenome</p></div></p>
<p>Once Prenome extracts a genetic risk score, it combines it with a risk score built off of social determinants, with factors like previous trauma, disposable income, proximity to grocery stores. By combining these two factors, Prenome claims it can accurately predict gestational diabetes at a 90% accuracy rate, compared to the 80% baseline today.</p>
<p>The co-founders picked gestational diabetes over the plethora of other women’s health conditions because it has a strong genetic component. Cline explained how gestational diabetes is predictable and preventable, which gives Prenome a chance at screening high-risk individuals and also providing interventions that will help them prevent getting gestational diabetes early on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once Prenome is able to develop technology that helps women navigate gestational diabetes, it can use that insight to better address associated conditions, such as infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;People think that genetic diseases are usually caused by a single gene or a single chromosomal disorder, like Down Syndrome or Cystic Fibrosis,&#8221; Crozio said. &#8220;[They] wanted this idea that one gene equals one problem so we can fix that &#8211; but that&#8217;s actually really untrue for most of our health.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>She explained part of the driver for the biobank is to be able to mine it for more and more indications on triggers within women&#8217;s health conditions. Similar to hormonal health, genetic health is complicated yet key in understanding the common threads between these conditions.</p>
<p>Prenome’s biggest stance may be that it doesn’t want to test for any condition that it can’t intervene or improve on.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re never going to do a test [for] risk [of] Alzheimer&#8217;s in your 80s because there&#8217;s nothing really right now that we can do to prevent that from happening, women don’t need more stress” Cline said. “If we are telling you [that you are] high risk, it&#8217;s something that you can improve on, we can intervene on, we can provide for.”</p>
<p>Over a year since launch, Prenome has so far filed patents on both its test and methodology. It also plans to publish research with data from its OneInSeven Study.</p>
<p>The saliva-based test, which it hopes to release in 2022, is working to get CLIA-certified, which would allow physicians to order it for their patients. Eventually, Prenome will pursue FDA-approval, which would allow Prenome to go direct-to-consumers.</p>
<p>“Having doctors feel like they are cut out of the loop and that they are not important and part of the women&#8217;s health cycle is detrimental for us,” Cline said. “We really want to focus on how we engage people [and] get them to want to get their patients to use our tests.”</p>
<p>Prenome early strides have been noticed, and bet on. So far, Prenome has attracted $1 million worth of interest from investors, including Cleo Capital, OnDeck&#8217;s Runway Fund, Johns Hopkins University, Wing VC, First In Ventures and A-Level Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">New Zealand-based electric utility bike company Ubco announced a partnership with TPK Holdings, a Taiwanese electric components manufacturing company, onstage at the Micromobility America conference in San Francisco on Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As part of the agreement, TPK will be leading Ubco&#8217;s Series B with a $10 million investment, bringing the company&#8217;s total funding to $23 million. TPK will also bring the company significant supply chain support as well as scaling and manufacturing capabilities in the near future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The partnership enables us to scale from being a producer that does individual production runs of some number of bikes to a point where we can get into rolling production and scale that up to thousands and potentially tens of thousands of vehicles,&#8221; Katherine Sandford, Ubco&#8217;s CEO and executive chair, told TechCrunch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">TPK also invested in Ubco&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/electric-utility-bike-startup-ubco-raises-10-million-to-fund-its-global-expansion/">$10 million convertible note round in June</a>, alongside a range of U.S. and New Zealand-based investors like Seven Peak Ventures, Nuance Capital, GD1, Snowball Effect and Enterprise Angels. At the time Ubco said the funding would help it expand internationally, specifically with an eye to the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the initial stage of the partnership, TPK&#8217;s large network of global suppliers will help Ubco ramp up production of its flagship 2X2 electric utility bike, which comes in an off-road version geared for farmers and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/ubco-2x2-adventure-bike-review-utility-that-shreds/">city version</a> geared for last-mile logistics. Ubco currently has two production factories in China, one for the bikes and one for the batteries. Having TPK&#8217;s support on the supply side will ultimately help reduce costs of production, says Sandford.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ubco is also gearing up to release two new vehicles for which TPK will provide dedicated manufacturing support. The company hopes to begin production for the <a href="https://www.ubcobikes.com/frx1-trail-bike/">FRX1</a>, an off-road trail bike for the recreational market, in 2022, and is working on a prototype for pre-release of a four-wheel utility vehicle the same year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ubco says the commitment from TPK also allows it to double down on its ESG values.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;TPK&#8217;s deep experience in manufacturing supply chains, particularly with complex electronics, will be invaluable in solving the industry-wide challenge of product recycling and end of life through collaboration,&#8221; said Sandford. &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This funding allows UBCO to be more bullish in standing up R&amp;D projects, such as cell chemistry work, that require more investment to bring to light of day. Further, it enables us to grow the team in critical supporting roles like increasing our testing capabilities and focusing on the management of our products at end of life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Ubco co-founder Timothy Allan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/electric-utility-bike-startup-ubco-raises-10-million-to-fund-its-global-expansion/">previously told TechCrunch</a> that the company is dedicated to ensuring a responsible end-of-life of its vehicles, which starts with making sure the product is modular enough to be broken down into its composite parts to be recycled the right way.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;When combined with our focus on building an intelligent platform, which enables subscription business models, we create a circular lifecycle where we are incentivized to maximize the usable life of the product,&#8221; said Sandford. &#8220;This additional funding helps us get the platform, operations and commercials in place to bring this circular mentality to the next level.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weather forecasting is a notoriously challenging field, but it’s an endeavor that is becoming ever more vital to the daily functioning of our planet. Climate change is intensifying the scale and devastation of natural disasters, from wildfires and typhoons to floods and cyclones. Knowing precisely when and where a disaster strikes (or, even, just getting a few hours advanced notice) can drastically change the outcome for the populations affected.</p>
<p>In this field, Microsoft sees both an opportunity to do good as well as a lucrative niche to secure for its cloud computing service Azure. Through its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth">AI for Earth</a> program, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/microsoft-launches-ai-for-earth-to-give-2m-in-services-to-environmental-projects/">which we last covered during its launch in 2017</a>, the company has compiled a series of offerings into what it dubs a “planetary computer.” Those offerings include APIs for identifying objects as well as species of plants and animals. AI for Earth offers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth-grants">grants</a> for scientists and others to use Azure in their own research and modeling. The program joins other Microsoft cloud initiatives such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/microsoft-takes-wraps-off-40m-ai-for-health-initiative/">AI for Health</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/microsoft-commits-25m-to-its-ai-for-accessibility-program/">AI for Accessibility</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft launches AI for Earth to give $2M in services to environmental projects&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/microsoft-launches-ai-for-earth-to-give-2m-in-services-to-environmental-projects/embed/#?secret=jD7u7S4Qp1" data-secret="jD7u7S4Qp1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I’ve been focusing on all aspects of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/disaster-response/">disaster response stack</a> the past few months, so I was curious how the so-called planetary computer was performing and where the barriers are to better modeling of natural disasters. Bruno Sánchez-Andrade Nuño, program director of the project, told me that the ambitions of the project remain as strong as ever.</p>
<p>“The goal is to have a planetary computer to help everyone manage earth’s ecosystems, since that is the only way to be efficient when disaster happens,” he said. While the program is focused on “reduction, response and recovery,” it is the response stage which gets most interesting since decisions have to be made as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Sánchez-Andrade Nuño noted that AI has advanced tremendously fast over the past couple of years, particularly in domains relevant to the environment. “AI doesn’t need as much data as a lot of people think,” he said. “There has been a lot of progress with retraining algorithms … [and] we do a lot of work to onboard people to understand AI and how you can build an extremely efficient deep learning [model].”</p>
<p>One big challenge for applying AI to earth systems is simply the number of disciplines required to congregate in order for modeling to be successful. However, many disciplines remain aloof from each other, and no gap is wider than between scientists and AI researchers. Sánchez-Andrade Nuño sees an opportunity for the program to continually engage all sides into combatting some of the toughest challenges facing the planet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are “different dynamics because of different incentives — in the science community there is an incentive to create more knowledge, [but] for the modelers, [they want to] create good answers quickly,” he explained. “How can you make decisions quickly under uncertainty?”</p>
<p>One way of bridging that gap is through what he dubbed “upskilling,” or offering more AI training to scientists. “It’s all part of the same strategy … of helping people do environmental analytics faster and better,” he said. Nowhere is that harder than around geospatial analytics. “Computers are really good at one dimensional … they are not very good with things that are near each other.” He noted that he had originally trained in astrophysics, but upskilled himself in GIS (geographic information systems).</p>
<p>The effort involved in upskilling advanced AI skills has declined as libraries have expanded and common AI models are both well-behaved and also have prodigious educational materials available to understand them. “You used to need a PhD, and today, you need 10 lines of code,” he said.</p>
<p>That increasing power though is leading folks to believe that AI can solve every planetary problem. It cannot, or if you’re optimistic, cannot <i>yet</i>. “We are trying to reduce the hype of AI,” he said. “If you don’t know what AI is, you won’t trust what it is.” The program has been emphasizing explainability in a lot of its initiatives, so that scientists and AI researchers together can understand the outputs that come out of models.</p>
<p>That mission is increasingly aligned with relevant government agencies. Recently, the AI for Earth program <a href="https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/2693893/erdc-microsoft-agreement-aims-to-analyze-risk-of-extreme-weather-in-the-cloud/">signed a partnership</a> with the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center to improve the agency’s coastal monitoring system.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is increasing maturity in a lot of modeling even if there is more work to be done. “Right now, I would argue, we are still in the mezzanine phase,” Sánchez-Andrade Nuño said. “A lot of processes need a lot of ad-hoc processing than we should.” The good news is that more and more people are stepping into the field and trying to connect the dots, and in the process, improve the world’s disaster response capabilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tools you use most often are the ones you think about the least.<a href="https://calendly.com/"> Calendly</a>, an app that helps people plan, schedule and follow up on meetings, may be a perfect example of that.</p>
<p>Today, some 10 million people send Calendly links to millions of others to sort out meeting slots. But perhaps because its purpose is to get people from one step to the next in their day, and from using one piece of software to the next, Calendly tends not to get much attention.</p>
<p>That was the case, at least, until last year. The COVID-19 pandemic sent many of us home to work, and as commutes were cut out and people couldn&#8217;t meet at work, we suddenly found ourselves in a meeting frenzy. Calendly came into its own, and investors took notice.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;We are seeing strong usage in spite of the changes in how people work for the simple fact that human connection and collaboration are ultimately what drives a business forward.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Created out of founder Tope Awotona’s need for a tool to organize his life better, Calendly by nature kept a low profile even as it grew. But the combination of pandemic-fueled growth and major funding effectively changed that overnight. Earlier this year, we explored how the Atlanta-based company came virtually out of nowhere to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/"> raise $350 million at a $3 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a heavy load to lay on a founder and a startup, and it was the starting point of our fireside chat at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. If the product works well, how do you take it to the next level — and frankly, why should you?</p>
<p>&#8220;The question I had at the time [of that funding round] was, will the company take it as a distraction and become enamored with the publicity that comes with that? Or will we stay focused and continue to work really hard for our customers and partners and ourselves?” Awotona said. “Nine months later, it&#8217;s very clear that we&#8217;ve done the latter. Our culture and values have more or less remained the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company continues to stay focused on the “prosumers” who fueled its growth. These are individuals who gravitated to Calendly not because their company mandated it, but because they may have been sent a link for a meeting by someone else, become impressed with the UX, and started using it themselves — the classic kind of virality that has spurred a lot of technology to ubiquity.</p>
<p>Alongside that focus on prosumers, Calendly is also doubling down to build tools to address groups of users — starting from teams and going all the way up to large organizations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brave, the startup behind the eponymous non-tracking browser, has launched a non-tracking video conferencing add-on out of beta &#8212; letting all users make and receive video calls straight from their browser.</p>
<p>The tool, called Brave Talk, has been in beta testing since May last year. And Brave told us it&#8217;s had some 14,000 daily active users over this period &#8212; aka, earlier adopters and developers tapping in via Brave&#8217;s <a href="https://brave.com/download-nightly/">test version</a>.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s been made open access &#8212; with Brave making a pitch to Internet users of &#8220;privacy-focused&#8221; video conferencing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many other video conferencing providers, including Zoom, monitor calls, metadata, and images, and the records of that data can be sold or shared without user consent,&#8221; it writes in a <a href="https://brave.com/talk/">blog post</a> announcing the wider launch.</p>
<p><span class="il">&#8220;Brave</span> <span class="il">Talk</span> users can enable multiple layers of encryption on calls, so an eavesdropper cannot listen in on users’ calls, and our servers don&#8217;t save metadata, so calls, images, and activities are never recorded or shared without user consent,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0aWoHApbs0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The video calling software is a subscription offering costing $7 per month for premium features (like group calls and call recording) &#8212; but basic one-to-one calls are free and unlimited. (NB: <span class="il">Brave&#8217;s</span> Android and iOS apps only currently offer <span class="il">Brave</span> <span class="il">Talk</span> Premium but will have the free version too &#8220;in the coming weeks&#8221;).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users initiating a video call must do so from within the Brave browser however recipients need only be using any &#8220;modern browser&#8221; (so basically Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera etc) to participate in a video chat.</p>
<p>While Brave is touting its non-tracking credentials as a differentiating plus for the video conferencing software vs mainstream players like Zoom, it&#8217;s worth noting that Brave Talk does not (yet) have end-to-end encryption rolled out.</p>
<p>Brave says it&#8217;s using the Jitsi as a Service open source video meeting platform from 8&#215;8 &#8212; which relies on WebRTC open source technology to enable developers to embed HD video directly into the browser.</p>
<p>On encryption it says users can enable different layers in the settings. It describes the current strongest level of encryption available in both free and premium versions of Brave Talk as &#8220;Video Bridge Encryption&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This setting ensures that the video and audio streams are encrypted using keys generated by the participants, which prevents eavesdropping on the Video Bridge Server,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Brendan Eich. &#8220;Video Bridge Encryption can be enabled under &#8216;Security Options&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we find the phrase &#8216;end to end encryption&#8217; to be confusing and overloaded, Brave Talk refers to the setting as &#8220;Video Bridge Encryption,&#8221; he also told us, adding: &#8220;End to end encrypted calls are just one dimension of privacy and security when participating in video calls. Even when using encryption, most of the &#8216;Big Tech&#8217; video tools actively collect and store data about your call: Who the participants were, when the call took place and for how long, and a host of other information.</p>
<p>&#8220;The anonymous credential system employed by Brave Talk ensures that we don&#8217;t know who users are and who they are talking to, and we can&#8217;t link them across sessions. Brave Talk is a privacy-by-default tool that does not track users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pushed for more clarity on the difference between Video Bridge Encryption (VBE) and E2EE, he also told TechCrunch: &#8220;The reason that we refer to it as &#8216;Video Bridge Encryption&#8217; and not &#8216;End to End Encryption&#8217; is that, while VBE does ensure that audio and video remain encrypted from Brave, 8&#215;8, and any other passive eavesdroppers, we are still working with 8&#215;8 on a way to make this more robust against active attackers by automatically authenticating meeting participants.</p>
<p>&#8220;When that work is complete, we will feel comfortable introducing it as full end to end encryption, and it will provide significant advantages over platforms like Zoom, which require participants to read a security code out loud to confirm end to end encryption is working.&#8221;</p>
<p>Internet users wanting to kick the tyres of <a href="https://talk.brave.com">Brave Talk</a> &#8212; which was previously called Brave Together &#8212; will first need to download the Brave browser in order to initiate a call. Receiving calls doesn&#8217;t require using Brave, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Per Eich, Brave recently passed 36 million monthly active users across its suite of anti-tracking products &#8212; which also includes a search engine and a Firewall+VPN.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sethi draws on her decade-plus cybersecurity experience to talk about the role of the modern CISO and how the next-generation of CISOs can stay ahead.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting a new job can be stressful at the best of times. During lockdown, it can be a real challenge.</p>
<p>Rinki Sethi joined Twitter as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/twitter-ciso-rinki-sethi/">its chief information officer a year ago</a> during the peak of the pandemic. Like most companies, Twitter had closed its offices, requiring its thousands of employees — and new hires — to work from home. For someone who thrives in the office, Sethi said going in as a new, entirely remote employee came with its own complexities.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re leading a security organization, one of the biggest things is trust, and one of the things you have to lean in on is building trust with the people that are driving security — your own team,&#8221; Sethi said during a wide-ranging virtual fireside interview at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. Building those working relationships over video calls is much tougher, she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m used to doing that in person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sethi is no stranger to cybersecurity and has previously held senior cybersecurity positions at IBM, Intuit, Palo Alto Networks, and most recently served as Rubrik&#8217;s CISO. Now as Twitter&#8217;s CISO, she oversees efforts to protect Twitter&#8217;s information and technology assets — entirely remotely for the time being. While that comes with its own challenges, there have also been upsides.</p>
<p>The pandemic didn&#8217;t just change how companies respond to cyber threats, it changed how we work. Remote work has broken down barriers to the global talent pool, once restricted by who could relocate to be near the office. We&#8217;re talking more about mental health in the workplace, and there&#8217;s a greater focus than ever on the people that keep companies running.</p>
<p>These factors don&#8217;t just make for a stronger workforce, they make for a more secure workforce. &#8220;There&#8217;s some &#8216;people-aspect&#8217; to everything,&#8221; said Sethi. &#8220;Making sure your employees are feeling good; that they&#8217;re able to do their best work; that they&#8217;re mentally in a good space. I think that&#8217;s one of the most important things that tools, technology, applications and monitoring are not going to be able to solve for.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup called <a href="https://lounge.place/">Lounge</a> wants to reimagine work for the fully remote era where tools like Slack, Zoom, and Teams have fallen short in terms of helping companies build culture and creating relationships between employees who have never yet met in person &#8212; and now, it seems, never will. Instead of offering message boards and profiles that reduce a user&#8217;s identity to a photo and short bio, Lounge&#8217;s richer profiles aim to communicate more about the person, like their timezone, weather, location, team, and their participation in company events &#8212; like a steps or meditation challenge. It also offers tools that allow employees to get to know one another and connect on a more personal level, like drop-in audio chat and photo sharing.</p>
<p>The idea for Lounge comes from co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexyoungkwon/">Alex Kwon</a>, CEO, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=jason%20jardim&amp;origin=RICH_QUERY_SUGGESTION&amp;position=1&amp;searchId=cff5403e-0bb7-4a9b-9793-153091a4c6a3&amp;sid=h%3Bf">Jason Jardim</a>, CTO, who had previously worked together at Life360. During the pandemic, the two had been developing a family to-do list type of app while working remotely. While that project was scrapped, the co-founders learned a lot about remote work &#8212; and its pitfalls &#8212; during this time.</p>
<p>Kwon had never before worked remotely, he says, and found the experience lacking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doing a once-a-day stand-up on a Zoom call and then just being chatty here and there with a one-hour delay on Slack was just way too lonely for me,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>He said it lacked the same magical spark you get from having real conversations with co-workers, which can also often lead to new ideas. That type of in-person collaboration is one key reason why many <a href="https://www.idropnews.com/news/apple-employees-are-leaving-over-inflexible-remote-work-policies/163620/">companies</a> want their staff back in the office, pandemic or not.</p>
<p>But Kwon believes in-person is not the only way to introduce camaraderie among a team and grow a company&#8217;s culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have been [forming] relationships online ever since the origin of the internet,&#8221; he says. &#8220;People meet in games and get married online in World of Warcraft. And the majority of my friends now have met their significant others on dating apps. And where do they start? Online.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So if friendship and love can happen online, Kwon argues, then work-related camaraderie can, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206712" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206712" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2206712" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206712" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lounge</p></div></p>
<p>The co-founders began experimenting with ways to feel more connected, including at one point, a 24/7 Zoom call so they could just chat as inspiration struck. But that felt too invasive and kids were often interrupting. Always-on audio had a similar problem. This ultimately led to the development of a simple app that allowed them to quickly connect over audio chats with just a tap, but while respecting each other&#8217;s privacy.</p>
<p>The success of this app to solve their own remote work issues led them to scrap their to-do list startup idea and work on Lounge instead.</p>
<p>Today, Lounge presents employees as visualizations of virtual desks which are grouped by teams, projects, or even by hobby or interests. That way, it&#8217;s easy to see who&#8217;s working on what, similar to how company org charts would work. But the desks offer a more personalized experience. The visualizations reflect the person&#8217;s time zone and even their weather, by including little windows that let you see if it&#8217;s nighttime or daytime, for instance. You&#8217;ll also see the person&#8217;s profile photo and other data &#8212; like the steps they&#8217;ve taken a company-wide challenge.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206739" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206739" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2206739" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="394" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg 3042w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=300,174 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=768,445 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=680,394 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=1536,890 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1186 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-11.47.58-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lounge</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to the employees&#8217; own desks, Lounge also introduces the concepts of multi-person &#8220;rooms.&#8221; Unlike Slack channels focused only on topics or projects, Rooms can be designed to serve almost any purpose. They can even represent a virtual version of what in traditional offices would have been a physical space. You may join rooms for townhall meetings or whiteboard sessions or even hang out virtually with fellow teammates in a public room like the company cafeteria, for example.</p>
<p>Rooms can be locked or unlocked. If you&#8217;re heads-down on a project, you don&#8217;t have to respond to your visitors &#8212; you can lock the room instead. Visitors can then leave a private DM by typing into the chat, as you would with Slack. But if a room is open, you can click to engage with the co-worker synchronously over audio. This is the virtual version of walking up to someone&#8217;s desk and saying hi, except now you&#8217;re using an online tool to do so. The other person will hear your greeting then unmute themselves to respond and have an audio conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it as a combination of Zoom calls and Slack,&#8221; says Kwon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206713" style="width: 323px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206713" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2206713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?w=313" alt="" width="313" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png 776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lounge</p></div></p>
<p>Lounge is also working on a photo-sharing feature, inspired by Kwon&#8217;s earlier startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oneminute">Oneminute</a>, which allows people to snap and share random photos that would then appear on their virtual desks for a time and in other places in the app. The idea here is to give people a sense of what you&#8217;re up to or to share something more personal &#8212; like a photo of your dog or a weekend hobby. This is something employees already do in Slack channels today. But now they could contribute to an ongoing stream of shared photos that could help new hires learn about their teammates and find reasons to start chatting with them.</p>
<p>The startup has been in private beta with select customers since April but has hundreds of signups on its waitlist. So far, it&#8217;s been targeting smaller teams under 20 employees. Today, Lounge is launching into an open beta, with apps for Mac, web, and iOS being prioritized.</p>
<p>Lounge has raised $1.2 million in funding from investors including Unusual Ventures, Hustle Fund, Translink, Unpopular Ventures, and other angels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the first major Windows release in a half-dozen years <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/windows-11-launches-october-5/">looming over the horizon</a>, Microsoft has just unveiled a big slate of new hardware. The Surface line has always been viewed as a sort of proof of concept line for an operating system that hasn’t always inspired the most cutting-edge hardware breakthroughs.</p>
<p>The brand affords Microsoft an opportunity to push the edge of what can be done with consumer hardware, generally with a focus on blurring the line between categories like laptop, tablet and, more recently, phone. The Surface track record has been a solid one, on the whole, though messing around with form factors means no one gets it 100% right 100% of the time.</p>

<p>Last year’s Surface Duo is one of the best examples of this phenomenon, barring, of course, its larger sibling, the Surface Neo. The two devices garnered a ton of buzz when they were announced at the same event back in 2019. Both eagerly anticipated devices were ultimately disappointments for two very different reasons.</p>
<p>The Neo simply never came out. Microsoft’s subsequent cancellation of Windows 10X earlier this year appears to be the final nail in that specific product. While the Duo did arrive, it failed to live up to the hype. The form factor was every bit as interesting as it was at launch, but the company essentially acknowledged lackluster specs as it opted to focus on other things. I called it a “work in progress” that didn’t come near justifying the $1,400 price tag.</p>

<p>Microsoft likely won’t outright say it, of course, but the new Surface Duo 2 represents something of a do-over. It’s the sort of thing extended to products that we all really want to be good &#8212; like, say, Samsung’s first-gen foldables. In the world of smartphones, we’re all pretty eager for those products that could eventually expand from the same basic form factor our mobile devices have been stuck in for roughly a decade and a half. The dual-screen device is nothing if not an interesting insight into what could be.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The top-line additions here are the screens, which have been expanded from 5.6 to 5.8 inches for a combined 8.3 inches (up from 8.1). The screens sport a 1344 x 1892 resolution at 401 PPI. The addition of a Snapdragon 888 processor is nice, as is the 5G connectivity, after last year’s LTE-only offering stuck out like a sore thumb. So did the camera situation, which was a pretty big mess last time. The Duo 2 adds a large camera model to the rear (in addition to the front-facing 12-megapixel), with three lenses: 12-megapixel wide and telephoto and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide.</p>
<p>One thing the Duo does maintain is that price point. It’s up for preorder now, starting at $1,500.</p>

<p>The other most interesting new device of the lot is the Surface Laptop studio. The device is a clever take on the two-in-one category that Microsoft has been bullish about forever, and the name fittingly pays homage to both the Surface Studio and Laptop, perhaps splitting the difference between the pair. It features a 14.4-inch touchscreen mounted on a kind of origami stand that allows it to be positioned in a number of configurations. It’s basically a laptop (and a very MacBook-esque laptop, at that) with a screen designed to move like a tablet mounted on top of a keyboard case. Also clever is the magnet on the underside of the product that lets you snap on the company’s new stylus.</p>

<p>The product is targeted firmly at creative professionals the company has long been working to siphon off from Apple. The Laptop Studio sports an 11th-gen Intel Core H35 in either i5 or i7 configurations. It’s up for preorder now and starts at $1,600.</p>

<p>The Surface Go, Pro and Pro X are all getting updates this time out. The Go 3 gets a new Intel Core i3, which the company promises will offer up to 60% faster performance. The 10.5-inch system starts at $400 and will also add an LTE option, which is set to arrive at some point in the coming months. The Pro 8 two-in-one sports a 13-inch screen, 11th-gen Intel Core processors and two Thunderbolt 4 ports. It starts at $1,100. The thin and light Surface Pro X, meanwhile, runs on a Microsoft SQ2 ARM chip and will start at $900.</p>

<p>All of the above work with the new Surface Slim Pen 2, which sports a finer point, haptic feedback and magnetic charging. That runs $130. Also on the peripheral tip is the Microsoft Ocean Plastic Mouse, which is made from 20% recycled plastic that’s been recovered from the ocean. The Surface Adaptive Kit, meanwhile, features stick-on keycap labels, bump labels, port indicators and device openers, designed to increase accessibility for the devices.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2206663,2206666,2206667,2206664,2206660,2206659,2206651,2206637,2206638,2206639,2206647,2206648,2206650,2206636"]</p>
<p>On the whole, it’s a good balance for the company. The Laptop Studio finds the company exploring another fascinating corner of the two-in-one space. Is it a niche? Yeah, probably. It’s a big machine with a relatively narrow focus, but Microsoft’s been doing this long enough to understand the specifics of scale with a product like this. And hey, a major OS update doesn’t amount to much with some hardware working to push it forward.</p>
<p>The Duo 2, meanwhile, is a refinement of an eagerly anticipated new product that really didn’t pan out the first time around. Microsoft has been reasonably candid about the device’s failings and looked to address them here. You can make a pretty convincing argument that the device should offer more for the price, but it’s good to see the company sticking with an outside the box product like this, considering how many strange concept products (<em>cough</em> Neo) never make it that far.</p>

<p>The other new Surface products present a further sense of refinement to the line, in anticipation of Windows 11. Microsoft clearly wants you to upgrade your hardware to match, if the convoluted system requirements are any indication.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Ocean Plastic Mouse is, admittedly, a bit gimmicky as the company is pushing hardware upgrades. In a more ideal world, all of the company’s devices would be made of similar components. But hey, if it rescues plastics from the ocean, it’s a start. The Surface Adaptive Kit, is a consumer-facing piece of what has been among the industry’s leading accessibility efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember when OnlyFans said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">ban explicit content</a>, putting its creators&#8217; livelihoods in jeopardy, then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">suspended</a> that ban less than a week later? Even though Patreon&#8217;s guidelines on adult content are far more limited than those for OnlyFans, the changing standards of credit card companies like Mastercard are affecting how its creators can make money online.</p>
<p>As part of its quarterly <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/announcing-our-new-creator-policy-engagement-program">Creator Policy Engagement Program</a> (CPEP), which invites creators to engage with Patreon&#8217;s Policy Team, Patreon wrote in a <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/fall-2021-creator-policy-engagement-update">blog post</a> that it will roll out tools to help its adult creators meet the new Mastercard standards. These standards, effective October 1, were <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/onlyfans-visa-mastercard">cited</a> as one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-policy-change-is-a-tale-as-old-as-the-internet/">many potential reasons</a> for OnlyFans&#8217; short-lived potential porn ban, though founder Tim Stokley <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b">blamed banks</a>. The impending Mastercard requirements involve consent documentation (verifying that all people involved in adult content are 18+ and consent to distribution), as well as age and identity verification (requiring creators to provide government-issued ID). Patreon will require creators to meet these guidelines for both new and existing posts.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/policy/guidelines">Patreon allows</a> certain kinds of NSFW content behind paywalls, like &#8220;works depicting real people in the nude in sexual contexts,&#8221; animations or illustrations of nudity and sexual encounters, and &#8220;audio content that features simulated sexual interactions.&#8221; But it blatantly bans pornographic material and &#8220;sexual services.&#8221;</p>
<p>The OnlyFans debacle was only the latest threat to the livelihoods of online sex workers, who have been repeatedly deplatformed. Patreon <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators">cracked down on NSFW content</a> in 2017, citing pressure from payment partners. While Patreon has stated that porn was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kqye3/patreon-porn-adult-content-guidelines-open-letter">never allowed</a>, its guidelines used to be less stringent, allowing more flexibility for adult creators, some of whom made the bulk of their income on the platform. So, like the recent backlash against OnlyFans, adult creators had <a href="https://openlettertopatreon.com/">protested</a> the sudden suspension of many sex workers who depended on the platform for income.</p>
<p>&#8220;You at Patreon have been our friends in the tech world, you have told us so. Imagine how hard it must be for us to survive without the tools you had to start your business. Remember that our fan bases have been a pillar of your community and supported that very business,&#8221; an <a href="https://openlettertopatreon.com/">open letter</a> to Patreon said.</p>
<p>Patreon told TechCrunch in a written statement that everything discussed in <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/fall-2021-creator-policy-engagement-update">the blog post</a> should be considered a work-in-progress. Patreon is hosting a <a href="https://events.patreon.com/connect-q4policylive">livestream</a> tomorrow for creators to share their thoughts about adult content on the platform, as well as the potential to distribute creator coins, marking Patreon&#8217;s first potential investment in crypto. Given the experimental nature of the CPEP program, it&#8217;s unclear if the platform will roll out additional protections for adult creators beyond its tools to help meet Mastercard standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patreon is committed to cultivating strong relationships with our creators and developing policies that support their business efforts,&#8221; the platform told TechCrunch. &#8220;The work involves constantly talking with our creators to ensure our policies will continue to help them create independent, sustainable income.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[The UK government has announced a national AI strategy &#8212; its first dedicated package aimed at boosting the country&#8217;s capabilities in and around machine learning technologies over the longer term. It says it hopes the strategy will lead to an increase in the number and types of AIs being developed and commercialized in the UK [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK government has announced a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy/national-ai-strategy-html-version#executive-summary">national AI strategy</a> &#8212; its first dedicated package aimed at boosting the country&#8217;s capabilities in and around machine learning technologies over the longer term.</p>
<p>It says it hopes the strategy will lead to an increase in the number and types of AIs being developed and commercialized in the UK over the next ten years.</p>
<p>The plan to prioritize and &#8216;level up&#8217; development and applications of artificial intelligence follows earlier industrial and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/28/uks-long-delayed-digital-strategy-looks-to-ai-but-is-locked-to-brexit/">digital strategies</a> &#8212; which talked up the promise of AI. But Boris Johnson&#8217;s government is now inching onward, announcing a ten year plan to invest in making Britain &#8220;a global AI superpower&#8221;, as the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-ten-year-plan-to-make-britain-a-global-ai-superpower">government&#8217;s PR</a> puts it &#8212; by targeting support at areas like upskilling and reskiling in the hopes of reaping AI-driven economic rewards down the line.</p>
<p>Whether there&#8217;s much of policy substance here, as yet, looks debatable.</p>
<p>Notably there&#8217;s a lack of new money being announced to back up the strategy. For now the government highlights how much cash investors are ploughing into UK AI companies (£13.5BN into 1,400+ UK tech firms between January and June this year) &#8212; and flags a total government investment into AI of £2.3BN+ since 2014.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s no word on how much funding the government might put into supporting the development of AI from here on in &#8212; such as through planned continued support for &#8220;postgraduate learning, retraining and making sure children from wide backgrounds can access specialist courses&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead the announcement is heavy on soundbites about &#8220;transform[ing] the UK’s capabilities in AI&#8221; &#8212; or positioning the UK as &#8220;the best place to live and work with AI&#8221;, whatever that means. (Presumably it&#8217;s a companion piece to the other government digital policy talking point &#8212; about making the UK the &#8216;safest place to go online&#8217;, as it works on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">online safety legislation</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The early phase of the strategy looks focused on data-gathering to inform future AI policies. And, there, perhaps the most interesting element is an AI-focused review of the UK&#8217;s current copyright and patent rules.</p>
<p>There is also some geopolitical standards setting ambition on show &#8212; with the government talking about putting AI provisions into trade deals &#8212; but whether the UK will be able to punch so hard on the global stage in this area remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Among the announced measures in the strategy are plans to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch a National AI Research and Innovation Programme &#8212; &#8220;to improve coordination and collaboration between the country’s researchers and help transform the UK’s AI capabilities, while boosting business and public sector adoption of AI technologies and their ability to take them to market&#8221;</li>
<li>Launch a joint Office for AI (OAI) and UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI) programme aimed at continuing to develop AI in sectors based outside of London and the South East. &#8220;This would focus on the commercialisation of ideas and could see, for example, the government focusing investment, researchers and developers to work in areas which currently do not use much AI technology but have great potential, such as energy and farming&#8221;</li>
<li>Publish a joint review with UKRI into the availability and capacity of computing power for UK researchers and organisations, including the physical hardware needed to drive a major roll out in AI technologies. &#8220;The review will also consider wider needs for the commercialisation and deployment of AI, including its environmental impacts&#8221;</li>
<li>Launch a consultation on copyright and patents for AI through the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) to make sure the UK is capitalising on the ideas it generates and by best supporting AI development and use through the copyright and patent system. &#8220;This consultation will also include a focus on how to protect AI generated inventions which would otherwise not meet inventorship criteria as well as measures to make it easier to use copyright protected material in AI development&#8221;</li>
<li>Trial an AI Standards Hub to &#8220;coordinate UK engagement in setting the rules globally&#8221;, and working with The Alan Turing Institute to update guidance on AI ethics and safety in the public sector and &#8220;create practical tools to make sure the technology is used ethically&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s also notable that while the government&#8217;s strategy talks about wanting to establish &#8220;clear rules, applied ethical principles and a pro-innovation regulatory environment&#8221; for AI, the UK is already lagging on defining a regulatory framework &#8212; as it&#8217;s now outside the European Union which already has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">comprehensive proposal</a> for regulating high risk applications of AI on the table.</p>
<p>Instead of clarity vis-a-vis data use, current UK government policy is simultaneously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">querying the current data protection regime</a> &#8212; with ministers entertaining the idea of watering down rules in the hopes that weaker protections for citizen&#8217;s information will (somehow) boost people&#8217;s trust in and uptake of technologies like AI.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DLYI18pTKl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/embed/#?secret=DLYI18pTKl" data-secret="DLYI18pTKl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For AI startups and scale-ups specifically, the national strategy includes a plan to evaluate &#8220;private funding needs and challenges&#8221; &#8212; over the next six to 12 months.</p>
<p>While, over the same timeframe, the government says it will roll out a new visa regime &#8212; &#8220;to attract the world&#8217;s best AI talent to the UK&#8221;. (Of course the devil will be in the detail of what it announces there.)</p>
<p>But if UK startups were hoping the announcement of a national strategy to boost AI might mean gaining imminent access to all sorts of interesting government data-sets to train AI models the document only says that ministers will &#8220;consider what open and machine-readable government datasets can be published for AI models&#8221; &#8212; and will only turn their attention to that particular task over the next 12 months or later. So that&#8217;s a wait and see, then.</p>
<p>&#8220;This National AI Strategy will signal to the world our intention to build the most pro-innovation regulatory environment in the world; to drive prosperity across the UK and ensure everyone can benefit from AI; and to apply AI to help solve global challenges like climate change,&#8221; said (new in post) digital secretary, Nadine Dorries, in a statement accompanying publication of the strategy.</p>
<p>If Dorries&#8217; name is unfamiliar that&#8217;s because she recently replaced Oliver Dowden in the hot seat at the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) &#8212; after yet another ministerial reshuffle.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI will be central to how we drive growth and enrich lives, and the vision set out in our strategy will help us achieve both of those vital goals,&#8221; Dorries added.</p>
<p>Dowden only lasted just over a year in post at DCMS, presiding over the UK&#8217;s digital policy (and all the rest of the wide-ranging brief). That was still longer than his predecessor, Nicky Morgan &#8212; who was only there for a little over half a year.</p>
<p>Before that the digital brief was the responsibility of (now former minister) Matt Hancock &#8212; so there has been quite the parade of politicians pulling UK tech policy strings in recent years.</p>
<p>So perhaps, as a first step on its claimed &#8220;long term&#8221; commitment to nurturing the country&#8217;s deep tech powers, the government might consider a lasting ministerial appointment atop digital policy &#8212; to signal both a sustained focus on levelling up the country&#8217;s technical capabilities in areas like AI and, at the ministerial level, an appropriate <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42216622">ability to grasp basic best tech practices</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">FedEx has started to use self-driving trucks to haul goods between Dallas and Houston as part of a pilot program with autonomous vehicle startup Aurora and heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer Paccar.</p>
<p>Paccar trucks that are equipped with Aurora&#8217;s technology will be used multiple times a week to complete the nearly 500-mile route along Interstate 45, the companies said Wednesday. The trucks will operate autonomously with a backup safety driver.</p>
<p>The partnership marks the latest progress by Aurora to meet its target to launch an autonomous trucking business that hauls loads between terminals without a safety driver by the end of 2023. It is also part of a <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/unveiling-the-toyota-sienna-powered-by-the-aurora">string of announcements and updates</a> made by the company in recent weeks ahead of a vote on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/spacs-keep-rolling-as-autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-targets-blank-check-debut-with-13b-valuation/">reverse merger</a> with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the SPAC launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cNrRvIV4Fh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">Uber sells self-driving unit Uber ATG in deal that will push Aurora&#8217;s valuation to $10B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber sells self-driving unit Uber ATG in deal that will push Aurora&#8217;s valuation to $10B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/embed/#?secret=cNrRvIV4Fh" data-secret="cNrRvIV4Fh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The combined company, which will be listed on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol AUR, will have an implied valuation of $13 billion. Aurora was last valued at $10 billion following its acquisition of Uber’s self-driving unit.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is really about exploring and understanding the kind of changes that would need to be made to the truck,&#8221; Sterling Anderson, co-founder and CPO of Aurora told TechCrunch, adding that this includes how the self-driving system and the cloud services it provides fits with FedEx&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>The pilot will involve a small number of trucks, Anderson said. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make sense to launch huge pilots right off the bat,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With a handful of trucks operating regularly, we can really start to suss out any of the tweaks and refinements to the product in the interface.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There is no end date to the pilot, and Anderson expects it to evolve and extend beyond these handful of trucks on the Dallas-to-Houston route as the company gets closer to a driverless capable product.</p>
<p>The pilot, which was launched Wednesday, follows a strategic announcement earlier this year between Aurora and Paccar to develop, test and commercialize autonomous Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks.</p>
<p>The partnership also illustrates FedEx&#8217;s interest in autonomous and robotics solutions, as the company continues to experience record delivery volumes. In June, the logistics giant announced a multiyear, multiphased strategic partnership to test and ultimately deploy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/autonomous-delivery-startup-nuro-moves-into-logistics-with-fedex/">Nuro’s next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle</a> within FedEx operations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Intuit Ventures will identify growth opportunities and trends beneficial for Intuit's key customers — small businesses and consumers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.intuit.com/">Intuit</a>, the business and financial tools company best known for its TurboTax software, made news last week for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/intuit-confirms-12b-deal-to-buy-mailchimp/">acquisition of Mailchimp</a>, and is now announcing a corporate venture capital arm, <a href="https://www.intuit.com/ventures/">Intuit Ventures</a>, to identify growth opportunities and trends beneficial for its key customers — small businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>The company is the latest to get into corporate venture, joining a group that includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/14/workday-launches-venture-arm-to-fund-machine-learning-startups/">WorkDay</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/salesforce-ventures-launches-100m-impact-fund-to-invest-in-cloud-startups-with-social-mission/">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/zoom-announces-first-startups-receiving-funding-from-100m-zoom-apps-investment-fund/">Zoom</a>. CEO Sasan Goodarzi spoke exclusively with TechCrunch about the new venture, which will focus its initial investments in areas including fintech, e-commerce infrastructure, platforms and enablement, virtual experts/digital advice, AI/ML and cryptocurrency/DeFi.</p>
<p>The initial idea for the venture arm came about a year ago, when Goodarzi and Intuit’s chief corporate strategy and development officer Anton Hanebrink were discussing the acceleration of internal and external company pipelines and how to align those with the company’s mission and identify big opportunities.</p>
<p>The VC arm is one of the ways they would do this, which would enable the company to accelerate innovation while also learning from companies, Goodarzi said.</p>
<p>“The conversation led to months of work and the decision to create Intuit Ventures,” he said. “Anton and Shveta [Mujumdar] now own this and come to Michelle [Clatterbuck] and I to walk us through their investment opinions.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Intuit Ventures’ investment strategy will look across the company and touch on a number of areas:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Connecting people with experts &#8212; many customers want to digitize services like bookkeeping, accounting and taxes, so the company provides a virtual expert platform accessible at the touch of a button.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Capabilities to bolster platform using artificial intelligence, machine learning and knowledge engineering. This is an area where Goodarzi sees Intuit going beyond its current offerings to other industries.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Unlocking smart money decisions by being a platform where any consumer can run their financial life in one place. “That’s why we acquired companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/intuit-credit-karma/">Credit Karma</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/the-value-of-techcrunch50-mint-acquired-by-intuit-for-170m-two-years-after-winning-tc40/">Mint</a> — to be able to pull them together with TurboTax into one platform,” Goodarzi said. “We are now willing to invest in companies like stock trading platforms to add another layer.”</li>
<li aria-level="1">Helping small businesses get customers &#8212; with the Mailchimp acquisition, it is an investment that fuels customer growth, whether omnichannel or through other methods.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Talent and technology around cryptocurrency and blockchain &#8212; another area where Intuit can make an impact for customers, he added.</li>
</ul>
<p>The venture firm will look at coming into an investment in the Series B and C rounds and may lead a round, but will also work with other venture capital firms. Goodarzi said identifying potential investments will start with “the belief in the talent and the company” and an idea of how by Intuit infusing money into the company, it will be successful.</p>
<p>“We are boundaryless in terms of funds that we will be putting into this,” Goodarzi said. “We have told Anton and Shveta to bring us the investments until the time we say, ‘no,’ but I don’t think there will ever be a ‘no.’ Talent is scarce and good ideas are endless.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Intuit’s first investment was in <a href="https://clear.co/landing/for-founders/?utm_campaign=2020_as_na_google_search_brand_mca_na_na&amp;utm_content=2020_as_na_google_search_brand_mca_na_na_focused_exa--clearco--515971563321&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_term=clearco&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_ad=515971563321&amp;hsa_grp=65405063645&amp;hsa_kw=clearco&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_acc=3143805101&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_cam=1632587273&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-378026955757&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwvuGJBhB1EiwACU1AiXnnT0NGN2qbgTep6yxFz8_JxHvpWfwtJgbSQtyPdhA_VZFUN9vYoxoCWWQQAvD_BwE">Clearco</a>, an e-commerce investment company that was just infused with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/clearco-gets-the-softbank-stamp-of-approval-in-new-215m-round/">$215 million from SoftBank</a> in July. It is also an investor in <a href="https://www.meliopayments.com">Melio Payments</a>, which provides a platform for SMBs to pay other companies electronically using bank transfers, debit cards or credit. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/melio-raises-110m-on-a-1-3b-valuation-to-bring-b2b-payments-for-smbs-into-the-21st-century/">raised $110 million</a>, led by Coatue in January.</p>
<p>Goodarzi explained that Clearco was a good first investment because the company is representing diversity and diversity in the companies Clearco is helping. Secondly, its focus on e-commerce and omnichannel, also leveraging artificial intelligence capabilities, aligns with one of the five big bets identified by the company and stated above.</p>
<p>Having started a few companies of his own, Goodarzi said he wants Intuit Ventures to be the kind of investor he looked for back then: one that will help get companies off the ground, give advice and be a partner to launch and fuel product growth. He intends investments to turn into partnerships and could lead to Inuit acquiring the company.</p>
<p>One of the best ways the venture arm will determine how best companies will fit into Intuit is by exposing them to its platform of <a href="https://investors.intuit.com/news/news-details/2021/Intuit-Reports-Strong-Full-Year-Results-and-Sets-Fiscal-2022-Guidance/default.aspx">more than 100 million customers worldwide</a>.</p>
<p>“Our platform is what makes us attractive to companies like Melio or Clearco,” he added. “Many of these companies are building out things we don&#8217;t have. The biggest way we can understand the places they want to play in is to give them access to our platform. That will be the key to seeing if the company is going to be successful.”</p>
<p>Shveta Mujumdar, vice president of corporate development at Intuit and head of the venture program, and Clearco’s co-founders Andrew D’Souza and Michele Romanow, will be on hand to discuss the fund further at the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=rightrail">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> panel, “How to approach fundraising from corporate VCs” on September 22 at 2 p.m. PT.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[So, what I had done was turn $50 into less than $50 and locked the funds in an account on an art marketplace where I couldn't afford to buy something that cost nothing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Years and years ago, to get a better handle on the then-nascent crypto economy, I bought some bitcoin. About $50 worth, if memory serves. And then I moved it to BTC-E, at which point I bought some random coins to see how that would go.</p>
<p>BTC-E <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/07/27/btc-e-digital-currency/">eventually closed</a> after a massive money-laundering fine, so I presume that whatever coins I bought back then are lost to the void. That&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t had any disclosures in anything I&#8217;ve written about crypto since &#8212; I don&#8217;t own any that I can access, which is the same thing as not owning any crypto at all.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no longer the case. After chatting about the NFT craze once or twice on the podcast, I realized that the trend wasn&#8217;t going away, which meant that I needed to give it a try. Most folks who write about football have thrown a football. It seemed pretty reasonable to dip a single toe into the NFT waters if I was going to keep covering them.</p>
<p>After doing a little playing around, my impressions are that NFTs are neat and fun and silly &#8212; and that their on-ramp is still far too steep for most folks.</p>
<h2>Hello, I&#8217;m Alex and I am an NFT noob</h2>
<p>To get into the NFT game, I opened a Coinbase account and bought $50 worth of ether. My goal was not to buy lots of crypto, use it to purchase NFTs and reap stonk-like gains. I just wanted to run the process and figured I could find some sort of unloved NFT for $50 worth of Ethereum&#8217;s token. I even considered buying a piece from an artist I like, whose physical art I own and who makes NFTs.</p>
<p>So, I moved the funds from Coinbase to NFT market OpenSea, where I also had a wallet. The exact linkage between OpenSea and MetaMask wasn&#8217;t 100% clear during the process, but, hey, I&#8217;m here for a good time, so I rolled with it.</p>
<p>Sadly, fees from Coinbase and transferring my pittance of ether quickly ate into my crypto wealth:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2206641" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.39.56-AM.png?w=591" alt="" width="591" height="460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.39.56-AM.png 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.39.56-AM.png?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.39.56-AM.png?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-22-at-9.39.56-AM.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /></p>
<p>From this point, I figured I had paid the piper and was ready to buy something worth as little as possible, closing this chapter on my NFT mess-around.</p>
<p>Regular crypto users and traders know what&#8217;s coming, but let me explain for the rest of the crew. There&#8217;s a thing called gas fees in the ether ecosystem, the price that you pay to have your transaction executed. And it turned out that the gas fee alone for the purchase of an NFT that cost as close to zero as possible was more than the total ETH that I had in my account.</p>
<p>So, what I had done was turn $50 into less than $50 and locked the funds in an account on an art marketplace where I couldn&#8217;t afford to buy something that cost nothing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1437518114342805508">someone sent me a pity NFT for my live-tweeted troubles</a>, so I now own <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xf75140376d246d8b1e5b8a48e3f00772468b3c0c/3738">this</a>. Which I can&#8217;t sell because I don&#8217;t really want to get into the tax issues and because receiving a gift is against journalistic ethics.</p>
<p>At some point, I guess I&#8217;ll sell the NFT, explain to my spouse why our taxes are more complicated than usual, and donate whatever money it is worth at the time to charity. I&#8217;ve received a few offers for my free NFT for around $300, which is weird. It&#8217;s like someone handing you a small plastic chit that has a pretty color and then having folks queue up to offer you several hundred dollars for it.</p>
<p>I also <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1440032618221752327">minted my own NFT</a> of a Twitter thread discussing NFTs with a friend. No one wants to buy that one, but, again, it&#8217;s good to experiment.</p>
<p>This little saga closes with <a href="https://digitaleyes.market/collections/Thugbirdz">Thugbirdz</a>, an NFT project that sports highly pixelated images of birds. I looked these up on OpenSea and found one that <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/43129830942309892117831599888217540274730121224258835673118773888212505985025">had a bird smoking a cigarette for a very low price</a>. <em>And</em> it featured a &#8220;buy with card&#8221; option.</p>
<p>Bingo, I thought. I can just use one of my fiat cards to buy this bird, and then I will have actually managed my original goal of purchasing &#8212; as opposed to minting or receiving &#8212; an NFT. But after mucking around with the service to use a card &#8212; MoonPay &#8212; and verifying that I am in fact who I am, two of my cards hit fraud barriers.</p>
<p>No smoking Thugbird for Alex.</p>
<p>Anyway, all this is to say that I like buying art and I think NFTs are good fun. But the on-ramp to actually getting one is too high. Perhaps that&#8217;s why OpenSea has added 107,000 active users in the last week, <a href="https://dappradar.com/ethereum/marketplaces/opensea">per DappRadar</a>, instead of, say, a few million. Folks who want to eventually climb through the software web required, and the huge fees that must be paid, will manage. But if NFTs want the more regular types like yours truly, the barriers need to come down a little. Or at least the fees.</p>
<p>Perhaps proof-of-stake will fix this. Or Solana. Regardless, here&#8217;s to tinkering. And helping Coinbase&#8217;s next-quarter earnings report by a few dollars.</p>

It&#8217;s the same free-to-start MOBA with the same maps and monsters the launched on the Nintendo Switch in July, though the <em>Pokémon Unite</em> team recently rolled out a new update in preparation for its mobile debut. In a <a href="https://unite.pokemon.com/en-us/news/producer-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">post</a>on the game&#8217;s official website, producer Masaaki Hoshino detailed the new features, starting with full cross-platform support and account linking capability across mobile devices and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>The game has also introduced Unite Squads, which allow Trainers to team up with squadmates. According to The Pokémon Company, Trainers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22685804/pokemon-unite-mobile-launch-ios-android-battle-pass-squads" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">can create</a>their own squads with this feature or search for existing ones. Teams will be able to use &#8220;tags&#8221; to describe themselves to give people with the same interests a way to find them. The update brings a second battle pass with all-new cosmetic items, new in-game events, new held items and support for more languages, as well.</p>
<p>Hoshino has also mentioned in the post that the team is currently developing a new mode designed &#8220;to level the playing field for all Trainers, regardless of their held items’ grades.&#8221; While Hoshino didn&#8217;t expound on the new mode, it could give people who don&#8217;t spend a lot of money (if at all) to buy held items on the game a bigger chance to win against others who do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV startup Workhorse Group is recalling 41 of its C-1000 cargo delivery vehicles and suspending the remainder of its deliveries for this model, telling regulators Wednesday that “additional testing” is needed to certify the vehicles under Federal safety standards.</p>
<p>All automakers must certify their vehicles under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, minimum safety performance requirements issued by the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). The additional testing should be completed in the fourth quarter, the company told the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001425287/000121390021049277/ea147777-8k_workhorse.htm">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p>
<p>The company also filed a safety recall report with NHTSA, and noted that it had not received any customer reports of safety issues relating to the C-1000.</p>
<p>Ohio-based Workhorse has been in the news lately, primarily for filing a legal complaint against the U.S. Postal Service for awarding a multibillion-dollar contract for electric delivery vehicles to defense contractor Oshkosh Defense. The EV startup dismissed its challenge voluntarily last week.</p>
<p>Losing the USPS contract doesn’t mark the end of its woes. The SEC also opened an investigation into Workhorse at the beginning of September, though the regulator hasn’t disclosed what the investigation concerns. The company appointed CEO Richard Dauch to replace Duane Hughes in July.</p>
<p>The notice from Workhorse sent its shares tumbling by around 10%.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to both Workhorse and NHTSA and will update the story if they respond.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook today provided an update on how Apple&#8217;s privacy changes have impacted its ad business. The company had <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FB-Q2-2021-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">already warned</a> investors during its second-quarter earnings that it expected to feel an even more significant impact in its ad targeting business by Q3. This morning, it reiterated that point, but also noted that it had been underreporting iOS web conversions by approximately 15%, which had led advertisers to believe the impact was even worse than they expected.</p>
<p>According to Facebook&#8217;s announcement <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/navigating-change-and-improving-performance-and-measurement">published</a> to its business blog, this exact percentage could vary broadly among individual advertisers. But it said the real-world conversions, including things like sales and app installs, are likely higher than what advertisers are seeing when using Facebook&#8217;s analytics.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s stock has dropped by nearly 4% on this news, as of the time of writing.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Facebook has shared misleading metrics. In the past, however, it had inflated its video ad metrics and didn&#8217;t quickly act to correct the problem, leading to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/facebook-knew-ad-metrics-were-inflated-but-ignored-the-problem-lawsuit-claims.html">a class-action lawsuit</a>. In this case, however, the issue with the metrics isn&#8217;t making Facebook look better than it is, but worse. The company noted it&#8217;s been hearing from its advertising community that they are seeing a larger-than-planned impact to their ad investments on the network, raising concerns.</p>
<p>Facebook offered advertisers a few tips to help them better understand a campaign&#8217;s impact and performance in this new era. It suggested waiting a minimum of 72 hours or the full length of the optimization window before evaluating performance rather than making assessments on a daily basis, as before. It also said advertisers should analyze reporting at the campaign level, when possible, as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/micro_site/url/?click_creative_path[0]=link&amp;click_from_context_menu=true&amp;country=US&amp;destination=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fhelp%2F311705270326952&amp;event_type=click&amp;last_nav_impression_id=038HUuAMQx3vR9ZtP&amp;max_percent_page_viewed=34&amp;max_viewport_height_px=845&amp;max_viewport_width_px=1680&amp;orig_http_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2F&amp;orig_request_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbusiness%2Fnews%2Fnavigating-change-and-improving-performance-and-measurement&amp;primary_cmsid=4298554343565860&amp;primary_content_locale=en_US&amp;region=noam&amp;scrolled=true&amp;session_id=1BlWFa01oHOpSUeWp&amp;site=fb4b&amp;extra_data[view_type]=v3_initial_view&amp;extra_data[site_section]=news&amp;extra_data[placement]=%2Fbusiness%2Fnews%2Fnavigating-change-and-improving-performance-and-measurement&amp;extra_data[creative_detail]=FBBHelp_SomeEstimatedConversions">some estimated conversations</a> are reported with a delay. And it suggested advertisers choose web events (like a purchase or sign-up) that are most aligned with their core business, among other things.</p>
<p>To address the issues with improving its measurements, Facebook said it&#8217;s working to improve its conversion modeling, accelerating its investments to address reporting gaps, launching new capabilities to track web conversions and extending its ability to measure in-app conversions in apps that have already been installed. The company said it would work quickly to fix bugs, including one that recently had led to underreporting of approximately 10%, which was previously shared with advertisers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company in August explained how it&#8217;s been <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/building-for-the-future">working</a> to adapt its personalized ads business in light of both Apple and Google&#8217;s privacy changes and the new regulatory landscape, but those efforts will take time, it said.</p>
<p>Outside of the ad tech updates themselves, Facebook has also been working on new products that would allow advertisers to better position themselves in front of consumers browsing Facebook&#8217;s apps. Just last week, for instance, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-revamps-its-business-tool-lineup-following-threats-to-its-ad-targeting-business/">revamped its business tool lineup</a> with the introduction of new features and expansions of smaller tests that would offer businesses more ways to be discovered. One such test in the U.S. would direct consumers to other businesses and topics directly underneath news feed posts. It also now allows businesses to add WhatsApp buttons to their Instagram profiles and create ads that send Instagram users to WhatsApp business chats.</p>
<p>Facebook has been warning advertisers for some time that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency">Apple’s new privacy features</a>, which allow mobile users to opt out of being tracked across their iOS apps, would cause issues for the way its ad targeting business typically operated. And it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/"> repeatedly argued that Apple’s changes</a> would impact small businesses that relied on Facebook ads to reach their customers. When the changes went into effect, Facebook&#8217;s concerns were validated as <a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">studies found</a> very few consumers are opting into tracking on iOS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News that Klarna is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/really-this-market-isnt-good-enough/">waiting for more favorable market conditions</a> before going public felt a little odd yesterday. Today, hesitation to go public feels downright strange. New pricing information from U.S. tech unicorn Toast and Indian tech unicorn Freshworks indicate that the IPO market is more than welcoming.</p>

Sure, both companies have yet to start trading, but even flat debuts would represent strong fundraising tallies and strong upward mobility in valuation terms.</p>
<p>This morning, we&#8217;re going to run the final numbers, calculating how much the companies are worth and what those figures say about startup prices, especially in the payments space. And then we&#8217;ll close with one of the more humorous answers I&#8217;ve ever gotten from a startup executive. Sound good? Let&#8217;s talk money.</p>
<h2>Freshworks, Toast price well</h2>
<p>Toast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/toast-looks-toward-18b-valuation-in-upcoming-ipo/">first targeted</a> an IPO range of between $30 and $33 per share. The company then looked toward a $34 to $36 per share IPO price. It finally sold 21,739,131 shares <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921006179/en/Toast-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $40 apiece</a>, with its underwriters having the option to purchase another 3,260,869 shares at its IPO price if they so choose. The company&#8217;s IPO fundraise could be worth as much as $1.0 billion in its debut.</p>
<p>Freshworks set its IPO price range <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/freshworks-aims-for-nearly-9-billion-valuation-in-us-ipo/">between $28 and $32 per share</a>. That didn&#8217;t last, with the customer support software company raising its range to between $32 and $34 per share. Freshworks <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/freshworks-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering-301382238.html">priced at $36</a> per share, selling 28,500,000 shares with an underwriter option of 2,850,000 more shares. The company&#8217;s IPO fundraise could be worth as much as $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Recall that <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/">Renaissance Capital</a> valued Toast at $17.9 billion at $31.50 per share (the midpoint of its first IPO range), and Freshworks at $9.6 billion at $30 per share (again, the midpoint of its first IPO pricing interval), both calculated with <em>fully </em>diluted share counts. Simple math indicates that Toast is worth around $22.7 billion at its IPO price, and Freshworks at $11.5 billion, again using fully diluted share counts.</p>
<p>You will see lower numbers out there, likely calculated using a simple &#8212; more conservative &#8212; share count. Those are also valid.</p>
<p>In revenue multiple terms, Toast&#8217;s and Freshworks&#8217; final IPO prices are good news for the companies. With $424.7 million in Q2 revenues, Toast is worth 13.4x its annual run rate. Freshworks is worth 32.5x its own run rate. The differential that we see there is the difference between the two companies&#8217; business models. Toast is a majority payments/fintech company, while Freshworks is a more pure-play SaaS company. SaaS has stronger gross margins than payments revenues &#8212; and is stickier (i.e., recurring) than transaction incomes. So, it gets a higher multiple.</p>
