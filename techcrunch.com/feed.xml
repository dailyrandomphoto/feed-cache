										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A huge cache of source code repositories, creator payouts, and other internal data from Twitch has leaked online after an apparent hack.</p>
<p>In a post on Tuesday (but which was widely circulated on Wednesday), the hacker claims to have taken the video game streaming giant&#8217;s source code, as well as proprietary SDKs, or software development kits, which let developers integrate Twitch into their apps and services. The hacker also claims to have taken unreleased software as well as hacking tools used by the company to stress-test its own network from security threats.</p>
<p>The hacker says the cache, seen in part by TechCrunch, is &#8220;part one,&#8221; suggesting more data is expected to leak. The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-entirety-of-twitch-has-reportedly-been-leaked/">Video Games Chronicle</a>, which said Twitch was internally &#8220;aware&#8221; of the apparent breach on Monday. Twitch has not yet confirmed a breach, and has not responded to a request comment by TechCrunch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213340" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213340" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2213340" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="900" height="542" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg 1906w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=768,463 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=680,410 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=1536,925 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/posting-twitch.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213340" class="wp-caption-text">The hacker&#8217;s listing. (Image: TechCrunch/screenshot)</p></div></p>
<p>But streamers were quick to lend credence to the breach after creator payout figures were also leaked. (TechCrunch is not linking to the data since it contains personal information.) The data contains payouts for each Twitch user, some of which reach into the six-figures and more.</p>
<p>Several Twitch streamers have confirmed that the leaked records match their own. &#8220;I looked at a line from June 2019 and literally 100% match to the information showing on my analytics on my dashboard,&#8221; said <a href="https://twitter.com/BigJon06/status/1445699831666675723">one user</a>.</p>
<p>The leak of internal source code could also represent a security risk, since it now allows practically anyone to search for security vulnerabilities in the code.</p>
<p>The breach comes almost exactly a month after Twitch streamers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids/">took September 1 to protest</a> the company&#8217;s lack of action against &#8220;hate raids,&#8221; where bots are used to flood other streamers with hate and harassment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nintendo seems as unable to let go of its decades-old franchises as it is unwilling to stop reinventing them. But in <a href="https://metroid.nintendo.com/"><em>Metroid: Dread</em> </a>the company has acknowledged that sometimes it really is better not to mess with a good thing. The game&#8217;s traditional approach may not move the genre forward like some recent standouts, but it&#8217;s a hell of a good time to play.</p>
<p>The first new &#8220;mainline&#8221; <em>Metroid</em> game to come out in more than a decade, <em>Dread</em> is a direct sequel to <em>Fusion</em>, though I&#8217;ll spare you the plot summary — like <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em> games, the story is secondary to the moment-to-moment experience. But suffice it to say that galactic bounty hunter Samus Aran finds herself stranded on ZDR, an alien planet she has been sent to investigate, and afflicted with an inexplicable &#8220;physical amnesia&#8221; that prevents her from using all the abilities we all know by now.</p>
<p>What follows, as far as I am permitted to say within the confines of Nintendo&#8217;s review guidelines, is a very <em>Metroid</em>-esque tunnel crawl through environments artificial and natural, all the while collecting new weapons and abilities that unlock new paths and generally imbue you with new power and confidence. In other words, not much has changed since 1986.</p>
<h3>Smooth sixty</h3>
<p>The first thing that must be said about Dread is that the controls and gameplay feel of Samus are wonderfully fluid and responsive. This was a big worry for me, as the feel of the main character is one of the most important parts of any game like this. In <em>Hollow Knight</em>, your character feels crisp and precise; in <em>Blasphemous</em>, he&#8217;s deliberate and weighty; in newcomer <em>Death&#8217;s Door</em>, smoothly maneuverable. In <em>Metroid: Dread</em>, Samus feels <em>fast </em>and <em>agile</em>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213073" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213073" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2213073" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-4.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Metroid Dread for Nintendo Switch." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-4.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-4.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-4.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-4.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-4.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-4.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-4.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213073" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> A screenshot of Metroid Dread for Nintendo Switch.</p></div></p>
<p>Running at a steady 60 FPS, and with a base movement speed that feels like a sprint rather than the sedate jog Samus has sometimes used, it&#8217;s clear in this game that you are meant to be both hunter and hunted, moving quickly and responding quickly. Every action is fast and at your fingertips, and the game seems to want you to play on the run, picking off enemies at speed rather than hanging back in safety. You feel reasonably powerful, but your agility is your best asset.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s especially true in <em>Dread&#8217;s</em> signature areas where invincible hunter-killer robots known as EMMIs roam, listening for Samus&#8217;s step and pursuing doggedly if they detect her presence. Fast and able to scale walls and creep through crawl spaces, EMMIs are rather like <em>Alien</em>&#8216;s xenomorphs, and like one of those, if it gets hold of you it&#8217;s all over unless you can pull off a counter with very precise timing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213072" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213072" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2213072" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-3.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Metroid Dread for Nintendo Switch." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-3.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-3.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-3.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213072" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> A screenshot of Metroid Dread for Nintendo Switch.</p></div></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be very clear on this: you will die in <em>Metroid: Dread</em>, and you will die a lot. Probably about half the the time it will be an EMMI, which clambers out of a chute right in front of you and snatches you up as you panic, or corners you as you&#8217;re trying to find a safe place to hide. The rest of the time it will probably as you learn the unforgiving patterns of the various bosses. The overworld doesn&#8217;t seem quite so threatening once you have an energy tank or two — but when you enter one of those special EMMI zone doors (and thank god it saves when you do), your stress levels will skyrocket. Even the cloaking ability you gain a short way into the game is alarmingly limited in preventing your capture. And your one surefire way of defeating them, paradoxically, requires you to stand your ground, which is even worse than running away!</p>
<p>For the most part the game is tough but fair — I doubt it will present much of a challenge to the more masochistic class of gamers who do no-hit runs of <em>Demon&#8217;s Souls</em>, but it provides a consistent level of danger such that you&#8217;re always relieved to reach a save room. I&#8217;ve played up to the very end of the game and while there are definitely some difficulty spikes and some hilariously difficult counter timings, generally after a few tries you&#8217;ll understand what the game requires of you. Or you&#8217;ll get lucky.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t be doing anything in the pause screen other than checking the map or re-checking the tutorial for a new item — there&#8217;s no inventory or loadout, every action is available by some combination of buttons, and this can get a bit unwieldy. Hold left bumper to free aim, right trigger to activate grapple, left stick to aim, jump with B and then hit Y&#8230; if you can.</p>
<h3>Saga of Samus</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2213074" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213074" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2213074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-5.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Metroid Dread for Nintendo Switch." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-5.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-5.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-5.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-5.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-5.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-5.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-5.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> A screenshot of Metroid Dread for Nintendo Switch.</p></div></p>
<p>While as mentioned, the story isn&#8217;t really the point of <em>Metroid</em> games, it is valuable, and the events in <em>Dread</em> do provide interesting beats and revelations in the ongoing saga. I&#8217;m forbidden to speak of it beyond the first couple areas, but I can say that compared with my personal favorite, <em>Hollow Knight</em>, there isn&#8217;t a lot of emotional investment. In that game, the combination of visual storytelling and music was a wonder to behold, and you got a sense of the places you visited being storied and tragic. In <em>Dread</em>, they feel much more like video game levels — with different feels and themes to be sure, but not the kind of ineffable <em>consequence</em> that has become a part of gaming vocabulary especially since the likes of <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>
<p>The upside of that is that the level designers engineer these places very, very cleverly. The way you are funneled and looped through locations in the first few areas in fact makes them almost completely linear, yet you feel like you&#8217;re ranging around and following your nose — &#8220;Ah,&#8221; you think, &#8220;I remember seeing a door that I couldn&#8217;t open before&#8230; I&#8217;ll go back there,&#8221; not realizing it&#8217;s literally the only place you <em>can</em> go. Fortunately the upgrades you get to suit and weapons usually feel consequential outside acting as a key to open certain doors.</p>
<p>There are certainly points where things open up somewhat, but this is very much a guided tour of ZDR. At times it can even feel too restrictive and streamlined — while there is certainly backtracking, much of it is obviated by suspiciously conveniently placed teleporters, which tend to take you exactly where you need to go next. It takes a lot of the guesswork out of the game, which is a mixed blessing — I&#8217;ve been stumped in Metroidvanias many a time, but figuring out what to do next is part of the challenge.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213075" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-map.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213075" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2213075" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-map.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Metroid Dread for Nintendo Switch." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-map.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-map.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-map.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-map.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-map.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-map.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-map.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213075" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>The map is very nice, though, informative without revealing too much, and a &#8220;something is around here&#8221; flash fills every journey with pit stops as you blast the landscape trying to find the secret passage to the missile tank. Being able to show all of a certain type of door or item is a very helpful time-saver as well.</p>
<h3>And here we have the water area</h3>
<p>Feeling like you&#8217;re in a cohesive world is also nice, and something that <em>Dread</em> doesn&#8217;t really accomplish. The different areas you&#8217;ll visit are all distinct in look and feel, but they don&#8217;t really fit into one another at all. You get in a train or elevator and you&#8217;re in a whole new zone, with no overlaps or secret passages between them. In <em>Super Metroid</em>, for instance, you have the rocky surface with a secret base embedded in it, the wrecked ship crashed into a large ocean zone, all above the fiery core, and you travel through them logically. In <em>Dread</em>, you have the rocky area, the jungly area, the hot area, and so on, but they don&#8217;t feel connected.</p>
<p>While it may lack that exploratory <em>je ne sais quoi</em>, the areas themselves are beautiful and fun to get around, and you do repeatedly visit them unlocking whole new sections you had no idea existed. They also change over time as the plot and your abilities evolve, and these changes can feel both clever and overly limiting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213070" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213070" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2213070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-1.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Metroid Dread for Nintendo Switch." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/metroid-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213070" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> A screenshot of Metroid Dread for Nintendo Switch.</p></div></p>
<p>My journey in Dread lasted a little over 8 hours, up to what I believe is the final boss encounter (which I have not yet beat — it&#8217;s hard, okay?), though honestly it felt considerably longer than that even though I rushed through it. And of course like all <em>Metroid</em> games, there is pleasure in playing it multiple times with accumulated expertise. If there&#8217;s a significantly different new game plus mode I haven&#8217;t heard about it, and from what I could tell there isn&#8217;t much opportunity to sequence break — a major hobby of <em>Metroid</em> fandom, meaning skipping a boss or ability to tackle areas in a different order. I&#8217;m probably wrong, though.</p>
<p><em>Metroid: Dread</em> is a <em>Metroid</em> game through and through, and while it may not have the sheer size of some of the games that have taken up its mantle in recent years, it makes up for it with its incredibly fluid gameplay systems and propulsive energy. I always wanted to continue playing and had to peel myself away every night, though I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have been able to take my time even had the review deadline not been approaching. This is a game that wants to be played, but also treats your time respectfully, with minimal padding and constant forward movement. It&#8217;s not an epic, but not every game needs to be in order to be worth your time and money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mindee.com">Mindee</a> offers an API that lets you turn raw data in a paper document into structured data. The startup is coming out of stealth mode and has raised a $14 million Series A round led by GGV Capital.</p>
<p>Other investors in today’s funding round include Alven, Serena Capital, Bpifrance’s Digital Venture fund as well as several business angels, such as Algolia co-founder Nicolas Dessaigne and Datadog co-founder Alexis Lê-Quôc.</p>
<p>If you’re working on a product that involves saving paper receipts, scanning driver licenses or entering invoices in a system, chances are you’ve been looking at ways to automate that process as much as possible. Many companies rely on OCR services (optical character recognition) from Google or Amazon.</p>
<p>But turning text into raw digital text isn’t the most complicated step. After that, you want to turn raw digital text into structured data. This is much more complicated as companies often rely on humans to identify the right information and paste it in the right data field.</p>
<p>Essentially, you can process a photo through Mindee API and turn it into relevant data for your product without any manual data entry. Many industries could use this kind of API-based product, from expense management to procurement, accounting, loan applications and more.</p>
<p>Some of Mindee’s clients include Qonto, Payfit, Spendesk and Lucca. With the new funding, the startup plans to get more customers in Europe and expand to the U.S.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the company has trained its algorithms using machine learning on large data sets of documents. It is supposed to get better over time as it processes more documents. The company already processes millions of pages every month from its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup charges its clients based on volume. Once you go over the free tier, you get charged per processed page. And because it’s a hosted API, integrating Mindee in your product doesn’t require a ton of changes in your product. You call an API and receive structured data in return.</p>
<p>What makes Mindee special is that the experience for the end user is much better. For instance, when you try to sign up to a service that requires your passport information, you usually have to enter your personal information, take a photo and wait. It’ll ping someone so that they can make sure it’s the same information in the registration system and on the photo.</p>
<p>If Mindee manages to capture data in near real-time and with a near perfect level of accuracy, you could get a much snappier experience. And that could lead to more customers for Mindee’s clients.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Marc Lore, who earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/marc-lore-leaves-walmart-a-little-over-four-years-after-selling-jet-com-for-3b/">stepped down from his role</a> as Walmart&#8217;s head of U.S. e-commerce, is now backing a new startup in the e-commerce space called <a href="https://wizard.com/">Wizard</a>. Lore has taken on the roles of co-founder, chairman of the board and investor in Wizard, a B2B startup in the &#8220;conversational commerce&#8221; space which believes the future of mobile commerce will take place over text. Ahead of its official launch, Wizard today is announcing its $50 million Series A, led by NEA&#8217;s Tony Florence.</p>
<p>Both Lore and Accel also participated in the round. Florence, Lore and Accel&#8217;s Sameer Gandhi have board seats alongside Wizard&#8217;s co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissabridgeford">Melissa Bridgeford.</a></p>
<p>The startup has an interesting founding story, as it&#8217;s not quite as new as it would have you believe.</p>
<p>Bridgeford, who once left a finance career in New York, founded and ran Austin-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stylust">Stylelust</a>, a text-based shopping platform that aimed to offer a shopping assistant for consumers. Its users could text screenshots and photos and be served recommendations of products they could then buy over text, without visiting a website. Stylelust took advantage of AI and image recognition capabilities to help provide consumers with options of what to buy. There was also a B2B component to Stylelust, which promised brands a &#8220;one-text checkout&#8221; experience. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210304132801/https://stylust.com/">According to a cached version of its website</a>, the company touted a 35% conversion rate &#8212; or 10x higher performance than web-based commerce.</p>
<p>Wizard says it &#8220;acquired&#8221; Stylelust, but the entire team (minus a few new C-Suite hires in September), are all prior Stylelust employees. Wizard did not have a product in the market at the time of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, it&#8217;s a brand-new company &#8212; and one that now has the ability to lean on Lore&#8217;s experience in e-commerce as well as that of top-tier investors.</p>
<p>Bridgeford described Wizard as an opportunity &#8220;to build our vision on a much larger scale and to partner with Marc, who&#8217;s really a tremendous visionary in retail tech and really a proven founder and a proven operator.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We really share the vision that conversational commerce is the future of retail,&#8221; Bridgeford adds.</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t yet willing to talk in detail about its product, however. Instead, it describes the B2B service as one that will enable brands and retailers to transact with consumers over text. The service is positioned as &#8220;an end-to-end shopping experience&#8221; on mobile from opt-in to search to payments and shipping and even reorders.</p>
<p>These text-based chats won&#8217;t feel like the annoying interactions you may have had with messaging app chatbots in the past, Bridgeford claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve found is a combination of automation and human touch really provides the optimal experience for users, while also building a powerful technology on the backend that&#8217;s built to scale. That&#8217;s really where the Holy Grail is,&#8221; she explains. &#8220;And that&#8217;s really what we see for the future of conversational commerce&#8230;we&#8217;re incorporating chat abilities, natural language processing &#8212; all of those technologies are moving very quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the frustrating experience you may have had with a chatbot a year or two ago, may not be the experience you would have today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal of the technology is to make it seem like you are speaking with a human, when it&#8217;s really technology-enabled,&#8221; Bridgeford adds.</p>
<p>Stylelust also brought its brand relationships to Wizard as part of the deal.</p>
<p>An earlier version of the Stylelust website listed clients including <a href="https://laughingglasscocktails.com/">Laughing Glass Cocktails</a>, <a href="https://www.desolasmezcal.com/">Desolas Mezcal</a>, <a href="https://www.pinhookbourbon.com/">Pinhook Bourbon</a>, <a href="https://marshhouse.com/">Marsh House Rum</a> and <a href="https://www.neftvodkaus.com/">Neft Vodkas</a>. A focus on wine and sports retail was also mentioned in <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/bizwomen/news/latest-news/2020/12/text-based-shopping-startup.html?page=all">an Austin Biz Journal feature</a>. However, a write-up about <a href="https://stpetecatalyst.com/florida-funders-backs-text-based-shopping-platform/">Florida Funders&#8217; backing of Stylust in 2020</a> noted relationships with top-tier retailers like Neiman Marcus, Walmart, Sephora and Allbirds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear which relationships will continue with Wizard or whether it will continue to focus on the alcohol brands or other retailers, as the company declined to discuss any details related to its business beyond the funding.</p>
<p>The startup plans to use the funds to hire in areas like AI, machine learning and natural language processing, as well as in non-tech roles, like sales, finance and operations. One of the key hires it&#8217;s still looking to make is a chief people officer. Though the current team is working in offices based in both New York and Austin, Wizard is hiring nationwide to fill roles on its remote tech team, it says.</p>
<p>Wizard already has some competitors whose services address certain aspects of its business, particularly in the text marketing space. But more broadly, there are other ways that consumers interact with brands over messaging which could evolve into more fully formed products over time, too. Today, consumers often discover products on social media, like Facebook and Instagram, then turn to Messenger or DMs for product questions. WhatsApp is <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-catalog/?lang=en">building out a product catalog for businesses</a> that enables consumers to discover products and services directly in the app. Even Apple entered the market with <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/business-chat/">Business Chat</a>, which already allows for purchases made through iMessage chats.</p>
<p>Wizard&#8217;s focus on SMS instead of requiring a dedicated messaging app or, say, an iPhone with iMessage, for instance, could help it to differentiate from competitors. Still, betting on SMS &#8212; increasingly a <a href="https://www.unionrecorder.com/news/bbb-receive-a-text-with-a-surprise-offer-don-t-click-that-link/article_8a30b040-2519-11ec-8ad9-e3fa5edf338d.html">home</a> to <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2020/03/02/mobile-phone-texts-spam-and-scams">text-based spam</a> and <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/personal-finance/phone-scams-getting-worse-how-to-protect-yourself">scams</a> &#8212; is a riskier bet. But it&#8217;s one Lore is willing to make.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having spent most of my career so far in e-commerce, it’s been clear that conversational commerce is the future of retail,&#8221; said Lore. &#8220;With deep learning becoming more pervasive, the ability to create a hyper-personalized, conversational shopping experience is going to transform how people shop — and I’m confident that what Melissa and the team at Wizard are building will lead that transformation.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.logicworks.com/">Logicworks</a> might not be a household name, but since 2012 it has been working with customers to help them move to the cloud and manage their workloads once they get there. By following that approach, the late stage startup is closing in on $100 million in revenue. Today, it announced a new Cloud Reliability Platform (CRP) designed to help companies migrate to AWS or Azure safely in a compliant way &#8212; and to keep that revenue engine cranking.</p>
<p>CEO Ken Ziegler says that Logicworks has taken a long view to building the business, and today&#8217;s announcement is the culmination of a lot of work over the years of staying tightly connected to the major cloud platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken a much longer approach, which is you build a platform from day one where basically you pick which cloud you&#8217;re going to support and then build really high quality tooling, telemetry and automation around those platforms. Over time you end up with this really nice high margin recurring revenue engine that becomes an integral part of our customers long term success and operations because we&#8217;re tying in compliance, security and scalability,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As companies move ever faster to the cloud, Logicworks is helping their customers by using a template approach to migrate in a secure way, while remaining in compliance with whatever industry standard is applicable whether that&#8217;s HIPPA, FINRA or any other set of rules. Customers can choose the template that applies to their industry, apply whatever customizations are required and then move in a secure and compliant fashion to the cloud.</p>
<p>As the company approaches that $100 million revenue threshold, it has numbers that are solid enough to support an IPO, but Ziegler says that he is content to continue building the company for now and to take advantage of the more generalized growth in the cloud market, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/">reached $42 billion last quarter</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xBdbf8NKrj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/logicworks-raises-135m-for-its-cloud-automation-and-management-platform/">Logicworks raises $135M for its cloud automation and management platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Logicworks raises $135M for its cloud automation and management platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/logicworks-raises-135m-for-its-cloud-automation-and-management-platform/embed/#?secret=xBdbf8NKrj" data-secret="xBdbf8NKrj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In fact, Ziegler says that in his conversations with AWS executives they are indicating the bottleneck for customers is getting to the cloud in the first place, and that is the sweet spot of Logicworks &#8212; helping companies migrate to the cloud</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s really what we built this platform to do, and if we can maintain credibility to really unstick migrations, and then show how they can run successfully, [we can continue to grow],&#8221; he said. He adds that because the company has a long term relationship with the cloud providers, it can also help customers take advantage of the continued innovation happening on these platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cloud operators aren&#8217;t sitting still, so if you want to maintain that innovation curve, which is why you&#8217;re to going to the cloud in the first place, you want to work with someone that&#8217;s going to make sure that that&#8217;s included with the long term success as part of the partnership,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spanish ride-hailing unicorn Cabify is getting into grocery deliveries as it looks to add another string to its multi-modal mobility and urban utility bow.</p>
<p>It announced the addition of a &#8216;Super&#8217; option in its app today &#8212; which is available for users in nine cities in its home market, namely: A Coruña, Alicante, Barcelona, Madrid, Malaga, Murcia, Seville, Valencia and Zaragoza.</p>
<p>The grocery delivery service is powered by a partnership with local grocery picking startup, Lola Market. But there&#8217;s an added twist here because the latter was acquired by Spain&#8217;s on-demand delivery platform giant, Glovo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/glovo-bags-two-grocery-picking-and-delivery-startups/">last month</a> &#8212; as part of its efforts to expand a speedy urban grocery delivery business. So it&#8217;s been a busy few months (of being <em>in</em> demand) for the smaller Spanish startup.</p>
<p>The relationship between Cabify and Glovo (via Lola Market) looks to be only at the level of a strategic partnership for now.</p>
<p>Last month Glovo said Lola Market would retain its brand and operate independently post-acquisition — led by Gonçalo Soares da Costa, CEO of a second grocery picking business, Mercadão, that Glovo simultaneously acquired.</p>
<p>And while Cabify is touting the new &#8216;Super&#8217; offering as the first time its users will be able to grocery shop via its app, the service (including delivery) is being fulfilled by Lola Market. So it&#8217;s a purely technical integration &#8212; and looks like a play to cross-sell the ride-hailing platform&#8217;s users on the convenience of push-button, app-based supermarket shopping too.</p>
<p>Madrid-based Lola Market, meanwhile, deliveries groceries from Spanish supermarket chains including Makro, Lidl, Carrefour, Mercadona, DIA, Alcampo, as well as saying it can do picking from traditional markets and some specialised shops.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2213301" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213301" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2213301" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cabify_Groceries_LolaMarket-3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cabify_Groceries_LolaMarket-3.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cabify_Groceries_LolaMarket-3.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cabify_Groceries_LolaMarket-3.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cabify_Groceries_LolaMarket-3.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cabify_Groceries_LolaMarket-3.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cabify_Groceries_LolaMarket-3.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Cabify_Groceries_LolaMarket-3.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213301" class="wp-caption-text">The new &#8216;Super&#8217; option in Cabify&#8217;s app in Spain (Image credits: Cabify)</p></div></p>
<p>This summer Cabify rolled out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/cabify-launches-cabify-go-a-multi-modal-subscription-service/">pilot multimodal subscription offering in Madrid</a> &#8212; seeking to nudge users towards subscription plans that make use of its different mobility offerings &#8212; ride-hailing, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/10/movo-grabs-22-5m-to-get-more-cities-in-latam-scooting/">electric micromobility subsidiary MOVO</a>, bike subscription service Bive and courier service.</p>
<p>With the new grocery tie-up it&#8217;s billing the move as a further expansion of this multi-modality strategy &#8212; and trying to claim green credentials, by suggesting it will reduce trips in private cars and help improve the urban environment by reducing emissions through grouped deliveries.</p>
<p>Though of course ride-hailing can negatively impact cities by clogging roads and causing congestion that can degrade the quality of public transport services and other emissions-free mobility options (e.g. biking and walking), as well as worsening air quality (even electric cars can produce pollution by generating particulate matter, such as from wear to car tyres).</p>
<p>Ride-hailing services also took a knock during the pandemic &#8212; while grocery deliveries surged during lockdowns. So diversification looks sensible.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new service expands the concept of what we know as &#8216;multi-mobility&#8217;,&#8221; said Lucía Chávarri, VP of new business at Cabify in a statement. &#8220;With the &#8216;Super&#8217; service, thanks to the collaboration with Lola Market, we avoid trips to supermarkets in private cars, which are often occupied by only one person, and which are very common in cities. &#8220;In addition, online shopping improves the efficiency of available resources, because delivery allows different orders to be grouped together and delivered following the best route.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luis Pérez del Val, the founder and CEO of Lola Market, suggested the &#8220;collaboration&#8221; with Cabify will allow it to reach many more users and &#8220;take advantage of our infrastructure, making the service accessible to many more people in major cities&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this integration we will be able to further optimise the efforts of our Personal Shoppers,&#8221; he also said, sketching the use-case of a Cabify user getting picked up at the airport and on the way to their destination having time to buy their groceries in the app and receive them when they arrive home.</p>
<p>&#8220;The possibility of shopping in 1 hour or at the scheduled time is a huge opportunity for this collaboration,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Cabify also operates its ride-hailing platform in a number of cities in Latin America. We&#8217;ve asked if it has any plans to add grocery deliveries for users in that region.</p>
<p>More broadly, the lines between different on-demand city-based &#8216;convenience&#8217; services continue to blur in Europe and the Americas as different platform giants jockey for position and profitability &#8212; chasing the dream of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55929418">China-style &#8216;super app&#8217;</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many e-commerce businesses run their entire order fulfillment process in-house because outsourcing it can be expensive. But the COVID-19 pandemic has supercharged many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) as consumers switched to home deliveries and ‘digitized’ their lifestyles to a far greater extent. It means this surge in e-commerce sales is subsequently leading to a boom in warehousing and shipping.</p>
<p>It would seem then that <a href="https://www.huboo.co.uk/">Huboo</a> was virtually tailor-made for the post-pandemic era. It has a full-stack, software-driven e-commerce warehousing and fulfillment system that is turning out to be a boon to these e-commerce-driven SMBs.</p>
<p>It’s now closed a £60 million ($81.4m) Series B financing led by US-based Mubadala Capital. The round was joined by existing investors including Stride, Ada Ventures, Hearst, Episode 1 and Maersk Growth, and takes Huboo’s total funding raised to nearly £80 million since April 2019, after its £14 million Series A funding, raised last year.<br />
 <br />
Founded in 2017 by Martin Bysh and Paul Dodd out of one warehouse in Bristol, the company now has four fulfilment centres across the UK, a site in the Netherlands, and has plans to roll out across other European markets. Each center is split into a ‘micro-hub’ of a few hundred square foot enabling staff to pick and pack inventory more efficiently. It says it has over 1,000 customers, small and large.</p>
<p>The company’s merchant platform uses APIs to integrate with popular sales channels and online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay, and Shopify. These allow D2C brands to view and track orders and manage their inventory on a dashboard. It also has proprietary software to manage warehouse operations.</p>
<p>Martin Bysh, co-founder and CEO of Huboo, said: “Scores of new and existing retail businesses now see their future in e-commerce, but while anyone can set up an online store-front and start selling within hours, the infrastructure powering e-commerce is alarmingly outdated, inefficient, inflexible and expensive.”<br />
 <br />
He said this hub model addresses this: “It brings flexibility and affordability to the incredibly complex fulfilment piece so that online retailers of all sizes – from part-timers to fast-growth D2C leaders – can benefit.”</p>
<p>Over a call, he added: “We win clients from Amazon’s ‘Fulfilled By Amazon’ (FBA) because part of the 20% that the seller pays to Amazon goes to cross-subsidize the inexpensive fulfillment, but if you&#8217;re trying to use FBA (because you&#8217;re selling on eBay or Shopify) it&#8217;s hopeless. It’s, like, three times as expensive. So we get people using Shopify or eBay. They love what we&#8217;re doing… We compete very effectively against them… They&#8217;re not the nimble creature they were years ago.”<br />
 <br />
Fatou Bintou Sagnang, Partner at Mubadala Capital Ventures, said: “Huboo’s product solves one of the most critical pain points for e-commerce companies &#8211; while order fulfillment is a core function for these companies, it is not part of their core competency. By combining logistics with a user-friendly software platform, Huboo delivers a superior fulfillment experience and allows businesses of all sizes to continue focusing on core activities such as product development while managing growing demand from their customers.” <br />
 <br />
Matt Penneycard, Founding Partner at Ada Ventures, said: “Huboo is a shining light of UK tech, and we’re particularly delighted for a Bristol-based company to be succeeding this way! Martin and Paul’s incredible vision is becoming a global reality at supersonic speed.” </p>
<p>Fred Destin, Founder at Stride.VC, said: “Huboo does the seemingly impossible &#8211; to deliver high-precision e-commerce fulfillment cost-effectively to businesses of all sizes and levels of complexity. Huboo innovates both in how it looks at logistics, as an interlocked set of lego blocks connected by software, and how it looks at people, as a team of empowered self-starters obsessed about customer success.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rigetti.com/">Rigetti Computing</a>, one of the most visible quantum hardware startups, today announced that it is going public through a merger with the <a href="https://snii.supernovaspac.com/">Supernova Partners Acquisition Company II SPAC</a>. Once the transaction closes, Rigetti&#8217;s ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange will be &#8216;RGTI.&#8217;</p>
<p>The transaction values Rigetti at about $1.5 billion and the company expects to receive about $458 million in cash, including a $100 million <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pipe.asp">PIPE</a> (private investment in public equity) deal subscribed to by a group of investors including T. Rowe Price, Bessemer Venture Partners, Franklin Templeton and In-Q-Tel. There is also a new group of strategic investors here, including Keysight Technologies and Palantir Technologies. Ampere Computing, which is mostly known for its Arm-based servers, is also making a direct investment.</p>
<p>Supernova&#8217;s Michael Clifton will join the Rigetti board after the transaction closes.</p>
<p>According to CrunchBase, Rigetti has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rigetti-computing">just under $200 million in VC capital</a> since it was founded in 2013.</p>
<p>In addition to the financial news, Rigetti also published an updated roadmap, that has the company produce 1,000-qubit machines in 2024 and 4,000 qubit-ones by 2026. Currently, its systems scale to 80 qubits. The company argues that the proceeds from the SPAC and PIPE transaction will allow it to accelerate the development of its next-gen quantum processors.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the next decade one Rigetti quantum computer could be more powerful than today’s entire global cloud,&#8221; said Rigetti Computing CEO and Founder Chad Rigetti. &#8220;Rigetti is the leading innovator in this space. Our team has solved the most pressing scientific problems associated with bringing quantum computing to market by creating a scalable computer and high-performance integration with existing computing systems. We plan to use this capital to accelerate our product development and accelerate our goal to bring this transformational computing capability to every major industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Going public through a SPAC merger seems to be a bit of a trend for quantum computing companies right now. Rigetti competitor IonQ, after all, raised about $650 million through this same process <a href="https://www.axios.com/ionq-quantum-computing-trading-e5659963-f2f8-468d-9571-c5a0f912befa.html">only a few days ago</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Pattern’s platform works with brands to accelerate sales by buying inventory, figuring out gaps are in sales, optimizing it across marketplaces and identifying insights for boosting margins.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pattern.com/">Pattern</a>, a Lehi, Utah-based e-commerce accelerator that helps brands optimize sales on marketplaces like Amazon, Walmart, Target, eBay and Google, brought in $225 million in growth funding to continue developing its technology and expand its global presence.</p>
<p>The new round was led by Knox Lane. Pattern co-founder and CEO David Wright said this round brings the company’s total pre-money valuation to $2 billion and serves as the “largest raise by a home-grown, female founded or co-founded company in Utah.” The company has raised over $275 million to date, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/with-technology-to-perfect-product-pitches-in-digital-marketplaces-pattern-raises-52-million/">$52 million Series A</a> announced in August 2020.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 by Melanie Alder and Wright, the company expects to surpass $1 billion in revenue within the next year. Its mission is to help brands get a piece of the <a href="https://techwireasia.com/2021/08/asia-leads-the-global-e-commerce-market/">$6 trillion global e-commerce market</a> that is being driven by Asia and payment offerings like buy now, pay later, Wright said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Berlin Brands Group, now valued at $1B+, raises $700M to buy and scale merchants that sell on marketplaces like Amazon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/berlin-brands-group-now-valued-at-1b-raises-700m-to-buy-and-scale-merchants-that-sell-on-marketplaces-like-amazon/embed/#?secret=F9aD7pe974" data-secret="F9aD7pe974" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike e-commerce aggregators, which buy up smaller brands that sell on marketplaces and use technology to run and scale them more efficiently, Pattern’s platform works with brands for free to accelerate sales by buying the brand’s inventory, figuring out where the gaps are in sales, optimizing it across the marketplaces and identifying insights for boosting margins.</p>
<p>Wright referred to the past year as “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/berlin-brands-group-now-valued-at-1b-raises-700m-to-buy-and-scale-merchants-that-sell-on-marketplaces-like-amazon/">the year of the e-commerce aggregator</a>,” with companies, like Thrasio, Berlin Brands, Perch and others, operating in a hyper competitive market. These companies together have raised billions of dollars in equity and debt funding in 2021 alone.</p>
<p>However, he says with the way e-commerce accelerators, like Pattern, Packable, Spreetail and Netrush are growing, which includes raising nearly $600 million so far in 2021, next year “will be the year of the e-commerce accelerators.”</p>
<p>“Our theory is that Pattern and others will win the day because we are figuring out how to grow brands and execute rather than spending time acquiring and aggregating EBITDA,” Wright added. “These stories have not played out yet, but it is the concept of accelerators versus aggregators. They are essentially buying brands, but in a year or two, will be wondering what to do with them. Aggregators will have to become accelerators or I don’t think they will survive.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pattern now has more than 900 employees and is working with over 100 brands globally.</p>
<p>John Bailey, managing partner Knox Lane, a San Francisco-based firm focused on consumer and tech-enabled services, said he was on the accelerator side having previously led e.l.f. Beauty through its IPO.</p>
<p>He says that accelerators are “fighting the harder battle” by working to build up companies. As a result of its work, Pattern is seeing net revenue retention figures that “rival some of the best-in-class SaaS providers,” he added.</p>
<p>“Brands partner with Pattern to navigate the marketplace environment,” Bailey said. “The vision of Pattern’s offering is different from other platforms, and what is most compelling is their global execution and how they think of e-commerce globally. China is many multiples ahead on the total addressable market, but the fact that Pattern has a head start on this in the U.S., as well as profitable growth and scale was compelling to us.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Among the 30 of the companies High Alpha has started, there have been seven exits so far.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture studio <a href="https://highalpha.com/">High Alpha</a> launched its third studio Wednesday, continuing to create, launch and scale enterprise cloud companies.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis firm typically begins a new studio every three years, and is a model of entrepreneurship that combines startup creation with venture funding. Co-founder and managing partner Scott Dorsey told TechCrunch this is coming at a busy time for venture capital.</p>
<p>“The venture market is so hot and crazy right now,” Dorsey said. “Venture firms are having to move earlier to be competitive to get deals they might miss. Given what we do, we are as early as it gets, so I think we are ahead of that curve with the venture studio model. We are also going through all the trials and tribulations of starting companies, so we have that empathy and operator background. Not many firms have that background.”</p>
<p>All of that wild and crazy activity is a positive shift and providing a bigger field for seed investors, he added. There are more firms now that can write big checks, so if High Alpha is able to get companies up-and-running in the first year, the startups will need that next level of capital for the next stage of growth.</p>
<p>High Alpha Studio III raised $18 million from repeat investors Emergence Capital and Foundry Group. It comes seven months after the venture studio announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/indy-based-high-alpha-capital-launches-new-110m-fund/">$110 million fund</a>. As part of the investment, Foundry Group’s Jaclyn Freeman Hester and Emergence Capital’s Carlotta Siniscalco joined its board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dorsey, along with Eric Tobias, Mike Fitzgerald and Kristian Andersen, founded High Alpha in 2015. Since then, it has raised over $260 million and founded and launched more than 30 companies, including Zylo, Lessonly, MetaCX, Mandolin, Casted and Bolster.</p>
<p>The first studio had 11 companies and the second had 17. This new studio is starting out with three, two that are in stealth mode, Dorsey said. Among all of the companies, there have been seven exits so far, most recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210816005369/en/%C2%A0Seismic-Acquires-Lessonly-Delivering-to-Customers-the-World%E2%80%99s-Most-Powerful-Comprehensive-Sales-Enablement-Platform">Seismic’s acquisition of Lessonly</a>, a training, coaching and enablement company.</p>
<p>Over the years, High Alpha has examined different sectors, from the gig economy to the talent marketplace to technology knowledge. When the way people worked changed in 2020, High Alpha kicked into high gear and started a record number of companies, 10, compared to its typical three per year.</p>
<p>“We saw an opportunity to solve problems for the new way we are living,” Dorsey added. “We are in a brand new world now. Being more funded means we can make more meaningful investments and compete in the market.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://next.drivekyte.com/">Kyte</a>, a fleet-logistics platform that allows customers to order rental cars delivered right to their doors, has raised a $30 million Series A round. In the short term, the startup wants to expand into new cities, countries and verticals, but the long-term goal is to build out a platform that can deliver vehicles via teleoperation or an autonomous system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need the foundation of a fleet operating system and a technology layer that is able to manage both the fleet now as well as a fleet of teleoperated vehicles or autonomous vehicles in the future,” Nikolaus Volk, co-founder of Kyte, told TechCrunch. “Part of that is really building the data platform that includes sensing and telematics capabilities, and really supports teleoperated launches in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Kyte isn’t working on the software or hardware that will enable teleoperated or autonomous car delivery &#8212; there are plenty of companies already doing that, and Kyte says it’s in advanced conversations with multiple companies in the space with the goal of partnering on pilot deployments. Rather, it wants to ensure its fleet management system can connect to and enable future technologies. Kyte plans to begin testing out teleoperated delivery in 2022 and bring a small subset of the fleet to one or two markets by 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first, the company has to set up the commercial use case, drive unit economics and enhance the customer experience for rental car deliveries before it jumps into the “sexy” part of the business model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Kyte operates in nine U.S. cities, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">including Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the start of October, the startup expanded beyond Manhattan and into </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kyte-brings-its-on-demand-car-service-to-brooklyn-301386135.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooklyn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyte positions itself as the solution for all urban trips that are longer than general ride hailing. About 80% of its trips instantly leave the city environment for a few days, so long weekend trips are Kyte’s bread and butter. But as the company eyes expansion into more cities and, by next year, more countries, it also looks to expand its use cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ludwig Schoenack, one of Kyte’s three co-founders, told TechCrunch the startup is pursuing a business travel vertical, wherein customers arriving in a new city might arrange for their rental car to meet them at their Airbnb or hotel. Kyte is also doubling down on longer-term rentals, or rather subscriptions of up to 12 months. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car subscription model is quickly cropping up in many markets, and in a few cases, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/onto-raises-175-million-in-series-b-to-expand-ev-subscription-service-in-the-uk/">U.K.-based Onto, </a>it revolves around providing alternative access to electric vehicles</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Schoenack and Volk say that because they are very customer-centric, their main goal is not to necessarily drive EV adoption, but rather to listen to what the customer needs. If the majority of Kyte users are Americans taking weekend trips outside the city, it stands to reason that range anxiety, warranted or not, is something the company has to keep in mind.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Onto raises $175 million in Series B to expand EV subscription service in the UK&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/onto-raises-175-million-in-series-b-to-expand-ev-subscription-service-in-the-uk/embed/#?secret=b6xqfOcEe0" data-secret="b6xqfOcEe0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited supply of EVs is another potential hurdle for introducing more EVs to the platform. Kyte says it doesn’t yet offer electric in most of its markets, although almost all have some version of a hybrid car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look at our platform as the most ready to adapt to changing customer needs,” said Shoenack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kyte’s fleet is somewhat limited to the cars its partners are stocking. The company generally works with rental companies or companies with large commercial fleets that are being underutilized and gives them a second life on its platform. Kyte is beginning to work more directly with manufacturers, as well, both leasing and purchasing cars through a leasing company it controls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Kyte vehicles, third-party and leased or bought from OEMs, live on the company’s “cloud parking infrastructure,” which are essentially like dark stores for car rentals &#8212; cheap pieces of real estate tucked away in urban environments that are optimized for delivery operations. At the moment, Kyte has about one dark parking lot per city, with the exception of larger cities like NYC and LA, in which Kyte has multiple lots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a more future-proof model compared to anything else because there will always be space that’s hidden away from the consumer,” said Shoenack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lots also don’t have storefronts or branding, which makes for a pure delivery play that “allows us to arbitrage costs,” Shoenack continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the Kyte model saves on overhead costs, the startup says it’s able to offer services cheaper than the ZipCars and Hertzes of the world, which has resulted in profitable market operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t disclose exact revenue, but we can share that Kyte makes seven-figure monthly revenues, and this figure grew by about 10x last year,” said Volk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavy investment into its technology, product development and accelerated growth has led the company to raise the additional funding in this round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest funding round, which follows a $9 million seed round earlier this year, brings Kyte’s total funding to more than $40 million. The Series A was led by Park West Asset Management and Sterling Road. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament has voted to back a total ban on biometric mass surveillance.</p>
<p>AI-powered remote surveillance technologies such as facial recognition have huge implications for fundamental rights and freedoms like privacy but are already creeping into use in public in Europe.</p>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">To respect &#8220;privacy and human dignity&#8221;, MEPs said that EU lawmakers should pass a permanent ban on the automated recognition of individuals in public spaces, saying citizens should only be monitored when suspected of a crime.</p>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">The parliament has also called for a ban on the use of private facial recognition databases &#8212; such as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">controversial AI system created by US startup Clearview</a> (also already in use by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai/">some police forces in Europe</a>) &#8212; and said predictive policing based on behavioural data should also be outlawed.</p>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">MEPs also want to ban social scoring systems which seek to rate the trustworthiness of citizens based on their behaviour or personality.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">April</a>, the EU&#8217;s executive presented draft legislation for regulating high risk uses of artificial intelligence technology &#8212; which included a ban on social scoring and prohibition in principal on the use of remote biometric surveillance in public.</p>
<p>However civil society, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public-to-safeguard-rights-urge-eu-bodies/">European Data Protection Board and European Data Protection Supervisor</a> and a number of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public/"> MEPs quickly warned</a> that the Commission&#8217;s proposal did not go far enough.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The parliament as a whole has now made it clear it also wants stronger safeguards for fundamental rights.</p>

<p>In a resolution adopted last night &#8212; with the parliament voting 377:248 in favor of the LIBE committee&#8217;s <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2021-0232_EN.pdf">report on Artificial Intelligence in criminal law</a> &#8212; parliamentarians sent a strong signal over what they will accept in the upcoming negotiations between EU institutions that will nail down the details of the Artificial Intelligence Act.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The relevant paragraph on remote biometric surveillance calls on the Commission to:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;implement, through legislative and non-legislative means, and if necessary through infringement proceedings, a ban on any processing of biometric data, including facial images, for law enforcement purposes that leads to mass surveillance in publicly accessible spaces; calls further on the Commission to stop funding biometric research or deployment or programmes that are likely to result in indiscriminate mass surveillance in public spaces</p></blockquote>
<p>The resolution also takes aim at algorithmic bias, calling for human supervision and strong legal powers to prevent discrimination by AI &#8212; especially in a law enforcement and the border-crossing context.</p>
<p>Human operators must always make the final decisions, MEPs agreed, saying that subjects monitored by AI-powered systems must have access to remedy.</p>
<p>To ensure fundamental rights are upheld when using AI-based identification systems &#8212; which MEPs noted have been shown to misidentify minority ethnic groups, LGBTI people, seniors and women at higher rates &#8212; algorithms should be transparent, traceable and sufficiently documented, they also said.</p>
<p>They also called for public authorities to use open-source software in order to be more transparent, wherever possible.</p>
<p>MEPs also targeted a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/orwellian-ai-lie-detector-project-challenged-in-eu-court/">controversial EU-funded research project</a> &#8212; to create a &#8216;smart&#8217; lie-detector based on analyzing facial expressions &#8212; saying the iBorderCtrl project should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, rapporteur <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/197844/PETAR_VITANOV/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Petar Vitanov</a> (S&amp;D, BG) said: “Fundamental rights are unconditional. For the first time ever, we are calling for a moratorium on the deployment of facial recognition systems for law enforcement purposes, as the technology has proven to be ineffective and often leads to discriminatory results. We are clearly opposed to predictive policing based on the use of AI as well as any processing of biometric data that leads to mass surveillance. This is a huge win for all European citizens.”</p>
<p>The Commission has been contacted for comment on the vote.</p>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s resolution also calls for a ban on AI assisting judicial decisions &#8212; another highly controversial area where automation is already been applied, with the risk of automation cementing and scaling systemic biases in criminal justice systems.</p>
<p>Global human rights charity, <a href="https://www.fairtrials.org">Fair Trials</a>, welcomed the vote &#8212; calling it a &#8220;landmark result for fundamental rights and non-discrimination in the technological age&#8221;.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Favo enables under-employed entrepreneurs to create new income streams through steady sales commissions from their own local grocery network.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Favo, a Brazilian social commerce platform, closed on $26.5 million in Series A funding to continue developing its app that takes grocery orders through local social networks.</p>
<p>Tiger Global Management led the round, with existing investors GFC, Elevar Equity, Kevin Efrusy, David Velez, FJ Labs and H2O participating. The latest round gives the company about $37 million in total funding since the company was started in 2019 by Alejandro Ponce and Marina Proença.</p>
<p>Families in Brazil spend, on average, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1114851/spending-food-brazil/">$118 a month on food</a>. According to IBGE data, they <a href="https://agenciadenoticias.ibge.gov.br/en/agencia-press-room/2185-news-agency/releases-en/25609-pof-2017-2018-households-with-up-to-r-1-9-k-allocate-61-2-of-their-expenses-to-food-housing">spend up to 22% of their budget on groceries</a>. Favo enables under-employed entrepreneurs to create new income streams through steady sales commissions from their own local network. People order groceries through the Favo app, and the logistics system fills the order and arranges delivery, in bulk, to the entrepreneur the next day. The entrepreneur completes the last-mile delivery.</p>
<p>Ponce was previously the founder of another company, but felt he was not fulfilling his purpose. He was introduced to “ikigai,” the Japanese concept for finding your purpose, which he explained says to do what you love and what keeps you going. When he learned about social commerce from a friend, he traveled to China in 2019 to see it firsthand.</p>

<p>“I came back and knew that this is what I wanted to build,” Ponce said.</p>
<p>He met Proença, who has a marketing and user experience background. They bonded over their humble beginnings and set out to build a company for families just like theirs that would bring e-commerce to all consumers across Latin America, not just for the wealthy.</p>
<p>“We are creating a new class of entrepreneurs,” he added. “We empower unemployed people, mainly moms, with technology and logistics to become owners and generate extra income for households. This could be one of the largest e-commerce platforms in LatAm because we are democratizing it.”</p>
<p>By having entrepreneurs be the contacts for the shoppers, Proença said Favo is removing the lack of trust for buying groceries online, which included the fear of not receiving their goods because they didn’t have a human to talk to.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t cost entrepreneurs any money to work with Favo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Many direct sales organizations force people to buy things, but in our case, they don’t have to do anything,” Ponce said. “Latin America is 20 years behind the United States, and in most cases, we are the first-time introduction a client has to e-commerce in their lives.”</p>
<p>Favo launched in Peru in 2020 and then Brazil. The co-founders plan to focus the new funding on logistics and fulfillment operations, as well as expansion in Brazil and into Mexico. Ponce expects to be in 20 cities in the following months.</p>
<p>The company is working with 160,000 buyers and seeing revenue increase 30% month over month. Buyers can choose from over 3,000 products that are delivered to them within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ponce said Favo partnered with this round of investors because they are known for helping with expansion. He added that Tiger Global has already helped put the company on the right path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Favo&#8217;s innovative social commerce business model and rapidly growing logistics platform are transformative developments for the purchase and distribution of goods in Latin America,” said Griffin Schroeder, partner at Tiger Global Management, in a written statement. “We are excited to support Favo&#8217;s mission to democratize e-commerce and to partner with Alejandro and Marina as they quickly expand across new markets.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google plans to invest up to $50 million in African early and growth-stage startups via its Africa Investment Fund, ramping up efforts to support more businesses on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google made known its plans today in a virtual event where CEO Sundar Pichai announced the tech giant&#8217;s intentions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/">commit $1 billion over the next five years</a> in tech-led initiatives in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These initiatives range from improved connectivity via Google&#8217;s subsea cable Equiano to investments in small businesses and startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, Google had fulfilled its obligations in the latter through its Google for Startups Accelerator Africa program and the recently launched Black Founders Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In three years, the accelerator program has supported more than 80 startups in seed to Series A stages, providing equity-free mentorship and resources. Google for Startups Accelerator Africa has accepted startups like Twiga, Paystack, and Piggyvest and collectively, these 80+ startups have raised over $100 million in venture capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Black Founders Fund gives dilutive cash awards to black-led startups in three regions. In the U.S, the Black Founders Fund operates <a href="https://startup.google.com/blackfoundersfund/">a $5 million fund</a>; in Africa, <a href="https://www.campus.co/africa/black-founders-fund/">a $3 million fund</a>; and in Europe, <a href="https://www.campus.co/europe/black-founders-fund/">a </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.campus.co/europe/black-founders-fund/">$2 million fund</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, 50 startups have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been selected to participate in the Africa program starting on October 13.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Each will receive up to $100,000 in equity-free capital along with credits from Google Cloud, Google.org ads grants, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Of the fifty startups, Google says 40% are women-led, representing 9 countries and 12 sectors. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is a significant gap in terms of access to funding. Some groups do not have access to funding as much as other groups. We&#8217;ve seen that with black and female-founded startups. And our effort with the Black Founders Fund is to help close that gap to some extent,&#8221; said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nithin Gajria, the managing director of Sub-Saharan Africa, Google, on a conference call highlighting why the internet juggernaut created the fund.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213261" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213261" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2213261" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?w=680" alt="Google" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213261" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, unlike both initiatives, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced $50 million Africa Investment Fund will see Google take equity in high-growth African startups in exchange for varying check sizes. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it as Google bringing venture capital into the continent,&#8221; said Gajria.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the fund&#8217;s investment thesis, the managing director said the Africa Investment Fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn&#8217;t have any preference for specific sectors or countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that the fund might work in a similar fashion as the Google for Startups Accelerator program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Africa has a Big Four (Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt) in terms of startup and venture capital activity on the continent, the accelerator has made sure to accept applications from startups in less-funded and overlooked regions. </span></p>
<p>These countries include Algeria, Botswana, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Ghana, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not restricting ourselves to certain verticals. We are focusing on investments where we believe that Google could add value,&#8221; Gajria said. &#8220;If there are founders building interesting products solving real challenges in Africa, that would fall squarely within our investment thesis.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For startups who get investments from the Africa Investment fund, Google says they will have access to its employees, network, and technologies. Asked when Google will make its first set of investments, Gajria said, &#8220;We are in advanced stages of various discussions, nothing that I can talk about more specifically at this point. But I&#8217;m hopeful we can come back with more information soon.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">More to follow.</span></em></p>

And it&#8217;s not just the first 4-star store outside the US, it&#8217;s also the company&#8217;s first shop in the UK that sells non-food and non-perishable items. Similar to Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-amazon-4-star.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">4-star stores in New York</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-amazon-4-star-store-colorado.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">other parts</a> of the US, the shop in Bluewater will sell products rated 4 stars and above, are top sellers or are trending on the e-commerce giant&#8217;s UK website.</p>
<p>Since the shop can&#8217;t carry all the highly rated products Amazon sells online, the selection in-store will be curated, though they will include goods across top categories like consumer electronics, toys, games, books, kitchen and home. It will sell products from small businesses across the UK, as well as the company&#8217;s own devices, including Kindle e-Readers, Fire tablets and Echo speakers.</p>
<p>The shop will have sections that correspond to specific sections of the website, as well, such as Most Wished For, which will feature products from Wish Lists. &#8220;Trending in Bluewater&#8221; will showcase items local customers have been buying, while &#8220;Most Gifted&#8221; will feature the top items ordered as gifts. Amazon says it will switch out products regularly based on customer feedback and to keep up with the latest trends.</p>
<p>Products in the store will be marked with digital tags containing the item&#8217;s price, average star rating and the number of customer reviews. In addition, customers don&#8217;t have to be Prime members to be able to shop there. That said, the store won&#8217;t feature Amazon&#8217;s Just Walk Out technology like the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-go-store-uk-084721065.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Fresh grocery store</a> in London. Just Walk Out allows shoppers to grab what they need from the shelves and, well, walk out without having to pay at a manned or a self-checkout counter. They can make their purchase from Amazon&#8217;s UK website, however, and simply pick up their order from the store the next day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber is piloting new app features aimed at making air travel more hassle-free, including the ability to reserve rides from airports, gain access to enhanced curbside pickup, request a ride once you land and order food in advance from airport restaurants for pickup.</p>
<p>Uber Reserve at Airports will allow users at 20 major airports across the country – including LaGuardia, JFK, Miami International, Dallas Fort Worth and Ronald Reagan International – to book a ride up to 30 days in advance. The new feature, which includes complimentary wait time of up to one hour, is connected to airport departure and arrival KPIs so it can track flights and automatically adjust reservations if a flight is delayed or early. Uber has also upped its machine learning technology to allow for a feature that helps match riders waiting at airport curbsides with drivers more quickly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213166" style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213166" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2213166 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?w=403" alt="Uber Reserve at Airports feature" width="403" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=178,300 178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=768,1296 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=403,680 403w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=910,1536 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=1214,2048 1214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213166" class="wp-caption-text">Uber Reserve at Airports feature</p></div></p>
<p>While it&#8217;s not exactly news that a car service is going to start accepting airport reservations, this move demonstrates how Uber is using its brand recognition to pivot away from on-demand and towards more traditional black car services. The announcement comes at a time when Uber is working to increase revenues after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/how-uber-plans-to-rebound-from-massive-q2-losses-stemming-from-driver-incentives/">massive losses last quarter</a>.<a href="https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput"> With air travel beginning to climb back up to 2019 levels</a>, the company has a chance to offer a more luxury, bespoke (and expensive) service to riders.</p>
<p>Airport trips are a good target for revenue growth because they&#8217;re typically longer and have higher fares, according to Uber. The company says just over the last week of September, it&#8217;s seen a 15% increase in airport trips, so the new reserve function will potentially give drivers the option of earning more money, the ability to plan their day in advance and more control knowing where a pickup starts.</p>
<p>As part of the new feature rollout, Uber is also offering a &#8216;Ready When You Are&#8217; service that falls somewhere in between on-demand ride-hailing and booking in advance, without an increase in fare. Customers can request a ride once they land with options to be picked up in 20 minutes, 10 minutes or as soon as possible. This feature is being piloted at six airports in the U.S. and Canada, but Uber says to expect a larger rollout through the start of next year.</p>
<p>Uber has had to work very closely with airports to make these app features work, says Sundeep Jain, Uber&#8217;s chief product officer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Different airports and cities have different regulations and laws that we have to keep in mind,&#8221; Jain told TechCrunch. &#8220;The complexity amplifies when you get to international airports. Also the pickup zones, the walking distance between where passengers arrive and where ground transportation is available varies and the way the signage works for airports is different, so working with airports is always a challenge, but an opportunity as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, Uber is also tapping into humanity&#8217;s collective fear of being in crowds for too long with its Mobile Ordering for Pickup feature, which allows customers can skip the line by using Uber Eats for pick-up while at the airport to order from select Starbucks, Burger King, Chili&#8217;s, Wolfgang Puck and Eddie George&#8217;s Grill 27. This feature is currently piloting at Toronto Pearson Airport, and will continue to roll out to US airports in the coming months, says the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Databricks today announced that it has acquired German startup 8080 Labs, the company behind <a href="https://bamboolib.8080labs.com/">bamboolib</a>, a popular GUI for the Python-based <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> data analysis and manipulation tool. Bamboolib allows data scientists to quickly and easily explore their data and transform it without having to write any code. 8080 Labs offered both a free community edition of bamboolib as well as a paid pro edition with additional enterprise capabilities. Databricks plans to integrate these UI-driven features into its Lakehouse Platform and to expand its own low-code/no-code capabilities.</p>
<p>This marks Databricks&#8217; first acquisition since it closed its $1.6 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">Series H funding round in August</a>. At the time, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi told us that he wanted to raise this round to be able to go up against its well-capitalized competitors in this space. As is so often the case with fast-growing companies in a competitive space, that often means making acquisitions to buy both the engineering talent and software capabilities to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together with last year’s acquisition of <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/06/24/welcoming-redash-to-databricks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://databricks.com/blog/2020/06/24/welcoming-redash-to-databricks.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633544358353000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHh7LrhPEqYZCuHwJpgU8u0kTufiw">Redash</a>, we are broadening the focus of our user base to a wider audience that prefers low-code/no-code solutions. Bringing simple capabilities to <span class="il">Databricks</span> is a critical step in empowering more people within an organization to easily analyze and explore large sets of <span class="il">data</span>, regardless of expertise,&#8221; Ghodsi noted in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>For Databricks, this acquisition also marks a renewed emphasis on bringing its platform to citizen data scientists who may not have the expertise to use its tools otherwise. &#8220;As <span class="il">data</span> and AI become a strategic priority for businesses of every size, it&#8217;s critical that everyone within an organization is empowered to ask questions and take action based on <span class="il">data,&#8221; the company notes in today&#8217;s announcement. Combined with its automated machine learning tools, Databricks argues, its service will now allow a wider range of users to extract value from their data &#8212; and also make life easier for professional developers who can build their data transformations with its UI tools and then export the Python code once they need to build a more custom implementation.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We founded 8080 Labs to bring simplicity to complex <span class="il">data</span> tasks and make the power of <span class="il">data</span> science and machine learning accessible to <span class="il">data</span> teams of any skill set,&#8221; said Tobias Krabel, co-founder of 8080 Labs. &#8220;With open-source roots and an incredible vision to reshape the <span class="il">data</span> landscape with the lakehouse category, we see endless opportunities with <span class="il">Databricks</span> and could not be more excited to join the team on this journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two companies did not disclose the details of the acquisition, and 8080 Labs didn&#8217;t raise any outside funding prior to this sale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The developing world represents the best chance of growth for large internet companies, and today one of the very biggest set out its strategy for how it plans to tackle that.</p>
<p>Google said that it would be investing $1 billion to support “digital transformation” across Africa. This will include landing a subsea cable into the continent to enable faster internet speeds, low-interest loans for small businesses, equity investments into African startups, skills training and more.</p>
<p>The plans were unveiled today at an <a href="https://adsonair.withgoogle.com/events/google4africa">event</a> led by Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai &#8212; putting the most senior executive at the company at the top of the event being a mark of the priority that the company is placing on the bet it’s making here.</p>
<p>“We’ve made huge strides together over the past decade &#8212; but there’s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African. Today I’m excited to reaffirm our commitment to the continent through an investment of $1 billion over five years to support Africa’s digital transformation, to cover a range of initiatives from improved connectivity to investment in startups,” said Pichai.</p>
<p>Google said it will inject the investment in projects to be implemented in countries across the continent including Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Ghana.</p>
<p>The subsea cable will cut across South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena, connecting Africa and Europe. It will provide approximately 20 times more network capacity than the last cable built to serve Africa, said the managing director for Google in Africa, Nitin Gajria.</p>
<p>“This will lead to a 21 percent reduction in internet prices and increase internet speed in Nigeria and almost triple in South Africa,” said Gajria.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It is projected to create about 1.7 million jobs in Nigeria and South Africa by 2025 as the digital economy grows.</p>
<p>Google also announced the launch of the Africa Investment Fund, where it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-sets-up-50m-fund-to-invest-in-african-startups/">invest </a>$50 million in start-ups across the continent providing them “with access to Google’s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities.”</p>
<p>The company said it will additionally disburse $10 million in low-interest loans to small businesses in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, to alleviate hardships brought about by the Covid pandemic. This will be done in partnership with Kiva, a San-Francisco based non-profit lending organization. It pledged $40 million to non-profits improving lives in Africa.</p>
<p>“I am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before. I am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa’s biggest problems than Africa’s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa&#8217;s innovators and entrepreneurs,” said Gajria.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mauritius and U.K.-based investment company <a href="https://www.juven.africa/">Juven</a> went live today with plans to fund growth-stage technology and consumer companies in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-year-old firm is looking to invest large checks in companies &#8220;that have proven business models, strong revenue traction and large addressable markets,&#8221; it said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juven is one of the few investment firms targeting growth deals on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">TLcom</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/novastar-ventures-becomes-200m-african-vc-fund-after-108m-raise/">Novastar</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/partech-is-doubling-the-size-of-its-african-venture-fund-to-143-million/">Partech Africa</a>, that have written significant checks in tech companies in recent years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But unlike the others, Juven is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not a venture capital fund; the evergreen investment company is a spinoff from Goldman Sachs&#8217; Africa principal team responsible for making several high-growth investments in the tech scene since 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juven founder Jules Frebault led the Africa team, the Special Situations Group. He joined Goldman Sachs in 2010 and grew out the department&#8217;s strategy from a London office to back companies that could make good returns on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team first made some investments across private equity and credit; the most notable bets were in telecom-led businesses and towers like the IHS Towers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down the line, Goldman Sachs dipped its hand into growth-stage investing in tech companies, backing Africa&#8217;s first unicorn Jumia, Zipline, and Eat&#8217;N&#8217;Go. It also led investments in Unicaf&#8217;s Series B round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/south-african-fintech-startup-jumo-raises-second-50m-vc-round/">Jumo&#8217;s second Series B</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/14/nigerian-logistics-startup-kobo360-raises-30m-backed-by-goldman-sachs/">Kobo360&#8217;s Series A</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/kenyas-twiga-foods-eyes-west-africa-after-30m-raise-led-by-goldman/">Twiga Foods&#8217; Series B round</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3N2YEtCNGj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/south-african-fintech-startup-jumo-raises-second-50m-vc-round/">South African fintech startup Jumo raises second $50M+ VC round</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;South African fintech startup Jumo raises second $50M+ VC round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/south-african-fintech-startup-jumo-raises-second-50m-vc-round/embed/#?secret=3N2YEtCNGj" data-secret="3N2YEtCNGj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frebault tells TechCrunch that the Juven team spun out off Goldman Sachs to &#8220;go after the growth-stage opportunity in Africa with a dedicated structure, capital, resources and mandate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs transferred its growth portfolio &#8212; Unicaf, Jumo, Kobo360, Twiga, and Eat&#8217;N&#8217;Go &#8212; to Juven. Some former Goldman Sachs employees also left with Frebault to build out Juven&#8217;s operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is structured</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have a holding company and a balance sheet that holds its assets and cash. This way, when an investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is monetized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the capital comes back and Juven redeploys it. Such methods allow for making </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investments without raising multiple funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s actually akin to a corporate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how it&#8217;s structured,&#8221; Frebault said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the capital that we deploy either comes from our balance sheet or we take on follow-on investments from our shareholders.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that light, Juven has re-invested in four companies in its current portfolio this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it plans to add more investments before the next year runs out, Frebault says the firm might not make more than three investments per year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average ticket size will range from $10 million to $30 million, then $50 million or more in follow-on checks. The founder says that for tech companies, which is one of Juven&#8217;s primary targets, it targets Series B and later-stage growth rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Juven makes only a handful of investments per year, the firm will provide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> benefits around financial, legal, operational and strategic support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have to be flexible and start at $10 million because it can be the right size for Series B rounds on the continent,&#8221; Frebault said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t take a venture capital approach, and we don&#8217;t invest in many companies. We take concentrated positions and then continue investing in these companies over time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juven&#8217;s focus is on entrepreneurs trying to leverage tech to solve problems around access for the masses, the company said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frebault adds that Juven may also consider non-tech companies that can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solve such problems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the firm says it can invest in almost anything, businesses solving problems around food, education, healthcare, financial services, commerce and logistics will most likely get a nod before others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can invest in everything but we&#8217;re staying away from is extractive industries,&#8221; the founder said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the same situation with countries as the investment firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has a preference for businesses expanding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in large consumer economies like Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana and the Ivory Coast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the team that led Goldman Sachs&#8217; investments in Africa is now at Juven, Frebault says the 152-year-old investment giant&#8217;s Asset Management division still has a global mandate that includes Africa, albeit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focusing on a larger scale and institutional activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs declined to comment on Frebault&#8217;s move, Juven&#8217;s activity, its own broader objectives or plans for the region in the future.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wayve.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayve</a>, a U.K.-based self-driving startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/wayve-claims-world-first-in-driving-a-car-autonomously-with-only-its-ai-and-a-satnav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notable</a> for its use of deep learning and cameras rather than more-costly Lidar and other sensors to guide vehicles, is gearing up for its next stage of development with a strategic backer in its pocket. Today <a href="https://ocado.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ocado</a> &#8212; the online grocer that also powers online grocery systems for other retailers like Kroger in the U.S. &#8212; announced that it is investing £10 million ($13.6 million at today&#8217;s rates) in the startup.</p>
<p>The deal will give Ocado early access to London-based Wayve&#8217;s technology, which will be used in a trial in which Wayve&#8217;s hardware and software will be fitted on to Ocado vans and trialled for a year in real-world scenarios involving traffic congestion, making awkward turns on small residential streets, and navigating complicated, non-grid street layouts.</p>
<p>Longer term, Ocado wants to use the technology across its wider global footprint: the U.K. company licenses its grocery picking, inventory, and logistics technology, which it calls the Ocado Smart Platform (OSP) to other retailers around the world.</p>
<p>The deal is a two-way street in terms of data: Wayve will also be retrofitting Ocado vehicles with its computers and cameras to gather more data about delivery driving in general: the company&#8217;s big claim is that it doesn&#8217;t rely on costly Lidar and other sensors to operate, and that this also means that it can be used in unfamiliar environments, but it still needs lots of training data for its machine learning to operate that system.</p>
<p>“Ocado Group has been driving innovation in global grocery logistics for decades. Their cutting-edge approach to grocery operations and international reach aligns strongly with Wayve’s culture and global ambitions,&#8221; said Alex Kendall, CEO of Wayve, in a statement. &#8220;I am incredibly excited to collaborate with Ocado Group and learn from their vast expertise. Globally, there is huge momentum to transform mobility in grocery operations right now. We are focused on delivering an autonomous last mile solution to support the needs of grocery retailers everywhere. Through this partnership with Ocado Group we aim to unlock autonomous delivery faster in more places worldwide.”</p>
<p>The deal is non-exclusive on both sides.</p>
<p>On Wayve&#8217;s side, it is also<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> working with at least one other big retailer in the U.K. &#8212; just last month, Asda (the UK superstore that used to be owned by Walmart but is no longer) </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/technology-and-supply-chain/asda-to-trial-driverless-delivery-vans-in-london/659999.article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off a trial with the company</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. Records at </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.companysearchesmadesimple.com/company/uk/13536254/ocado-ventures-wayve-limited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Companies House</a> show that<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Wayve has been working with Ocado for some months before now, so it seems like there was a small scramble between the two supermarket rivals to get the news out of their engagements.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wayve has other strategic investors in the company: Virgin &#8212; the conglomerate that has stakes in a variety of businesses &#8212; in March announced an <a href="https://www.virgin.com/branson-family/richard-branson-blog/supporting-wayve-to-make-self-driving-cars-a-day-to-day-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investment of an undisclosed amount</a> in the startup. In total Wayve has disclosed more than $58 million in funding, with Yann LeCun, Balderton and Firstminute (Brent Hoberman&#8217;s VC) among the other investors.</p>
<p>On Ocado&#8217;s side, the company is hedging its bets with autonomous driving technology.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Ocado also invested a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/oxbotica-raises-13-8m-from-ocado-to-build-autonomous-vehicle-tech-for-the-online-grocers-logistics-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar amount of funding in Oxbotica</a>, which builds software to power these systems.</p>
<p>The two investments represent different approaches to solving the self-driving challenge.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“They are othogonal solutions, like an Android and iPhone,&#8221; Alex Harvey, chief of advanced technology, Ocado Group, said in response to our questions about how the two might work together. &#8220;They don’t work together but for us they represent two different ways to solving this very complex challenge which Ocado is committed to solving for its OSP partners at the earliest possible time.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Given that both approaches are still some way away from full, real-world implementations, it&#8217;s important that we continue to see a variety of approaches at this stage to find the best and safest solutions (not just those that are the most cost-effective).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ocado is committed to being at the fore-front of solving one of the most complex technological challenges of our age &#8211; automating last-mile deliveries in congested, busy, unstructured urban environments. We recognize there may be many different technical ways to solve this challenge,&#8221; Harvey said. &#8220;Our investment portfolio in the self-driving space reflects this ambition, giving us an unrivalled platform upon which to accelerate the development of this capability for our OSP partners.”</p>
<p>Aside from exploring the potentials of the different technological approaches, one other significant incentive for investing in Wayve is the fact that the startup&#8217;s system would be significantly less expensive to implement than one based around Lidar and other sensors. (Wayve sells its approach as &#8220;AI software, lean hardware and fleet learning platform for AV 2.0&#8243;.)</p>
<p>Regardless which direction self-driving technology goes, this latest deal marks one more step for Ocado in building out its next generation of technology, and underscores how the company has placed autonomous systems at the heart of that strategy.</p>
<p>“Ocado is on a journey to develop highly intelligent autonomous mobility systems to further transform the operational economics, and proposition, of the Ocado Smart Platform for our OSP retail partners,&#8221; said Harvey in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been impressed with Wayve’s approach to solving this most complex of challenges and are excited to accelerate our capabilities so that our retail partners globally can take advantage of them at the earliest opportunity.”</p>
