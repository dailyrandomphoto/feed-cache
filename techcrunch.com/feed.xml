										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been well over two years since the UK&#8217;s data protection watchdog warned the behavioural advertising industry it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">wildly out of control</a>.</p>
<p>The ICO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">hasn&#8217;t done anything</a> to stop the systematic unlawfulness of the tracking and targeting industry abusing Internet users&#8217; personal data to try to manipulate their attention &#8212; not in terms of actually enforcing the law against offenders and stopping what digital rights campaigners have described as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">biggest data breach in history</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">sued over inaction against real-time-bidding&#8217;s misuse of personal data</a> by complainants who filed a petition on the issue all the way back in September 2018.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239714" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But today the UK&#8217;s (outgoing) information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, published an <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/4019050/opinion-on-data-protection-and-privacy-expectations-for-online-advertising-proposals.pdf">opinion</a> &#8212; in which she warns the industry that its old unlawful tricks simply won&#8217;t do in the future.</p>
<p>New methods of advertising must be compliant with a set of what she describes as &#8220;clear data protection standards&#8221; in order to safeguard people’s privacy online, she writes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8URFMDzwJw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/">Privacy experts slam UK&#8217;s &#8216;disastrous&#8217; failure to tackle unlawful adtech</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Privacy experts slam UK&#8217;s &#8216;disastrous&#8217; failure to tackle unlawful adtech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/17/privacy-experts-slam-uks-disastrous-failure-to-tackle-unlawful-adtech/embed/#?secret=8URFMDzwJw" data-secret="8URFMDzwJw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Among the data protection and privacy &#8220;expectations&#8221; Denham suggests she wants to see from the next wave of online ad technologies are:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>• engineer data protection requirements by default into the design of the initiative;</p>
<p>• offer users the choice of receiving adverts without tracking, profiling or targeting based on personal data;</p>
<p>• be transparent about how and why personal data is processed across the ecosystem and who is responsible for that processing;</p>
<p>• articulate the specific purposes for processing personal data and demonstrate how this is fair, lawful and transparent;</p>
<p>• address existing privacy risks and mitigate any new privacy risks that their proposal introduces</p>
<p>Denham says the goal of the opinion is to provide &#8220;further regulatory clarity&#8221; as new ad technologies are developed, further specifying that she welcomes efforts that propose to:</p>
<p>• move away from the current methods of online tracking and profiling practices;</p>
<p>• improve transparency for individuals and organisations;</p>
<p>• reduce existing frictions in the online experience;</p>
<p>• provide individuals with meaningful control and choice over the processing of device information and personal data;</p>
<p>• ensure valid consent is obtained where required;</p>
<p>• ensure there is demonstrable accountability across the supply chain;</p>
<p>The timing of the opinion is interesting &#8212; given an impending decision by Belgium&#8217;s data protection agency on a flagship ad industry consent gathering tool. (And current UK data protection rules share the same foundation as the rest of the EU, as the country transposed the General Data Protection Regulation into national law prior to Brexit.)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">Earlier this month</a> the IAB Europe warned that it expects to be found in breach of the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation, and that its so-called &#8216;transparency and consent&#8217; framework (TCF) hasn&#8217;t managed to achieve either of the things claimed on the tin.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LAlcBQip7m"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IAB Europe says it&#8217;s expecting to be found in breach of GDPR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/embed/#?secret=LAlcBQip7m" data-secret="LAlcBQip7m" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But this is also just the latest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">&#8216;reform&#8217; missive from the ICO to rule-breaking adtech</a>.</p>
<p>And Denham is merely restating requirements that are derived from standards that already exist in UK law &#8212; and wouldn&#8217;t need reiterating had her office actually enforced the law against adtech breache(r)s. But this is the regulatory dance she has preferred.</p>
<p>This latest ICO salvo looks more like an attempt by the outgoing commissioner to claim credit for wider industry shifts as she prepares to leave office &#8212; such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">Google&#8217;s slow-mo shift toward phasing out support for third party cookies</a> (aka, it&#8217;s &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; proposal, which is actually a response to evolving web standards such as competing browsers baking in privacy protections; rising consumer concern about online tracking and data breaches; and a big rise in attention on digital matters from lawmakers) &#8212; than it is about actually moving the needle on unlawful tracking.</p>
<p>If Denham wanted to do that she could have taken actual enforcement action long ago.</p>
<p>Instead the ICO has opted for &#8212; at best &#8212; a partial commentary on embedded adtech&#8217;s systematic compliance problem. And, essentially, to stand by as the breach continues; and wait/hope for future compliance.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This, from the UK ICO, is good. <br />(However, ICO enforcement would convince the industry far more effectively than today&#39;s restating of data protection principles that have applied for 17 years). <a href="https://t.co/zZKVGRPpKF">https://t.co/zZKVGRPpKF</a> <a href="https://t.co/NhCHhgRvhF">pic.twitter.com/NhCHhgRvhF</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change may be coming regardless of regulatory inaction, however.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And, notably, Google&#8217;s &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; proposal (which claims &#8216;privacy safe&#8217; ad targeting of cohorts of users, rather than microtargeting of individual web users) gets a significant call-out in the ICO&#8217;s remarks &#8212; with Denham&#8217;s office writing in a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/ico-calls-on-google-and-other-companies-to-eliminate-existing-privacy-risks-posed-by-adtech-industry/">press release</a> that it is: &#8220;Currently, one of the most significant proposals in the online advertising space is the Google Privacy Sandbox, which aims to replace the use of third party cookies with alternative technologies that still enable targeted digital advertising.&#8221;</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The opinion heavily references <a href="https://twitter.com/w3c?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@w3c</a> work, also the &quot;Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy&quot; which I had the honor to maintain :) It is me who included the recommendation to make a &quot;privacy impact assessment&quot;.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The ICO has been working with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to review how Google’s plans will safeguard people’s personal data while, at the same time, supporting the CMA’s mission of ensuring competition in digital markets,&#8221; the ICO goes on, giving a nod to ongoing regulatory oversight, led by the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">has the power to prevent Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox ever being implemented</a> &#8212; and therefore to stop Google phasing out support for tracking cookies in Chrome &#8212; if the CMA decides the tech giant can&#8217;t do it in a way that meets competition and privacy criteria.</p>
<p>So this reference is also a nod to a dilution of the ICO&#8217;s own regulatory influence in a core adtech-related arena &#8212; one that&#8217;s of market-reforming scale and import.</p>
<p>The backstory here is that the UK government has been working on a competition reform that will bring in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">bespoke rules for platform giants</a> considered to have &#8216;strategic market status&#8217; (and therefore the power to damage digital competition); with a dedicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">Digital Markets Unit already established and up and running within the CMA</a> to lead the work (but which is still pending being empowered by incoming UK legislation).</p>
<p>So the question of what happens to &#8216;old school&#8217; regulatory silos (and narrowly-focused regulatory specialisms) is a key one for our data-driven digital era.</p>
<p>Increased cooperation between regulators like the ICO and the CMA may give way to oversight that&#8217;s even more converged or even merged &#8212; to ensure powerful digital technologies don&#8217;t fall between regulatory cracks &#8212; and therefore that the ball isn&#8217;t so spectacularly dropped on vital issues like ad tracking in the future.</p>
<p>Intersectional digital oversight FTW?</p>
<p>As for the ICO itself, there is a further sizeable caveat in that Denham is not only on the way out (ergo her &#8220;opinion&#8221; naturally has a short shelf life) but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">UK government is busy consulting on &#8216;reforms&#8217; to the UK&#8217;s data protection rules</a>.</p>
<p>Said reforms could see a major downgrading of domestic privacy and data protections; and even legitimize abusive ad tracking &#8212; if ministers, who seem more interested in vacuous soundbites (about removing barriers to &#8220;innovation&#8221;), end up ditching legal requirements to ask Internet users for consent to do stuff like track and profile them in the first place, per some of the proposals.</p>
<p>So the UK&#8217;s next information commissioner, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/uk-names-john-edwards-as-its-choice-for-next-data-protection-chief-as-govt-eyes-watering-down-privacy-standards/">John Edwards</a>, may have a very different set of &#8216;data rules&#8217; to apply.</p>
<p>And &#8212; if that&#8217;s the case &#8212; Denham will, in her roundabout way, have helped make sliding standards happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Polestar launched its first all-electric vehicle last year, it came in a single flavor: a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive configuration that cost around $50,000 before incentives. Next year, the automaker is adding some variety.</p>
<p>Polestar is rolling out a more affordable, single-motor, two-wheel-drive version of the sedan that still offers many of the features of the dual-motor Polestar 2 along with a few changes that make it a bit more affordable, appealing and greener for those looking to make the electric switch. In a recent drive, we put it to the test.</p>
<h2>Single or dual motor</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2239500" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Polestar-2-kirsten-k.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239500" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2239500 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Polestar-2-kirsten-k.jpg" alt="2022 Polestar 2 single motor" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Polestar-2-kirsten-k.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Polestar-2-kirsten-k.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Polestar-2-kirsten-k.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Polestar-2-kirsten-k.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Polestar-2-kirsten-k.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Polestar-2-kirsten-k.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Polestar-2-kirsten-k.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2239500" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239475" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The 2022 Polestar 2 single motor offers a Polestar-estimated 270 miles of range, a bit less oomph and fewer options yet plenty of technology to make your drive easier.</p>
<p>Rather than having two motors that power all four wheels — like it does with the dual motor — this single-motor version pushes all its 231 horsepower and 243 pound-feet of torque to the front wheels. The 2022 Polestar 2 single motor comes with a 78 kWh battery pack that sits under the floor between the front and rear wheels. Polestar says that its usable capacity is 75 kWh. The same battery pack is in the Polestar 2 dual motor. Polestar can and has pushed over-the-air updates to all of its vehicles to help make charging faster and tweak battery settings to make them more efficient.</p>
<p>The 2022 Polestar 2 Single motor sedans also get the optional addition of a mechanical heat pump (available in the Plus Pack for $4,000 more) that helps maintain that charge in more adverse climates. Polestar says that under certain climate conditions the heat pump will scavenge heat from the outside air to extend the range of the vehicle by as much as 10%. Using Polestar&#8217;s estimate, that means that the 2022 Polestar 2 Single motor could gain an additional 27 miles of range thanks to the heat pump.</p>
<p>For this model year, the fully loaded Launch Edition has been eliminated. The Polestar 2 Single motor replaces it and comes with a simplified and less loaded setup including a metal roof instead of the Launch Edition&#8217;s glass one, environmentally-friendly upholstery and a choice of a handful of option &#8220;packs,&#8221; as Polestar calls them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can opt for the Plus Pack, which includes the heat pump, a glass panoramic roof, Harman Kardon premium audio and a wireless phone charger (amongst other things). This pack was on the prototype Polestar 2 I drove. You can also opt for the the Pilot Pack ($3,200 more) that includes things like adaptive cruise control and LED exterior lighting. Sadly, the vehicle I drove did not have the upgraded ADAS system so I was not able to test out what Polestar says offers Level 2 driver support aids on my drive.</p>

<p>The Polestar 2 has the distinction of being the first vehicle to use Google&#8217;s Android Automotive operating system. While Volvo has also rolled out the Android Automotive OS in some of its vehicles like the Volvo XC40 Recharge, the entire Polestar brand uses the platform.</p>
<p>Android Automotive OS is an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-is-making-it-easier-to-bring-android-apps-to-your-car/">open source operating system</a> that runs on Linux and is used as the underlying operating system in vehicle infotainment systems, including Polestar. As a result, Google services such as Google Assistant, Google Maps and the Google Play Store are embedded into the car. Android OS is not the same as Android Auto, a secondary interface that lies on top of an operating system and lets users project the functions and feel of their smartphone to the vehicle&#8217;s center display.</p>
<p>In the 2022 Polestar 2, users can choose to access almost everything in the vehicle via voice control by using the convenient &#8220;Hey Google,&#8221; initiation phrase. This phrase gets you access to climate control and driving directions. Since the public has been so deeply steeped in the Google infrastructure for so long now, it&#8217;s all highly intuitive.</p>
<p>Tell the system your feet are hot and Google OS will lower the temperature in the footwell. Want to find the best taco place in Santa Barbara? Just ask Google to search then navigate there like I did. I rarely touched the touchscreen while driving, as I could pretty much do everything I needed just by asking Google to do it for me.</p>
<p>Natural language recognition is something Google has been working on diligently for many years and it keeps getting better. A few times, when using the system, I botched a request or awkwardly asked for something like adding a stop at a local beach to take photos. The system didn&#8217;t miss a beat and untangled my language to do just what I asked it to do.</p>
<p>In the Polestar 2 Single motor I drove, charging locations were somewhat integrated to the Google Maps platform on Android OS. There are some caveats, however.</p>
<p>Ask Google to find charging stations along your route, and you can filter by brand. While doing so in Google Maps, the system won&#8217;t tell you if a charger is available or working. Polestar has partnered with ChargePoint to provide charging access, and you can use the ChargePoint App, installed on the center screen, to learn more about your selected charger. It does take some tapping around the screen before hitting the road, which means you&#8217;ll still need to pull over and stop before heading to the nearest charger. On my 200-mile roundtrip from the Pacific Design Center in Hollywood to Santa Barbara I didn&#8217;t need to stop to recharge.</p>
<p>If I had needed to recharge, Polestar says that on DC fast chargers, I could have expected to get to 80% charge in just about 30 minutes. That&#8217;s down from the 40 minutes it used to take to get to an 80% charge, according to Glenn Parker, a Polestar technical operations specialist. Parker also said that continued over-the-air updates will improve the efficiency and range of the entire portfolio as the company rolls out updates to all owners.</p>
<p>While finding an available charger is still clunky, the integration of Google Maps into the very technological fabric of the Polestar 2 means that your estimated range is displayed each time you navigate to a new place or add a stop along the way. On my day trip, I arrived at each destination with a few miles more range than the system originally thought I&#8217;d have, which was a nice surprise given that I timed my return to LA badly and sat in Westside traffic for 45 minutes, while the range hovered down around 20%.</p>
<h2>On the road</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2199792" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/car-pass-lights.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2199792" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2199792 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/car-pass-lights.gif" alt="Animated image of a car passing by on a curve with flashing headlights and tail lights." width="640" height="404" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2199792" class="wp-caption-text">S<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">eparate drive of 2022 Polestar 2 Dual motor.</span><strong style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Video</strong> <strong style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Credits:</strong><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Kirsten Korosec</span></p></div></p>
<p>The Polestar 2 Single motor is quiet, comfortable and quick. Polestar says that it does 0 to 60 mph in seven seconds, and while that doesn&#8217;t seem like much, it&#8217;s plenty to get you merged into traffic on the highway, especially because the low-end torque is so readily available.</p>
<p>On the prototype I drove, I could adjust a few driving features, including steering feel and one-pedal braking and could toggle some of the driver assistance systems like lane departure warning on and off. Unfortunately, as previously mentioned, my test vehicle did not have any of the advanced driver aids that Polestar offers in the Pilot pack so I didn&#8217;t get to test those.</p>
<p>One of the joys of electric vehicles is the availability of braking mode (B Mode), or one-pedal driving. Essentially you&#8217;re adjusting the level of regeneration you get from the rolling wheels when you lift off the accelerator.</p>
<p>In the Polestar 2, you can roll to a stop, or toggle on the &#8220;Creep&#8221; mode setting through the infotainment screen and the vehicle will move slowly without the accelerator pedal being necessary. I drive most electric vehicles with the most aggressive braking setting, as it&#8217;s the most efficient and most enjoyable mode to employ in Los Angeles traffic. While most people may find the highest setting in the Polestar 2 to be a bit surprising, after a few minutes of getting used to it, it becomes intuitive to use. I did however turn off the &#8220;Creep&#8221; function as it felt unnatural when paired with the regenerative braking mode.</p>
<p>I also spent 90% of my time behind the wheel using the most aggressive steering setting, called &#8220;Firm.&#8221; Essentially the system changes the steering ratio based on the setting you&#8217;ve chosen. Firm offers the most direct-feeling response, while the softer settings make the Polestar feel a bit more roly-poly and slow to respond.</p>
<h2>Right to repair, recondition, recycle</h2>
<p>Polestar makes no bones about its commitment to greener manufacturing and materials. To that end, the company is proactively considering the entire lifecycle of the batteries in its vehicles. According to Parker, the company uses blockchain to track the mining of cobalt for its batteries and is looking into using the system to track other elements used in building their vehicles.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Polestar has also thought relatively comprehensively about the battery and owner lifecycle.</p>
<p>The stacked packs in the Polestar 2 Single motor can be individually replaced as parts fail. Parker said that if one component fails, the company collects that material back to form a closed-loop system. &#8220;We&#8217;re exploring remanufacturing and reusing those components that come back,&#8221; he said. Polestar also offers complete repair instruction and access to a catalog of parts that owners can purchase directly from the company itself, too.</p>
<p>Prices for the Polestar 2 Single motor start at $45,900 and vehicles will be available starting January 2022, not including the destination fee or taxes. With the $7,500 federal tax incentive — as well as incentives from certain states — that price can come down to around $35,000 (again not including taxes and the destination fee).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been almost a year since the EU&#8217;s executive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">announced</a> it would propose rules for political ads transparency in response to concern about online microtargeting and big data techniques making mincemeat of democratic integrity and accountability.</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s come out with its proposal. But frankly it doesn&#8217;t look like the wait was worth it.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_6118">PR</a> claims the proposal will introduce &#8220;strict conditions for targeting and amplifying&#8221; political advertising using digital tools &#8212; including what it describes as a ban on targeting and amplification that use or infer &#8220;sensitive personal data, such as ethnic origin, religious beliefs or sexual orientation&#8221;.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239685" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>However the claimed &#8216;ban&#8217; does not apply if &#8220;explicit consent&#8221; is obtained from the person whose sensitive data is to be exploited to better target them with propaganda &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/cookie-consent-still-a-compliance-trash-fire-in-latest-watchdog-peek/">online &#8216;consents&#8217; to ad targeting</a> are already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/iab-europe-tcf-gdpr-breach-belgium/">a total trashfire of non-compliance</a> in the region.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not clear why the Commission believes politically vested interests hell-bent on influencing elections are going to play by a privacy rule-book that <em>almost no online advertisers operating in the region currently do</em>, even the ones that are only trying to get people to buy useless plastic trinkets or &#8216;detox&#8217; teas.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_6212">Q&amp;A</a> offering further detail on the proposal, the Commission lists a set of requirements that it says anyone making use of political targeting and amplification will need to comply with, which includes having an internal policy on the use of such techniques; maintaining records of the targeting and use of personal data; and recording the source of said personal data &#8212; so at best it seems to be hoping to burden propagandists with the need to create and maintain a plausible paper trail.</p>
<p>Because it is also allowing a further carve-out to allow for political targeting &#8212; writing: &#8220;Targeting could also be allowed in the context of legitimate activities of foundations, associations or not-for-profit bodies with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim, when it targets their own members.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is incredibly vague. A &#8220;foundation&#8221; or an &#8220;association&#8221; with a political &#8220;aim&#8221; sounds like something any campaign group or vested interest could set up &#8212; i.e. to carry on the &#8220;legitimate&#8221; activity of (behaviorally?) targeting propaganda at voters.</p>
<p>In short, the scope for loopholes for political microtargeting &#8212; including via the dissemination of disinformation &#8212; looks massive.</p>
<p>On scope, the Commission says it wants the incoming rules to apply to &#8220;ads by, for or on behalf of a political actor&#8221; as well as &#8220;so called&#8221; issue-based ads &#8212; aka politically charged issues that can be a potent proxy to sway voters &#8212; which it notes are &#8220;liable to influence the outcome of an election or referendum, a legislative or regulatory process or voting behaviour&#8221;.</p>
<p>But how exactly the regulation will define ads that fall in and out of scope remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most substantial measure of a very thin proposal is around transparency &#8212; where the Commission has proposed &#8220;transparency labels&#8221; for paid political ads.</p>
<p>It says these must be &#8220;clearly labelled&#8221; and provide &#8220;a set of key information&#8221; &#8212; including the name of the sponsor &#8220;prominently displayed and an easily retrievable transparency notice&#8221;; along with the amount spent on the political advertisement; the sources of the funds used; and a link between the advertisement and the relevant elections or referenda.</p>
<p>However, again, the Commission appears to be hoping that a few transparency requirements will enforce a sea change on an infamously opaque and fraud-filled industry &#8212; one that has been fuelled by rampant misuse and unlawful exploitation of people&#8217;s data. Rather than cutting off the head of the hydra by <em>actually</em> curbing targeting &#8212; such as by limiting political targeting to broad-brush contextual buckets.</p>
<p>Hence it writes: &#8220;All political advertising services, from adtech that intermediate the placement of ads, to consultancies and advertising agencies producing the advertising campaigns, will have to retain the information they have access to through the provision of their service about the ad, the sponsor and the dissemination of the ad. They will have to transfer this information to the publisher of the political ad &#8212; this can be the website or app where the ad is seen by an individual, a newspaper, a TV broadcaster, a radio station, etc. The publisher will need to make the information available to the individual who sees the ad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Transparency of political advertising will help people understand when they see a paid political advertisement,&#8221; the Commission further suggests, adding: &#8220;With the proposed rules, every political advertisement – whether on Twitter, Facebook or any other online platform – will have to be clearly marked as political advertisement as well as include the identity of the sponsor and a transparency notice with the wider context of the political advertisement and its aims, or a clear indication of where it can be easily retrieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice theory but for one thing plenty of election interference originates from outside a region where the election itself is taking place.</p>
<p>On that the Commission says it will require<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> organisations that provide political advertising services in the EU but do not have a physical presence there to designate a legal representative in a Member States where the services are offered, suggesting: </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This will ensure more transparency and accountability of services providers acting from outside the Union.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>How exactly it will require (and enforce) that stipulation isn&#8217;t clear.</p>
<p>Another problem is that all these transparency obligations will only apply to &#8220;political advertising services&#8221;.</p>
<p>Propaganda that gets uploaded to online platforms like Facebook by a mere &#8220;user&#8221; &#8212; aka an entity that does not <em>self-identify</em> as a political advertising service &#8212; will apparently escape the need for any transparency accountability at all.</p>
<p>Even if they&#8217;re &#8212; y&#8217;know &#8212; working out of a Russian trollfarm that&#8217;s actively trying to destabilize the European Union&#8230; Just so long as they claim to be &#8216;Hans, 32, Berliner, loves cats, hates the CSU&#8217;.</p>
<p>Now if platforms like Facebook were perfectly great at identifying, reporting and purging inauthentic activity, fake accounts and shadey influence ops in their own backyards it <em>might</em> not be such a problem to leave the door open for &#8220;a user&#8221; to post unaccountable political propaganda. But a whole clutch of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/29/1030260/facebook-whistleblower-sophie-zhang-global-political-manipulation/">whistleblowers</a> have pointed out, in excruciating detail, that Facebook at least is very much not that.</p>
<p>So that looks like another massive loophole &#8212; one which underlines why the only genuine way to fix the problem of online disinformation and election interference is to put an end to behavioral targeting period, rather than just fiddling around the edges. Not least because by fiddly with some tepid measures that will offer only a flawed, partial transparency you risk lulling people into a false sense of security &#8212; as well as further normalizing exploitative manipulation (just so long as you have a &#8216;policy&#8217; in place).</p>
<p>Once online ads and content can be targeted at individuals based on tracking their digital activity and harvesting their personal data for profiling, it&#8217;s open season for opaque InfluenceOps and malicious interests to workaround whatever political ads transparency rules you try to layer on top of the cheap, highly scalable tools offered by advertising giants like Facebook to keep spreading their propaganda &#8212; at the expense of your free and fair elections.</p>
<p>Really what this regulation proposes is to create a large admin burden for advertisers who intend to run genuinely public/above board political campaigns &#8212; leaving the underbelly of paid mud slingers, hate spreaders and disinformation peddlers to exploit its plentiful loopholes to run mass manipulation campaigns right through it.</p>
<p>So it will be interesting to see whether the European Parliament takes steps to school the Commission by adding some choice amendments to its draft &#8212; as MEPs have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">taking a stronger line against microtargeting</a> in recent months.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Inside a European push to outlaw creepy ads&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/embed/#?secret=QQ7dhYOxzD" data-secret="QQ7dhYOxzD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>On penalties, for now, under the Commission proposal, &#8216;official&#8217; advertising services could be fined for breaking things like the transparency and record-keeping requirements but how much will be determined locally, by Member States &#8212; at a level the Commission says should be &#8220;effective, proportionate and dissuasive&#8221;.</p>
<p>What might that mean? Well under the proposal, national Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) will be responsible for monitoring the use of personal data in political targeting and for imposing fines &#8212; so, ultimately, for determining the level of fines that domestic rule-breaking political operators might face.</p>
<p>Which does not exactly inspire a whole lot of confidence. DPAs are, after all, resourced by the same set of political entities &#8212; or whichever flavor happens to be in government.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s ICO carried out an extensive audit of political parties data processing activities following the 2018 Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal &#8212; and in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/data-audit-of-uk-political-parties-finds-laundry-list-of-failings/">2020 it reported finding a laundry list of failures</a> across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>So what did the EU&#8217;s (at the time) best resourced DPA do about all these flagrant breaches by UK political parties?</p>
<p>The ICO&#8217;s enforcement action at that point consisted of &#8212; <em>checks notes</em> &#8212; issuing a series of recommendations.</p>
<p>There was also a warning that it <em>might</em> take further action in the future. And this summer the ICO did issue one fine: Slapping the Conservative Party with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/uk-pm-boris-johnsons-tories-guilty-of-spamming-voters/">a £10,000 penalty for spamming voters</a>. Which doesn&#8217;t really sound very dissuasive tbh.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/labour-party-data-breach-ransomware/">Earlier this month</a> another of these UK political data offenders, the Labour Party, was forced to fess up to what it dubbed a &#8220;data incident&#8221; &#8212; involving an unnamed third party data processor. It remains to be seen what sanction it may face for failing to protect supporters&#8217; information in that (post-ICO-audit) instance.</p>
<p>Adtech generally has also faced very little enforcement from EU DPAs &#8212; despite scores of complaints against its privacy-eviscerating targeting methods &#8212; and despite the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">ICO saying back in 2019</a> that its methods are rampantly unlawful under existing data protection law.</p>
<p>Vested interests in Europe have been incredibly successful at stymieing regulatory enforcement against invasive ad targeting.</p>
<p>And, apparently, also derailing progress by defanging incoming EU rules &#8212; so they won&#8217;t do anything much to stop the big-data &#8216;sausage-factory&#8217; of (in this case) political microtargeting from keeping on slicing &#8216;n&#8217; dicing up the eyeballs of the citizenry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voice AI company SoundHound is set to go public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC transaction at a nearly $2.1 billion valuation in early 2022, blank check company Archimedes and its target <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211116005518/en/SoundHound-Inc.-Global-Leader-in-Voice-AI-Technology-to-Become-Publicly-Traded-Through-Proposed-Merger-With-Archimedes-Tech-SPAC-Partners-Co">announced</a>.</p>
<p>The last time you heard SoundHound&#8217;s name might have been several years ago when it was considered a lesser-known Shazam competitor. Now it&#8217;s worth 5.25x what Apple paid for the leading music recognition service – some $400 million, in a transaction that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/apple-closes-its-shazam-acquisition-and-says-the-music-recognition-app-will-soon-become-ad-free/">closed in the fall of 2018</a>. That was five years after TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/17/now-with-175m-users-soundhound-launches-its-ios-7-app-as-company-struggles-to-exit-shazams-shadow/">reported</a> on <a href="https://www.soundhound.com/">SoundHound</a>&#8216;s &#8220;struggles to exit Shazam&#8217;s shadow,&#8221; despite boasting more than 175 million users.</p>
<p>So what happened that would make SoundHound now significantly more valuable than its British counterpart?</p>

<hr />
<p>Well, some of the discrepancy might be due to Shazam&#8217;s somewhat bumpy trajectory; after all, it was valued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/08/sources-apple-is-acquiring-music-recognition-app-shazam/">at $1.02 million post money</a> in its 2015 fundraise. But it&#8217;s SoundHound we are looking at today, because if its <a href="https://voices.soundhound.com/pdfs/SoundHound_Investor_Presentation_11_16_2021.pdf">SPAC deck</a> is to be believed, it seems it is just doing magic in plain sight.</p>
<p>To find out more, let&#8217;s have a closer look at SoundHound&#8217;s history, and dig into the case it is making to argue for its double unicorn valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s always been a slight puzzle why <a href="http://AngelList.com">AngelList</a> never really <em>properly </em>took off in Europe, especially when, a few years ago, there was such a dearth of funding options for poorly served European startups. But the reasons are fairly simple when you look at them. For starters, the US tech industry boomed in the last ten years. Why bother spreading your resources, when your home market is taking off, right? Secondly, the sheer complexity of building such a platform across Europe’s myriad regulatory borders would tend to dissuade even the boldest of actors. So this is why the market for such a fund-raising platform has been more or less wide open for such a long time. Until now.</p>
<p><a href="https://vauban.io/">Vauban</a> is a new startup based out of London which provides venture capital fund managers with tools to raise a fund and invest capital. It’s now closed a Post-Seed / Pre-Series A funding round of £4.7m or $6.3m.</p>
<p>Vauban says it will now deepen its tech and regulatory infrastructure, and launch a new office in Luxembourg to strengthen its European / EU offering, alongside its headquarters in London. Thus it will be able to span the entire European ecosystem.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239690" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The investment round was co-led by Pentech and Outward, in addition to 7percent Ventures and MJ Hudson. A roster of angel investors have also participated including CEO of Nested Matt Robinson;  the founder of Grabayo, Will Neale; the founder and CEO of ComplyAdvantage, Charles Delingpole; Partner at Augmentum Fintech Perry Blacher; and Al Giles, from legal services provider Axiom.</p>
<p>Vauban allows VCs and angel investors to raise funds, create angel syndicates, and manage fundraising and investment activities. The platform claims it enables users to set-up and deploy Funds and SPVs, from multiple global investment jurisdictions, at “a fraction of the usual time and cost”, covering structuring, legal documents, investor onboarding, banking, and reporting.</p>
<p>Vauban says it is onboarding “at least one new client every day” and current VC users include Anthemis, Passion Capital and Octopus Ventures. In total, it says over 5,000 LPs are using its platform.</p>
<p>Founder and Co-CEO Rémy Astié said: “Our goal is to reduce the friction between those who have the capital, and those who need it to solve humanity&#8217;s biggest problems. So, we decided to start by rebuilding the infrastructure on digital rails, because it&#8217;s mission-critical in order to provide a great UX to everyone in the industry: GPs, LPs and Founders.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vauban has appeared at a time when there is huge investment activity in European tech. Some €41.8bn was raised across Europe in the first half of 2021, up from €32.6bn in 2020.</p>
<p>With VC firms now managing several funds and now often using Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to participate in specific deals, make secondary investments, or set up &#8216;sidecar’ funds alongside EIS vehicles or their main institutional funds, the whole process is becoming more complex, hence the increasing ‘platformization’ of the space. Doing all this on spreadsheets or, similarly simple tools, will no longer cut it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, European angel investors are more and more professionalizing and syndicating deals to boost dealmaking and dealflow, hence why a dedicated platform is likely to be welcome.</p>
<p>Ulric Musset, Founder and Co-CEO says, &#8220;One of the biggest catalysts for new startup creation was the launch of Amazon Web Services in the early 2000s. We believe Vauban will have the same impact that AWS has had on the startup ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Andi Kazeroonian, Investor at Outward VC, commented: “Despite the meteoric growth in alternative investments in recent years, the infrastructure the industry relies on has failed to evolve. Simply creating and administering an investment vehicle remains synonymous with lengthy, cumbersome and expensive processes fragmented across multiple service providers. Vauban’s integrated platform has turned this on its head with a relentless focus on product and user experience, which has unsurprisingly led to exceptional organic growth and its emergence as the standout category leader in Europe.”</p>
<p>Craig Anderson, Partner at Pentech added: “We like to invest in category-leading companies with big ambitions for growth. We believe Vauban is building a modern infrastructure for the alternate asset market which enables users to set up, deploy and manage their funds and SPVs in just a few hours.”</p>
<p>Founder and Co-CEO Rémy Astié told me over a call: “We are different to AngelList in that we are very international and global by design. The idea is to create a global platform, which means that you can raise from LPS anywhere in the world, to invest in a company that&#8217;s anywhere in the world. And yeah, we think that&#8217;s our core strength, that we build everything with international LPs in mind, so you can raise in multiple currencies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese space startup Astroscale has raised $109 million in a new Series F round of financing, brining the company&#8217;s total funding raised to date to $300 million. The company specializes in on-orbit servicing technology, designed to help reduce the amount of debris that exists in operating orbital altitudes, and also to extend the life of existing satellites as a means of making orbital businesses more sustainable.</p>
<p>This new funding, led by Japan&#8217;s THE FUND and including participation from investors including Seraphim Space, brings Astroscale&#8217;s total funding to $300 million. The startup&#8217;s CEO and founder Nobu Okada said in a press release that the new funds will help them scale and &#8220;dramatically accelerate [their] ability to make on-orbit servicing routine by 2030.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a big year for Astroscale (Okada will be joining us on stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL5fb8xAiw2k3zgvdb5qacvfitrBmeHyPiKqy0Z9UbQBUXt0MyqNULLcLzpjDwtf1p1b0gyhxOOtgnk0KF2bAFKh4XLjwhur7TRCL07FOJvQmEQ9nmFs41kYDrdHsYO_auHC1k6r1LyLym5ZwiSu_YfqDbbDHHLR6QEN3O5tf6ox">TC Sessions: Space 2021 this year</a>, by the way), with a successful tech demo of its end-of-life services product in August.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber will halt its ride-hailing service in most of Belgium tomorrow following a court ruling Wednesday that extends a 2015 order banning its p2p UberPop service to also cover professional drivers providing its ride-hailing service.</p>
<p>Uber told us that it is studying the detail of the ruling to decide whether to appeal the decision with the country&#8217;s Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The move also follows a temporary suspension of Uber&#8217;s service in Brussels<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uber-temporarily-suspends-brussels-service-first-europe-2021-09-30/"> in September</a> &#8212; an action the tech giant called &#8220;exceptional and unprecedented&#8221;, saying it was only taking the step to protest the lack of reform of rules which prohibit drivers from using smartphones.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239658" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Following the ruling by the Brussels Appeal Court this week, private hire vehicle drivers have also been <a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels-2/195102/uber-demonstration-closes-off-brussels-tunnels/">blocking a major tunnel</a> in the Belgian capital.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a statement on Friday&#8217;s looming shutdown, Uber&#8217;s country chief, Laurent Slits, once again attacked the Belgian government for not delivering a reform it&#8217;s been lobbying for, writing: “This decision was made based on outdated regulations written in a time before smartphones, which the government has promised and failed to reform for the last seven years.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-24/uber-in-brussels-faces-friday-partial-shutdown-after-ruling?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google">Bloomberg</a>, which reported on Uber&#8217;s shutdown earlier, it will not apply to a small number of drivers who are licensed in a Flemish region of the country &#8212; and who will therefore still be allowed to use the app.</p>
<p>Uber confirmed the Appeal Court ruling only affects drivers with Brussels licences.</p>
<p>In the statement, Slits added that the tech giant is &#8220;deeply concerned&#8221; about the 2,000 holders of LVC licenses (aka rental car with driver licences) who he said will &#8220;lose their ability to generate earnings [via Uber&#8217;s platform] from Friday&#8221;.</p>
<p>That phrasing &#8212; &#8220;generate earnings&#8221; &#8212; refers to the fact Uber does not employ drivers directly in Belgium; instead it classifies them as independent contractors. So it cannot claim that 2,000 &#8216;jobs&#8217; are about to be lost since it does not provide employment contracts to the LVC drivers in question in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We urge the government to move quickly to reform the taxi and LVC sector once and for all so that drivers can continue working to provide for their families,” Slits added.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-bans-uber-drivers-from-picking-up-rides-through-the-app/">March</a> the local government in Brussels banned Uber drivers from picking up rides via smartphones and geolocation.</p>
<p>Since then Uber drivers in the city have been operating in a legal grey zone &#8212; where they risk sanctions by continuing to drive using its app. However the company suggests drivers have been given mixed messages, claiming authorities are sometimes telling drivers &#8212; in private &#8212; that they can continue driving.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Uber called the government&#8217;s March order &#8220;mistaken&#8221; &#8212; pointing out that it had promised a reform of the law before the summer. Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uber-temporarily-suspends-brussels-service-first-europe-2021-09-30/">Reuters</a>, a draft law to reform the rules was set out by the Belgian government in September. But, according to Uber, the sector as a whole has yet to see the text.</p>
<p>Uber suggested there is widespread backing in Belgium for reforming the 1995 rules &#8212; not just from LVC drivers who serve customers via its platform but also from traditional taxi firms.</p>
<p>However local taxi firms in Brussels have their own reform ideas &#8212; and have also said they are keen to poach Uber drivers to plug a shortage of taxi drivers.</p>
<p>A sector spokesman recently told <a href="https://www.taxipro.be/ondernemen/2021/09/14/uber-chauffeurs-als-antwoord-op-tekort-taxichauffeurs-brussel/?gdpr=accept&amp;gdpr=accept">TaxiPro</a> there&#8217;s a shortfall of 600+ taxi drivers in the capital which could be filled by LVC holders that have been driving for Uber.</p>
<p>“The big advantage is that we offer a solution to these Uber drivers,” Sam Bouchal told the publication in September [translated to English via Google Translate], saying that the Uber drivers could be offered permanent contracts, and adding: &#8220;We&#8217;re getting them out of illegality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bouchal also told TaxiPro that the taxi sector wants to avoid what he couched as &#8220;a social massacre.&#8221;</p>
<p>Concern over gig working conditions has been a fiery topic across Europe for years, leading to scores of legal challenges &#8212; and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/blow-to-uber-in-europe-as-top-court-rules-its-a-transport-service/">2017 ruling by Europe&#8217;s top court</a> that Uber is a transport service and so cannot simply dodge local taxi regulations.</p>
<p>In the UK, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">Uber was also recently been forced to recognize drivers as workers</a> after losing the last of a long line of employment challenges at the country&#8217;s Supreme Court.</p>
<p>However, in Belgium &#8212; a core centre of power for the European Commission &#8212; the ride-hailing giant is continuing to lobby for favorably changes to the law to grease the engines of its platform business.</p>
<p>Uber is also lobbying the Commission to address ride-hailing regulations across the bloc&#8217;s single market in an upcoming <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12916-Sustainable-transport-new-urban-mobility-framework_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12916-Sustainable-transport-new-urban-mobility-framework_en&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637916941304000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2CuSdq_DOgkYbFhLrJViqg">urban mobility framework</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; which the EU exec has said it wants to support the development of urban transport systems that are &#8220;safe, accessible, inclusive, affordable, smart, resilient and emission-free&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s hope here is that EU lawmakers will seek to apply rules that override city level regulations &#8212; setting a pan-EU enabling framework for ride-hailing services which would mean it could just ignore local authority demands.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>However the Commission has also said it wants the urban mobility framework to tackle &#8220;transport pollution and congestion&#8221; &#8212; so it&#8217;s not clear how removing regulatory barriers to ride-hailing would be anything other than counterproductive on that front.</p>
<p>Cars remain the least efficient way to transport people around dense urban environments given how much space they require and how relatively few people can be moved around in the space occupied by a single car vs a train, bus, cycling, scooting, walking etc. The rise of micromobility has also fuelled the range of available car alternatives &#8212; so the arguments in favor of cars in cities are shrinking rapidly.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has also led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars/">a number of European cities</a> to dial up their focus on transforming street infrastructure to be more pedestrian and locally focused, also leveraging the rise of micromobility to enact policies that deliberately de-emphasize the car. Simply put, cleaner air and more vibrant local streets (and<a href="https://twitter.com/zachklein/status/1450113164775870468"> school bike trains</a>) are hard to argue against.</p>
<p>While Brussels has not been at the forefront of those developments the city has been <a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/57902/a-campaign-in-brussels-to-reduce-the-number-of-cars-entering-and-leaving-the-city/">seeking to reduce the number of cars</a> on its infamously congested, <a href="https://epha.org/brussels-inhabitants-testify-how-air-pollution-impacts-their-health/">pollution-smogged</a> roads in recent years. So Belgium&#8217;s government may well have reason to pause and consider the implications of any ride-hailing reforms.</p>
<p>In parallel, the European Commission has been working on another legislation initiative &#8212; which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">wants to improve conditions for platform workers</a> across the bloc, responding to high levels of concern over factors such as the lack of job security and precarious earnings.</p>
<p>On that front Uber has also been busy lobbying &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">stands accused</a> of pushing EU lawmakers to reduce standards for platform workers, with critics saying it&#8217;s seeking to replicate its success in overturning a California law that had sought to classify gig workers as employees.</p>
<p>So the street-level battle for Europe&#8217;s social contract is very real.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Worldwide, over 1.3 trillion eggs are produced annually, and Perfeggt co-founders believe this market is largely untapped and has room to grow with plant-based alternatives.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sales of plant-based alternatives, like dairy and meat, are <a href="https://www.meticulousresearch.com/product/plant-based-food-products-market-5108" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surging in the global market</a>, and Perfeggt wants to do the same for the egg.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based foodtech company is poised to debut its chicken-less egg product in the first quarter of 2022 in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Today, the company announced it raised $2.8 million in its first funding round to aid the initial launch and then expand further in Europe later in 2022.</p>
<p>Backers in the round include EVIG Group, Stray Dog Capital, E2JDJ, Tet Ventures, Good Seed Ventures, Sustainable Food Ventures and Shio Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239291" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Perfeggt CEO Tanja Bogumil co-founded the company, which is part of Lovely Day Foods GmbH, earlier this year with Gary Lin, EVIG’s founder and CEO, and Bernd Becker, who was a long-time head of R&amp;D for Rügenwalder Mühle, a German vegetarian and vegan meat maker.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239295" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239295" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2239295" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bernd-Becker-Gary-Lin-Tanja-Bogumil-v.l.n.r.-Perfeggt-©-Perfeggt_Patrycia-Lukaszewicz.jpg" alt="Bernd Becker, Gary Lin, Tanja Bogumil v.l.n.r.

<p>“I really believe we deserve better food,” Bogumil told TechCrunch. “My mother’s family is from an agriculture background in small-scale farming, so I have always been conscious of where the food we eat comes from. I turned vegetarian at 12 when my uncle brought me to a slaughterhouse to show me that the sausages I ate were not made the right way. I didn’t fully get what was happening there, but it didn’t feel right or humane.”</p>
<p>Unlike dairy, where there is already sustainability, she believes the egg is still largely untapped. Sure, there are companies making similar plant-based alternatives, like Simply Eggless and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/eat-just-the-alt-protein-company-formerly-known-as-hampton-creek-has-raised-another-200-million/">Just Eat, which raised $200 million</a> earlier in the summer, but worldwide, <a href="https://ew-nutrition.com/us/how-producers-keep-the-egg-supply-chain-going-amid-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1.3 trillion eggs are produced annually</a>, meaning there is room to grow, and applications are versatile, Bogumil said.</p>
<p>Perfeggt’s first plant-based egg product is a protein-rich liquid alternative made from fava beans. It can be prepared as a scrambled egg or omelet in the pan. The company will initially be launching its product with food service organizations.</p>
<p>As with all food, taste is king, and with this product, the co-founders worked to create similar mouth feel, sensory, flavors and textures — all elements that Bogumil says are needed to get people to switch to a plant-based equivalent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This is something we spent time on figuring out,” she added. “Our product is built around the fava bean, which is very suited to mimic functionality required for these applications.”</p>
<p>To do this, Perfeggt’s R&amp;D site in Emsland, Germany works closely with Wageningen University &amp; Research, known for its life sciences research, to test plant-based protein sources and their combinations that come closest to the nutritional and functional properties of animal products.</p>
<p>The new funding enables the company to build out its team at its headquarters and R&amp;D facility. The company is currently hiring for food scientists, marketing and R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bogumil believes that more companies coming into the egg alternative space will help Perfeggt’s mission to shift people to plant-based foods.</p>
<p>“This is not a one-winner-takes-all market,” she said. “We have never in history seen alternative proteins be so close to the mainstream market. Clearly that is reflected in the capital markets, and not just for developing niche markets, but for the future of food.”</p>
<p>“We are incredibly impressed by the team&#8217;s rapid technological progress in developing next-generation alternative proteins and finding solutions that improve human, planetary and animal health,” Stephanie Dorsey, founding partner at E2JDJ, added in a written statement. “The egg market is a massive opportunity and this is just the beginning.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria’s informal trade sector, worth over $244 billion, has more than 40 million micro, small and medium businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these businesses operated offline until a few years ago when startups brought about digitization by providing infrastructure and a gamut of e-commerce and financial services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One-year-old <a href="https://www.sabi.am/">Sabi</a> &#8212; a spinoff from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/nigerias-rensource-raises-20m-to-power-african-markets-by-solar/">Rensource</a>, an African energy company that offers power-as-a-service to customers &#8212; is the latest startup to raise funds to serve the informal sector. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised a $6 million bridge round led by pan-African VC firm CRE Venture Capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239606" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi’s bridge round is coming a year after closing a $2 million seed round from CRE Venture Capital, Janngo Capital, Atlantica Ventures and Waarde Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/aadesina">Ademola Adesina</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anu-adasolum-46754a19/">Anu Adasolum</a> have been at the helm of Rensource since the company started in 2015; Adesina as founder and CEO and Adasolum, COO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By providing these small and medium businesses with power, the team at Rensource began to look into other pain points these SMEs had and find ways to add value beyond energy provision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the pandemic halting Rensource’s business, the team had time to develop this concept which became Sabi in October 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adasolum leads Sabi’s efforts as founder and CEO following the company’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">branch out in March, while Adesina</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> holds a co-founder and director role. </span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lHWrgkoSul"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/nigerias-rensource-raises-20m-to-power-african-markets-by-solar/">Nigeria’s Rensource raises $20M to power African markets by solar</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria’s Rensource raises $20M to power African markets by solar&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/nigerias-rensource-raises-20m-to-power-african-markets-by-solar/embed/#?secret=lHWrgkoSul" data-secret="lHWrgkoSul" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi is an attempt at platforming the informal sector and African trade via various online and offline channels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means that Sabi tries to complement the middlemen (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> distributors) in the B2B e-commerce retail chain rather than replace them, a model familiar with other prominent B2B e-commerce retail startups such as Sokowatch, MaxAB TradeDepot and Twiga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not trying to be, you know, a tech-enabled digital distributor. We’re not trying to disintermediate a market full of hyper-specialization where one of the defining characteristics of the informal sector is you have all these middlemen and agents performing a very narrow role,” Adesina said to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that specialization is important for the sector to work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">properly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; whether it’s aggregation, making a sale, knowing the customer especially well, all these middlemen play a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">key role. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the way we deal with them is we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">give them a set of tools and an infrastructure they can run their business on to make it more optimized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi caters to the needs of manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers and classifies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them as merchants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company operates an asset-light model and doesn’t own vehicles, warehouses or goods. But it provides visibility into these assets across the entire value chain from the demand and supply side and controls on a single platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running this model exempts Sabi from the constraints a typical B2B e-commerce retail platform might face when acting as a distributor for manufacturers to retailers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, asset-heavy platforms can’t move goods from two different suppliers in the same truck or use the same salespeople when distributing goods from different suppliers to retailers. On</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other hand,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sabi doesn’t have such constraints, so whereas other platforms try to standardize operations around goods offtake, Sabi concentrates </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on offtake monitoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We focus our processes, policies and monitoring around understanding the different types of users and monitoring how the third parties we work with are serving them,” said CEO Adasolum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a result, the net experience of each off-taker is different and it works more for their particular business type</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I’m not going to go to a business that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to working a particular way and change it but instead offer several other channels that they’re more comfortable with through our platform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These channels include offline agents, call centres, merchant partners, supplier centres and mobile app. Each stakeholder can access tools around inventory management, sales, tracking, digital invoices, analytics on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re starting with what makes them comfortable, not what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is best,” the CEO added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants on Sabi deal with FMCG goods and products in other sectors such as agriculture, electronics and chemicals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The category-agnostic platform is home to more than 175,000 merchants who have made B2B transactions totalling over $200 million annualized GMV run rate. And more than 10,000 agents serve these merchants on Sabi’s network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi makes money by taking a transaction fee when any merchants perform any sale on the marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company also earns a margin for providing financing to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adesina said in Q1 2022, Sabi plans to roll out a subscription model where agents will pay a monthly fee to access a reseller model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Sabi’s pipeline is providing manufacturers with visibility and data-backed insights and direct engagement down the value chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing an average of 40% month on month in Nigeria, Sabi intends to replicate its rapid growth in other African countries Kenya and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company opened shop in Kenya last month and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made a few hires in South Africa, intending to go live early next year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another round of funding, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series A, might </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">close in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time to fuel the company’s expansion into both countries, Adesina said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pardon Makumbe, co-founder and managing partner of CRE Venture Capital, in a statement emphasizing why his firm doubled down on its investment under a year said, “Sabi’s online and offline approach to serving informal businesses, combined with the quality of its platform and service provider curation, has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taken root in Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is on track to be one of the fastest-growing African companies of 2021 and is showing no signs of slowing down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi’s growth, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to market demand, comes from the background of its founders. Before Sabi and Rensource, CEO Adasolum worked at Jumia, where she was in charge of offline sales for some African countries: Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has also performed commercial operations and merchant acquisition roles for the African e-commerce giant. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adesina too has vast experience working with multinationals such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Capricorn Investment Group, the Rockefeller Foundation and JP Morgan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adesina is confident that the digitization of offline processes for B2B e-commerce retail will continue despite questions about why many players exist in the space. And he believes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as more startups come into the market, more venture capital will follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi’s monthly GMV numbers is one reason the co-founder has this conviction.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, the company claims to be on the verge of processing about $12 million monthly GMV</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Jumia, Africa’s biggest e-commerce player, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/jumia-posts-revenue-and-order-gains-but-compounding-losses-drag-its-stock-lower/">records this volume </a>on average after five years in operation, it has taken Sabi less than a year to achieve this feat which can be attributed to the size of the country&#8217;s informal B2B e-commerce retail market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The kind of data we’re seeing now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like real-time visibility into whether people like this product or that product, that stuff is gonna </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accrue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and grow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the next a few years,” the co-founder said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the same way one saw in China in the late 90s the kind of hyper digitalization of what was a very informal economy, I see that happening faster in Africa than most people realize. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s something people don’t realize how </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s going to happen.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.pyxo.fr">Pyxo</a>, a French startup that has been thinking a lot about single-use plastic food packaging for the past three years. The company wants to offer a service that makes it as easy and as cost-efficient to use reusable food storage containers at scale.</p>
<p>The idea behind Pyxo comes from a fair at the Tuileries gardens in Paris. Right next to the food stands, waste bins were overflowing with soda cups, clamshell burger containers and various single-use food packaging.</p>
<p>At first, the company started working with French corporate catering service company <a href="https://www.sodexo.com">Sodexo</a>. They worked with them to replace plastic cups and make everything reusable. Due to the coronavirus pandemic and the switch to remote work, Pyxo started looking for other potential clients.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239326" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They have started working with <a href="https://www.foodles.co">Foodles</a>, <a href="https://popchef.com">Popchef</a> and other foodtech companies that offer connected fridges with packed lunches and snacks.</p>
<p>But Pyxo’s biggest market opportunity comes from a regulatory change. In July 2020, France’s parliament passed an anti-waste law with some drastic changes. Restaurants have to switch to reusable food containers by January 2023.</p>
<p>It means that fast food restaurant chains won’t be able to use paper-and-plastic cups, disposable clamshell boxes, etc. Pyxo is already working with an unnamed fast food chain in France to help them switch to reusable packaging.</p>
<p>The startup has created a sort of marketplace of reusable food containers that connect every company in the industry. When a fast food restaurant buy a batch of containers, they all come with a QR code or NFC chip to track them everywhere.</p>
<p>Restaurants can outsource cleaning to specialized companies who can give you a batch of clean containers when they come and pick up the containers of the day. These contracting companies also scan containers, cups and whatever they are cleaning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to that, customers could also order take-out food and bring it home in reusable containers. They could use an app to find the nearest collection point — it doesn’t necessarily have to be the restaurant where you originally ordered your food. Pyxo is thinking about gamification and small deposits to incentivize returns.</p>
<p>“Our vision is that it’s an infrastructure industry,” co-founder and CEO Benjamin Peri told me. Pyxo thinks it is building a network that works just like the electrical grid. Down the road, the startup believes there will be a dense network of restaurants, collection points and cleaning centers.</p>
<p>Fast food chains could help kickstart the industry because a single client has a ton of restaurants around the country. They could incentivize other actors to participate in the network with Pyxo acting as the network operator.</p>
<p>The company is just getting started as there are only a few restaurants actively using Pyxo right now. But the startup has raised a $7.9 million (€7 million) funding round from Eurazeo, FiveSeasons Ventures and others.</p>
<p>On January 1st, 2023, the startup expects to work with 2,000 points of sales in the restaurant industry alone. Pyxo still expects to work with foodtech companies and corporate catering services, but they would represent a smaller part of the business. With today’s funding round, the company expects to recruit 70 additional employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.camlist.com/">Camlist</a>, a video marketplace for pets, has raised $1.3 million in a pre-seed round, funding that the startup plans to use to develop its platform and grow its workforce &#8212; as it looks to expand its reach in the UK, its second market (after the U.A.E.), which it entered earlier this year.</p>
<p>Unlike other marketplaces, Camlist (derived from camera listing) allows sellers to list videos of the pets they wish to sell, and once contact is made, the buyer and seller can engage through both video and text-chat within the app.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/peek-raises-80m-as-its-travel-experiences-software-and-marketplace-business-passes-2b-in-bookings/">marketplace</a> currently only allows the listing of pets, but it is set to diversify to other items in the near future.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239588" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Classifieds, or peer to peer commerce in general, has been stuck in the same old way of operation since eBay showed up. There has not been real significant innovation ever since; it&#8217;s just listings, maybe some images and phone numbers,” said Camlist co-founder and chief executive officer, Moustafa Mahmoud.</p>
<p>“But at Camlist we are changing that. We are turning the marketplace into a video experience because every pre-owned item has a story.”</p>
<p>Mahmoud said that they are building the safest way for anyone to find a pet by also ensuring verified health checks and interest free financing, in partnership with third parties, for those unable to make one-off payments. Camlist has rehomed over 6,000 pets to date.</p>
<p>“Our in-app GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) has been growing 100% every two quarters, so we&#8217;re doubling every quarter, and our total GMV is around $2 million a month,” said Mahmoud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Y Combinator company was founded and launched in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/uae-b2b-e-commerce-site-dubuy-targets-africa-for-growth/">Dubai, U.A.E</a>, last year, just before Covid pandemic hit. The launch turned out to be timely and the site grew popular as people, forced to stay home, bought their own pets &#8212; partly to deal with boredom, but also because they had the time to nurture them.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re building the marketplace category by category, and we just feel that the pets listing is so huge, and also very underserved. We plan to expand into different items as we grow,” said Mahmoud, who is also a computer scientist.</p>
<p>Other co-founders include <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maharefai/?originalSubdomain=uk">Maha Refa</a>i, also the startup&#8217;s chief product officer, who has 16 years’ experience building and scaling digital products. She is also the creator of MBC&#8217;s (Middle East’s largest free-to-air broadcaster) premier video platform as well as other multiple video streaming products.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alsayedgamal/?originalSubdomain=eg">Alsayed Gamal</a>, who is Camlist chief technical officer, has 15 years software engineering experience. He has knowledge and experience in mobile platforms, data engineering, DevOps, API design, microservices and serverless architecture.</p>
<p>Mahmoud said the idea to start Camlist was inspired by the need to counter the bad experiences he went through while making purchases on classified sites in Dubai, U.A.E, where items were often misrepresented and scams high.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239630" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239630" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2239630 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239630" class="wp-caption-text">Moustafa Mahmoud; Camlist chief executive officer, he co-founded the video marketplace with Maha Refai; the startup&#8217;s chief product officer and Alsayed Gamal; chief technical officer.</p></div></p>
<p>Classifieds are popular in Dubai, an expat city, as people use them to dispose of their items, but they have also provided an opportunity for scammers to target unsuspecting people. To counter this, Camlist has an option for in-app payments &#8212; with funds released once the buyers confirm receipt of the pets. This feature ensures that buyers are not defrauded by deterring cons masquerading as vendors.</p>
<p>Mahmoud and his other co-founders provide a marketplace that allows buyers to first experience items of interest, through video, before making a purchase. This is besides ensuring that buyers were protected against fraud and guaranteeing high quality services.</p>
<p>The company also follows up with the sellers on its platform to ensure that they are breeding or keeping the pets in healthy environments, as well as vaccinating, deworming, and microchipping them.</p>
<p>“We also support our buyers and sellers by providing them with free vaccinations, microchipping, deworming, insurance, and pet food. We try to provide the best experience for our buyers and our sellers,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup raised the new funding from Y-Combinator; the technology startup accelerator, Act One Ventures; an early-stage venture fund and a number of angel investors from Houseparty, Mux and Facebook.</p>
<p>“We really looked forward to investors who believe in our vision of building the marketplace of the future. And we are really fortunate to get people who believe in this vision, and who actually work and build applications in the video industry,” said Mahmoud.</p>
<p>After achieving traction in the UK, Camlist is planning to enter the US market, which it believes is going to be a huge and important market for them.</p>
<p>“So, the current state for us is expansion within the UK because it&#8217;s a pretty big market. And we can see the impact of what we&#8217;re doing here. But as soon as we reach a certain stage where we have the majority of the market, then we will start to expand into the United States,” said Mahmoud, who was born in Egypt, with his family moving to Dubai when he was six years old.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In December 2020, Beijing laid out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">guideline</a> for Ant Group to &#8220;rectify&#8221; its business after calling off its IPO, which could have been the largest initial public offering in history. In the plan, regulators asked Ant to revamp its credit business, among other changes that would make it subject to the same set of regulations overseeing financial institutions. In other words, Ant can no longer get by with its freewheeling practices by calling itself a &#8220;tech&#8221; firm.</p>
<p>Nearly a year later, the Alibaba-affiliated fintech powerhouse showed that it has almost finished restructuring its popular consumer credit products.</p>
<p>Credit loan products contributed nearly 40% of Ant&#8217;s revenues in the six months ended June 2020, according to the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2020/1026/2020102600165.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prospectus</a> filed last year. The two main products are Huabei (Spend), which launched in 2014 for daily expenditures by consumers, working like a virtual credit card. A year later Jiebei (Borrow) was introduced as a credit product for larger consumption transactions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239625" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Under the old model, Ant originated loans that were then underwritten by third-party banks and other financial institutions. As of June 2020, about 98% of Ant&#8217;s credit balance originated through its platform was underwritten by its partner financial institutions or securitized, according to the firm&#8217;s prospectus.</p>
<p>Jiebei has split itself into two brands, users reported earlier this week. Credit lines extended by third-party banks are now called Xinyong Dai (Credit Loan) on Alipay, Ant&#8217;s flagship financial services app. Those provided by Ant&#8217;s consumer finance company, which was recently established at the behest of regulators, are staying under the Jiebei brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://weibo.com/u/5445230801?layerid=4707056739157128">Huabei has similarly started a restructuring</a>, which will show users which loans are extended independently by banks and which by Ant&#8217;s consumer finance firm. Huabei will focus on &#8220;small-ticket&#8221; everyday transactions, it <a href="https://weibo.com/5445230801/L2XzPCqbC?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in a Weibo post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Following the brand differentiation, users applying for credit loan services will have more information about their credit providers to avoid brand confusion.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Huabei also noted that it&#8217;s now submitting consumer credit information to a database overseen by China&#8217;s central bank. It <a href="https://weibo.com/5445230801/KzjHoddoe?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> the routine in September after it established its consumer credit company, which, just like banks, need to report their credit information to the central bank in China.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Whether you agree or not, it's hard to ignore the fact that the multipliers in Silicon Valley and the growth of software businesses have changed the way we think about a startup's timeline.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On a recently recorded (and soon-to-be published) episode of the <a href="https://pod.link/found">Found podcast</a>, an entrepreneur told my co-host and me that he sees a broad swath of the venture capitalists out there as money managers, more focused on short-term gains and returns than long-term revolutionary technology.</p>
<p>Whether you agree or not, it&#8217;s hard to ignore the fact that the multipliers in Silicon Valley and the growth of software businesses have changed the way we think about a startup&#8217;s timeline.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The pressure from [Index] caused us to work a little harder and be a little bit more precise in our instrumentation to be able to prove that the long-term trajectory would achieve certain milestones that would work for everybody.&#8221;							<cite>Jessica McKellar</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pilot/">Pilot</a>, a bookkeeping software service that has raised more than $160 million since inception, is not necessarily a stranger to the shorter-term desires of investors. Index Ventures partner Mark Goldberg, who led the Series A and Series B rounds for the startup, would be the first to tell you that the board and the founders had some early disagreements about how the company should operate.</p>
<p>Obviously, it wasn&#8217;t enough to stop him or Index from doubling down on the business.</p>
<p>We talked about all this and more on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a>.</p>
<h2>Doubling down</h2>
<p>&#8220;It was pretty terrifying,&#8221; said Goldberg. &#8220;In my gut, I thought, &#8216;Wow, we better get this right.'&#8221;</p>
<p>A few things clicked into place for Goldberg to want to keep investing in Pilot. The first was that it was a real category-creation opportunity, in that bookkeeping was a $100 billion industry that was largely fragmented.</p>
<p>The second was the customer love for the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to hear customers proactively calling us from within the Index portfolio saying that they hated doing bookkeeping and back office functions, and now they don&#8217;t have to think about it. They said things like &#8216;Whoever this Pilot team is, they&#8217;re doing some wizardry so I can just shut my brain off to the part of the business I didn&#8217;t enjoy doing.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The third was the conviction and dedication of the team to empathizing with and understanding their customers.</p>
<p>He recalled a time early on when the team was no more than 10 people, most of them engineers, when he visited the office on a weekend. They were all wearing green visors, doing bookkeeping for their customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t doing it because they needed to for customer support, but because they really wanted to empathize with the customers for the product that they were building,&#8221; said Goldberg. &#8220;That&#8217;s the sort of sweat equity and market recognition that told me, if this continues to grow, there really is no ceiling on what this business could become.&#8221;</p>
<p>While that sort of dedication to understanding the user was attractive, it was not without its costs.</p>
<h2>Counterintuitive convictions</h2>
<p>&#8220;Pilot is a technology company wrapped in this lovely human layer of high-touch support for its customers, which is a bit counter-intuitive in Silicon Valley, where most companies don&#8217;t want humans in the loop,&#8221; said Goldberg. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I know and understand, and we had a view that this sort of tech-enabled service model could be very valuable, but we wanted to make sure that they could create a financial profile that had gross margins that reflected that of a software company.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its simplest form, Jessica McKellar and her co-founders felt very strongly that they wanted to focus on the customer fully and deliver great customer service from the very beginning. In a business where you are onboarding customers by ingesting the entirety of their financials, that can be costly.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/in-a-crowded-global-market-canadian-ai-startups-fundraising-results-stand-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Up north, an AI boom:</a></strong> Continuing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/huge-deals-are-pushing-more-ai-startups-into-ipo-territory/">TechCrunch’s coverage</a> of the rapid-fire AI fundraising market, we explored the Canadian artificial-intelligence startup industry. There’s a lot more going on up north than you might expect. Consider this more evidence of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly global startup landscape</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/france-asks-search-engines-and-app-stores-to-remove-wish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">France moves to delist Wish:</a> </strong>Akin to a nonprofit U.S. newsroom, France decided to test its concerns about e-commerce marketplace Wish by buying stuff and checking out what they got. A bunch of violations, it turns out. France is now asking search engines and app stores to delist the public U.S. company.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/attio-wants-to-build-the-crm-for-the-airtable-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attio is taking on Salesforce:</a></strong> While startups are busy attacking a host of markets, there are certain areas of the software domain that have felt too off-limits in recent years. Search is finally seeing a wave of competitors, for example. Attio, now flush with $7.7 million in capital, is taking on the old-school CRM market.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/kenyan-fintech-asilimia-raises-2-million-in-a-pre-seed-round-plans-to-extend-loans-to-msmes-and-expand-in-east-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Asilimia wants to bring more loans to Kenya:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The business of loaning money to folks not supported by the traditional banking world is big business. Asilimia just raised $2 million — half debt, half equity — to keep money flowing in its home market. Per TechCrunch reporting, the company also offers “a lifeline to traders in Kenya by enabling them to make mobile money transactions that are devoid of transfer charges through its Leja app.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/nigerias-onepipe-raises-3-5m-to-double-down-on-its-embedded-finance-offering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OnePipe raises $3.5M for its fintech API business:</strong></a> Plaid is a big deal in its domestic market, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t related startups executing similar work around the world. OnePipe is one such company, bringing fintech infra APIs to Africa. And now it has a pile of new funds to continue its work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/india-used-cars-platform-spinny-valued-at-1-75-billion-in-over-280-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ok *now* the used car market is out of control:</strong></a> If you read business news, you’ve read about the used car market. A chip shortage has made used cars more pricey than ever. And now Indian startup Spinny has shifted into unicorn territory with a new $280 million round. There are related companies in the U.S. market that have gone public, so Spinny is operating in a market that we understand. Let’s see how its economics bear out.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/vollebak-which-makes-clothes-for-the-future-is-closing-its-series-a-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Clothes for a bleak future:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you want jackets for huge storms and a fleece for extreme conditions — wagering that climate change is going to make our home planet a bit less fun to live on — Vollebak has your, well, back. The startup just raised a Series A, likely, we guess, hoping to follow Allbirds and other recent DTC debuts to the public markets.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/juicy-marbles-gets-4-5m-to-sizzle-up-plant-based-steaks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Today in startup names we’re not sure about:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I’ve never been huge on calling meat fat “marbling” &#8212; to me, marble is the material for old-world erotic sculptures. I blame my parents’ love for art and art museums for this view. Regardless, there’s a startup called Juicy Marbles out there hoping to create “plant-based whole meat cuts.” I am in favor of the product and the company’s goals. But Juicy Marbles? There I am less confident.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Japan has been the birthplace of traditional arts and crafts since ancient times. Craftmanship, meticulous attention to detail and balance of design and functionality have contributed to creating unique Japanese products like pottery, traditional fabrics, washi (paper), woodwork, glasses, bento-boxes and more. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This craftsmanship continues to be passed along from generation to generation and live on in modern Japan. However, the craftsmen and women, who do not always have the skills or tools to be influential merchants, have often been left behind in the rapidly evolving business environment in the 21st century. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In recent years, a growing number of e-commerce entrepreneurs have started to develop their own products and brands in response to a shift in consumer demand from cheap, mass-produced goods to diversified products that meet one’s unique needs and lifestyle. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239178" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.forest-inc.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forest</a>, a Japanese e-commerce aggregator, seeks to identify sustainable, high-quality products and brands that embrace the spirit of Japan </span>and help them grow and enter the global market by using the power of technology.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Forest announced today it has raised approximately $8 million (900 million yen) of seed round led by <a href="https://www.ut-ec.co.jp/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners (UTEC)</a> and <a href="https://nordstar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordstar Partners</a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup will use the new capital to acquire more than 300 Japanese e-commerce brands that have been carefully crafted and curated by entrepreneurs. Forest will apply digital marketing strategies at scale, optimize sales and enhance inventory planning through data analytics, as well as support cross-border e-commerce expansion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Forest is currently in the process of finalizing its first acquisition. It will continue to look for brands that generate sales between $1 million and $5 million and target to acquire companies with more than $10 million of sales next year, said CEO of Forest <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shingo-yuhara-74075060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shingo Yuhara</a> told TechCrunch. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It also plans to raise around $20 million to $30 million debt and equity capital of Series A, targeting the first half of 2022, Yuhara said.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Forest looks at marketplaces, including Amazon, Rakuten, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://zozo.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Zozotown</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Yahoo Japan sellers, Shopify and more. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As crypto proponents look to onboard a new generation of users, one of the major consumer onramps has been a host of consumer wallet apps with slick interfaces.</p>
<p>Today, Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1463589935085142020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it is bringing on the team from <a href="https://brd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRD</a> &#8212; a crypto wallet startup that first launched its mobile wallet back in 2014. While the team is transitioning over to Coinbase, BRD&#8217;s co-founders say nothing will be changing for BRD users for the time being, and that their wallets will continue to operate normally and that user &#8220;funds are safe and secure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wallet startup was an early player in the mobile crypto wallet space that started as a place for users to store bitcoin, but grew to support a wide network of tokens and the ability to buy, sell and swap cryptocurrencies thanks to partnerships with exchanges. The startup claims to have more than 10 million users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239511" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The team brings deep expertise in self-custody for crypto wallets, which will help Wallet enable more people to safely and securely access the decentralized world of crypto,&#8221; a <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1463589935085142020?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> from the Coinbase Wallet Twitter account reads.</p>
<p>BRD raised a hefty amount of venture capital funding, banking nearly $55 million in venture funding from firms like SBI Crypto Investment and East Ventures.</p>
<p>Coinbase and BRD did not reveal terms of the acqui-hire.</p>
<p>Co-founder Adam Traidman and Aaron Voisine note that they plan to build out a &#8220;migration path&#8221; for users to transfer their wallet contents to the Coinbase Wallet app but that it will be entirely optional for users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[It is, somehow, that time again! Thanksgiving is hours away, which means it's time to figure out what, if anything, you want to buy on Black Friday.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. We’re just starting to roll out this year’s gift guides, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2021/">check back from now until the end of December for more</a>! </em></p>
<p>It is, somehow, that time again! Thanksgiving is hours away, which means it&#8217;s time to figure out what, if anything, you want to buy on Black Friday.</p>
<p><em>Should</em> you buy anything on Black Friday? It depends. Some people are able to make a game out of it and save a stack on things they were going to buy anyway. Others end up getting fleeced by sales that aren&#8217;t really sales or end-of-life TVs repackaged under new model numbers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239483" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There definitely <em>are</em> deals to be found, of course — you&#8217;ve just gotta be smart about it. Some of the things we like to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying stuff you already wanted, at a discount? Good. Buying stuff you didn&#8217;t want, just because it&#8217;s maybe cheaper? Not so good.</li>
<li>Make sure that thing you&#8217;re buying is <em>actually on sale</em>, and that they didn&#8217;t just hike the price up temporarily yesterday for the sake of &#8220;discounts&#8221; today. Historical price trackers like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">camelcamelcamel</a> can help with that.</li>
<li>Check the model number on anything you&#8217;re buying. If you can&#8217;t find any trace of it older than a few weeks, something fishy might be going on.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all that said, here are some of the generally good deals we&#8217;ve found around the web — the stuff that&#8217;s solid, battle-tested and that we&#8217;d probably recommend at <em>full</em> price. We&#8217;ll be adding more throughout the week as we find them.</p>

<p>Not too long ago, discounts on Apple gear were a rare sight — nowadays, though, it&#8217;s not too tough to at least save a couple bucks.</p>
<p>For example: Amazon&#8217;s got the latest non-pro AirPods <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JQL3NWT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B09JQL3NWT&amp;linkId=ae3965bc1d8487dd562f245dfd98c907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $155</a> (usually $179), the AirPod Pros <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JQMJHXY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B09JQMJHXY&amp;linkId=7eeebf9831bb39c5ac40ffb1a4ed099f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $159</a> (usually $190+) and the over ear AirPods Max <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PZHYWJS/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08PZHYWJS&amp;linkId=4ba59eabbaee9a54bebfed47a7ba0194" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $429</a> (from $549)</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s also got the best iPad Pro deal we&#8217;ve found so far, taking anywhere from $100 to $150 off the 2021 12.9&#8243; model — so <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0932D45W8/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0932D45W8&amp;linkId=aafcca709f116db06b542ef2b24f5547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$999 for the 128 GB base model</a>, for example, instead of $1099.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2046659" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2046659" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2046659 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2046659" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Best Buy has the generally more budget-friendly 40 mm Apple Watch SE <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-se-gps-40mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-space-gray/5706649.p?skuId=5706649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked down to $219</a>, normally $279. If you&#8217;re looking for the latest and greatest Apple Watch, your best bet is probably Amazon again, where the Series 7 has been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HDXS1DM/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B09HDXS1DM&amp;linkId=04e8fb151f3a45d5a638b18359b1776a">cut down to $379</a> instead of $399 — but know that inventory seems limited and you might not get the color/band you want.</p>
<p>Big discounts on M1 Macs seem rare right now — which makes sense, as they&#8217;re still relatively new. When they do pop up, stock seems to be limited or shipping is delayed well into next year. Apple will be giving out $100 gift cards with the purchase of eligible Macs (which, sadly, appears to exclude the 14&#8243; and 16&#8243; M1 MacBook Pros) but that deal seemingly doesn&#8217;t start until the actual morning of Black Friday</p>

<p>Amazon usually does pretty deep discounts on its own gear for Black Friday, and that&#8217;s holding true this year.</p>
<p>The 4K Fire TV stick, for example, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XVYZ1Y5/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08XVYZ1Y5&amp;linkId=bb5170f404a23e8cf5d08594c0aa94c6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $25</a> (normally $50).</p>
<p>Their latest-gen Kindle, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FRJLSFL/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07FRJLSFL&amp;linkId=95218459756e8c8172572f663f504d31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $70</a> (normally $110) if you buy the version that doesn&#8217;t come with ads splashed around the interface. If you don&#8217;t mind the ads, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DPMXZZ7/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07DPMXZZ7&amp;linkId=d277e71c19ea0cd22aa916de08415e05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;s $50</a> (normally $90).</p>
<p>Got a smart house full of Echo devices and want to add some more? The latest (4th gen) model is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XKF5RM3/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07XKF5RM3&amp;linkId=82811add059421ae5c09b8a6ef294bb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $60</a> (usually $80-$100). The 2021 Echo Show, with its camera and 5.5&#8243; display, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J8FFJ8H/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08J8FFJ8H&amp;linkId=478e5a01c294d6f133ee50fc9c12ae08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $45</a> (usually around $80), and the itty-bitty (if probably at the end of its lifespan) Echo Dot puck is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FZ8S74R/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07FZ8S74R&amp;linkId=07214f0a4cf484ff6ab8908ee88f1a15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $20</a> (usually $30).</p>

<p>Oculus&#8217; Quest 2 virtual reality headset is about as good as entry-level VR gets right now. If you&#8217;re just looking to dabble or otherwise don&#8217;t want to spend a zillion dollars on a megapowerful VR rig, the Quest 2 is really a good place to start. I&#8217;ve happily recommended it to a bunch of people at the full price … so at a discount? Absolutely.</p>
<p>The best deal I&#8217;ve found so far is Target&#8217;s, where you&#8217;ll get a $50 Target gift card with either the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/oculus-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb/-/A-83984421" target="_blank" rel="noopener">128 GB</a> ($300) or <a href="https://www.target.com/p/oculus-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-256gb/-/A-84022117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">256 GB</a> ($400) model.</p>
<h2>Backbone</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2239486" style="width: 1146px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239486" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2239486 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/backbone.jpg" alt="" width="1136" height="572" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/backbone.jpg 1136w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/backbone.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/backbone.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/backbone.jpg?resize=768,387 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/backbone.jpg?resize=680,342 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/backbone.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1136px) 100vw, 1136px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239486" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Backbone</p></div></p>
<p>If you often use your iPhone* for things like Apple Arcade or remotely playing games on an Xbox or PlayStation, the Backbone is a very, <em>very</em> good controller add-on. It snaps on quick, it&#8217;s solid as a rock, and it&#8217;s <em>way</em> more comfortable than trying to paw at the touchscreen.</p>
<p>I thought it was almost too cheap at $99, but now they&#8217;ve marked it <a href="https://playbackbone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $85 for Black Friday</a> — and they&#8217;ve thrown in three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for good measure. That&#8217;s a steal, honestly.</p>
<p><em>(* They recently added support for controlling other devices via wired USB, but that&#8217;s more of a neat bonus and less the main draw.)</em></p>
<h2>Apps and Services</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1962460" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1962460" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1962460 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hulu-on-Xfinity-Hulu-Screens.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hulu-on-Xfinity-Hulu-Screens.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hulu-on-Xfinity-Hulu-Screens.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hulu-on-Xfinity-Hulu-Screens.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hulu-on-Xfinity-Hulu-Screens.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hulu-on-Xfinity-Hulu-Screens.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hulu-on-Xfinity-Hulu-Screens.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hulu-on-Xfinity-Hulu-Screens.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1962460" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hulu</p></div></p>
<p>A few tried-and-true apps and services are offering deals, albeit often with caveats. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hulu will give you a year of <a href="https://www.hulu.com/gma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad-supported Hulu</a> for 99 cents a month, instead of $7 a month. The catch? It&#8217;s only for those who are new and &#8220;returning&#8221; subscribers, the latter defined as those who haven&#8217;t paid for Hulu in the last month.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t already have Disney+, Amazon is doing a kind of confusing deal as a tie-in with Amazon Music Unlimited. If you already have Amazon Music Unlimited, they&#8217;ll give you three months of Disney+ for free. If you don&#8217;t already have it and are willing to sign up for the $8 per month service, they&#8217;ll give you six months of Disney+.</li>
<li>Plex is selling its lifetime pass option, usually $120, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/black-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for $90</a>.</li>
<li>Adobe is selling its &#8220;All Apps&#8221; package — so access to Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, Audition and everything else Adobe makes under the Creative Cloud umbrella — for <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30 a month</a>, down from $52. Sadly, terms specify &#8220;first-time subscribers&#8221; only.</li>
<li>Popular password manager LastPass is <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/plans-and-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offering plans for 25% off</a> this week. USE A PASSWORD MANAGER.</li>
<li>Guided meditation app <a href="https://www.headspace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Headspace</a> is 50%-60% off right now, depending on if you&#8217;re paying monthly or annually. If monthly, it&#8217;s 60% off — $4.99 a month, instead of $12.99. If annually, it&#8217;s 50% off — which might sound like a smaller discount, but at $35 for a year (normally $70), you&#8217;re paying about $2.91 per month (usually around $6.) Both plans renew at their respective full price after the first year.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Architecture and construction have always been, rather quietly, at the bleeding edge of tech and materials trends. It&#8217;s no surprise, then, especially at a renowned technical university like ETH Zurich, to find a project utilizing AI and robotics in a new approach to these arts. The automated design and construction they are experimenting with show how homes and offices might be built a decade from now.</p>
<p>The project is a sort of huge sculptural planter, &#8220;hanging gardens&#8221; inspired by the legendary structures in the ancient city of Babylon. (Incidentally, it was my ancestor, Robert Koldewey, who excavated/looted the famous <a href="https://www.livescience.com/43036-ishtar-gate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ishtar Gate</a> to the place.)</p>
<p>Begun in 2019, Semiramis (named after the queen of Babylon back then) is a collaboration between human and AI designers. The general idea of course came from the creative minds of its creators, architecture professors <a href="https://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/web/d/projekte/409.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabio Gramazio and Matthias Kohler</a>. But the design was achieved by putting the basic requirements, such as size, the necessity of watering and the style of construction, through a set of computer models and machine learning algorithms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239484" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>During the design process, for example, the team might tweak the position of one of the large &#8220;pods&#8221; that make up the 70-foot structure, or change the layout of the panels that make up its surface. The software they created would then immediately adjust the geometry of the overall structure and the other panels to accommodate these changes, making sure it would still safely bear its own weight, and so on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239519" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239519" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2239519" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg" alt="Computer rendering of what the final Semiramis hanging garden structure will look like." width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=768,517 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=1536,1033 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=2048,1378 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2239519" class="wp-caption-text">Computer rendering of what the final Semiramis hanging garden structure will look like. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gramazio Kohler Research</p></div></p>
<p>There are many automated processes in architecture, of course, but this project pushes the boundaries out in the level of final control seemingly given to them. The point, after all, is to make it a genuine collaboration, not just a sort of architectural spell-check that makes sure the whole thing won&#8217;t collapse.</p>
<p>&#8220;The computer model lets us reverse the conventional design process and explore the full design scope for a project. This leads to new, often surprising geometries,&#8221; <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2021/11/robots-build-new-hanging-gardens.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler said in an ETHZ news post</a>.</p>
<p>Having arrived at a final design, the construction is being accomplished by another human-automation team: a set of four robotic arms operating with one mind to hold multiple heavy pieces (each pod has dozens) in place while humans apply the resin used to keep them together. It&#8217;s a step above the technique <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/22/hold-this-beam-for-me-friend-robot-and-let-us-construct-a-house-together/">we saw used a few years ago</a> by the same team when they used robots as automated assistants.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qR92gbOxfU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/22/hold-this-beam-for-me-friend-robot-and-let-us-construct-a-house-together/">Hold this beam for me, friend robot, and let us construct a house together</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hold this beam for me, friend robot, and let us construct a house together&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/22/hold-this-beam-for-me-friend-robot-and-let-us-construct-a-house-together/embed/#?secret=qR92gbOxfU" data-secret="qR92gbOxfU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Semiramis is being constructed in the workshop then shipped piece by piece to its eventual home at Tech Cluster Zug. It should be fully assembled and ready to accept soil and seeds this coming spring, so stop by if you&#8217;re in the area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As many of the top cryptocurrencies seem to temporarily stabilize near all-time highs, users looking to speculate on tokens that are a bit more volatile are searching across exchanges to find deals.</p>
<p>Amsterdam-based startup <a href="https://tab-trader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TabTrader</a> has been capitalizing on this search with a platform that aggregates prices and token availability across dozens of exchanges. While other platforms allow users to look at token prices across exchanges, most are desktop-optimized while TabTrader has built up a substantial presence for its mobile app on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>As different exchanges take different approaches toward onboarding new tokens, crypto traders are increasingly signing up for accounts on multiple exchanges and tracking prices across multiple apps with multiple notification types set for each. Many users rely on TabTrader for its cross-exchange price alert feature, notifying users when a particular token has gone above or below a certain value. While plenty of exchanges offer this functionality inside their native apps, the reliability and customizability of these push notifications has often been inconsistent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239428" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Kirill Suslov tells TechCrunch that the TabTrader app has more than 400,000 active users, with particularly strong presences in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The startup has adopted a Kayak-like model, aggregating prices for tokens and picking up rebate fees from exchanges when users make a purchase through the app. While users plug their wallet info into the app to easily make purchases through connected exchanges, Suslov says that TabTrader never has access to user funds.</p>
<p>Alongside these rebates, TabTrader also makes money through a $12 monthly subscription for a paid version, as well as advertising. Suslov says his 20-person team has scaled to reach their current audience without any paid marketing.</p>
<p>While tens of millions of users have created accounts on centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, Suslov says that TabTrader&#8217;s biggest opportunity may be embracing so-called decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, which allow users to rapidly exchange tokens with other users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Suslov says that while the exchanges have built out great technology in the back-end, the front-end interfaces aren&#8217;t as easy for users to navigate, leaving room for an aggregator like TabTrader to streamline the user experience while allowing users to explore decentralized exchanges for the first time. The startup says they&#8217;re starting with a number of Solana-based exchanges including Serum, Raydium and Orca.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Decentralized exchanges] are the hottest topic of 2021,&#8221; Suslov says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> &#8220;</span>We raised to get onto this rocket ship.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cannabis is quickly going to the nerds. As it gradually becomes legal around the world, startups have responded with innovative products from laser-powered water bongs to CNC machined vapes to AI-powered herb grinders. Got a friend who wants to get a bit fancy with it? Give&#8217;m the gift of high-tech consumption.</p>
<p>Please consume responsibility.</p>
<p>Throughout 2021, cannabis companies made major strides on the back of unprecedented consumer demand. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/in-new-round-dutchie-focused-on-smoother-cannabis-retail-sees-its-valuation-soar-by-eight-times/">Dutchie</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/cannabis-e-commerce-startup-jane-technologies-raises-100m-after-stellar-growth/">Jane Technologies</a> raised hundreds of millions in new venture financing, leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/cannabis-investment-jumps-82-the-second-half-of-2021-165-over-2020-levels/">industry investments climbing 82%</a> in the second half of 2021. Others companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/cannabis-giant-leafly-is-going-public-through-a-spac-merger/">Leafly</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/agrify-aims-to-be-the-fastest-growing-cannabis-company/">Agrify</a> turned to public markets to raise new capital. Amazon<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/amazon-to-stop-screening-employees-for-marijuana/"> stopped screening</a> employees for marijuana, and Apple started treating cannabis as it does with pharmaceuticals and started letting users order and pay for cannabis in apps (in places where that&#8217;s legal).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s high hopes for cannabis in 2022. Cannabis is now legal for use in 36 states, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/cannabis-banking-act-passes-u-s-house-with-bipartisan-support/">there&#8217;s traction in Washington</a> that could end its federal prohibition.</p>
<h2>Puffco Budsy</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.puffco.com/products/budsy?variant=39699376799803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puffco Budsy</a> is a fantastic discrete water bong, and it&#8217;s nearly invisible thanks to the Nalgene-style bottle. Just throw some water in the bottle, pack flower in the hidden bowl and hit the trails. When you&#8217;re ready, flip up the lid, hit the bud with a lighter and inhale from the spout (which is thankfully not connected to the water). Rinse and repeat. Puffco released the Budsy on April 1, 2021 but it wasn&#8217;t a joke. This product is real, and it&#8217;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Roger Volodarsky founded the company in 2013 and has since led the company as CEO. Over the last several years, the company has kept pushing forward into innovative dabbing products. The Puffco Peak Pro (below) even features interchangeable ovens to allow owners to tailor their smoking experience without buying a new rig.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$50 and up</p>
<h2>Dynavap</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2238005" style="width: 777px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238005" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2238005 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg" alt="" width="767" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg 767w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238005" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dynavap</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dynavap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynavaps</a> are my go-to smoking device. They&#8217;re pocketable, batteryless and produce a great cloud of vapor. Think of it as a one-hitter vape with a thermometer. First, heat the tip with a torch or induction heater. In about 3-5 seconds, the cap will click, notifying the user that the herb is at the right temperature and ready to hit. The cannabis lasts about 3-4 cycles. Best yet, since the cap protects the ground flower from the flame, there&#8217;s no combustion or smoke &#8212; just vapor &#8212; and there&#8217;s very little smell.</p>
<p>Dynavap vaporizers are CNC machined in the company&#8217;s De Forest, Wisconsin facility. George Breiwa started the company in 2015 and currently employs around 40 people. Dynvap sells several versions of the little metal vape, including this <a href="https://www.dynavap.com/dynashop/ocs/the-gentleman-pipe-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stately &#8220;gentleman&#8217;s pipe&#8221;</a> and the sleek, all-black Obsidium Omni for $250.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$60 and up</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gpen.com/products/g-pen-dash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPen Dash</a> is the GoPro of vapes. This tiny vaporizer is impressive: It costs $70 and hits above its weight. The little vape has a glass-coated stainless steel heating chamber and a clean air path. The hits are smooth and plentiful. The GPen Dash is a great grab-and-go vape. Pictured here is one of the special versions; the company teamed with the nonprofit breast cancer prevention foundation Keep A Breast and made this limited edition.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Chris Folkerts started Grenco Science with Anthony Barron in 2011. The company sells a wide range of vaporizers, including a portable dab rig and a battery-powered concentrate vaporizer for glass stems. In May 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/grenco-science-acquires-stundenglass-a-contactless-water-pipe-company-founded-by-ex-apple-employee/">Grenco Science acquired Stündenglass</a>, a company founded by an ex-Apple employee that makes high-end gravity bongs.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no tech here. The <a href="https://blazysusan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blazy Susan</a> isn&#8217;t, technically, a high-tech gift. I don&#8217;t care. This is my list. The Blazy Susan is just a lovely weed station with little compartments to hold different toking accoutrements. There&#8217;s a dab station, a bowl cleaner and silicon inserts to make cleaning a bit easier. Prices start at around $90 and are available in different types of wood.</p>
<p>The company was started by Will Breakell and is based out of Colorado. The company also sells rolling papers, cones, grinders and a bunch of merch &#8212; everything is pink and I love it.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$90</p>
<h2>Banana Bros’ OTTO AI-enabled Grinder</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2238076" style="width: 2710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238076" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2238076 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Banana_Bros_OTTO.jpeg" alt="" width="2700" height="1800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Banana_Bros_OTTO.jpeg 2700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Banana_Bros_OTTO.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Banana_Bros_OTTO.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Banana_Bros_OTTO.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Banana_Bros_OTTO.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Banana_Bros_OTTO.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Banana_Bros_OTTO.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Banana_Bros_OTTO.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2700px) 100vw, 2700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238076" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Banana Bros</p></div></p>
<p><em>Surprise Guest! TC&#8217;s Amanda Silberling dropped by the gift guide to add this:</em></p>
<p>If you’re still using that cheap grinder you bought on Amazon, you’re probably wondering why anyone needs an AI-powered grinder. Here&#8217;s why: The <a href="https://bananabros.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OTTO</a> considers the density, moisture level, texture and consistency of your flower, then adjusts the speed, pressure and even the grind direction. Then, the OTTO deposits the perfect ground flower into a magnetically attached chamber and evenly distributes it into a pre-rolled cone. The result is luxurious &#8212; so long as you’re not an elitist who thinks cones are a cop-out (but if you are, you can just use the grinder on its own).</p>
<p>Banana Bros says the OTTO can grind perfect herbs, spices and incense, but even though the grinder is easy to clean, you’d probably end up with slightly sedative cinnamon or strangely flavorful cones if you’re not careful. At $150, this thing isn’t cheap, but it gets the job done. Banana Bros was founded in 2017 by CEO Dave Richmond and Director of Innovation Manny Montano, whose background is in industrial and 3D design. They’ve patented the AI technology that powers the OTTO, which is the company’s first and flagship product.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.storz-bickel.com/en-us/mighty-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mighty+</a> is the best vaporizer available. It&#8217;s reliable, can cook a lot of herb and produces some of the best vapor from any device. Sure, there are drawbacks, including its large size and $399 price, but it&#8217;s worth it. Storz &amp; Bickel released the original in 2014 and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/storz-bickle-new-mighty-vape-features-faster-heating-usb-c-and-ul-certification/"> just released the updated version in October 2021</a>. The new Mighty+ features quicker heat-up time, USB-C recharging and a ceramic filling chamber that&#8217;s much easier to keep clean than the chamber in the original.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Quick tip:</strong> The Mighty+ features orange arrow buttons while the original&#8217;s are gray.</p></blockquote>
<p>Markus Storz started working on a herbal vaporizer in 1996 and in 2002 Jürgen Bickel joined the board forming Storz-Bickel. The company still sells its original, groundbreaking device, the Volcano, and several less expensive products. The company is based in Germany, where its vaporizers carry medical device certifications. In 2018 Canadian cannabis giant Canopy Growth acquired Storz &amp; Bickel. Jürgen Bickel remains at the company and runs the day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>Into dabbing? The <a href="https://www.puffco.com/products/the-peak-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puffco Peak Pro</a> is the best portable dabbing rig available. It produces an amazing cloud of tasty vapor and feels like something designed in Cupertino. The Puffco Peak Pro constantly impresses me. The Pro version packs USB-C charging, an improved oven and easier cleaning. Plus, there&#8217;s an optional wireless charging stand that works very well. Want something more unique? The company sells a handful of special editions that feature wild color schemes and glass designs.</p>
<p>Roger Volodarsky founded the company in 2013 and has since led the company as CEO. Over the last several years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/puffco-keeps-innovating-dabbing/">the company has kept pushing forward into innovative dabbing products</a>.

<p>At its core, the <a href="https://hitoki.com/products/trident" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$499 Hitoki Trident V2</a> is a battery-powered water bong. The trick? It uses a laser and sealed chamber to heat the flower. When the device works, it hits like a truck. I tested the Hitoki, and it&#8217;s finicky and requires a lot of cleaning. The hose attachment is low quality, and the laser blasts the herb into a smoldering mess. So why is it on this list? Because despite its drawbacks, the Hitoki is a fun device and can produce an impressive cloud without butane. Plus lasers. You get to watch the laser light the pot and make a miniature mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>Joe and Jack Tran started Hitoki in 2019. The Trident V2 is the company&#8217;s second version of the product. The V2 version includes a carb button, a larger laser burn radius and an improved airflow path.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://stundenglass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stündenglass Kompact</a> is a compact version of the amazing Stündenglass gravity bong. The $599 device is made of high-end materials and works very well. Trust me. I&#8217;ve used it, and it&#8217;s smooth, rich and impressive. The device isn&#8217;t just for cannabis. It&#8217;s also a fantastic hookah, and with the right attachments, it can be used to infuse food and drinks with a burst of smokey flavor. Want a bigger hit? The full-size Stündenglass is the same price but is much less portable.</p>
<p>Stündenglass was founded by Tracey Huston and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/grenco-science-acquires-stundenglass-a-contactless-water-pipe-company-founded-by-ex-apple-employee/">purchased by Grenco Science in May 2020</a> for an undisclosed amount.</p>
