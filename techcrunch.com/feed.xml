		Jalal Nasir is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.pixalate.com/">Pixalate</a>, a global ad fraud intelligence and marketing compliance platform. Previously, he was one of the early engineers on Amazon’s fraud prevention and risk management team and held various product leadership roles building adtech and enterprise privacy technologies.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Programmatic advertising is a <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/362815/ana-blasts-mind-numbing-programmatic-marketplace.html">$200 billion</a> global marketplace that is rapidly growing and far-reaching, with Connected TV (CTV) serving as its latest accelerant. Unfortunately, however, it’s also a business sector rife with fraud and consumer privacy abuse, particularly in emerging media forms like CTV and mobile.</p>
<p>Global losses to ad fraud <a href="https://www.thisisbeacon.com/resources/ad-fraud-industry-facts/">exceeded</a> $35 billion last year, a figure expected to rise to $50 billion by 2025, according to the <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2016/06/06/WFA-issues-first-advice-for-combatting-ad-fraud">World Federation of Advertisers</a>. Per the WFA, ad fraud is “second only to the drugs trade as a source of income for organized crime,” but there is no one-size-fits-all ad fraud strategy.</p>
<p>To capitalize on the promise of video advertising in mobile and CTV, and measure ad efficacy with confidence, business leaders must ensure that they’re reaching customers — not bots — and achieving their business goals while remaining compliant with the latest regulations and laws.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are a few key steps business leaders can take to guard their reputation and their ad spend:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy sophisticated tools to reveal the types of ad fraud attacks to which your ad budgets are falling prey.</li>
<li>Analyze your budget with quality versus reach in mind — fraudsters continue to take advantage of advertisers’ historic obsession with reach.</li>
<li>Acknowledge that the “Age of Privacy” has arrived; business leaders must remain compliant and protect their brand image in the ad marketplace.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Know the different types of ad fraud in CTV and mobile in-app to better protect your ad spend</h2>
<p>It’s important to consider the various ways your ad budgets can be squandered on invalid traffic. Although 78% of U.S. households are now reachable via programmatic CTV advertising, ad fraud rates remain high, at <a href="https://blog.pixalate.com/connected-tv-ctv-ott-ad-supply-trends-report-q4-2020">24% in Q4 2020</a>. Traditional ad fraud attacks, such as spoofing (i.e., pretending to be a different publisher) and fake sites or apps, are being supplanted by more advanced schemes, such as CTV device farms.</p>
<p>Knowing that ad fraud is eating away at your budget is the first step, but business leaders need to understand the different schemes so they can apply the right protection in the right moments.</p>
<h2>Looking at reach through a quality lens</h2>
<p>Historically, the standard way to measure advertising has been focused on reach. However, reach is now more of a vanity metric if uncoupled from traffic quality.</p>
<p>Striving for reach while ignoring quality creates a prime opportunity for ad fraud. Generating fake traffic to create the illusion of “reach” has become a staple in many ad fraud schemes, with some CTV schemes fabricating up to 650 million bid requests a day per day from bots, per <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/04/29/beware-the-bots-the-threat-ctv-ad-fraud-looms-viewership-rates-rise">The Drum</a>.</p>
<p>High impression rates that fail to convert into actual sales and pricing anomalies (as compared to a peer group) are compelling harbingers of traffic quality issues.</p>
<p>Because the growing CTV ecosystem commands premium pricing, advertisers may be tempted to seek out deals. However, several leading streaming TV providers, such as XUMO and Philo, have warned advertisers about prices that seem too good to be true, noting that they may be signals of fraudulent activity. Work to identify where traffic is coming from and ask questions when the data looks suspicious.</p>
<p>The ad industry itself is also fighting back by giving tools to business owners meant to stymie ad fraud. There are several industry working groups and watchdog organizations — including the Media Rating Council, Interactive Advertising Bureau and Trustworthy Accountability Group — that accredit certain platforms and suppliers to combat ad fraud. These working groups and organizations also regularly release industry standards and programs designed to address fraudulent activity, such as the Ads.txt initiative meant to help advertisers know they are buying inventory via legitimate third parties. All business owners should utilize certified platforms – along with emerging programs and standards – to stay on top of the latest trends in ad fraud.</p>
<h2>Business leaders need to prioritize brand safety and compliance</h2>
<p>In addition to navigating the complex world of ad quality, brands must now consider whether the publishers they are working with are brand-safe and compliant with the latest consumer privacy and compliance laws.</p>
<p>Pixalate’s May 2021 estimates show that 22% of Apple App Store apps and 9% of Google Play Store apps that serve programmatic advertisements don’t have a privacy policy. This is significant because there are already documented cases of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/11/02/mobile-fraud-targets-swing-state-voters-in-russian-owned-app-with-history-of-white-supremacism/?sh=5bc47f543cc6">consumer data being misused as part of ad fraud schemes.</a> And 70% of Google Play Store apps have at least one of what Google calls “dangerous permissions,” an <a href="https://blog.pixalate.com/google-play-store-mobile-apps-dangerous-permissions-q3-2020">increase of 5%</a> in 2020. Additionally, of apps that serve programmatic ads, 80% of Apple App Store apps and 66% of Google Play Store apps count children aged 12 and under as part of their audience, which brings <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">COPPA compliance risks</a> into the equation as well.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things at play when it comes to brand safety that business leaders and brands should be aware of. The most important is that what is deemed “safe” for a brand is solely based on that brand – there is no golden standard because each brand has a different vision, mission and goals. Brand safety is subjective. However, it’s essential for success.</p>
<p>Ad fraud, brand safety and data compliance continually evolve, and leaders must follow the numbers, stay educated on market changes, and invest in the right partnerships to ensure consumers, not bots, are engaging with the <a href="https://www.pixalate.com/rankings/">most impactful and effective content</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-elipsa">Kobo&#8217;s Elipsa</a> is the latest in the Amazon rival&#8217;s e-reading line, and it&#8217;s a big one. The 10.3-inch e-paper display brings it up to iPad dimensions and puts it in direct competition with the reMarkable and Boox&#8217;s e-reader tablets. It excels on reading experience, gets by on note-taking and drawing, but falls a bit short on versatility.</p>
<p>Kobo has been creeping upmarket for a few years now, and though the cheaper <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/29/kobos-new-entry-level-clara-hd-e-reader-has-a-crisp-color-adjustable-display/">Clara HD</a> is still the pick of the litter in my opinion, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/kobos-forma-e-reader-takes-on-kindle-oasis-with-an-asymmetric-design-and-premium-price/">Forma</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/kobo-brings-brings-the-forma-form-factor-to-a-cheaper-model/">Libra H2O</a> are worthy competitors to the Kindle lines. The $400 Elipsa represents a big step up in size, function, and price, and it does justify itself — though there are a few important caveats.</p>
<p>The device is well designed but lacks any flourishes. The tilted &#8220;side chin&#8221; of the Forma and Libra is flattened out into a simple wide bezel on the right side. The lopsided appearance doesn&#8217;t bother me much, and much of the competition has it as well. (Though my favorite is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/the-boox-poke-3-is-my-new-favorite-e-reader/"> Boox&#8217;s ultra-compact, flush-fronted Poke 3</a>)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="y79ISubfXa"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/the-boox-poke-3-is-my-new-favorite-e-reader/">The Boox Poke 3 is my new favorite e-reader</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Boox Poke 3 is my new favorite e-reader&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/the-boox-poke-3-is-my-new-favorite-e-reader/embed/#?secret=y79ISubfXa" data-secret="y79ISubfXa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The 10.3&#8243; screen has a resolution of 1404 x 1872, giving it 227 pixels per inch. That&#8217;s well below the 300 PPI of the Clara and Forma, and the typography suffers from noticeably more aliasing if you look closely. Of course, you won&#8217;t be looking <em>that</em> closely, since as a larger device you&#8217;ll probably be giving the Elipsa a bit more distance and perhaps using a larger type size. I found it perfectly comfortable to read on — 227 PPI isn&#8217;t bad, just not the best.</p>
<p>There is a frontlight, which is easily adjustable by sliding your finger up and down the left side of the screen, but unlike other Kobo devices there is no way to change the color temperature. I&#8217;ve been spoiled by other devices and now the default cool grey I lived with for years doesn&#8217;t feel right, especially with a warmer light shining on your surroundings. The important part is that it is consistent across the full display and adjustable down to a faint glow, something my eyes have thanked me for many times.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to consider the Elipsa independent from the accessories it&#8217;s bundled with, and in fact there&#8217;s no way to buy one right now without the &#8220;sleep cover&#8221; and stylus. The truth is they really complete the package, though they do add considerably to its weight and bulk. What when naked is lighter and feels smaller than a standard iPad is heavier and larger once you put its case on and stash the surprisingly weighty stylus at the top.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174812" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174812" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174812" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-3.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2174812" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The cover is nicely designed, if a bit stiff, and will definitely protect your device from harm. The cover, secured by magnets at the bottom, flips off like a sheet on a legal pad and folds flat behind the device, attaching itself with the same magnets from the other direction. A couple folds in it also stiffen up with further magnetic arrangement into a nice, sturdy little stand. The outside is a grippy faux leather and the inside is soft microfiber.</p>
<p>You can wake and turn off the device by opening and closing the cover, but the whole thing comes with a small catch: you have to have the power button, charging port, and big bezel on the right. When out of its case the Elipsa can, like the others of its lopsided type, be inverted and your content instantly flips. But once you put it in the case, you&#8217;re locked in to a semi-right-handed mode. This may or may not bother people but it&#8217;s worth mentioning.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174810" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174810" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174810" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="716" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=680,475 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=1536,1074 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=2048,1432 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/elipsa-review-1.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2174810" class="wp-caption-text">The Elipsa, center, with the Forma and reMarkable 2 to its left and right.</p></div></p>
<p>The reading experience is otherwise very similar to that on Kobo&#8217;s other devices. A relatively clean interface that surfaces your most recently accessed content and a not overwhelming but still unwelcome amount of promotional stuff (&#8220;Find your next great read&#8221;). Ebooks free and paid for display well, though it&#8217;s never been my preference to read on a large screen like this. I truly wish one of these large e-readers would make a landscape mode with facing pages. Isn&#8217;t that more booklike?</p>
<p>Articles from the web, synced via Pocket, look great and are a pleasure to read in this format. It feels more like a magazine page, which is great when you&#8217;re reading an online version of one. It&#8217;s simply, foolproof and well integrated.</p>
<h2>Kobo&#8217;s new note-taking prowess</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s new on the bottom row, though, is &#8220;Notebooks,&#8221; where unsurprisingly you can create notebooks for scribbling down lists, doodles, notes of course, and generally use the stylus.</p>
<p>The writing experience is adequate. Here I am spoiled by the reMarkable 2, which boasts extremely low lag and high accuracy, as well as much more expression in the line. Kobo doesn&#8217;t approach that, and the writing experience is fairly basic, with a noticeable amount of lag, but admirable accuracy.</p>
<p>There are five pen tips, five line widths, and five line shades, and they&#8217;re all fine. The stylus has a nice heft to it, though I&#8217;d like a grippier material. Two buttons on it let you quickly switch from the current pen style to a highlighter or eraser, where you have stroke-deleting or brush modes. The normal notebooks have the usual gridded, dotted, lined and blank styles, and unlimited pages, but you can&#8217;t zoom in or out (not so good for artists).</p>
<p>Then there are the &#8220;advanced&#8221; notebooks, which you must use if you want handwriting recognition and other features. These have indelible lines on which you can write, and a double tap captures your words into type very quickly. You can also put in drawings and equations in their own sections.</p>

<p>The handwriting recognition is fast and good enough for rough notes, but don&#8217;t expect to send these directly to your team without any editing. Likewise the diagram tool that turns gestural sketches of shapes and labels into finalized flowcharts and the like — better than the original wobbly art but still a rough draft. There are a few clever shortcuts and gestures to add or subtract spaces and other common tasks, something you&#8217;ll probably get used to fairly quick if you use the Elipsa regularly.</p>
<p>The notebook interface is snappy enough going from page to page or up and down on the &#8220;smart&#8221; notebooks but nothing like the fluidity of a design program or an art-focused one on an iPad. But it&#8217;s also unobtrusive, has good palm blocking, and feels nice in action. The lag on the line is definitely a con, but something you can get used to if you don&#8217;t mind the resulting product being a little sloppy.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174799" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174799" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2174799" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting2.jpg" alt="A sketched diagram is turned into a real one by the Elipsa." width="1024" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting2.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting2.jpg?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting2.jpg?resize=768,328 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting2.jpg?resize=680,291 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting2.jpg?resize=1536,657 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting2.jpg?resize=2048,876 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/handwriting2.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2174799" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>You can also mark up ebooks, which is nice for highlights but ultimately not that much better than simply selecting the text. And there&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re writing in the margins with the limitations of this stylus.</p>
<p>Exporting notepads can be done via a linked Dropbox account or over USB connection. Again the reMarkable has a leg up here, for even if its app is a bit restrictive, the live syncing means you don&#8217;t ever have to worry about what version of what is where, as long as it&#8217;s in the system. On the Kobo it&#8217;s more traditional.</p>
<p>Compared to the reMarkable, the Kobo is really just an easier platform for everyday reading, so if you&#8217;re looking for a device that focuses on that and has the option of doodling or note-taking on the side, it&#8217;s a much better deal. On the other hand, those just looking for an improvement to that stylus-focused tablet should look elsewhere — writing and sketching still feels way better on a reMarkable than almost anything on the market. And compared with something like a Boox tablet, the Elipsa is more simple and focused, but doesn&#8217;t allow the opportunity of adding Android apps and games.</p>
<p>At $400 — though this includes a case and stylus — the Elipsa is a considerable investment and comparably priced to an iPad, which is certainly a more versatile device. But I don&#8217;t particularly enjoy reading articles or books on my iPad, and the simplicity of an e-reader in general helps me focus when I&#8217;m making notes on a paper or something. It&#8217;s a different device for a different purpose, but not for everyone.</p>
<p>It is however probably the best way right now to step into the shallow end of the &#8220;big e-reader&#8221; pool, with more complex or expensive options available should you desire them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While crypto exchanges have demystified some of the largest cryptocurrencies for retail investors, many of the intricacies of decentralized finance are still lost on even more savvy investors as a result of DeFi&#8217;s weave of diverse offerings.</p>
<p><a href="https://zerion.io/">Zerion</a>, a startup building a decentralized finance &#8220;interface&#8221; for crypto investors, has attracted venture capitalist attention on the back of recent growth. Amid a renewed crypto gold rush, the company has processed more than $600 million in transaction volume so far this year, now with over 200 thousand monthly active users, CEO <span style="font-weight: 400;">Evgeny Yurtaev tells TechCrunch</span></p>
<p>The startup has also wrapped an $8.2 million Series A funding round led by Mosaic Ventures, with participation from Placeholder, DCG, Lightspeed, Blockchain.com Ventures, among others. Mosaic&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">Toby Coppel and Placeholder&#8217;s Brad Burnham have joined Zerion’s Board, the startup also shared.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zerion gives customers access to more than 50,000 digital assets and 60 protocols on the Ethereum blockchain through their app which streamlines the UI of DeFi. Users can access tokens and invest through the app similar to exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini, but do so using their own personal wallets like MetaMask, meaning user funds and private keys aren&#8217;t controlled by or accessible to Zerion, a sticking point for Yurtaev, a life-long crypto enthusiast and builder.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174806" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174806" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2174806 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png" alt="" width="1024" height="630" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png 5200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=680,418 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=1536,945 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=2048,1260 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macbook_proiphone_blue-bg.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174806" class="wp-caption-text">Image via Zerion</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;There are a bunch of different tokens and protocols in the DeFi space,&#8221; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yurtaev says. &#8220;</span>In theory, it’s supposed to be easy to navigate, but in reality, it&#8217;s all a mess&#8230; We try to demystify them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside major growth in Ethereum and Bitcoin prices, DeFi volume has surged in 2021, up from just under $20 billion at the year&#8217;s start to nearly $90 billion this May. The DeFi market et large has proven just as volatile as Bitcoin, with market volume falling some 35 percent in the past couple months to just over $57 billion.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s mobile app on iOS and Android has become a particularly popular way for crypto investors to track the market and the tokens they&#8217;re backing. The average user opens the app more than 9 times per day, the company says.</p>
<p>Crypto&#8217;s 2021 upswing has drawn plenty of investor attention, not only to the assets themselves but to the platforms facilitating those transactions. Last month, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz announced that they had raised more than $2.2 billion to invest in startups building products in crypto spaces including decentralized finance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/trump-lawsuit-tech-companies/">spicy trio of lawsuits</a> against the social media platforms that he believes wrongfully banned him have succeeded in showering the former president with a flurry of media attention, but that&#8217;s likely where the story ends.</p>
<p>Like Trump&#8217;s quixotic and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">ultimately empty quest to gut Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act during his presidency</a>, the new lawsuits are all sound and fury with little legal substance to back them up.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="62sAxCkXoO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/">Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Going to war with Twitter, Trump threatens critical social media legal protections&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/embed/#?secret=62sAxCkXoO" data-secret="62sAxCkXoO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The suits allege that Twitter, Facebook and YouTube violated Trump&#8217;s First Amendment rights by booting him from their platforms, but the First Amendment is intended to protect citizens from censorship by the government — not private industry. The irony that Trump himself was the uppermost figure in the federal government at the time probably won&#8217;t be lost on whoever&#8217;s lap this case lands in.</p>
<p>In the lawsuits, which also name Twitter and Facebook chief executives Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg as well as Google CEO Sundar Pichai (Susan Wojcicki escapes notice once again!), Trump accuses the three companies of engaging in &#8220;impermissible censorship resulting from threatened legislative action, a misguided reliance upon Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and willful participation in joint activity with federal actors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit claims that the tech companies colluded with &#8220;Democrat lawmakers,&#8221; the CDC and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who served in Trump&#8217;s own government at the time.</p>
<p>The crux of the argument is that communication between the tech companies, members of Congress and the federal government somehow transforms Facebook, Twitter and YouTube into &#8220;state actors&#8221; — a leap of epic proportion:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Defendant Twitter&#8217;s status thus rises beyond that of a private company to that of a state actor, and as such, Defendant is constrained by the First Amendment right to free speech in the censorship decisions it makes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Trump&#8217;s own Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1702_h315.pdf"> issued the court&#8217;s opinion on a relevant case two years ago</a>. It examined whether a nonprofit running public access television channels in New York qualified as a &#8220;state actor&#8221; that would be subject to First Amendment constraints. The court ruled that running the public access channels didn&#8217;t transform the nonprofit into a government entity and that it retained a private entity&#8217;s rights to make editorial decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; A private entity&#8230; who opens its property for speech by others is not transformed by that fact alone into a state actor,&#8221; Justice Kavanaugh wrote in the decision.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not likely that a court would decide that talking to the government or being threatened by the government somehow transform Twitter, YouTube and Facebook into state actors either.</p>

<h3>Trump vs. Section 230 (again)</h3>
<p>First Amendment aside — and there&#8217;s really not much of an argument there — social media platforms are protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a concise snippet of law that shields them from liability not just for the user-generated content they host but for the moderation decisions they make about what content to remove.</p>
<p>In line with Trump&#8217;s obsessive disdain for tech&#8217;s legal shield, the lawsuits repeatedly rail against Section 230. The suits try to argue that because Congress threatened to revoke tech&#8217;s 230 protections, that forced them to ban Trump, which somehow makes social media companies part of the government and subject to First Amendment constraints.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/section-230-stimulus-mcconnell-bill-trump/">Republican lawmakers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/tech-giants-immunities-encryption/">Trump&#8217;s own administration</a> made frequent threats about repealing Section 230, not that it changes anything because this line of argument doesn&#8217;t make much sense anyway.</p>
<p>The suit also argues that Congress crafted Section 230 to intentionally censor speech that is otherwise protected by the First Amendment, ignoring that the law was born in 1996, well before ubiquitous social media, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/the-consequences-of-indecency/">and for other purposes altogether</a>.</p>

<p>For the four years of his presidency, Trump&#8217;s social media activity — his tweets in particular — informed the events of the day, both nationally and globally. While other world leaders and political figures used social media to communicate or promote their actions, Trump&#8217;s Twitter account was usually the action itself.</p>
<p>In the shadow of his social media bans, the former president has failed to re-establish lines of communication to the internet at large. In May, he launched a new blog, &#8220;From the Desk of Donald J. Trump,&#8221; but the site was taken down just a month later after it <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/02/donald-trump-blog-fail-491667">failed to attract much interest</a>.</p>
<p>The handful of pro-Trump alternative social platforms are still struggling with app store content moderation requirements <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/apple-confirms-it-will-allow-parler-to-return-to-app-store/">at odds with their extreme views</a> on free speech, but that didn&#8217;t stop Gettr, the latest, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/gettr-trump-social-network-hack-defaced/">going ahead with its own rocky launch last week</a>.</p>
<p>Viewed in one light, Trump&#8217;s lawsuits are a platform too, his latest method for broadcasting himself to the online world that his transgressions eventually cut him off from. In that sense, they seem to have succeeded, but in all other senses, they won&#8217;t.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[By streamlining the process to fail fast on infeasible projects, teams can significantly increase their overall success with AI initiatives. 
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI teams invest a lot of rigor in defining new project guidelines. But the same is not true for killing existing projects. In the absence of clear guidelines, teams let infeasible projects drag on for months.</p>
<p>They put up a dog and pony show during project review meetings for fear of becoming the messengers of bad news. By streamlining the process to fail fast on infeasible projects, teams can significantly increase their overall success with AI initiatives.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			In order to fail fast, AI initiatives should be managed as a conversion funnel analogous to marketing and sales funnels.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>AI projects are different from traditional software projects. They have a lot more unknowns: availability of right datasets, model training to meet required accuracy threshold, fairness and robustness of recommendations in production, and many more.</p>
<p>In order to fail fast, AI initiatives should be managed as a conversion funnel analogous to marketing and sales funnels. Projects start at the top of the five-stage funnel and can drop off at any stage, either to be temporarily put on ice or permanently suspended and added to the AI graveyard. Each stage of the AI funnel defines a clear set of unknowns to be validated with a list of time-bound success criteria.</p>
<p>The AI project funnel has five stages:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174118" style="width: 992px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174118" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2174118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png" alt="" width="982" height="824" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png 982w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png?resize=150,126 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png?resize=300,252 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png?resize=768,644 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png?resize=680,571 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AI-Funnel-Image-By-Author.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sandeep Uttamchandani</p></div></p>
<h2>1. Problem definition: “If we build it, will they come?”</h2>
<p>This is the top of the funnel. AI projects require significant investments not just during initial development but ongoing monitoring and refinement. This makes it important to verify that the problem being solved is truly worth solving with respect to potential business value compared to the effort to build. Even if the problem is worth solving, AI may not be required. There might be easier human-encoded heuristics to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Developing the AI solution is only half the battle. The other half is how the solution will actually be used and integrated. For instance, in developing an AI solution for predicting customer churn, there needs to be a clear understanding of incorporating attrition predictions in the customer support team workflow. A perfectly powerful AI project will fail to deliver business value without this level of integration clarity.</p>
<p>To successfully exit this stage, the following statements need to be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The AI project will produce tangible business value if delivered successfully.</li>
<li>There are no cheaper alternatives that can address the problem with the required accuracy threshold.</li>
<li>There is a clear path to incorporate the AI recommendations within the existing flow to make an impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my experience, the early stages of the project have a higher ratio of aspiration compared to ground realities. Killing an ill-formed project can avoid teams from building “solutions in search of problems.”</p>
<h2>2. Data availability : “We have the data to build it.”</h2>
<p>At this stage of the funnel, we have verified the problem is worth solving. We now need to confirm the data availability to build the perception, learning and reasoning capabilities required in the AI project. Data needs vary based on the type of AI project  —  the requirements for a project building classification intelligence will be different from one providing recommendations or ranking.</p>
<p>Data availability broadly translates to having the right quality, quantity and features. Right quality refers to the fact that the data samples are an accurate reflection of the phenomenon we are trying to model  and meet properties such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">independent and identically distributed</a>. Common quality checks involve uncovering data collection errors, inconsistent semantics and errors in labeled samples.</p>
<p>The right quantity refers to the amount of data that needs to be available. A common misconception is that a significant amount of data is required for training machine learning models. This is not always true. Using pre-built transfer learning models, it is possible to get started with very little data. Also, more data does not always mean <em>useful</em> data. For instance, historic data spanning 10 years may not be a true reflection of current customer behavior. Finally, the right features need to be available to build the model. This is typically iterative and involves ML model design.</p>
<p>To successfully exit this stage, the following statements need to be true:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The harsh truth: Some of the advice you read about marketing is incorrect.</p>
<p>While not always <em>intentionally</em> misleading, you&#8217;re often absorbing content written by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marketers without a breadth of experience</strong>: People who&#8217;ve marketed a single product and have a limited — or biased — view on a channel.</li>
<li><strong>Non-practitioners</strong>: People who&#8217;ve never run experiments, but pass along (sometimes outdated) marketing insights that they&#8217;ve read online.</li>
</ul>
<p>After running thousands of experiments for brands like Microsoft, Segment and Perfect Keto, here are 10 significant lies we&#8217;ve realized you&#8217;ve been told about marketing (on email marketing, ads and referrals).</p>
<h2>1. &#8220;Send a welcome email immediately after signup.&#8221;</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s better to avoid sending emails right after people sign up on your site. We’re used to getting generic, unimportant welcome emails every time we sign up for anything online. So most people will reflexively discard your welcome email as spam.</p>
<p>Instead, try delaying your welcome email by 15 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The delay removes the subscriber&#8217;s mental connection between signup and your email, bypassing the reflex to ignore.</p>
<p>As a result, you&#8217;ll likely get more opens and more engagement.</p>
<h2>2. &#8220;Only highlight your best product reviews.&#8221;</h2>
<p>For context, reviews are a big deal:</p>
<ul>
<li>93% of consumers claim product reviews impact purchase decisions.</li>
<li>The social proof of having 50+ product reviews increases conversion. Shoppers trust peers more than they trust brands.</li>
</ul>
<p>But imperfect reviews can generate more sales than five-star ones. How?</p>
<p>When a partially negative review weighs your cons versus your pros and concludes that the product was worth purchasing anyway, that sounds authentic and honest.</p>
<p>In contrast, strings of flawless five-star reviews don&#8217;t signal authenticity. Psychologically, they’re less likely to sink in as positive social proof.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your post-purchase email flow contains a request for reviews. The more reviews you have, the better.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t bury slightly negative reviews. If someone leaves a four-star review and offers a fair (and insignificant) critique, showcase it toward the top of your product page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. &#8220;You have to send a newsletter every week.&#8221;</h2>
<p>Most newsletters shouldn&#8217;t be sent weekly. This goes against what most creator economy entrepreneurs suggest.</p>
<p>But high cadences force newsletter writers to rush and publish lower-quality information to hit self-imposed deadlines.</p>
<p>Instead, consider only sending when you truly have value to add. At a minimum, consider setting a more reasonable cadence like once or twice a month so that you&#8217;ll have enough time and content to consistently hit a high-quality bar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virtual reality did not turn into the ultimate office replacement telepresence machine during the pandemic &#8212; and it wasn&#8217;t for lack of trying &#8212; but some startups focused on employee training in VR have found added validation in the past year as professionals across industries were forced to access institutional knowledge in remote settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://ossovr.com/">Osso VR</a>, a San Francisco-based virtual reality startup focused on medical training, has piqued investor attention as they&#8217;ve bulked up on partnerships with medical devices powerhouses like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Stryker and Smith &amp; Nephew during the pandemic. The startup tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve recently closed $27 million in Series B funding led by GSR Ventures with additional participation from SignalFire, Kaiser Permanente Ventures and Anorak Ventures, among others.</p>
<p>CEO Justin Barad tells TechCrunch that the pandemic &#8220;created an intense level of urgency&#8221; for the startup as customers found new demand for their platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Osso VR is looking to upend modern surgical instruction with a virtual reality-based solution that allows surgeons to interact with new medical devices in 3D space, &#8220;performing&#8221; a surgery over and over on a digital cadaver from the comfort of anywhere they have enough room to stretch out their arms. Osso&#8217;s efforts are particularly useful to its medical device customers who can use the platform to boost familiarity with their solutions while helping surgeons gain proficiency in implanting them.</p>
<p>One of the startup&#8217;s broader aims is to bring video games&#8217; multiplayer mechanics into the virtual operating room, allowing surgeons and medical assistants to collaborate in real-time so they not only know their responsibility but how they fit into the whole of each operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a lot like a symphony, everyone has a different role to play and you need to communicate with each other.&#8221; Barad says.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Wo3z7GNkY0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/training-platform-virti-raises-10m-series-a-led-by-iq-capital-to-teach-soft-skills-in-vr/">Training platform Virti raises $10M Series A led by IQ Capital to teach soft skills in VR</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Training platform Virti raises $10M Series A led by IQ Capital to teach soft skills in VR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/training-platform-virti-raises-10m-series-a-led-by-iq-capital-to-teach-soft-skills-in-vr/embed/#?secret=Wo3z7GNkY0" data-secret="Wo3z7GNkY0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a process that needs virtual reality&#8217;s spatial breadth, Barad notes, though instruction is always supplemented by text and videos as well.</p>
<p>Barad calls the startup&#8217;s aim &#8220;something unambiguously good,&#8221; a quality which has helped the team poach talent as it has scaled to some 100 employees, which includes what he claims is the world&#8217;s largest team of medical illustrators. That team has helped scale the platform&#8217;s content to more than 100 modules spanning 10 specialties.</p>
<p>Virtual reality founders have struggled in recent years to coax investor attention as consumer and enterprise uptake has proven slower than the early wild ambitions for the technology. In its stead, investors have looked more towards bets on adjacent technologies like gaming and computer vision that don&#8217;t require the specialized head-worn hardware. Osso VR&#8217;s platform runs on Facebook&#8217;s Oculus Quest 2 headset through the company&#8217;s Oculus for Business program.</p>

<p>The rapid emergence of Pakistan’s technology ecosystem on the international stage has been no accident &#8212; it’s the result of a confluence of changing facts on the ground and shifting dynamics in the startup and investing world as a result of the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Unlocking Pakistan’s potential</h2>
<p>The sudden emergence of Pakistan’s tech ecosystem on the international stage has been driven by three major factors: an improving security situation, quickly growing mobile connectivity, and critical legal changes and deregulation.</p>
<p>As a frontline state and coalition partner in the United States’ invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan saw <a href="https://www.satp.org/datasheet-terrorist-attack/fatalities/pakistan">fatalities from terrorist violence soar</a> from 295 in 2001 to a peak of over 11,000 in 2009. This climate of instability and violence scared away international business and investors from Pakistan for much of the first two decades of the 21st century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">WellSaid Labs, whose tools create synthetic speech that could be mistaken for the real thing, has raised a $10M Series A to grow the business. The company&#8217;s home-baked text-to-speech engine works faster than real time and produces natural-sounding clips of pretty much any length, from quick snippets to hours-long readings.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/07/wellsaid-aims-to-make-natural-sounding-synthetic-speech-a-credible-alternative-to-real-humans/">WellSaid came out of the Allen Institute for AI incubator in 2019</a>, and its goal was to make synthetic voices that didn&#8217;t sound so robotic for common business purposes like training and marketing content.</p>
<p>It achieved that first by basing its solution on Tacotron, a speech engine developed by Google and academic researchers. But soon it had built its own that was more efficient, resulted in more convincing voices and could produce clips of arbitrary lengths. Speech engines often trip up after a couple sentences, descending into babble or losing tone, but WellSaid&#8217;s <a href="https://www.notion.so/Research-at-WellSaid-Labs-b2c40b2b7ab645e0b6d7beb3eef52b23">read the entirety of Mary Shelley&#8217;s &#8220;Frankenstein&#8221; without a hiccup</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The voices were good enough that they were rated as human or as good as human by listeners — not something you could really say about the usual virtual assistant suspects when they speak more than a handful of words. Not only that, but the speech was generated considerably faster than real time, where other high-quality options often operated at a tenth real time or slower — meaning three minutes of speech would take one minute to generate by WellSaid and half an hour or more by Tacotron.</p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');</script><![endif]-->
<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-2174302-1" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wellsaid-clip.mp3?_=1" /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wellsaid-clip.mp3">https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wellsaid-clip.mp3</a></audio></p>
<p>Lastly, the system allows for new &#8220;Voice Avatars&#8221; to be created based on existing voice talent, like a trusted company spokesperson or voiceover artist. Originally about 20 hours of audio was needed to build a model of their quirks and voice style, but now it can do so with as little as two hours, CEO Matt Hocking said.</p>
<p>The company is strictly business-focused right now, which is to say there&#8217;s no user-facing app to digitize your voice into an avatar or anything. There are attendant risks and no realistic business model for it, so that&#8217;s off the table for now.</p>
<p>Such a realistic voice might still be of enormous help to people with disabilities, however, something Hocking acknowledges but admits they&#8217;re not quite ready to tackle yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are committed to expanding access to this technology so that nonverbal communicators, nonprofits and others can benefit from it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the meantime the company has expanded from its first market, corporate training videos, to marketing, longer copy, interactive products with considerable text and app experiences. One hopes that the talent these avatars are based on are being properly compensated for helping create a digital likeness of their voice.</p>
<p>The oversubscribed $10M round was led by FUSE, with participation from repeat investor Voyager, Qualcomm Ventures LLC and GoodFriends, all of whom were likely impressed by the product and business growth. Synthetic voices have served a handful of popular use cases but content has not been a big one — so there&#8217;s plenty of room to grow. The company will invest the money in deepening its product offering and growing the team along with it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[European SPAC creation is modest compared to what’s been going on in the U.S, but it still represents material growth and a new avenue for European tech startups still hungry for exit opportunities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. SPAC market kept rolling along this week with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">news that Satellogic will go public</a> on the Nasdaq stock exchange thanks to a merger with a blank check company. The Earth-imagery-focused company is standard SPAC fare, with strong capital needs and distant revenues. It was not alone in pursuing the transaction type Tuesday, with news breaking that Nextdoor will also go public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC.</p>
<p>Nextdoor’s projections, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nextdoors-spac-investor-deck-paints-a-picture-of-sizable-scale-and-sticky-users/">TechCrunch noted</a>, were more modest and thus more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/spac-charts-are-exercises-in-the-limits-of-hype/">believable than what we’ve seen</a> from many other SPAC-led debuts.</p>
<p>These companies represent the two poles of blank-check-powered public offerings: Some startups taking the SPAC route are more speculative, banking on revenues to come, while others feature more established companies with a history of material revenue growth. It’s easy to find more examples of both varieties. Acorns’ deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/acorns-spac-listing-depicts-a-consumer-fintech-business-with-a-saasy-revenue-mix/">fits the established trend.</a> Lidar SPACs? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/aeye-becomes-latest-lidar-company-to-go-public-via-spac/">Less so</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Given the breadth of companies pursuing blank-check deals, the SPAC boom isn’t over even if there has been chatter that the party is breaking up. Bessemer partner <a href="https://twitter.com/mcadonofrio">Mary D&#8217;Onofrio</a> told The Exchange, for example, that while the “pace of SPAC IPOs” and combinations have slowed, “there is still $128 billion of SPAC dry powder in the market seeking acquisitions and incentivized to transact.”</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mmurph">Matt Murphy</a>, a partner at Menlo Ventures, helped explain the SPAC pace deceleration that D&#8217;Onofrio discussed, telling The Exchange that the pace of SPAC deals “has slowed as they’ve gotten more scrutiny and don’t seem quite as ‘easy’ as they once were.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1995214 size-medium alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But this week’s U.S. SPAC news tells us that blank-check companies are still finding a diverse set of companies to take public. But what about other regions? Unicorns are hardly unique to the U.S. startup ecosystem. Are we seeing similar SPAC interest in Europe?</p>
<p>The Exchange tried to find out, given that we’ve seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/european-insurtech-startup-wefox-grabs-650-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">huge rounds from the region</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/wise-ipo/update-1-wise-shares-indicated-to-open-at-10-bln-valuation-in-auction-idUSL5N2OJ1HJ">a few IPOs over various types.</a> Is the SPAC game afoot in Europe?</p>
<h2>Hunting European targets</h2>
<p>There’s a huge number of SPACs trading in the United States currently hunting for a deal. And there is historical precedent for U.S.-listed blank-check companies taking on European targets. Global law firm Skadden <a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2021/02/spacs-reshaping-ma-and-ipos">counts 16</a> U.S. SPAC-led transactions with European companies from 2015 through February of this year, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the past few weeks, we&#8217;ve been approached on a recurring basis, much like all known French and European scaleups,&#8221; Aircall&#8217;s co-founder Jonathan Anguelov <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/start-up/ecosysteme/spac-la-nouvelle-obsession-de-la-french-tech-1301577">told French financial newspaper Les Échos</a> last March (translation: TechCrunch). However, being approached doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that European unicorns are entertaining the offers.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corporate venture capital used to get a bad rap. The money flowed from corporations into startups when times were good, and quickly disappeared when the market turned.</p>
<p>But startups and corporations discovered something over time: They&#8217;re a lot stronger together no matter the market conditions. Most big companies can&#8217;t gain enough insight into what&#8217;s bubbling up in the market without deep ties to founders; meanwhile, founders benefit greatly from having a renowned corporation on the balance sheet. Not only can a big brand give an upstart near-instant credibility, a corporate partner can also open doors and provide startups with a far better understanding about the needs of established companies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because the corporate venture relationship has become so key to founders that we&#8217;re thrilled to be welcoming Arvind Purushotham to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TC Early Stage — Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a> happening tomorrow, July 8-9. Purushotham is a longtime VC who started his career as a circuit designer with Intel before spending nearly a decade with Menlo Ventures. Then, in 2011, he helped found Citi&#8217;s corporate venture capital group, where he remains the outfit&#8217;s global head of venture investing and sets the group&#8217;s overall strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, having since partnered with all kinds of companies over this last decade with Citi  &#8212;  just some of its checks have gone to Square, DocuSign, Honey, Plaid, Betterment, Jet.com, DataRobot, Tanium, Pindrop and Digit &#8212; Purushotham knows what it takes to drive a business forward and how corporate VCs can help in the mission.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll share what his own team looks for when meeting with a founding team and how Citi specifically identifies, then invests in startups as a way to bring cutting-edge tech to Citi&#8217;s businesses and functions.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll also share what not to do and why, how much to reveal and when, and how to think about a corporate venture partner once that investment is made.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be one of the highlights of our event, which is coming up quickly and is a must-see if your startup or a startup that you&#8217;re advising is looking for insights into how to better approach the key pillars of both marketing and fundraising. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2?display=true">Get your ticket today</a> before prices increase tonight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the Pentagon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nobody-wins-as-dod-finally-pulls-the-plug-on-controversial-10b-jedi-contract/">killed the JEDI cloud program yesterday</a>, it was the end of a long and bitter road for a project that never seemed to have a chance. The question is why it didn&#8217;t work out in the end, and ultimately I think you can blame the DoD&#8217;s stubborn adherence to a single vendor requirement, a condition that never made sense to anyone, even the vendor that ostensibly won the deal.</p>
<p>In March 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/the-high-stakes-battle-for-the-pentagons-winner-take-all-cloud-contract/">the Pentagon announced</a> a mega <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/15/why-the-pentagons-10-billion-jedi-deal-has-cloud-companies-going-nuts/">$10 billion, decade-long cloud contract</a> to build the next generation of cloud infrastructure for the Department of Defense. It was dubbed JEDI, which aside from the Star Wars reference, was short for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure.</p>
<p>The idea was a 10-year contract with a single vendor that started with an initial two-year option. If all was going well, a five-year option would kick in and finally a three-year option would close things out with earnings of $1 billion a year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the total value of the contract had it been completed was quite large, a billion a year for companies the size of Amazon, Oracle or Microsoft is not a ton of money in the scheme of things. It was more about the prestige of winning such a high-profile contract and what it would mean for sales bragging rights. After all, if you passed muster with the DoD, you could probably handle just about anyone&#8217;s sensitive data, right?</p>
<p>Regardless, the idea of a single-vendor contract went against conventional wisdom that the cloud gives you the option of working with the best-in-class vendors. Microsoft, the eventual winner of the ill-fated deal acknowledged that the single vendor approach was flawed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/23/dod-clarifies-winner-take-all-cloud-contract/">in an interview in April 2018</a>:</p>
<p>Leigh Madden, who heads up Microsoft’s defense effort, says he believes Microsoft can win such a contract, but it isn’t necessarily the best approach for the DoD. “If the DoD goes with a single award path, we are in it to win, but having said that, it’s counter to what we are seeing across the globe where 80% of customers are adopting a multicloud solution,” Madden told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was doomed from the start because of that. Yet even before the requirements were fully known there were complaints that it would favor Amazon,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/cloud-infrastructure-market-keeps-rolling-in-q1-with-almost-40b-in-revenue/"> the market share leader</a> in the cloud infrastructure market. Oracle was particularly vocal, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-04/oracle-s-catz-is-said-to-raise-amazon-contract-fight-with-trump">taking its complaints directly to the former president</a> before the RFP was even published. It would later file a complaint with the Government Accountability Office and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/oracle-loses-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-appeal-yet-again/">file a couple of lawsuits</a> alleging that the entire process was unfair and designed to favor Amazon. It lost every time &#8212; and of course, Amazon wasn&#8217;t ultimately the winner.</p>

<p>While there was a lot of drama along the way, in April 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/much-to-oracles-chagrin-pentagon-names-microsoft-and-amazon-as-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-finalists/">the Pentagon named two finalists</a>, and it was probably not too surprising that they were the two cloud infrastructure market leaders: Microsoft and Amazon. Game on.</p>
<p>The former president <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/president-throws-latest-wrench-in-10b-jedi-cloud-contract-selection-process/">interjected himself directly in the process</a> in August that year, when he ordered the Defense Secretary to review the matter over concerns that the process favored Amazon, a complaint which to that point had been refuted several times over by the DoD, the Government Accountability Office and the courts. To further complicate matters, a book by former defense secretary Jim Mattis claimed the president told him to &#8220;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/26/trump-mattis-screw-amazon-10-billion-pentagon-cloud-contract-jedi.html">screw Amazon out of the $10 billion contract</a>.&#8221; His goal appeared to be to get back at Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper.</p>
<p>In spite of all these claims that the process favored Amazon, when the winner was finally announced in October 2019, late on a Friday afternoon no less, the winner was not in fact Amazon. Instead,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/in-a-victory-over-amazon-microsoft-wins-10b-pentagon-jedi-cloud-contract/"> Microsoft won the deal</a>, or at least <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/even-after-microsoft-wins-jedi-saga-could-drag-on/">it seemed that way</a>. It wouldn&#8217;t be long before Amazon would dispute the decision in court.</p>

<p>By the time AWS re:Invent hit a couple of months after the announcement, former AWS CEO Andy Jassy was already pushing the idea that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/10/amazon-wants-to-depose-president-and-secretary-of-defense-as-part-of-jedi-protest/">the president had unduly influenced the process</a>.</p>
<p>“I think that we ended up with a situation where there was political interference. When you have a sitting president, who has shared openly his disdain for a company, and the leader of that company, it makes it really difficult for government agencies, including the DoD, to make objective decisions without fear of reprisal,” Jassy said at that time.</p>
<p>Then came the litigation. In November the company indicated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/aws-confirms-reports-it-will-challenge-jedi-contract-award-to-microsoft/">it would be challenging the decision</a> to choose Microsoft charging that it was was driven by politics and not technical merit. In January 2020, Amazon filed a request with the court that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/in-latest-jedi-contract-drama-aws-files-motion-to-stop-work-on-project/">the project should stop</a> until the legal challenges were settled. In February, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/judge-halts-microsoft-work-on-jedi-contract-after-aws-request/">a federal judge agreed</a> with Amazon and stopped the project. It would never restart.</p>
<p>In April the DoD completed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/dod-inspector-general-report-finds-everything-was-basically-hunky-dory-with-jedi-cloud-contract-bid/">its own internal investigation</a> of the contract procurement process and found no wrongdoing. As I wrote at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>While controversy has dogged the $10-billion, decade-long JEDI contract since its earliest days, a report by the DoD’s inspector general’s office concluded today that, while there were some funky bits and potential conflicts, overall the contract procurement process was fair and legal and the president did not unduly influence the process in spite of public comments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last September the DoD completed a review of the selection process and it once <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/dod-reaffirms-microsoft-has-won-jedi-cloud-contract-but-amazon-legal-complaints-still-pending/">again concluded that Microsoft was the winner</a>, but it didn&#8217;t really matter as the litigation was still in motion and the project remained stalled.</p>

<p>The legal wrangling continued into this year, and yesterday the Pentagon finally pulled the plug on the project once and for all, saying it was time to move on as times have changed since 2018 when it announced its vision for JEDI.</p>
<p>The DoD finally came to the conclusion that a single-vendor approach wasn&#8217;t the best way to go, and not because it could never get the project off the ground, but because it makes more sense from a technology and business perspective to work with multiple vendors and not get locked into any particular one.</p>
<p>“JEDI was developed at a time when the Department’s needs were different and both the CSPs&#8217; (cloud service providers) technology and our cloud conversancy was less mature. In light of new initiatives like <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/IF11493.pdf">JADC2</a> (the Pentagon&#8217;s initiative to build a network of connected sensors) and AI and Data Acceleration (ADA), the evolution of the cloud ecosystem within DoD, and changes in user requirements to leverage multiple cloud environments to execute mission, our landscape has advanced and a new way ahead is warranted to achieve dominance in both traditional and nontraditional warfighting domains,” said John Sherman, acting DoD chief information officer in a statement.</p>
<p>In other words, the DoD would benefit more from adopting a multicloud, multivendor approach like pretty much the rest of the world. That said, the department also indicated it would limit the vendor selection to Microsoft and Amazon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Department intends to seek proposals from a limited number of sources, namely the Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), as available market research indicates that these two vendors are the only Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) capable of meeting the Department’s requirements,&#8221; the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not going to sit well with Google, Oracle or IBM, but the department further indicated it would continue to monitor the market to see if other CSPs had the chops to handle their requirements in the future.</p>
<p>In the end, the single vendor requirement contributed greatly to an overly competitive and politically charged atmosphere that resulted in the project never coming to fruition. Now the DoD has to play technology catch-up, having lost three years to the histrionics of the entire JEDI procurement process and that could be the most lamentable part of this long, sordid technology tale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In his first press event since ignominiously leaving office earlier this year, former President Donald Trump announced that he is launching a volley of class-action lawsuits against Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, claiming that the three companies violated his First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>The suits also name Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg and Google&#8217;s chief executive Sundar Pichai.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re demanding an end to the shadow-banning, a stop to the silencing and a stop to the blacklisting, banishing and canceling that you know so well,&#8221; Trump said at the press conference, held at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following the January 6 attack on the Capitol, social media platforms swiftly revoked then-President Trump&#8217;s posting privileges. For years, Trump tested the boundaries of platforms&#8217; policies around misinformation and even violent threats, but his role in the events of that day crossed a line. Trump soon found himself without a megaphone with which to reach his many millions of followers across Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s fate on Twitter is known: The former president faces a lifetime ban there. But on Facebook and YouTube, there&#8217;s a possibility that his accounts could be restored. Facebook is still deliberating that decision after its external policymaking body, the Facebook Oversight Board, kicked the issue back to the company. Facebook now needs to determine the length of Trump&#8217;s indefinite suspension, whether permanent or for a fixed period of time.</p>
<p>Trump will be the lead plaintiff in the suits, which are being filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The lawsuits seek &#8220;compensatory and punitive damages&#8221; and the restoration of Trump&#8217;s social media accounts. Facebook and Twitter declined to comment on the news and Google did not respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s request for comment.</p>
<p>The lawsuits have already had their intended effect of generating attention, but they aren&#8217;t likely to go anywhere. Trump accuses Facebook, Twitter and Google of violating his First Amendment rights, but the First Amendment pertains to governments censoring free speech, not businesses.</p>
<p>The three companies are also well-guarded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which both protects platforms from legal liability for the content they host and empowers them to make content-moderation decisions — including the decision to remove a sitting president from their platforms altogether.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://r2c.dev/">r2c</a>, a startup building a SaaS service around the <a href="https://semgrep.dev/docs/">Semgrep open-source project</a>, announced that it has closed a $27 million Series B. Felicis led the round, which the company said was a pre-emptive deal.</p>
<p>Prior investors firms Redpoint and Sequoia also participated in the fundraising event; r2c last <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/r2c/company_financials">raised a $13 million Series A</a> in October of 2020.</p>
<p>The startup fits into several trends that TechCrunch has explored in recent quarters, including what appears to be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/2170552/">growing number</a> of open-source (OSS) grounded startups raising capital, more rounds coming to exist thanks to investors looking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/the-early-stage-venture-capital-market-is-weird-and-chaotic/">to get the jump on inside rounds</a> before they can form.</p>
<p>On the OSS point, r2c works with Semgrep, which the company likens to a &#8220;code-aware grep.&#8221; Still confused? Don&#8217;t worry, this is all a bit technical, but interesting. Grep is a tool for searching through plain-text that has been around for decades. Semgrep is related, but focused on finding things inside of written code.</p>
<p>Given the sheer volume of code that is written daily in the world, you can imagine that there is an ever-rising demand for finding particular bits of text quickly; Semgrep is an evolution of the original project, that was initially built inside of Facebook.</p>
<p>Per r2c CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaacevans">Isaac Evans</a>, however, the project failed to attract much awareness. His startup has built what Evans described to TechCrunch has the &#8220;canonical&#8221; Semgrep fork, or version, and has crafted a software service around the code to make it easier for other companies to use.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174593" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174593" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2174593 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="152" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg 3360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=2048,1035 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/r2c-team-photo-large.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174593" class="wp-caption-text">The r2c team, via the company.</p></div></p>
<p>There are many ways to generate revenue from open-source software. Two popular monetization routes are througuh support services or offers to host particular projects. But, R2c is a doing something a bit different. The startup sells a monthly, per-developer subscription (SaaS) that packages a broad set of security-focused rules across different coding languages, allowing companies to easily check their own software for possible security issues.</p>
<p>Or as Evans succinctly explained it, r2c offers something akin to application security in a box.</p>
<p>Focusing on cybersecurity is a reasonable tack for the company. Given the ever-growing number of breaches that the public endures, helping companies leak less data, and suffer fewer intrusions is big business.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to pay r2c, however. Semgrep is OSS and the rules associated with various languages are available under a LGPL license &#8212; more on that definition <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">here</a>. Developers could build their own version of what the company offers. But, Evans argued, it won&#8217;t be ready to help you pick which rules you may want to apply to your code, something that his company is happy to help with for a fee.</p>
<p>From a wide lens, r2c fits into the developer tools category. It is content to land and expand inside of companies, perhaps allowing it a lower cost of acquiring customers than we see at some SaaS startups. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the company won&#8217;t go to market to sell its service. Per Evans, the startup has historically underinvested in marketing, something that it may now be able to focus more on thanks to its recent financing.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to see companies with technically-minded founders initially spend too little on the sales and marketing parts of operating a software business. But our impression after discussing the company&#8217;s plans with Evans is that r2c intends to get that part of its house in order.</p>
<p>Evans told TechCrunch that his company took aboard more cash because it doesn&#8217;t want to build the best search tool for, say, the C programming language. It wants to go broad, fusing what the CEO described as the &#8220;customizability of Semgrep&#8221; and wide language support.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how quickly the company can staff up, bolster its marketing efforts, and take on enterprise clients. Raising a Series C puts the company somewhere past its startup adolescence, so from here on out we can pester the company for concrete growth numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re a frequent TechCrunch reader, you probably already know about mmhmm, the startup with the name you likely either love or hate. It&#8217;s Phil Libin&#8217;s second act after Evernote, and it&#8217;s a startup born of the pandemic maybe more so than any other, providing improved video chat tools, including automatic background removal and advanced presentation features. The company, which is just over a year old, has now raised a total of around $140 million thanks to a fresh injection of $100 million first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/a-company-called-mmhmm-just-raised-100-million">reported by Bloomberg</a> on Tuesday, which is somewhat astounding if you remember using the first early beta versions like me.</p>
<p>Startups with silly names raising lots of money is hardly an exceptional occurrence in tech, but Libin&#8217;s startup earns extra credit for barely having a name at all (it&#8217;s really just a sound).</p>
<p>The company was built on the idea that current video tools really fail to provide users with access to all the potential that modern technology offers, particularly when it comes to presentations. Mmhmm&#8217;s core presenter tools help your meetings look more like professional newscasts than warmed-over digital versions of transparency slideshows and whiteboard scrawls, and the company has steadily been adding features and improving its performance through frequent iterations since its founding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;mmhmm, the video conferencing software, kicks off summer with a bunch of new features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/mmhmm-the-video-conferencing-software-kicks-off-summer-with-a-bunch-of-new-features/embed/#?secret=xtp8BYcoZu" data-secret="xtp8BYcoZu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As it stands, mmhmm works in tandem with the existing video services that people use for virtual meetings, including Zoom. But Bloomberg says it&#8217;s going to go standalone as well, and introduce a mobile app version. That sounds like a good use of the new funds, which come from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital and more.</p>
<p>Even projecting forward to a post-pandemic world where virtual meetings are less important, they&#8217;re probably still a permanent part of the working world. But mmhmm&#8217;s feature set also seems to almost define the concept of &#8216;feature, not product&#8217; that is presented as a cautionary tale to startups crafting wings of wax and soaring as high as they can in terms of raises and valuation.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie, </strong></p>
<p><strong>I co-founded a startup a few years ago and currently have an O-1A visa. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My wife wants to return to work, but as you know, she cannot get work authorization on an O-3. I read that if I switch to International Entrepreneur Parole, she can get work authorization. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the process for getting Entrepreneur Parole and for my wife to get a work permit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Supportive Spouse in San Jose</strong></p>
<p>Dear Supportive,</p>
<p>I’m so excited by all the opportunities opening up thanks to the revived <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/entrepreneur-parole/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP) program. It would be awesome if your wife could resume her career!</p>
<p>Take a listen to my podcast on <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/078-parole-entry-process/">the parole entry process</a>, what you have to do to get it and what to expect when you do, including when your wife can apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). Tomorrow, I’ll be participating in a <a href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_IbfeMbSuQpG_smh3ijzfWg">free educational panel hosted by the National Venture Capital Association with representatives of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a> that you’re welcome to join as well.</p>
<p>Although this IEP has been around for more than four years, the Department of Homeland Security only recently revived it after the Trump administration tried and failed to get rid of it. Given that the IEP program is so new, I recommend working with an experienced immigration attorney when applying for IEP. An immigration attorney can also discuss other options that would allow your wife to work.</p>
<h2>How do I apply for Entrepreneur Parole?</h2>
<p>You must fill out the application for Entrepreneur Parole and submit it to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) along with evidence that demonstrates your rapidly growing startup will create jobs and significantly contribute to the U.S. economy. If you want more details on the qualification requirements for IEP, take a look at a previous <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-how-does-the-international-entrepreneur-parole-program-work/">Dear Sophie column</a> on that topic or listen to my podcast, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole is back!</a> To get parole for your spouse and children (under the age of 21 and unmarried), you can concurrently file their applications for Advance Parole.</p>
<p>If USCIS approves your application for IEP, you will receive a parole document that is valid for 30 months, supports multiple entries and can be extended once for another 30 months if you and your startup continue to meet the extension criteria. However, USCIS approval alone does not grant you or your family parole.</p>
<h2>Who grants parole?</h2>
<p>A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officer at an airport or other U.S. port of entry will have the final say on whether you and your family are granted parole — a temporary stay in the U.S. — and for how long. There is no equivalent of a “change of status” here.</p>
<p>That means if you and your family are in the U.S., you must first leave the U.S. and then show your parole documents to the CBP officer upon reentering the U.S. The CBP officer has the discretion to approve or deny your entry, so your immigration attorney should prepare you by letting you know the type of questions you may be asked and how to succinctly and honestly answer them.</p>
<p>If you and your wife are returning to the U.S. via airplane or boat, you will need to go to a U.S. embassy or consulate to obtain a boarding foil. That foil — also known as a travel foil — will enable you to board an airplane or boat since you won&#8217;t have a visa stamp in your passport under IEP.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Canadian nationals traveling from Canada to a U.S. port of entry can present an approved parole document without obtaining travel documentation. I believe individuals are allowed to enter the land border from Mexico, which some of our clients will be testing. (More updates to come!)</p>
<p>Although IEP allows for an initial stay in the U.S. of up to 30 months, CBP officers could approve your parole into the U.S. for only one year, requiring you to exit and reenter the U.S. again in 12 months. The CBP officer will stamp your passport with your parole expiration date.</p>
<p>To renew parole beyond the initial 30 months for another 30 months, you will have to meet the IEP extension requirements and file a new Entrepreneur Parole application.</p>
<h2>How does my spouse get an EAD?</h2>
<p>Once you and your wife are paroled into the U.S., she can apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), otherwise known as a work permit. Your wife cannot begin working until she receives the EAD, and it will only be valid for the length of the parole stay. Given the current USCIS processing delays, the EAD may only be valid for a few months before your wife has to apply for a new EAD.</p>
<p>Depending on your wife’s field of expertise, it may make more sense for her to find a job with an employer willing to sponsor her for a visa or green card. Given the tight labor market in some industry sectors in the U.S., many employers are increasingly willing to invest in international talent.</p>
<p>Or, if you both want to remain in the U.S. permanently, you can also consider self-petitioning for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A green card for individuals with extraordinary ability</a> or an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) green card for individuals with exceptional ability</a>. Your immigration attorney should be able to help you determine which immigration option is right for you and your wife.</p>
<p>Best wishes to you and your wife as you navigate this process to live your dreams!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.unit21.ai/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that helps businesses monitor fraudulent activities with its no-code software, announced today it has raised $34 million in a Series B round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round values San Francisco-based Unit21 at $300 million and comes nine months after the startup raised a $13 million Series A that included investments from the founders of Plaid, Chime and Shape Security as well as former Venmo COO Michael Vaughan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICONIQ Capital and existing backers Gradient Ventures (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s AI venture fund)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, A.Capital and South Park Commons participated in the latest funding event. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">F</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ormer Affirm product manager Trisha Kothari and C</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">larence Chio founded Unit21 in 2018 with the goal of giving risk, compliance and fraud teams a way to fight financial crime via a “secure, integrated, no-code platform.” </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2174139" style="width: 348px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2174139" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2174139 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?w=453" alt="" width="338" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg 3721w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unit21-2.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 338px) 100vw, 338px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2174139" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Unit21</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say they started Unit21 based on the belief that the existing model of “black box” machine learning used for fraud prevention and detection was flawed. Their idea was to develop an alternative system to provide risk and compliance teams with more control over their operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit21 describes its core technology as a “flag-and-review” toolset designed to give non-technical operators and <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/01/us-and-uk-regulators-take-lead-on-aml-fines-for-2019/">anti-money laundering (AML) teams</a> the ability to “easily” write complex statistical models and deploy customized workflows without having to involve their engineering teams. Unit21 says it provides this toolset to companies with the aim of helping them mitigate fraud and money laundering risks through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, transaction monitoring detection and suspicious activity report (SAR) case management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unit21 has built up an impressive customer base of over 50 enterprise clients, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chime, Intuit, Coinbase, Gusto, Flywire, Wyre and Twitter, among others.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The company says it has monitored more than $100 billion in activity via its API and dashboard since its 2018 inception. It also says that it has saved more than 20 million users over $100 million in fraud loss/suspicious activity. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, saying only revenue grew by “12x” in 2020 compared to 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data is the most important weapon in the fight against fraud and money laundering,” Kothari said. “This funding will support our mission to democratize data and make it more accessible to operations teams.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will also use its new capital in part toward expanding its engineering, research and development and go-to-market  teams. As of late June, Unit21 had 53 employees, up from 12 at the same time last year. The startup also plans to evolve its platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">for generalized flag and review use cases beyond financial crimes and fraud.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://opaque.co/">Opaque</a>, a new startup born out of Berkeley&#8217;s <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/">RISELab</a>, announced a $9.5 million seed round today to build a solution to access and work with sensitive data in the cloud in a secure way, even with multiple organizations involved. Intel Capital led today&#8217;s investment with participation by Race Capital, The House Fund and FactoryHQ.</p>
<p>The company helps customers work with secure data in the cloud while making sure the data they are working on is not being exposed to cloud providers, other research participants or anyone else, says company president Raluca Ada Popa.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do is we use this very exciting hardware mechanism called Enclave, which [operates] deep down in the processor &#8212; it&#8217;s a physical black box &#8212; and only gets decrypted there. [&#8230;] So even if somebody has administrative privileges in the cloud, they can only see encrypted data,&#8221; she explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Company co-founder Ion Stoica, who was a co-founder at Databricks, says the startup&#8217;s solution helps resolve two conflicting trends. On one hand, businesses increasingly want to make use of data, but at the same time are seeing a growing trend toward privacy. Opaque is designed to resolve this by giving customers access to their data in a safe and fully encrypted way.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Data is the world&#8217;s most valuable (and vulnerable) resource&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/data-is-the-worlds-most-valuable-and-vulnerable-resource/embed/#?secret=H7qbQvLiw9" data-secret="H7qbQvLiw9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company describes the solution as &#8220;a novel combination of two key technologies layered on top of state-of-the-art cloud security—secure hardware enclaves and cryptographic fortification.&#8221; This enables customers to work with data &#8212; for example to build machine learning models &#8212; without exposing the data to others, yet while generating meaningful results.</p>
<p>Popa says this could be helpful for hospitals working together on cancer research, who want to find better treatment options without exposing a given hospital&#8217;s patient data to other hospitals, or banks looking for money laundering without exposing customer data to other banks, as a couple of examples.</p>
<p>Investors were likely attracted to the pedigree of Popa, a computer security and applied crypto professor at UC Berkeley and Stoica, who is also a Berkeley professor and co-founded Databricks. Both helped found RISELabs at Berkeley where they developed the solution and spun it out as a company.</p>
<p>Mark Rostick, vice president and senior managing director at lead investor Intel Capital says his firm has been working with the founders since the startup&#8217;s earliest days, recognizing the potential of this solution to help companies find complex solutions even when there are multiple organizations involved sharing sensitive data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enterprises struggle to find value in data across silos due to confidentiality and other concerns. Confidential computing unlocks the full potential of data by allowing organizations to extract insights from sensitive data while also seamlessly moving data to the cloud without compromising security or privacy,” Rostick said in a statement</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Opaque bridges the gap between data security and cloud scale and economics, thus enabling inter-organizational and intra-organizational collaboration.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new startup called <a href="https://www.swoonmedating.com/">SwoonMe</a> aims to fix the problem with superficial dating apps, where users primarily make decisions based on how someone looks in their photos. Instead of swiping through profiles, SwoonMe&#8217;s idea is to use a combination of avatars and audio to encourage users to connect based on someone&#8217;s personality, not their appearance.</p>
<p>To use the app, you take a selfie which SwoonMe converts into an avatar. This is what others will see when they come to your profile. You then record a voice clip to tell others about yourself and what you&#8217;re looking for in a partner. You&#8217;ll also answer a few questions &#8212; like whether you&#8217;re looking for marriage or something more casual and what your <a href="https://www.5lovelanguages.com/">love language</a> is (e.g. physical touch, gifts, words of affirmation, etc.), among other things.</p>
<p>The result is that when people scroll through SwoonMe, they&#8217;re not making snap decisions based on what they&#8217;re seeing, but are rather making more thoughtful decisions based what they hear. When two people match, the app encourages them to continue to get to know each other using voice messages and soon, icebreaker games &#8212; not texting and photo-sharing. As they communicate, their avatar will slowly unveil their real photo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2173606" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173606" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2173606" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173606" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SwoonMe</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for SwoonMe comes from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanvigupta773/">Tanvi Gupta</a>, a former Facebook product specialist who was involved with a number of high-profile products, including those that shipped in Messenger and in Instagram Direct, such as Messenger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/facebook-messenger-reactions/">reactions</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/facebook-messenger-simple-redesign/">a Messenger redesign</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/12/chat-heads-comes-to-facebook-messenger-for-android-works-across-apps-even-without-facebook-home/">chat heads</a> on Android, and more. This experience taught her a lot about launching new products built from scratch, and helping them to find product-market fit, she says.</p>
<p>But Gupta decided to build SwoonMe because of her own personal struggles with modern-day dating apps, where men who messaged her immediately wanted to share selfies and meet her without having read anything on her profile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dating world always felt super-indexed on looks, given the proliferation of apps like Tinder and Bumble,&#8221; Gupta explains. &#8220;And what I felt was they were not solving my personal need for somebody who wants to connect for a long-term relationship,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Gupta began work on SwoonMe during the pandemic, when the market was hungry for new ways to connect people online &#8212; a trend that had led to the launch of audio apps like Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">and</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">later</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/reddit-unveils-its-clubhouse-clone-reddit-talk/">its</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">many</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">clones</a>. The founder says she was also inspired by Clubhouse, as it demonstrated the potential in audio-based social networking, including how it could be used for more personal connections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Platforms like Clubhouse have shown that taking video and looks out of the equation allow people to lean into actual topics,&#8221; Gupta says. &#8220;It creates new levels of intimacy and interaction, and we&#8217;re basically trying to capture this with SwoonMe, but in the dating world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though SwoonMe isn&#8217;t necessarily limited only to people looking for relationships, it may initially appeal to that demographic because it requires a bit more time and focus to listen to soundbites and engage in audio-based messaging. This experience would be more likely to attract someone who is taking dating more seriously, not someone in search of a quick hookup or causal connection.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2173605" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2173605" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2173605" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe-iPhone.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe-iPhone.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe-iPhone.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe-iPhone.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe-iPhone.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe-iPhone.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe-iPhone.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe-iPhone.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/SwoonMe-iPhone.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2173605" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SwoonMe</p></div></p>
<p>SwoonMe is not the first social app to use avatars instead of photos, however. Avatar-based social discovery apps have been popular in other markets in Asia and in Brazil, but have yet to see broad, mainstream adoption in the U.S., particularly in the dating market. That may soon change, though, as Tinder parent Match Group this year acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">Seoul-based social app maker Hyperconnect</a> — its biggest acquisition ever at $1.73 billion. AR-powered avatars are a part of the app portfolio that came with the deal.</p>
<p>The startup is also not the first dating app to take the idea of the &#8220;face reveal&#8221; &#8212; a somewhat gimmicky <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-doing-a-face-reveal">concept</a> popularized by online creators &#8212; into the world of dating. There are a number of voice-based apps on the app stores today, which have seen varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>In February, for example, an app called Jigsaw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/jigsaw-scores-3-7m-to-slow-down-your-dating-swipes/">raised</a> $3.7 million for its own so-called &#8220;anti-superficial&#8221; dating app that places puzzle pieces over users&#8217; faces which can only be removed after a pre-set amount of in-app engagement. But in Jigsaw&#8217;s case, the puzzle pieces were to be applied over full body photos, and it had banned selfies. That means the app was doing the opposite of what it proposes. Instead of encouraging daters to ignore images, some users were likely making decisions based on what someone&#8217;s <em>body</em> looked like in their photo with their face <em>removed</em>. That&#8217;s even worse. (After expressing my concerns to Jigsaw and declining to cover them, the startup told me it ended its selfie ban and now accepts a wide range of imagery.)</p>
<p>Gupta also feels strongly that women, in particular, deserve a different way to meet people that&#8217;s not about their looks alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a female, one of the main drivers behind founding a company like SwoonMe, which is audio-first and not photos, is because I personally am tired, and have been tired, of being objectified by men&#8230;We&#8217;re living in the 21st century and I am done with that. I want someone to like me because of my personality, because of my voice, because of what I bring into a relationship,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Sure, physical attraction is important, but that is not the only thing,&#8221; Gupta adds.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there&#8217;s demand for a less superficial dating app from men, too. In fact, SwoonMe currently has more male users than female at present. The app, to be clear, is open to all gender identities and sexual orientations as the issues it aims to solve can impact everyone. It also offers an inclusive sign-up flow.</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s too soon to report user numbers and growth, Gupta says the app has &#8220;a good number&#8221; of early testers and they&#8217;ve been able to get solid user feedback so far.</p>
<p>The bigger question for SwoonMe is whether or not it can attract people looking for real relationships, as many of those people <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-date-without-dating-apps-2018-10">avoid dating apps</a> altogether. It&#8217;s also competing with a growing number of video-first dating apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/snack-a-tinder-meets-tiktok-dating-app-opens-to-gen-z-investors/">like Snack</a>, aimed at Gen Z users who are more comfortable filming themselves thanks to their use of social media platforms like TikTok.</p>
<p>At launch, <a href="https://www.swoonmedating.com/">SwoonMe</a> doesn&#8217;t generate revenue, but plans to add premium features if it reaches scale. Longer-term, the company would like to expand its platform beyond dating to help keep couples connected during their relationship, too.</p>
<p>SwoonMe soft-launched across both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swoonme-voice-first-dating/id1552773407">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dalybyteinc.swoonme">Play Store</a> for beta testing, but is today announcing its official launch. Currently, SwoonMe is targeting the dating markets of San Francisco and L.A., but is open to anyone who wants to try it.</p>
<p>The startup is a small team and currently working to raise $1 million in seed funding.</p>

<p>This time, we are surveying founders and investors in Europe’s other cities to capture how European hubs are growing from the perspective of the people on the ground. We’d like to know how your city’s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and generally how your city will evolve.</p>
<p>We leave submissions mostly unedited and are generally looking for at least one or two paragraphs in answers to the questions.</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email <a href="mailto:mike@techcrunch.com">mike@techcrunch.com</a> and/or reply on Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher">@mikebutcher</a>.</p>
