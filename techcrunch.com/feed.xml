										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The California Department of Motor Vehicles gave General Motors-backed Cruise and Alphabet-owned Waymo the green light to start charging for autonomous services offered to the public.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Cruise received a &#8220;driverless deployment permit,&#8221; which means it can receive compensation for services provided without a safety operator in the front seat. Waymo&#8217;s &#8220;drivered deployment permit&#8221; allows the operator to also charge money while operating an AV, but with a driver in the front seat. While they can both in theory charge now for autonomous delivery services, they are still a step away from being able to charge for robotaxi services. That last hurdle will require a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), but both Waymo and Cruise declined to comment on a potential timeline for launching a commercial ride-hailing service in SF.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t be the only ones making a business out of their AVs on the roads in California. In December, 2020, autonomous delivery startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california/">Nuro became the first company to receive a permit from the California DMV</a> to launch a commercial driverless service on public roads in the state.</p>
<p>Cruise and Waymo have been testing their AVs on public roads with a safety driver since 2015 and 2014, respectively, and without since October 2020 and October 2018. Cruise was also given permission to start giving <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cruise-can-now-give-passengers-rides-in-driverless-cars-in-california/">passengers driverless rides in California in June</a>, so the company has been offering its employees free rides for the past few months.<em> </em>In August, Waymo began its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/waymo-launches-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">Trusted Tester program</a> in the city, as well, allowing San Franciscans to hail one of its autonomous, electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles, with a safety driver on board, for free rides.</p>
<p>Cruise&#8217;s most recent authorization grants the company permission to use its fleet of autonomous Chevy Bolt-based vehicles for commercial services on public surface streets within certain parts of San Francisco between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. at a maximum speed of 30 miles per hour. Waymo can use its fleet of light-duty AVs within parts of SF and San Mateo counties on public roads with a speed limit of up to 65 miles per hour and with no apparent time restrictions. Both can operate in rain and light fog.</p>
<p>Both Cruise and Waymo declined to comment on when they plan to launch a commercial service in the Bay Area or whether they have plans to begin a delivery service. Last November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/walmart-and-cruise-partner-to-test-autonomous-grocery-delivery-in-arizona/">Cruise and Walmart partnered in Scottsdale, Arizona</a> to deliver goods with a safety operator in the front seat. Waymo Via&#8217;s local delivery business has also been <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2020/01/partnering-with-ups-to-deliver-on-our.html">operational in Phoenix, Arizona</a> since January 2020, also with a trained operator onboard, providing services for clients like UPS and AutoNation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ellen Jantsch, founder of growth marketing agency Tuff, makes it clear: There's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to growth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you are looking for a growth marketing playbook, stop reading now, because you won&#8217;t get one from <a href="https://tuffgrowth.com/">Tuff</a>. The agency&#8217;s founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ellen-jantsch-a03955107/">Ellen Jantsch</a> makes it clear: There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to growth.</p>
<p>The team at Tuff knows their stuff — and it&#8217;s precisely why they are not selling &#8220;magic&#8221; or any kind of &#8220;mysterious secret sauce.&#8221; Instead, they are betting on transparency and experimentation, and it seems to be working well: The agency was warmly recommended to TechCrunch multiple times via our growth marketing survey. (You can share your own recommendations <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">here</a>!)</p>
<p>For instance, Luke Oehlerking, VP of Product and Strategy at solar company<a href="https://zenernet.com/"> Zenernet</a>, explained that Tuff fitted the bill for its ability to &#8220;truly move the needle with measurable results&#8221; while acting as &#8220;an extension of [Zenernet&#8217;s] own team.&#8221; This doesn&#8217;t necessarily involve offline meetings: Oehlerking and Jantsch are both based in Colorado, but Tuff&#8217;s team is fully remote, with global clients. Client work aside, Tuff also launched <a href="https://tuffgrowth.com/growth-guide/">Growth Guide</a>, a remote growth marketing training program for founders.</p>
<p>We asked Jantsch about all that, and found our conversation an interesting complement to our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/performance-marketing-agency-mutesix-bets-on-content-and-data-to-boost-dtc-e-commerce/">interview with LA-based agency MuteSix</a>: Both share a focus on results and creativity, but Tuff is focused on a wider range of sectors than DTC, while also being smaller. Let&#8217;s find out how it works.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: The interview below has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><b>What is Tuff? Why did you launch it, and how big is it now?</b></p>
<p><b>Ellen Jantsch: </b>Tuff is a small (20-person) growth marketing agency that partners closely with startups and scaleups to help them increase revenue and sales. While we have found success working with teams in nearly every industry, from early traction startups to large enterprises, there’s certainly a type that fits us best. The most basic guidelines: If a prospect is looking to acquire new customers and scale their company through modern channels, tools and frameworks, we’re almost always in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I started Tuff as a one-woman show because I wanted to do meaningful work with companies (and founders) I liked. While growth was always in the cards, I’ve always been most focused on creating a great place to work with people that care about helping companies with unique ideas as much as I do. After nearly five years in business, I’m proud to say that I’ve been able to check quite a few of those boxes I created for myself in the very beginning and added a handful of others along the way.</p>
<p><b>What range of services do you provide?</b></p>
<p>Our bread and butter is building efficient, holistic, growth-focused marketing strategies. We do this with our method that’s been battle-tested and has proven itself no matter the industry or company life stage. Then, we stay hungry for research and execute to a T, consistently optimizing and refining to find maximum efficiencies.</p>
<p>Throughout it all, we lean on all members of our team. Egoless and curious, we share hypotheses and findings with our partners and each other to find more streamlined paths to growth. But what really sets us apart is our method. Radical transparency is the name of the game. We believe that collaboration and showing our work is the only real way to build foundations for trustworthy partnerships.</p>
<p>Our list of tactics includes but is most certainly not limited to PPC, social ads, technical SEO, content strategy, creative, email and conversion rate optimization (CRO).</p>
<p><b>Are your team members generalists and/or specialists?</b></p>
<p>We hire for two core roles at Tuff. We have growth marketers who are big-picture strategists, as well as channel experts who are deeply experienced in a particular type of marketing. Each account we work with is paired with a growth marketer and at least three to five different channel experts depending on what we’re testing. Your growth marketer is your map maker and wayfinder — keeping goals clearly defined and the whole team focused on creating the smartest path to growth. Your channel experts are the in-the-weeds, watching-every-dollar-spent efficiency finders and optimizers.</p>
<p><b>What are the pros and cons of hiring an agency like Tuff, compared to an in-house marketer?</b></p>
<p>Finding a full-time hire is a great option for many companies. But they come with their own set of pros and cons when compared to a plug-in growth marketing team. The major benefit is the expertise and time they bring to the team. Pulling a full-time, smart marketing hustler that can squeeze the most out of a small budget and stay in lockstep with everything else you have going on can be a huge asset. The biggest downsides and risks are finding the right fit, investing the high cost and hoping that they can remain your go-to even if it becomes time to test tactics that fall outside of their wheelhouse. Ultimately, an in-house hire is right if you’re already confident in the channels that work for you and just need someone to help you refine and grow those 1-2 channels.</p>
<p>When you hire a growth marketing agency, though, the major, overarching benefit is that it typically comes stacked with a full team that can get a holistic view of your business, collaborate to identify the best course of action and delegate execution tasks to true channel experts. With an agency, you can often reallocate resources as you learn and move more quickly because the team has a long history of experience.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03"><i>Respond to our survey</i></a><i> and help other startups find top growth marketers they can work with!</i></em></p>
<hr />
<p><b>How do you charge clients, and why?</b></p>
<p>Most performance marketing agencies pocket a percentage of the amount of ad spend they&#8217;re managing or of revenue generated by their tactics. Neither of those methods is wrong by any means. But we deliberately built our pricing system differently: We charge flat-fee retainers based on the number of services we&#8217;re plugging in at once.</p>
<p>Why? Because growth marketing is fickle. Sometimes, even the best GM in the game can predict that a mix of PPC, SEO content and social ads is the golden ticket. But when one of them underperforms, it&#8217;s not a sign of something gone wrong, it&#8217;s a sign that it&#8217;s time to try something new. The way our process functions at Tuff allows us to seamlessly sub in new services or team members to try something new (like CRO or creative development) without a hitch until we find the mix that’s just right.</p>
<p><b>Can&#8217;t your clients simply all follow the same growth marketing playbook?</b></p>
<p>Scaling any business is hard, and growth marketing is not a [magic] trick. I’ve yet to see a playbook that you can take from one business and apply to the next and get consistent results.</p>
<p>We work with more than just e-commerce businesses; we flex into SaaS, fintech and B2B industries and it’s forced us to truly develop a model/process for growth and not just a playbook, meaning our channel and tactic mix is always different.</p>
<p>I think something that we focus on more than most is quick, fearless testing, then finding ways of operationalizing the early wins so they can become repeatable. It’s one thing to coax wins out of champion channels, and it’s another to know that your big-picture strategy is going to hold up under the pressure of scale.</p>
<p><b>Your site mentions &#8220;rapid experimentation&#8221; and &#8220;quick wins.&#8221; Can you detail how Tuff does that?</b></p>
<p>We know that even our most experienced growth marketers can develop an original growth plan that doesn’t drive results the way we want it to, despite extensive research and strategizing. That’s one of the reasons why we like growth marketing so much, there’s no gilded road to success.</p>
<p>So, instead of setting a strategy in stone, we’ll start every new partnership with a plan to test a range of different tactics within our chosen channels and check in every single day to gauge performance, reallocate budgets, glean insights and prioritize quick wins. After a few weeks, we’ll be able to emerge from our sea of data to outline what worked, what didn’t work quite as well as planned, and our game plan for driving longer-term success.</p>
<p><b>How do you make sure these early wins hold up under the pressure of scale?</b></p>
<p>In our earliest weeks of a partnership with any of our clients, we’re focused on not only driving quick wins, but designing our tests and articulating our hypotheses in ways that not only uncover insights for the following quarter, but for the next year and beyond.</p>
<p>More so, I think some of our strongest attributes as a team are our hunger to keep learning, our curiosity and our fearlessness when it comes to adapting, even if it means turning away from a tactic that’s held up for us in the past.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to illustrate this is the intro message a new prospect sent us last week: “Our current agency was great — until iOS 14.5 and then things went south because they only knew how to do the one thing.”</p>
<p>True, we saw CPCs [cost per click] shoot up and CVR [conversion rate] plummet soon after iOS 14.5 came out just like every other growth marketing team on the planet. But what allows us to scale is the same thing that allowed us to get every one of our clients back on track post-iOS 14.5: fearlessness, curiosity and adeptness.</p>
<p><b>Why did you choose to have an in-house creative team?</b></p>
<p>Ad creative is truly distinct from brand creative and, simply, we had a heck of a time finding agencies or even freelancers that could produce content optimized for ad channels on a tight budget and an efficient timeline.</p>
<p>Around the same time that this problem started to hinder our ability to quickly and efficiently optimize our campaigns, there were a handful of founders that reached out looking for a growth marketing team that could drive revenue growth and also validate/battle test their messaging and value props. So, we tried it out: We designed a few tests to measure the effectiveness of different value props, created visual assets that represented those in a clear, efficient way, measured the results and found that it all just clicked.</p>
<p>Long before ad creative was brought in-house, though, we had been working with a set of incredibly talented UX designers. Over the years, CRO became a much more tried-and-true element of our growth marketing strategies, and when the seeds of the ad creative team started to sprout, we knew that bringing creative in-house would anchor everything in place.</p>
<p><b>How has being a remote team fared out so far?</b></p>
<p>We’ve been a remote team since day one and this helps us be really thoughtful about ways we communicate internally and with our clients. Aside from setting the growth strategy for each company we work with, choosing the tools and executing tactics, we’ve learned how to be master communicators.</p>
<p>As a remote team, we’ve had to put a lot of time and energy into creating a culture rooted in transparency and authenticity. I like to think that this seeps into our client relationships, too. The more informed, honest and clear conversations we can have as a team and with our clients, the better work we will all do.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Banking as a service will change not just the way financial services apps are built and embedded into new platforms, but also the way in which consumers and businesses alike interact with their finances.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the last several years, a series of startups have emerged to cut through the complexity of launching financial services by offering technology that sits on top of partner banks’ infrastructure and enables developers to spin up bank accounts, payments and card capabilities through APIs.</p>
<p>These banking-as-a-service (BaaS) startups promise to offer fintech capabilities to other companies without them having to strike deals with partner banks, integrate with the banking core, or hire the technical or compliance personnel necessary to test or launch a new financial product.</p>
<p>As a result, it’s never been faster or easier to launch a fintech app or add a banking component to an existing vertical SaaS business. To get a better understanding of the problem BaaS providers are trying to solve, we spoke with several founders in this space, including Unit CEO Itai Damti, Bond CEO Roy Ng, and Synctera CEO Peter Hazlehurst, among others.</p>
<h2>Cutting through the complexity of financial services</h2>
<p>In the early days of the fintech market, startups were largely on their own when building or launching a new financial services app. Bringing a new financial product to market typically meant finding a bank partner and signing a long-term contract, creating and implementing compliance policies with that bank, and then finally building out the tech needed to support whatever financial app or service you were looking to offer to end users.</p>
<p>For startups, that meant large upfront investments of time and money just to lay the groundwork for launching a new product long before establishing product-market fit. It also meant a lot of duplicative work not just by startups to build up the necessary infrastructure needed to launch a financial product, but also between banks as they signed up and offered fintech partners access to their banking systems.</p>
<p>“The amount of work and pain that is involved in launching even something simple, even just checking accounts &#8212; you need to navigate the partner ecosystem of 30 to 40 banks that don&#8217;t always understand your business, then you need to write 15 to 20 compliance policies and operationalize them,” said Unit founder and CEO Itai Damti.</p>
<p>Now a lot of that complexity can be outsourced to BaaS companies that already have the bank relationships, APIs for embedding financial services into their apps and the ability to run compliance programs on behalf of their customers. And venture capitalists have lined up to fund them, including rounds announced by companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/rize-raises-11-4m-to-scale-its-embedded-fintech-service/">Rize ($11.4 million)</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fin-vc-leads-33m-series-a-for-synctera-which-wants-to-pair-fintechs-with-banks/">Synctera ($33 million)</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/unit-raises-51m-in-accel-led-series-b-to-grow-its-banking-as-a-service-platform/">Unit ($51 million)</a> over just the last three months.</p>
<p>But who benefits from working with a BaaS provider?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Interstate 45 in Texas, a billboard with &#8220;Aurora&#8221; emblazoned at the top in giant white letters offers a cryptic message: &#8220;A new way to drive is on the horizon.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know just how many of the thousands of drivers on this stretch of road know what that means or what Aurora is; the autonomous vehicle technology company is hardly a household name even as it (along with several competitors) aims to forever change how people and packages get from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>But Aurora, which plans to join the public markets via a merger with a blank-check company, placed the spotlight on its products this week, inviting reporters, analysts, and partners like PACCAR, Toyota and Volvo, as well as existing and potential new investors to ride in its autonomous trucks and get a closer view of its tech. It also shared an update on its operations, including that it is beginning to map and test a new route in Texas.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8220;Aurora Illuminated&#8221; event was held at an auspicious time for the company. Aurora, which was founded in 2017 by Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell and Chris Urmson, has more than doubled in size to more than 1,600 employees in less than a year through its acquisition of Uber&#8217;s self-driving unit.</p>
<p>It is now on the precipice of becoming a publicly traded company with an implied valuation of $13 billion through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners Y. That deal, which was announced in July and confirmed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">TechCrunch&#8217;s earlier reporting</a>, is expected to go to a shareholder vote this year. If approved, Aurora will make its public debut on the Nasdaq shortly after. The company has not disclosed either of these dates.</p>
<p>To say that Aurora has officially &#8220;made it&#8221; would be presumptive and premature. But the company has navigated a number of hurdles — notably raising considerable capital, securing key partnerships and ramping up testing — that puts it on the path toward commercialization. And it has made material progress in the competitive autonomous trucking landscape where other well-funded and partnered companies &#8212; such as Waymo and publicly traded TuSimple and smaller startups like Gatik and Kodiak Robotics &#8212; are playing.</p>
<h2>Progress report</h2>
<p>Aurora first landed in Texas a year ago. Today, it&#8217;s using its autonomous trucks (always with two safety drivers) to carry loads for Barcel, the Takis spicy chips and snacks manufacturer, along a route in Texas between its Dallas, Palmer and Houston terminals. The company also began to carry freight for FedEx between Dallas and Houston as part of a pilot program announced earlier this month. Paccar trucks that are equipped with Aurora&#8217;s technology will be used multiple times a week to complete the nearly 500-mile route along Interstate 45, according to FedEx.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The plan is to add more terminals in El Paso and San Antonio, then stretch west to Phoenix and Los Angeles, south to Laredo and east to New Orleans. The network that Aurora envisions will encompass the Western and Eastern seaboards and eventually the entire country.</p>
<p>Aurora has not shared when it expects to move beyond Texas. It just started testing — without freight — the 630-mile route between El Paso and Dallas.</p>
<p>On the routes where it is hauling goods, the company has always delivered within the allotted time frame, according to co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s awesome and an exciting example of operational excellence,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson said in an interview at the event. &#8220;Over the longer term, because we won&#8217;t have the hours-of-service limitations when we&#8217;re able to operate our vehicles without drivers on board — that when there is a dramatic leap forward.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The ride</h2>
<p>The ride, which TechCrunch took twice, began in the parking lot of its South Dallas Terminal in Palmer, Texas.</p>
<p>The truck is a Peterbilt 579 integrated with Aurora&#8217;s autonomous vehicle system and customized in partnership with Paccar. The system, which the company has dubbed the &#8220;Aurora Driver,&#8221; includes cameras, radar and a combination of long- and medium-range light detection and ranging radar sensors referred to as lidar.  The long-range lidar was developed in-house after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/fresh-off-a-530m-round-aurora-acquires-lidar-startup-blackmore/">acquisition of Blackmore</a>. (Aurora has since acquired a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/aurora-acquires-a-second-lidar-company-in-push-to-bring-self-driving-trucks-to-the-road/">second lidar company,</a> OURS Technology. The medium-range lidar sensors are from an undisclosed supplier.</p>
<p>A massive computer with cooling units sits in the rear of the cabin. Other displays, including one that shows the vehicle in motion, its intended path and image classifications made along the way, are also in the cabin. Two safety operators are in the vehicle. The so-called pilot holds a commercial truck driver&#8217;s license, or CDL, and the co-pilot is there watching and calling out the intended path as well as acting as a spotter for other vehicles, pedestrians or objects in the road.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t just see them as testers; they give us a ton of really good guidance and advice not just in the technology and how they&#8217;re feeling it, but also the rules of the road&#8221; Lia Theodosiou-Pisanelli, Aurora&#8217;s VP of partners and programs, said during a safety briefing prior to entering the truck. &#8220;For example, a truck driver wouldn&#8217;t do that, you take a wide turn, this is how you do it, this is how you operate, this is what other drivers are going to expect. They also have a really good understanding of customer expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p>All operators, which are employees of Aurora and not contract workers, go through weeks of training on vehicle controls, defensive driving and putting them through scenarios on a closed track. Twelve &#8220;pilots&#8221; have gone through the training, which takes between six and eight weeks, and are in trucks today. Others are in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Both test rides began with the truck driving autonomously from the terminal lot to a frontage road, where it then took an on-ramp onto Interstate 45. The truck traveled along 45 about 13 miles before exiting, turning left to travel under the freeway. After a stop sign, the truck took one more left to enter the interstate once more and head back to the terminal. The round trip was about 28 miles.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210883" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/File.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210883" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2210883 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/File.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="924" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/File.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/File.jpg?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/File.jpg?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/File.jpg?resize=768,355 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/File.jpg?resize=680,314 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/File.jpg?resize=1536,710 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/File.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2210883" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>While it&#8217;s difficult to provide a thorough assessment of AV tech in these kinds of demonstrations, it does provide a snapshot of the system and, importantly, what kind of &#8220;driver&#8221; a company is trying to develop.</p>
<p>In Aurora&#8217;s case, the company is taking a cautious approach. The truck will not exceed 65 miles per hour on the highway, even when the posted speed limit is 75 mph. The truck also stays in the far right lane except to provide space for a merging vehicle or to overtake slower ones. It also always moves to the other lane if a vehicle is stopped on the shoulder, per state law.</p>
<p>Aurora has also directed its safety operators to &#8220;disengage,&#8221; meaning to take over manual control, in active construction zones where workers are present, instances when emergency vehicles approach with lights activated, and amid any &#8220;crazy actors,&#8221; as Theodosiou-Pisanelli describes it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anytime we have a disengagement, it&#8217;s an experience we learn from,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We tell them to be proactive about disengaging; it doesn&#8217;t impact our ability to learn from that experience because we can put it through the simulator and see what the system would have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says it has already driven more than 4.5 million on-road miles, as well as billions of miles in its virtual testing suite.</p>
<p>During my ride, the safety operator took control once on a section along the frontage road as a pickup truck sitting in a driveway inched forward and appeared to be about to turn in front of the semi. For the remainder of the two rides, the truck did operate autonomously and smoothly, with one slightly more aggressive braking event when a slower vehicle moved in front of it.</p>
<h2>What they showed</h2>
<p>Underneath a temporary structure outfitted with slick lighting, carpet, seating and decor reminiscent of a Tesla reveal event, the company laid out its strategy and showed off prototypes and educational explainers of its technology, including its lidar and simulation. The aim was to indicate what is behind its plan to deploy<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an autonomous trucking business by late 2023 and ride-hailing in late 2024.</span></p>
<p>The company displayed two different vehicle prototypes that it says will ultimately deliver vehicles that move goods and people autonomously through the world. They showed the Volvo VNL truck, a design prototype of Volvo&#8217;s first autonomous truck, intended for commercial production. On-road testing of the VNL will begin in 2022.</p>
<p>Aurora also displayed its AV-ready Toyota Sienna prototype that is intended for mass production. Aurora is integrating its AV system into the vehicle and will have a testing fleet of about a dozen vehicles out for testing and validation in Pittsburgh, the San Francisco Bay Area and Texas, the company said.</p>
<h2>The road ahead</h2>
<p>Aurora was not ready to talk about future partners. But strategically speaking, Anderson noted that the market is huge, that &#8220;there are a lot of players, and we&#8217;re talking to many of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pair did weigh in on teleassistance technology, <span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is when humans in an off-site location monitor and then can send path planning instructions to the autonomous vehicle if needed,</span> that they haven&#8217;t discussed in detail before.</p>
<p>&#8220;From day one, we&#8217;ve thought teleassist would be part of the technology,&#8221; Urmson said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve modeled at a pretty fine granularity what happens in and around terminals,&#8221; Anderson said of its progress to date, noting that it has every step charted out. “So we have a pretty strong understanding of what the end-to-end support requirement is. What we don&#8217;t have quite yet is how frequently we&#8217;re going to require a teleassistance event or roadside assistance when we don&#8217;t have a driver in the truck.”</span></p>
<p>Urmson and Anderson confirmed that the company is testing a teleassist technology on a closed track and public roads and will be working with its partners to determine the best approach for commercial operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The NFT space has had quite the year, and while it can be difficult to separate the billions of dollars in crypto speculation from the potential infrastructure shifts, plenty of mainstream tech companies are dipping their toes into the space and signaling future interest.</p>
<p>This time it&#8217;s TikTok&#8217;s turn. The fast-growing social media platform, which just crossed 1 billion monthly users worldwide, has lined up its own NFT drop, leveraging content from some of its top creators, including Lil Nas X, Grimes, Bella Poarch, Rudy Willingham and Gary Vaynerchuk. The release of one-of-one and limited edition NFTs seems to be focused on generating buzz among the existing NFT community rather than exposing users inside the app to non-fungible tokens.</p>
<p>The company is side-stepping blockchain energy concerns by placing their NFTs on a dedicated site powered by Immutable X, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum which says that NFTs traded using it are &#8220;100% carbon neutral.&#8221; The drop starts October 6 with a collection from Lil Nas X and will continue on through the end of the month.</p>
<p>Why is TikTok getting into the world of NFTs to begin with? TikTok has a fairly precise answer for that on its <a href="https://tiktok.immutable.com/">drop site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Inspired by the creativity and innovation of the TikTok creator community, TikTok is exploring the world of NFTs as a new creator empowerment tool. NFTs are a new way for creators to be recognized and rewarded for their content and for fans to own culturally-significant moments on TikTok.</p>
<p>The creation that happens on TikTok helps drive culture and start trends that impact society. TikTok will bring something unique and groundbreaking to the NFT landscape by curating some of these cultural milestones and pairing them with prominent NFT artists.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s clearly a niche early experiment for the company, which hasn&#8217;t previously indicated the same level of NFT interest that platforms like Twitter and Facebook have shown, but it also showcases that they think NFTs are a space worth paying some attention to.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse announced today that it is unveiling four new features: Clips, Replay, Universal Search and spatial audio for Android (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/29/clubhouse-spatial-audio/">already exists</a> on iOS). All of these features will launch today, except for Replay, which will roll out in October. These additions will help expand Clubhouse&#8217;s reach by making content available even after a live conversation has ended, allowing for asynchronous engagement.</p>
<p>Clips will allow live listeners in public rooms to snip the most recent 30 seconds of audio and share it anywhere &#8212; so, if you&#8217;re listening to a speaker who says something particularly wise (or not), you can create a clip, which generates a shareable moment with a link to join the room. These can be shared on other social media platforms. Hosts can decide whether or not they want listeners to be able to make clips in their room &#8212; if clips are turned on, users will be able to tap a scissor icon to make one.</p>
<p>Clubhouse already acknowledges that there&#8217;s a danger in letting people share 30-second audio clips out of context. A bad actor could potentially clip audio to obscure what someone really meant (you might say &#8220;the museum is always free on Friday,&#8221; but the clip could stop at &#8220;the museum is always free&#8221; &#8212; of course, Clubhouse is concerned about more sinister examples than this). So, to begin, Clubhouse is rolling out clips in beta to a small group of creators. Clubhouse has <a href="https://twitter.com/clubhouse/status/1383935475333820417?lang=en">struggled</a> with <a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/on-community-moderation/">content moderation</a> in its short history, and recently, doctors have been reportedly <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypm5/doctors-are-being-forced-off-clubhouse-by-anti-vax-harassment">forced off the app</a> due to harassment from anti-vaxxers. In light of these challenges, it makes sense that Clubhouse is more slowly unveiling this feature.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210804" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210804" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210804" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="451" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png 5940w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=1536,1019 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=2048,1358 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clips-static.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210804" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clubhouse</p></div></p>
<p>Universal Search improves discoverability on Clubhouse, so that when users type a keyword or name into the search bar, they can find relevant rooms (both live and scheduled), people, clubs and bios. And Clubhouse says it&#8217;s bringing Spatial Audio to Android after positive feedback from iOS users. But even amid these feature updates, Clubhouse still has made itself <a href="http://forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-a-club-so-exclusive-it-excludes-disabled-people-by-design/?sh=eb02d9c60082">inaccessible</a> to deaf and hard of hearing users by failing to add live captioning.</p>
<p>Of these new features, Replay could be the biggest game-changer for the app &#8212; it will allow creators to record a room, save it to their profile and club, or download the audio to share it externally, like on a podcast feed. Hosts and moderators can choose whether or not they want the room to be recorded.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, former PayPal COO David Sacks launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/callin-david-sacks-social-podcasting-app-launches-and-announces-a-12m-series-a-round/">Callin</a>, a &#8220;social podcasting&#8221; app that functions like a Clubhouse live audio room, but allows users to save and edit recordings into podcasts through the app. Then, Twitter said it would add <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">recorded Spaces</a> too. Now, Clubhouse&#8217;s Replay feature will make it more competitive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though Clubhouse has tried to appeal to live audio creators through its &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/clubhouse-promises-its-accelerator-participants-either-brand-deals-or-5k-per-month-during-the-program/">Creator First</a>&#8221; program, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696403/clubhouse-creators-first-sponsorship-program">reports suggest</a> that the endeavor fell short of expectations. But if Clubhouse wants to appeal to creators, this easier way of saving and sharing audio can help keep hosts on the platform. Though the appeal of apps like Clubhouse is the ability to have a shared, live experience, allowing for asynchronous listening can help people grow their audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korean internet service provider SK Broadband, a subsidiary of South Korean telco company SK Telecom, has filed a counterclaim against Netflix to demand payment for the bandwidth the streaming platform has used for the last three years.</p>
<p>This case comes in the wake of the South Korean court <a href="https://telecoms.com/510357/netflix-ordered-to-pay-for-network-usage-in-korea/">siding against Netflix in June</a> in the case. Now SK Broadband is empowered to levy network usage fees on streaming platforms for consuming an excessive amount of bandwidth and causing heavy traffic on its network.</p>
<p>“We will review the claim that SK Broadband has filed against us. In the meantime, we continue to seek open dialogue and explore ways of working with SK Broadband in order to ensure a seamless streaming experience for our shared customers,” a Netflix spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The U.S. streaming giant lodged an appeal to a higher court against the court decision in July after it lost the first court case that the company filed in 2020. That case alleged that SK Broadband, which is responsible for managing its networks, has no right to demand fees for the bandwidth. Netflix has claimed that the ISP was trying to &#8220;double bill&#8221; &#8212; its subscribers already pay for broadband use, and now want to charge the streaming company for it, too.</p>
<p>SK Broadband plans to charge about $23 million per year for network use, as per local media reports.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, SK Broadband requested the Korea Communication Commission come to a settlement, but the two companies couldn’t find an agreement.</p>
<p>SK Broadband claims that Netflix’s traffic on the ISP network has exponentially increased about 24 times, from 50 Gigabits per second in May 2018 to 1,200 Gigabits in September 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-korea-the-story-so-far">Netflix says</a> on 28 September that its investment in content production in South Korea has brought socio-economic impact worth $4.7 billion, covering everything from publishing to consumer goods. It claims to have led to the creation of 16,000 jobs in the country since it opened in 2016, using figures from a Deloitte Consulting <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CsnPesZ6dzrE7lDHVxqdceHF554Vo2_o/view">report</a>. Netflix Korea has 3.8 million paid subscriptions in South Korea as of the end of 2020, while its global paid memberships were estimated at 200 million, as per the report by Deloitte Consulting.</p>
<p>The Netflix spokesperson said on a separate note that the Korean show “Squid Game” is now on track to be <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-making-of-a-global-sensation-the-journey-to-creating-squid-game">Netflix’s biggest show</a> ever and it’s the first Korean show to ever be No. 1 on Netflix U.S.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another global streaming giant, Disney Plus, is set to launch in South Korea in November. Disney Plus reportedly plans to use third-party content delivery networks (CDNs) instead of using ISP’s networks to avoid the bandwidth usage fees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last night, Facebook published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">two annotated slide decks</a> in an attempt to contextualize the documents that The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline">Wall Street Journal</a> published this month, which reported evidence that the company is aware of its negative impact on teen mental health. These documents were released in anticipation of today&#8217;s Senate hearing on the mental health harms of Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/">Committee on Commerce, Science, &amp; Transportation</a> questioned Facebook Global Head of Security Antigone Davis over two and a half hours, but lawmakers grew frustrated with Davis&#8217; reticence to answer their questions directly, or provide much information that hasn&#8217;t been written in Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/explaining-research-to-support-families/">blog posts</a> <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/">rebuking</a> the WSJ reports.</p>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you on a perfectly curated background,&#8221; Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn chided Davis. &#8220;It looks beautiful coming across the screen. I wish the messages that you were giving us were equally as attractive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis insisted that research from Facebook and Instagram has shown eight out of 10 young people say they have a neutral positive experience on the app, and that her team wants 10 out of 10 young users to have a good experience. But Senators pushed back with other findings from Facebook&#8217;s own data, like the fact that among teenagers with suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users and 6% of American users said they could trace those thoughts to Instagram. Senator Richard Blumenthal (who serves as Chair of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security) said that his office did their own research by creating an account pretending to be a 13-year-old girl. Senator Blumenthal said they followed &#8220;easily findable accounts associated with extreme dieting and eating disorders.&#8221; Within a day, he said, the account&#8217;s recommendations were solely composed of accounts promoting self-harm and disordered eating.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&#8220;That is the perfect storm that Instagram has fostered and created. Facebook has asked us to trust it. But after these evasions and these revelations, why should we?&#8221; Senator Blumenthal asked.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7kOQ8BxzqG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">Seeking to respin Instagram&#8217;s toxicity for teens, Facebook publishes annotated slide decks</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Seeking to respin Instagram&#8217;s toxicity for teens, Facebook publishes annotated slide decks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/embed/#?secret=7kOQ8BxzqG" data-secret="7kOQ8BxzqG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But in the midst of filibustering tactics that fit right in on the Senate floor (&#8220;We&#8217;re pretty good at filibustering in the Senate, too,&#8221; Senator Klobuchar told Davis), the Facebook Global Head of Safety did elaborate on some of the company&#8217;s plans to improve young users&#8217; experience, which Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1442461241289555977">previously mentioned</a> on Twitter.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Young people indicated that when they saw uplifting content or inspiring content, that could move them away from some other issues that they&#8217;re struggling with,&#8221; Davis said at the hearing. &#8220;So one of the things that we&#8217;re actually looking at is called &#8216;nudges,&#8217; where we would actually nudge someone who we saw potentially rabbit-holing down content towards more uplifting or inspiring content.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to a &#8220;nudges&#8221; feature, Davis said that the company is looking at a &#8220;take a break&#8221; feature, which would encourage users to stop looking at the app if they&#8217;ve been browsing certain content for too long. In 2018, Instagram introduced a &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/02/instagram-do-not-disturb/">you&#8217;re all caught up</a>&#8221; notice, which would appear when the user had scrolled through all posts from the last two days. This feature was introduced alongside &#8220;do not disturb&#8221; toggles, which helped users control when they wanted to receive notifications. These updates were part of &#8220;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/01/facebook-and-instagram-time-well-spent-features.html">Time Well Spent</a>&#8221; initiatives, designed to curb screen time and encourage healthier social media habits. But by 2020, the space beneath the &#8220;caught up&#8221; notice was turned into a feed of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/instagram-finds-new-ad-space-at-the-end-of-your-feed-with-launch-of-suggested-posts-feature/">suggested posts and ads</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At the hearing, Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey (a <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/10/30/how-to-make-an-old-politician-a-tiktok-sensation/">social media star</a> in his own right) announced that he would <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-rep-castor-reintroduce-legislation-to-protect-children-and-teens-from-online-manipulation-and-harm">reintroduce</a> legislation with Senator Blumenthal called the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3411/text">KIDS (Kids Internet Design and Safety) Act</a>, which seeks to create new protections for online users under 16. The bill would prohibit platforms directed at children from leveraging follower and like counts, push alerts that encourage users to use the app more, auto-play settings, badges that award elevated levels of engagement, or any design feature that unfairly encourages a user (&#8220;due to their age or inexperience,&#8221; the bill specifies) to make purchases, submit content, or spend more time on a platform.</p>
<p>Previously <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-introduce-first-of-its-kind-legislation-to-protect-children-online-from-harmful-content-design-features_">introduced</a> in March 2020, Facebook has known about the proposed legislation for almost a year and a half.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our company has made its position really well known that we believe it&#8217;s time for the update of internet regulations, and we&#8217;d be happy to talk to and work with you on that,&#8221; Davis told Senator Markey.</p>
<p>But when Markey directly asked if Facebook would support the KIDS Act, Davis said that Facebook would follow up on the question later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, your company has had this legislation in your possession for months. And you&#8217;re testifying here today before the committee that would have to pass this legislation,&#8221; said Senator Markey. &#8220;I just feel that delay and obfuscation is the legislative strategy of Facebook, especially since Facebook has spent billions of dollars on a marketing campaign calling on Congress to pass internet regulations, and Facebook purports to be committed to children&#8217;s well being.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the hearing, Davis said that she hopes the Senate will have hearings with companies that have kid-focused apps, like TikTok and YouTube. Currently, Facebook has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/messenger-kids-adds-expanded-parental-controls-details-how-much-kids-data-facebook-collects/">Messenger Kids</a> app, but the company but its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/daily-crunch-facebook-pauses-plans-to-release-instagram-app-for-kids/">Instagram for kids</a> product on hold in light of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-instagram-kids-tweens-attract-11632849667">WSJ&#8217;s reporting</a>. Though WSJ has published<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840"> six leaked documents</a> from Facebook, the company itself only annotated and re-published two of them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos just can’t get away from labor issues. The beleaguered billionaire, who has faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-begin-historic-vote-to-unionize/">repeated and persistent criticism over working conditions at the company he formerly led, Amazon,</a> is now facing allegations of a hostile work environment at his space company Blue Origin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past">An essay jointly composed by 21 current and former employees</a> paints a vivid picture of Blue Origin’s work culture as one marred by sexual harassment, in which professional disagreement is stifled, environmental concerns are left unaddressed and speed of execution takes precedence over human safety.</p>
<p>The sole named author of the essay is Alexandra Abrams, who worked at Blue Origin for two years and six months, according to her LinkedIn profile. Abrams eventually became the head of employee communications during her tenure at the company. “I would say to Jeff that I really wished he was the person we all thought he was, and that Blue Origin was the company we all thought it was going to be,” she said in an interview to CBS Morning on Thursday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Alexandra Abrams, a former head of employee communications for Blue Origin, is speaking out against the company to <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurieSegall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LaurieSegall</a>.</p>
<p>“You cannot create a culture of safety and a culture of fear at the same time. They are incompatible.” <a href="https://t.co/JHuFY3cjcs">pic.twitter.com/JHuFY3cjcs</a></p>
<p>— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSMornings/status/1443553601851322372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, a Blue Origin spokesperson said that Abrams “was dismissed for cause two years ago after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the spokesperson added. “We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct.”</p>
<p>Federal export control regulations restrict the exportation of certain goods and technology outside the U.S. At the time of publication, Blue Origin did not specify any further details related to Abrams’ departure from the company.</p>
<p>The essay couldn’t have been published at a worse time for Blue Origin, which is currently mired in a lawsuit against NASA over the agency’s awarding of a sole lunar lander contract to SpaceX. Blue Origin, which submitted its own bid, has been on the offensive ever since, disputing the contract on social media and to a major government accountability office. That office <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">dismissed Blue’s complaint</a>.</p>
<p>The essay alleges that safety took a backseat to the so-called billionaire space race, marked this summer by two trips to orbit by Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson and Bezos himself in July. The essay further claims that company leaders expressed a goal of hitting more than 40 launches of BO’s New Shepard spacecraft per year &#8212; a breakneck pace that the essay writers say did not match available staffing and resources.</p>
<p>“In the opinion of an engineer who has signed on to this essay, ‘Blue Origin has been lucky that nothing has happened so far,’ ” the essay says. “Many of this essay’s authors say they would not fly on a Blue Origin vehicle.”</p>
<p>A series of accusations detailed in the letter also allege a culture of sexism amongst numerous senior executives, including one in CEO Bob Smith’s “loyal inner circle” whom the essay claims was reported to Human Resources numerous times for sexual harassment.</p>
<p>The essay says that women at the company would warn new female hires regarding another senior executive’s inappropriate behavior, which included making inquiries into female employees’ dating lives and referring to them using diminutives like “sweetheart” or “baby girl.”</p>
<p>“It appeared to many of us that he was protected by his close personal relationship with Bezos—it took him physically groping a female subordinate for him to finally be let go,” the essay says.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine this essay not affecting Blue Origin’s bottom line. After the successful launch of New Shepard in August, in which Bezos and three others went to space during an 11-minute flight, the company intends to start welcoming more paying customers on flights.</p>

<p>That the majority of the letter writers chose to stay anonymous could be explained, at least in part, by the stifling new contracts employees were requested to sign in 2019, which included non-disparagement clauses, according to the essay.</p>
<p>The letter appears to have caught the attention of the Federal Aviation Administration, who told TechCrunch, &#8220;The FAA takes every safety allegation seriously, and the agency is reviewing the information.&#8221;<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Blue Origin regarding the other allegations in the letter and will update the story if they respond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok this week presented its new plan to ramp up advertiser investment in its video platform with the expansion of e-commerce, a new promise of &#8220;brand safety&#8221; and the launch of several new and interactive ad formats, ranging from clickable stickers to &#8220;Choose Your Own Adventure&#8221;-type ads to &#8220;super likes&#8221; and more. The additions, the company says, will make TikTok&#8217;s advertising more interactive and creative, much like the TikTok experience itself.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/enter-tiktok-world-and-meet-the-next-era-of-marketing">demonstrated</a> its new additions at an online conference aimed at the advertising and marketing community on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Here, TikTok also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">several new e-commerce partnerships </a>beyond its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">pilot partner Shopify</a> to make online shopping a more native experience, with the ability for users to go from product discovery to checkout without leaving the app. It noted it&#8217;s making live shopping available to brands and offered several ad products made just for e-commerce brands. And, in some markets, TikTok is offering to take on the responsibilities of shipping and fulfillment, as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok&#8217;s broader ads business is getting a jolt with the launch of several new products designed with the goal of making TikTok better differentiated from other social media rivals.</p>
<p>On this front, TikTok introduced a new product called &#8220;instant page,&#8221; which is a quick-loading landing page that the company claims will load 11 times faster than a typical mobile website. This allows a user who clicks through on an ad to be immediately taken to a page where they&#8217;ll be able to see more information from the brand, watch more videos and swipe through other content &#8212; all without leaving the TikTok app. This could compete with Instagram&#8217;s Link Sticker which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/instagram-is-ditching-swipe-up-links-in-favor-of-stickers/">recently stepped in</a> to replace the swipe-up gesture in its app.</p>

<p>Another new product, &#8220;pop out showcase,&#8221; aims to make engaging with ads a more interactive experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With &#8220;pop out showcase,&#8221; advertisers can access a library of stickers and images that can be superimposed on top of their TikTok videos to illustrate the products they&#8217;re demonstrating or other key story elements. For instance, a beauty brand may add a sticker of a makeup brush to its content that, when tapped, takes the viewer to a page where they can buy a makeup brush from the brand.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210686" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210686" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210686" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg 2662w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.44.56-PM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210686" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (pop out showcase)</p></div></p>
<p>Other new formats encourage TikTok users to tap on the ads themselves.</p>
<p>One of these is TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;super like.&#8221; This offers a way to make &#8220;liking&#8221; a video a more engaging experience. When users tap the like (heart) button on a TikTok video, the Super Like can display different types of icons that appear on viewers&#8217; screens. Users are also invited to visit a landing page where they can learn more about the brand&#8217;s product or service being featured.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210689" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210689" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2210689" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?w=438" alt="" width="438" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg 1084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=97,150 97w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=193,300 193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=768,1192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=438,680 438w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=990,1536 990w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210689" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (super like)</p></div></p>
<p>There are also gesture ads that will reveal rewards or other information to users who either slide or tap on videos. Like the &#8220;pop out showcase: and &#8220;super like,&#8221; these ads play to the familiarity that TikTok users &#8212; particularly its young Gen Z and millennial demographic &#8212; have with how to navigate their smartphones. It&#8217;s second nature for younger people to know to tap, swipe and drag, and these ads offer some form of immediate gratification for doing so, whether that&#8217;s an explosion of icons or even a real-life reward.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210684" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210684" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2210684" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?w=399" alt="" width="399" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg 978w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=88,150 88w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=176,300 176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=768,1308 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=399,680 399w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=902,1536 902w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.31-PM.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210684" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (gesture ads)</p></div></p>
<p>The final new product is TikTok&#8217;s &#8220;storytime tool,&#8221; which encourages users to become a part of the brand&#8217;s storytelling experience. Some streaming services, like Hulu, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/hulu-to-debut-new-ad-formats-in-2020-focused-on-letting-users-make-choices-transact-with-advertisers/">have experimented with ads</a> that ask the users to play along &#8212; but not quite to the extent of controlling the story. Instead of just watching a TikTok ad, this &#8220;Choose Your Own Adventure&#8221;- style format lets users tap to direct the action in the video to shape the narrative and personalize the outcome.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210690" style="width: 403px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210690" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2210690" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?w=393" alt="" width="393" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg 962w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=173,300 173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=768,1330 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=393,680 393w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=887,1536 887w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.46.03-PM.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210690" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (storytime tool)</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;All these solutions are a part of our goal to enable advertisers to create the most engaging ads in ways that taps into their creativity and fun that exists on the platform,&#8221; said Jaclyn Fitzpatrick, TikTok Product Strategist, Global Business Marketing, when introducing the new lineup.</p>
<p>Of course, performance and measurement capabilities are just as important to marketers as the ad creatives themselves. To address these concerns, the company touted its TikTok Ad Manager, editing suite, trends and insights, and other new tools for buying, scaling and analyzing their campaigns. It launched a new buying type called Reach &amp; Frequency, which allows advertisers to target a higher volume of users through extended reach, or get more impressions with the same number of users by opting into a higher frequency for their ad placements.</p>
<p>TikTok also made a commitment to brand safety &#8212; an issue <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/23/att-verizon-boycott-google-ads/">that&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/youtube-faces-brand-freeze-over-ads-and-obscene-comments-on-videos-of-kids/">plagued</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/21/after-youtube-boycott-google-pulls-ads-from-more-types-of-offensive-content/">YouTube</a> in the past &#8212; with the launch of a proprietary brand safety inventory filter.</p>
<p>The solution leverages machine learning technology to classify a video&#8217;s risk based on the video&#8217;s content, text, audio and more, so advertisers can make decisions about which kind of inventory they want to run adjacent to, the company explained. TikTok says the new filter is aligned with the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM)&#8217;s industry framework and it partnered with Integrate Ad Science (IAS), Zefr and OpenSlate to help it to ensure ads run next to brand-safe content.</p>
<p>The message to advertisers, clearly, is that TikTok should be considered not only because of its sizable audience &#8212; now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">1 billion monthly actives,</a> it says &#8212; but also because of its advertising toolset.</p>
<p>To date, marketers haven&#8217;t carved out as much of their spending for TikTok compared with other major platforms, like Facebook and Instagram. But TikTok parent company ByteDance has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-owner-bytedances-annual-revenue-jumps-to-34-3-billion-11623903622">been making inroads in the global ad market</a>, with annual revenue across its apps more than doubling in 2020 to reach $34.3 billion. In the U.S., TikTok was expected to bring in $500 million in 2020, up from $200-$300 million in the year prior, according to a report by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktoks-u-s-revenues-expected-to-hit-500-million-this-year">The Information.</a> (Some of that is from <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-revenue-75-million">in-app purchases</a>, of course.)</p>
<p>As TikTok has scaled its ad business, its ad prices have been steadily increasing, too. Bloomberg noted this summer it was jacking up home page takeover ads, its most valuable real estate, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/tiktok-is-jacking-up-prices-as-it-builds-its-ad-business?sref=gni836kR">to more than $2 million</a> on top days &#8212; like holidays. Reuters also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tiktoks-us-ad-business-roars-back-trumps-threats-recede-2021-02-16/">noted</a> that TikTok saw a 500% increase in the number of advertisers that were running campaigns in the U.S. from the start of 2020 to the end, though ad sales were still small compared with other major platforms.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210742" style="width: 620px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210742" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2210742" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?w=680" alt="" width="610" height="604" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png 1020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=300,297 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=768,760 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=680,673 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210742" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> eMarketer</p></div></p>
<p>That continues to be the case in 2021, as TikTok&#8217;s U.S. ad revenues are dwarfed by other social brands. In fact, TikTok was not even broken out in eMarketer&#8217;s recent tabulation of U.S. ad revenues, where it&#8217;s instead lumped into an &#8220;Other&#8221; category with other, smaller social networks (like Tumblr) which, combined, are expected to reach $1.3 billion in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All kinds of teams are raising venture funds these days, so don&#8217;t be surprised to see more investors from corporate venture firms decide to create their own outfits, too.</p>
<p>They might look to <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://counterpart.vc/">Counterpart Ventures </a>for inspiration. Founded by Patrick Eggen and Joe Saijo, the three-year-old, San Francisco-based outfit just closed a $110 million fund after investing a small amount across four companies as a kind of trial fund.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a decent amount of capital for a young outfit, but limited partners (who the firm isn&#8217;t naming) clearly like the partners&#8217; track records. Eggen launched Qualcomm Ventures&#8217;s Bay Area practice back in 2005, and when he left the outfit in the spring of 2018, he was the managing partner for all of North America.</p>
<p>While there are lots of reasons startups might want to hitch their wagon to Qualcomm &#8212; and Matterport, Noom and Cruise Automation are among those that did while Eggen was running the show &#8212; he does take some credit for persuading Qualcomm to invest in Zoom&#8217;s Series A round at a time when a lot of other venture firms didn&#8217;t see room for yet another video conferencing company in the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saijo is no slouch, either. After spending several years in business development at Hitachi, he later became the president and managing partner at Recruit Strategic Partners, the corporate arm of Japan&#8217;s Recruit Holdings. According to his bio, his most notable investments include Palo Alto Networks, DocuSign, 99designs, DataRobot, ShipBob and (along with Qualcomm Ventures) Noom.</p>
<p>Presumably, the networks of Eggen and Saijo were a draw for investors, too. Not only have they met hundreds &#8212; maybe thousands &#8212; of founders over their years in corporate VC, but corporate VC is its own not-so-little club, and the pair say they&#8217;ve actively fostered relationships with corporate venture arms, including hosting private events for the CVC community.</p>
<p>As for areas of focus, Counterpart &#8212; which is also run by senior associate Mikey Kailis &#8212; is focused on B2B SaaS, marketplace and mobility startups, and looks to lead or co-lead what it calls the “tweener” round, before a company&#8217;s Series A or Series B round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among its newest bets are <a href="http://www.cloudbeds.com/">Cloudbeds</a>, <a href="http://www.intricately.com/">Intricately</a> and<a href="http://www.prismosystems.com"> Prismo Systems</a>, deals it funded at the Series B, Series A and Series B stages, respectively.</p>

		Arthur Nobel is an entrepreneur turned investor, now working as principal at <a href="https://www.knight.capital/">Knight Capital</a> in Amsterdam, specializing in scaling companies. He started his career at Rocket Internet before holding various growth roles across Europe. Co-author of the book "Leaders of Growth," he also hosts its related podcast.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The T2D3 (triple, triple, double, double, double) acronym has become a well-known goal in the startup scene for achieving unicorn status. Formulating the goal can be easy, but realizing such tremendous revenue growth is notoriously difficult.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://dealroom.co/uploaded/2020/08/Probability-2.pdf">study</a> from Dealroom shows that about 16% of the companies that raise a seed round manage to raise a Series B investment, and only about 7% of those that raise seed funding raise a Series C investment.</p>
<p>This statistic is partially explained by a lack of a good organizational framework for scaling companies across seed to Series C. There is a lot of great content on the startup phase (getting to product-market fit) and success stories (raising hundreds of millions of dollars and multibillion dollar exits), but there is little available on how founders can grow a company from $1 million to $25 million in annual revenues (broadly defined as the Series A, B and C stages).</p>
<p>Based on 47 interviews with industry experts including Sean Ellis, Mark Roberge, Bill Macaitis, Micha Breakstone and Brian Requarth, desk research and our own experience as founders and investors in Series A to C companies, we have derived three major insights about how to scale a company from the organizational perspective. Here&#8217;s our framework:</p>
<h2>Scaling is a continuum with maturity stages</h2>
<p>A fast-scaling company with revenue of $5 million revenue has different scaling needs compared to a fast-scaling startup with $15 million in revenue. The concept of &#8220;maturity stages&#8221; for scaling a company can be useful to address the different needs.</p>
<p>The most common &#8220;maturity stages&#8221; of scaling a company are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ad hoc.</li>
<li>Basic process.</li>
<li>Repeatable process.</li>
<li>Predictable process.</li>
<li>At scale.</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2210543" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210543" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2210543" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png" alt="" width="1024" height="626" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png 1219w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png?resize=768,469 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/maturity-stages.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210543" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Knight Capital</p></div></p>
<p>Typically, for a seed-stage company, everything is developed in a more or less ad-hoc manner. At the Series A stage, it’s more about developing repeatable processes. Series B and C are about predictability of outcomes. Beyond Series C, it’s about doing everything at scale.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a companywide view. As we argue below, this can be different for individual departments. For example, a company at a &#8220;repeatability&#8221; stage that generates inbound leads through digital marketing efforts and has an enterprise sales department will often have a much more mature marketing department compared to sales.</p>
<p>The takeaway is to initially figure out in which stage your company and departments are in and only do what is required for that stage.</p>
<h2>The challenges to scaling</h2>
<p>You scale a company, from an organizational perspective, by overcoming numerous challenges. We believe that these challenges can be largely categorized into five buckets:</p>
<ol>
<li>KPIs and data.</li>
<li>People.</li>
<li>Documentation and enablement.</li>
<li>Processes.</li>
<li>Tooling.</li>
</ol>
<p>We believe it is best to approach these challenges on the departmental and subdepartmental levels to make it workable.</p>
<h3>KPIs and data</h3>
<p>Data-informed decision-making is particularly important in the T2D3 journey. It is important to realize that different KPIs are relevant at different stages. First, focus on the right metrics for your stage. An LTV:CAC metric (lifetime value to acquisition costs) is less relevant for a seed company than retention.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arctic-wolf-networks">Arctic Wolf</a>, a managed cybersecurity company that offers a “security operations-as-a-concierge” service, has acquired Habitu8, a security training and awareness content platform.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/arctic-wolf-series-f/">which comes just two months after Arctic Wolf secured $150 million in Series F funding</a> &#8212; were not announced, but a person with knowledge of the matter told TechCrunch that it was paid for with a combination of cash and equity. Arctic Wolf will acquire between 60 and 70 customers as a result of the takeover, the source added.</p>
<p>Habitu8 was co-founded in 2017 by Jason Hoenich, who previously led security training initiatives at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sony-pictures-entertainment/">Sony Pictures Entertainment</a>, Walt Disney and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/activision-blizzard/">Activision Blizzard</a>. The startup, which has completed three rounds of funding, takes a &#8220;Hollywood-style&#8221; approach to cybersecurity awareness, comprising live-action videos, which it claims has proven effective in fortifying the human element in security.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>As a result of the acquisition, Habitu8&#8217;s Learning Platform<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>will be combined with Arctic Wolf’s Managed Security Awareness offering (which the company tells TechCrunch has been delivered to “hundreds” of customers since it debuted in May this year) to create the industry’s first security awareness and training program delivered as a concierge service.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“We know that training and awareness programs are a cornerstone in ending cyber risk,” said Nick Schneider, president and CEO of Arctic Wolf. “Unfortunately, the content that most security programs offer is low-grade, often tedious, and ultimately doesn’t effectively serve the needs of modern users who expect on-demand and high-quality experiences like Netflix.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“With the addition of Habitu8 to the Arctic Wolf Platform, we will deliver modern, high-quality security awareness and training programs as a managed service, which, combined with our expert concierge guidance, will significantly strengthen customers’ overall security operations.”</p>
<p>Hoenich will also join the Arctic Wolf team as vice president of Service Delivery and will lead security awareness management and delivery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Data tells us that humans need ongoing, engaging and memorable content to retain and resonate with training concepts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am confident that combining the power of Arctic Wolf Managed Security Awareness and the Arctic Wolf Platform with our Hollywood-style content will make this the most effective and sought-after solution on the market for customers of all sizes.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Arctic Wolf&#8217;s takeover of Habitu8 is likely the first of many acquisitions on the company&#8217;s roadmap; in July, the company told TechCrunch that it plans to do &#8220;between five and 10 acquisitions&#8221; over the next 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kevin Ryan &#8212; the New York-based investor and entrepreneur who first rose to prominence as CEO of the early online ad business DoubleClick &#8212; could have launched or joined a traditional venture firm many years ago. Instead, he has launched one company after another with largely his own capital at the outset to get them going. Think Business Insider and Gilt Groupe, MongoDB and Zola.</p>
<p>Ryan is still at it, investing a $500 million evergreen fund with primarily personal capital through a growing team that also chips into the fund and helps him both fund startups as well as incubate them. Interestingly, despite that Ryan has no background in healthcare, more of those dollars have been moving into healthcare, too. His investment firm, <a href="https://alleycorp.com/">AlleyCorp</a>, has already made 20 healthcare-related bets in recent years. Now, it&#8217;s carving out $100 million for a new fund to double down on the sector.</p>
<p>The fund, chaired by Ryan, is being led by Brenton Fargnoli, M.D., a one-time resident physician at Brigham &amp; Women&#8217;s Hospital in Boston who was able to arrange a research elective with Flatiron Health back in 2015, which brought him to New York and into the world of entrepreneurship. (Fargnoli later did double duty, working as a medical director at Flatiron and also as an attending physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.)</p>
<p>Fargnoli is being joined by another M.D., Jeff De Flavio, a physician-entrepreneur who has launched numerous companies, including <a class="dy ie" href="http://www.jointempest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Tempest</a>, a holistic alcohol recovery program backed by AlleyCorp, and <a href="https://pearlhealth.com/">Pearl Health</a>, a primary care physicians group that he created inside of AlleyCorp and which just received <a href="https://pearlhealth.com/blog/pearl-strands/pearl-health-raises-18m-led-by-a16z-to-create-an-efficient-marketplace-for-healthcare-risk/">Series A backing</a> led by Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>The team also includes medical students Omar Njie and Sherman Leung, as well as Jane Suh, who previously worked at Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>We talked earlier this week with Fargnoli, who said the broad idea with the new fund is to focus on startups that are improving quality of care for patients, increasing access to care for patients and decreasing costs, writing initial checks of $1 million to $3 million.</p>
<p>We also talked at some length about the small but growing world of physician entrepreneurship, into which Fargnoli was himself pulled by Krishna Yeshwant, a physician, programmer, and general partner at GV who completed his own residency at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital, where he practiced for several years and where he apparently remains an inspiration to others. &#8220;Everyone knows Krishna,&#8221; said Fargnoli.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, he said that AlleyCorp now has nine &#8220;doctorpreneurs&#8221; across its portfolio and that Ryan, just before the pandemic, organized a gathering of 100 doctor physicians at his home. &#8220;It&#8217;s really part of this next generation [of healthcare] that merges the clinical with the tech,&#8221; noted Fargnoli.</p>
<p>Certainly, AlleyCorp isn&#8217;t alone in seeing a huge opportunity in healthcare and turning to physicians for help in both understanding underserved areas of their industries, as well as helping to suss out solutions. In addition to healthcare-focused funds that have for years brought doctors into the fold, generalist firms like Andreessen Horowitz have also been more aggressively hiring doctors into the firm. Among them: Vineeta Agarwala, one of a16z&#8217;s newer general partners, who still sees patients. She led the firm&#8217;s investment in Pearl Health, in fact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.voodoo.io">Voodoo</a> has made a significant acquisition in the casual mobile gaming market. The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.bbumgames.com">Beach Bum</a>, a game studio based in Israel and specialized in tabletop and card games.</p>
<p>It’s hard to get a clear number for this acquisition as Voodoo is offering both cash and shares and there are some retention bonuses. According to a source, Voodoo could be paying a few hundred million dollars in total. Beach Bum has generated $70 million in revenue over the past 12 months, so that gives you an idea of the size of the deal.</p>
<p>Voodoo is better known for its <a href="https://www.voodoo.io/games">hyper-casual games</a>, such as Helix Jump, Crowd City, Hole.io or Paper.io 2. The company is both a game developer and publisher. It partners with other game studios and has built a tech stack to optimize distribution, average revenue per user and more.</p>
<p>The company has raised money <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/tencent-takes-minority-stake-in-french-casual-games-maker-voodoo/">from Tencent</a> and Goldman Sachs. More recently, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert invested €266 million ($309 million at today’s exchange rate) in Voodoo. It values the company at €1.7 billion (nearly $2 billion).</p>
<p>Voodoo didn’t waste any time and started looking at acquisition targets for external growth opportunities right after raising some fresh capital. Right now, there are 350 people working for Voodoo. Beach Bum has 150 employees who will join Voodoo.</p>
<p>With today’s acquisition, Voodoo is expanding to a new segment, adding a handful of casual games to its hyper-casual catalog. Beach Bum currently has three games in the App Store — Backgammon (Lord of the Board), Spades Royale and Gin Rummy Stars.</p>
<p>The business model is also a bit different. Historically, Voodoo has mostly relied on advertising to monetize its games. Beach Bum focuses on in-app purchases instead. This way, the acquisition diversifies Voodoo’s revenue sources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“[Beach Bum] has two more games in development right now. The intention of Voodoo is to use Beach Bum as their entrance into in-app purchases. So I think they’ll want Beach Bum to put out as many games as possible,” Gigi Levy-Weiss told me.</p>
<p>Gigi Levy-Weiss is a general partner at VC firm <a href="https://www.nfx.com">NFX</a> and co-founded Beach Bum back in 2015. He doesn’t currently have an operational role at the gaming company but he is active chairman of the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Israeli gaming industry has grown significantly in the recent few years. To date, it counts 400 different companies. Few exits have taken place, mainly by European and Asian buyers. A few months ago, an Israeli gaming company <a href="https://www.playtika.com">Playtika</a> IPOed at Nasdaq for the valuation of $11B,&#8221; Avihai Michaeli, a senior investment banker based in Tel Aviv, told me.</p>

<p>With the announcement of today’s deal, Sony has acquired three studios in the past year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blockchain cybersecurity startup <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a> this morning announced a $23 million investment in <a href="https://forta.org/">Forta</a>, a security service aimed at smart contracts.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz led the round, which OpenZeppelin CEO and co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/demibrener">Demian Brener</a> described as 3x oversubscribed. The investment also attracted capital from Coinbase Ventures, True Ventures and Blockchain Capital, among others.</p>
<p>Per Brener, OpenZeppelin will retain a stake in Forta.</p>
<p>Forta is a neat project that comes at an interesting point for the larger blockchain community. When bitcoin came to market, it attracted interest as a potential medium of exchange, or perhaps a store of value. The latter use case wound up being the key bitcoin value offering. But while bitcoin was maturing, other blockchains were built that featured more native programmability, allowing developers around the world to leverage smart (self-executing) contracts for a host of use cases.</p>
<p>Ethereum is one of the best-known blockchains to feature smart contracts, which <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/">its foundation describes</a> simply as &#8220;program[s] that [run] on the Ethereum blockchain.&#8221; There&#8217;s more nuance to the matter, but that will suffice for our needs today. Forta, in turn, wants to help secure smart contracts across the blockchain market.</p>
<p>We summarized it as an attempt to build Web 3.0 security using Web 3.0 DNA when we were chatting with Brener, and he agreed. By that, we mean that Forta isn&#8217;t precisely the sort of company that TechCrunch tends to write about when it comes to venture capital fundraises; instead, Forta is nearly an attempt to empower a community of developers to build the tooling that they need to keep their own projects secure.</p>
<p>The heart of Forta, Brener explained, is a community of &#8220;agent writers,&#8221; or developers creating pieces of code that hunt up threats &#8212; on layer-one or -two chains, and sidechains &#8212; that fall into one of four main buckets of risk, namely cybersecurity, financial, operational or governance. The other half of the Forta project is nodes, or essentially what runs the agents themselves.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per OpenZeppelin, lots of the code used to write Forta agents will be repurposable, which could help code get written once and then deployed with variations to many chains. This is what Brener means when he thinks of Forta as helping developers in the larger blockchain world help themselves.</p>
<p>And the concept is not idle. Per a release from Forta, the team behind the project thinks that the &#8220;pace of innovation on public blockchains&#8221; is rapid enough that no &#8220;centralized solution can effectively address these evolving risks.&#8221; So, threats attacking the decentralized market will have to be solved, in Forta&#8217;s view, by even more decentralized activity.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was obviously curious how the Forta project would make money. Brener said that for the project to become a business, it will need to first help its community thrive. Part of that is opening its doors a little more today, allowing more developers than it did during its private beta to write agents.</p>
<p>Presuming that Forta can attract as many developers as it hopes, it will become a centralized source of smart contract security tooling. From that point, making money won&#8217;t be impossible, though it will be interesting to see precisely what business model Forta eventually chooses.</p>
<p>On the point of organizational centrality, Forta is today run by a set of folks. In time, the company could become a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, Brener said. If that bears out, the blockchain community will have managed to take external capital and internal knowledge, blended the two into a development community, and built not only security tooling for smart contracts, but managed to do so under the auspices of its own smart contract (DAO). So, this is at once a venture capital story and also a meta-moment for how far the crypto world has come in terms of taking care of itself.</p>
<p>I am sure that at some point in the above paragraphs I got something slightly wrong. Such is the risk of covering nascent efforts to build security tooling for the cutting-edges of the digital economy. But what matters more than any particular quibble is that the blockchain world is working to build the tools it needs to keep smart contracts safe; by doing so, using smart contracts should become less risky. And less risk means more market appetite.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something that a16z, with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/a16zs-new-2-2b-fund-wont-just-bet-on-the-crypto-future-it-will-defend-it/">huge crypto-focused bets</a>, and companies like Coinbase are more than in favor of. The dollars flowing toward Forta are a rounding error for its wealthy backers, even if its possible impact on their favorite market might be anything but.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In recent years, rows of electric scooters and bikes lining sidewalks have become a common sight in cities around the United States.</p>
<p>The size of the e-scooter market alone is expected <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-il/publications/2019/promise-pitfalls-e-scooter-sharing">to surpass</a> $40 billion by 2025, and Americans have taken more than <a href="https://nacto.org/shared-micromobility-2019/">342 million</a> trips on shared bikes and e-scooters since 2010.</p>
<p>Micromobility services generate a massive amount of mobility data, including potentially sensitive precise location data about users. Data from mobility services can provide valuable and timely insights to guide transportation and infrastructure policy, but the sharing of sensitive mobility data &#8212; between companies or between and with government agencies &#8212; can only be justified if issues of privacy and public trust are first addressed.</p>
<p>Innovative mobility options are providing cities with opportunities to solve the <a href="https://escooternerds.com/last-mile-transportation-electric-scooter/">last-mile transportation problem</a>, and the data from these services has a range of <a href="https://policydata.numo.global/">productive uses</a>.</p>
<p>It can help city planners design transportation improvements, such as protected bike lanes, to keep users safe. Access to mobility data gives community advocates and government officials the ability to know in nearly real time how many mobility devices are in a certain area so cities can enforce limits to ensure neighborhoods are not overcrowded or underserved. This data can also <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/">streamline communications</a> between companies and city governments, making it easier for mobility services to quickly adapt to events and emergencies in cities.</p>
<p>However, there are valid privacy concerns over the granularity and quantity of data that digitally enabled mobility services are able to collect and request to share with governments.</p>
<p>For example, a recent <a href="https://www.aclusocal.org/en/cases/sanchez-v-los-angeles-department-transportation">lawsuit</a> filed against the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and the City of Los Angeles alleges that the city’s collection of e-scooter trip data through the <a href="https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/">Mobility Data Specification</a> violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act. A lower court <a href="https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/2021/08/03/clinic-files-technologists-brief-in-ninth-circuit-scooter-privacy-case/">dismissed the lawsuit</a> and the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the ACLU of Northern and Southern California recently asked a federal appeals court to <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-aclu-urge-appeals-court-revive-challenge-los-angeles-collection-scooter-riders?s">revive it</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Additionally, a bill recently <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB859">introduced</a> in the California Legislature would require specific conditions to be met before mobility data is shared with public agencies or contractors. Under this bill, data could only be shared to assist transportation planning or protect the safety of users. The bill also requires that any trip data must be more than 24 hours old before being shared.</p>
<p>Near-real-time <a href="https://fpf.org/blog/a-closer-look-at-location-data-privacy-and-pandemics/">location data</a> is often required to fulfill valid safety and regulatory enforcement purposes, but this data is very sensitive because it could reveal intimate aspects of an individual’s life. Patterns in location data could indicate personal habits, interpersonal relationships or religious practices.</p>
<p>While it is possible in some cases to “de-identify” location data tied to a specific individual or device, it is incredibly difficult to truly make any data set of precise location history truly anonymous. Even highly aggregated location data about patterns of large groups of people can unintentionally reveal sensitive information.</p>
<p>In 2017, a “global heat map” of user movement in the Strava fitness app inadvertently <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/strava-heat-map-military-bases-fitness-trackers-privacy/">revealed the location</a> of deployed military personnel in classified locations. Location data, even when de-identified or aggregated, should be subject to checks and controls to ensure the data remains protected and private.</p>
<p>Local governments and mobility companies are taking these issues of user privacy seriously. Over the past few months, the<a href="https://fpf.org/"> Future of Privacy Forum</a> has worked with SAE’s <a href="https://mdc.sae-itc.com/">Mobility Data Collaborative</a> and public and private stakeholders to create a<a href="https://fpf.org/blog/fpf-and-mobility-data-collaborative-release-resources-to-help-organizations-assess-the-privacy-risks-of-sharing-of-mobility-data/"> transportation-tailored privacy assessment tool</a> that focuses on considerations for organizations that want to share mobility data in a privacy-sensitive manner.</p>
<p>The Mobility Data Sharing Assessment (MDSA) provides organizations in both the public and private sectors with operational guidance to conduct thoughtful, in-depth legal and privacy reviews of their data-sharing processes. Organizations that use this tool for sharing mobility data will be able to embed privacy and equity considerations into the design of mobility data-sharing agreements.</p>
<p>The goal of the MDSA is to enable responsible data sharing that protects individual privacy, respects community interests and equities, and encourages transparency to the public. By equipping organizations with an open-source, interoperable, customizable and voluntary framework that includes guidance, the barriers to sharing mobility data will be reduced.</p>
<p>This is the first version of the MDSA tool; it focuses specifically on ground-based mobility devices and location data. Some mobility vehicles like e-scooters now come equipped with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/19/e-scooter-pedestrian-detection-voi/">on-board cameras</a>, so in the future, the MDSA may be appended to add guidance about images and video collected by mobility devices.</p>
<p>The MDSA tool is open source and customizable, so organizations sharing this type of mobility data can edit it to consider the risks and benefits of sharing sensor or camera data that includes images.</p>
<p>Micromobility services can play a key role in improving access to jobs, food and health care. However, there are multiple factors for companies and government agencies to consider before sharing mobility data with other organizations, including the precision, immediacy and type of data shared. Organizations must assess these factors in a thoughtful, structured manner that considers any potential sources of bias.</p>
<p>That’s the key to using mobility data to maximize the benefits of services in the short term and build their infrastructure in the long term, allowing people to move about cities safer and faster.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">At last year&#8217;s inaugural <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633015242487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHor_VGE6KntM1F3I-krw4ZtxLP_g">Sight Tech Global </a>event, a virtual event dedicated to applications of AI and related tech to accessibility for people who are blind, one of the most popular sessions belonged to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saqibshaikh/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/saqibshaikh/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633015242487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtrz_VaQtePncD9TSRSG6Bq9B3PA">Saqib Shaikh</a>. The Microsoft engineer co-founded and leads the Seeing AI mobile app, which embeds a remarkable number of services beneficial to people who are blind, from reading documents and signs, to recognizing friends, grocery items, currency notes and even exploring photos by touch.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re delighted that Shaikh will make a return appearance at this year&#8217;s Sight Tech Global. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633015242487000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFYrWaYGskT0MQWNDjw1im9s8Cr-w">Register now</a> for the free, virtual event on December 1-2.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Shaikh describes his work as &#8220;a conversation between the blind community and the engineers/scientists at Microsoft &#8212; understanding the daily challenges our customers face and what emerging technologies could be leveraged to create novel solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the past year, Shaikh&#8217;s team has been adding features at a fast pace. Most recently they have created an audio augmented reality experience to assist with exploring an unfamiliar environment. It recognizes things in the world and places them in 3D space. When wearing headphones, items will be announced from their position in the room, such as the word &#8220;chair&#8221; coming from the chair itself. Users can place virtual audio beacons on objects to track the location of the door, for example, and use the haptic proximity sensor to feel the outline of the room.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All of this is made possible by combining the latest advances in AR, computer vision and the iPhone 12 Pro&#8217;s lidar sensor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At Sight Tech Global, Shaikh will discuss the Seeing AI team&#8217;s work to combine these remarkable technologies that promise to improve the independence of folks with vision loss, and describe the team&#8217;s latest steps toward this audio augmented reality experience, and paint a vision for the future of assistive agents.</p>
