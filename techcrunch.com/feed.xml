										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automating and controlling devices and energy usage in homes has potentially become a bit easier thanks to an integration between <a href="https://www.span.io/">Span</a>, the startup making a digital fusebox replacement, and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa"> Amazon&#8217;s voice recognition interface, Alexa</a>.</p>
<p>The integration also comes with a $20 million new cash infusion from <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-startups/alexa-fund">Amazon&#8217;s Alexa Fund</a> and the massive insurance company Munich Re Ventures&#8217; <a href="https://www.munichreventures.com/funds/#hsb">HSB Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Through the Alexa integration, homeowners using Span&#8217;s electrical panels can turn on or off any circuit or appliance in their home, monitor which appliances are using power, and determine which electrical source is generating the most power for a home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Questions like &#8220;Alexa, ask Span what is consuming the most power right now?&#8221; will get a response. The Alexa integration opens up new opportunities for home owners to integrate their devices and appliances, because of the connection to the home&#8217;s wiring, according to Span chief executive, Arch Rao.</p>
<p>Rao sees the Alexa integration as a way for Span to become the home automation hub that tech companies have been promising for a long time. &#8220;There are far too many devices in the hoe today&#8230; with too many apps,&#8221; Rao said. &#8220;The advantage we have is, once installed, we&#8217;re persistent in the home and connected to everything electric in the home for the next 30 to 40 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to monitoring energy usage and output, Alexa commands could turn off the power for any device or switch that a homeowner has programmed into the system.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most material way to state it is, our panel is providing a virtual interface to the home in the build environment,&#8221; said Rao. &#8220;We&#8217;re building a very capable edge device&#8230; it becomes sort of a true aggregation point and nerve center to give you real-time visibility and control.&#8221;</p>
<p>Going forward, Rao envisions Span integrating with other devices like water sensors, fire alarm sensors, and other equipment to provide other types of controls that could be useful for insurers like Munich Re.</p>
<p>With the $20 million that the company raised, Rao intends to significantly increase sales and marketing efforts working through partners like Munich Re and Amazon to get Span&#8217;s devices into as many homes as possible.</p>
<p>The company has significant tailwinds thanks to home automation and energy efficiency upgrade efforts that are now wending their way through Washington, but could mean subsidies for the deployment of technology&#8217;s like Span&#8217;s electric panels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rao also intends to boost headcount at Span. The company currently has 35 employees and Rao would like to see that number double to roughly 70 by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Span&#8217;s growth is part of a broad movement in home technologies toward increasingly sustainable options. In many cases that&#8217;s the penetration of electrical appliances in things like water heaters and stove tops, but also the integration of electric vehicle charging stations, home energy storage units, and other devices that push energy generation and management to the edge of electricity grids.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s cutting that pipe that’s bringing natural gas to the home and bringing all electric everything… as consumers are continuing to cut the cord on fossils, your existing home system is not efficient. That’s one ecosystem of products where we are starting to see partnership opportunities,&#8221; Rao said. &#8220;When it comes to applications like monitoring the health of your appliances… and services to the home. Having the data that we provide will be unprecedented.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">5G is the current revolution in wireless technology, and every chip company old and new is trying to burrow their way into this ultra-competitive — but extremely lucrative — market. One of the most interesting new players in the space is <a href="https://edgeq.io">EdgeQ</a>, a startup with a strong technical pedigree via Qualcomm that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/edgeq-raises-51-million-to-fuse-ai-compute-and-5g-within-a-single-chip/">we covered last year after it raised a nearly $40 million Series A</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hEagj7AK8S"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/edgeq-raises-51-million-to-fuse-ai-compute-and-5g-within-a-single-chip/">EdgeQ raises $51 million to fuse AI compute and 5G within a single chip</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EdgeQ raises $51 million to fuse AI compute and 5G within a single chip&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/edgeq-raises-51-million-to-fuse-ai-compute-and-5g-within-a-single-chip/embed/#?secret=hEagj7AK8S" data-secret="hEagj7AK8S" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company has been quite stealthy about its technology as it works on its design (its website as I write this literally says “Welcome to WordPress. This is your first post. Edit or delete it, then start writing!”), but today, the company revealed more details for the first time (and presumably also updated its website).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The most interesting facet of its system-on-a-chip (SoC) design is that it is based on RISC-V. Unlike processor architectures like x86 and Arm, RISC-V is open-source, and one of the first open architectures to reach any sort of enduring popularity and ecosystem. That’s led to a bunch of new companies building on top of it, including now EdgeQ and also SiFive, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/sifives-new-pc-is-bringing-open-source-computing-closer-to-reality/">which we covered late last year</a>.</p>
<p>Vinay Ravuri, EdgeQ’s founder and CEO, explained that the use of RISC-V allows EdgeQ to offer chips with the flexibility of reprogrammable processors known as FPGAs while also offering a more cohesive and integrated product with better power savings. In his view, that’s been one of the big challenges in the wireless communications market to date with the rollout of 5G.</p>
<p>“When you are in a closed system, it compacts nicely, and everything matches,” he said, pointing to market leaders like Huawei and Ericsson whose vertically-integrated base stations are widely deployed throughout the world. The problem is that customers feel stifled by having all of their equipment come from one, irreplaceable vendor. Meanwhile, with a purely open system based on standards like OpenRAN, “you get a clunky solution” that’s cobbled together from off-the-shelf parts. That leads to increased power consumption since the components in these boxes were never faithfully designed to be used together.</p>
<p>Ravuri says that EdgeQ stands in the middle between open and closed, offering an extensible system that is also integrated and may save, in some instances, up to 50% of the power demand for a wireless base station. The key is combining machine learning into wireless communications through a better SoC and having all the parts work seamlessly together. “The uniqueness of the communications chips is in the algorithms,” he said. “You are not selling sand, you are not connecting gates and saying this is a processor. You are connecting gates and here is an algorithm for the physical layer of communications.”</p>

Photo via EdgeQ.</p></div></p>
<p>Adil Kidwai, who is VP and head of product at EdgeQ, said that “Under the hood, it is hardware instructions that are controlled by software … It’s a ‘soft’ modem with very low power consumption.” Since EdgeQ is based on RISC-V, the existing toolchain available in that ecosystem also applies to the company’s product, allowing engineers to use compilers and debuggers that have been built for RISC-V. Ravuri noted that EdgeQ has added about 50 to 100 of its own vector extensions to the base RISC-V implementation to optimize performance.</p>
<p>With the product’s design more firmly established, he said that the company is looking to sample its system with customers in the first half of this year. “Once we sample, there is a productization cycle that customers take,” he said, and he intends to be starting revenue growth by 2022. The EdgeQ base station is compatible according to the company with OpenRAN option 7.x and option 6.</p>
<p>The company also noted for the first time today that Paul Jacobs, the former CEO of Qualcomm, and Matt Grob, the company’s former CTO, have both joined EdgeQ’s advisory board in an official capacity. The two met Ravuri back when he was at Qualcomm and have been in touch throughout EdgeQ’s development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many people want to develop better screen-time habits, but don&#8217;t have a good set of tools to do so. A new startup, <a href="https://www.opal.so/">Opal</a>, aims to help. The company, now backed by $4.3 million in seed funding, has developed a digital well-being assistant for iOS that allows you to block distracting websites and apps, set schedules around app usage, lock down apps for stricter and more focused quiet periods, and more.</p>
<p>The service works by way of a VPN system that limits your access to apps and sites. But unlike some VPNs on the market, Opal is committed to not collecting any personal data on its users or their private browsing data. Instead, its business model is based on paid subscriptions, not selling user data, it says.</p>
<p>Timed with its public debut, Opal also today announced its initial financing in a round led by Nicolas Wittenborn at <a class="notion-link-token notion-enable-hover" href="https://adjacent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-token-index="1" data-reactroot="">Adjacent</a>, a mobile-focused VC fund. Other investors included <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrystebbings/">Harry Stebbings</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/schlaf/">Steve Schlafman</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-zubillaga-b9398694/">Alex Zubillaga</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carterkev/">Kevin Carter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thibaud-elziere-a787913/">Thibaud Elziere</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcsamuelian/">Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/albandenoyel/">Alban Denoyel</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/isai">Isai</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/secocha-ventures">Secocha Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/speedinvest">Speedinvest</a>, and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2100262" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100262" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2100262" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kenneth-Schlenker.jpeg?w=454" alt="" width="350" height="524" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kenneth-Schlenker.jpeg 854w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kenneth-Schlenker.jpeg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kenneth-Schlenker.jpeg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kenneth-Schlenker.jpeg?resize=768,1151 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kenneth-Schlenker.jpeg?resize=454,680 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kenneth-Schlenker.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100262" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opal, founder Kenneth Schlenker</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for Opal comes from Paris-based <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennethschlenker/">Kenneth Schlenker</a>, a longtime technologist who previously founded and sold an art marketplace startup ArtList and later led mobility company Bird&#8217;s expansion in France.</p>
<p>Schlenker, who grew up in a small, quiet village in the Alps, says he got into technology at a young age.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sort of got obsessed, like many of us, by the potential of technology and its amazing power of attraction &#8212; making connections, learning new things, all sorts of incredible opportunities,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve then spent the last 10 years and more trying to seek a balance between this need for connection and this need for disconnection.&#8221;</p>
<p>In more recent years, Schlenker came to realize that others were having the same problem, including those outside the tech industry. That drove him to build Opal, with the goal of helping people better achieve balance in their lives so they could reconnect with loved ones, spend time in nature or just generally go offline to focus on other areas of their lives.</p>
<p>At a basic level, Opal&#8217;s VPN allows users to block themselves from using dozens of distracting apps and sites for certain periods of time, including social media, news, productivity apps and more.</p>
<p>Social media, in particular, has been a huge problem in recent years, Schlenker says.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter &#8212; social media is where you feel like you&#8217;re learning something, and you feel like you&#8217;re connecting with people. So it&#8217;s good. But on the other hand, it&#8217;s very hard to stay intentional,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;It&#8217;s okay to pick up your phone and go to Instagram, but when you &#8216;wake up&#8217; 30 minutes later, you usually feel really bad. You feel like, &#8216;where&#8217;s the time gone?&#8217;, &#8216;what did I just do?,&#8217; &#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Opal addresses this problem through a handful of features.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100279" style="width: 395px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100279" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2100279" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home.jpg?w=385" alt="" width="385" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home.jpg 1740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home.jpg?resize=85,150 85w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home.jpg?resize=170,300 170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home.jpg?resize=768,1356 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home.jpg?resize=385,680 385w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home.jpg?resize=870,1536 870w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home.jpg?resize=1160,2048 1160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Home.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100279" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opal</p></div></p>
<p>The free service allows you to block distracting websites and apps and take breaks throughout the day. By upgrading to the paid membership, Opal users can schedule time off from apps to establish recurring downtimes &#8212; whether that&#8217;s for family dinners or working hours, or anything else. They also can use a more extreme version of this feature called Focus Mode, which locks you out of apps in a way that&#8217;s not cancelable.</p>
<p>While the company is using a VPN to make this system work, it&#8217;s being transparent and straightforward about its data collection practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is zero private browsing data that leaves your phone,&#8221; Schlenker insists. &#8220;Anything you do on your phone outside of Opal&#8217;s app stays local on your phone and is never stored on any of our servers or any other servers. That&#8217;s very important to us,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>From inside Opal&#8217;s app, the company claims it only collects usability and crash information &#8212; not browsing data. And the usability data is completely anonymized for another layer of privacy. Opal also doesn&#8217;t require an email to begin using the app. It only asks for one if you choose to pay.</p>

<p>These core principles <a href="https://www.opal.so/terms">are also documented on Opal&#8217;s privacy page</a>, and are why Schlenker believes his app won&#8217;t face the challenges that other screen-time apps on the App Store have experienced in the past.</p>
<p>As you may recall, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/apple-puts-third-party-screen-time-apps-on-notice/">Apple cracked down on the screen time app industry</a> a couple of years ago &#8212; a move <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/28/apple-defends-its-takedown-of-some-apps-monitoring-screen-time/">Apple said</a> was focused on protecting user privacy, but has also been raised as a possible example of anticompetitive behavior. Many of the apps at the time had been using techniques Apple claimed put consumers&#8217; privacy and security at risk, as they gave third-parties elevated access to users&#8217; devices. This was particularly concerning because many of the impacted apps were marketed as parental control services &#8212; meaning the end users were often children.</p>
<p>Opal, meanwhile, is targeting adults, and perhaps teenagers, who want to develop better screen-time habits. It is not selling this as a parental control system, however.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100282" style="width: 395px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100282" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2100282" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customize-Apps.jpg?w=385" alt="" width="385" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customize-Apps.jpg 1740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customize-Apps.jpg?resize=85,150 85w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customize-Apps.jpg?resize=170,300 170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customize-Apps.jpg?resize=768,1356 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customize-Apps.jpg?resize=385,680 385w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customize-Apps.jpg?resize=870,1536 870w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customize-Apps.jpg?resize=1160,2048 1160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customize-Apps.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100282" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opal</p></div></p>
<p>At launch, Opal can block over 100 apps and sites across several categories, including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, Gmail, Outlook, Slack, Robinhood, WhatsApp, WeChat and others, including those in the news, adult and gambling categories.</p>
<p>Users can choose to block the apps for short breaks &#8212; 5, 10 or 60 minutes &#8212; throughout the day. You can also set an intention and set a timer before using an app, to help you avoid the issue of losing track of time. And you can set focus timers or scheduled times to automatically shut off app usage.</p>
<p>You can track your progress by viewing the &#8220;time saved&#8221; and you can share your successes across social media. In time, Schlenker plans to add more of a scoring mechanism to Opal that will help you stay accountable to your original goals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100280" style="width: 395px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100280" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2100280" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Stats.jpg?w=385" alt="" width="385" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Stats.jpg 1740w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Stats.jpg?resize=85,150 85w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Stats.jpg?resize=170,300 170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Stats.jpg?resize=768,1356 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Stats.jpg?resize=385,680 385w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Stats.jpg?resize=870,1536 870w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Stats.jpg?resize=1160,2048 1160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Stats.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 385px) 100vw, 385px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100280" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Opal</p></div></p>
<p>Though work on the app only began in 2020, Opal began attracting attention as it publicized its plans on Twitter and ran its private beta, which grew from hundreds to thousands of users this year, saving its users an average of two hours per day.</p>
<p>Though Schlenker had connections with many of the angel investors who have since backed Opal, he says the interest from institutional and larger investors was all inbound.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not our intention to raise so much, so early,&#8221; Schlenker notes.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to help Opal grow its team, particularly engineering, design as well as product. The company will also soon launch a version of Opal for Chrome and later, Android, and will experiment with more social features around sharing and hosting group sessions.</p>
<p>The app is currently <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/opal-focus-wellbeing/id1497465230">a free download on the App Store</a> with an optional $59.99/year subscription plan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.sayrhino.com/">Rhino</a> today announced that it has raised $95 million, an investment that values the startup at just under $500 million. Tiger Global led the round, an investment that Rhino described as &#8220;pre-IPO&#8221; to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Rhino provides an insurance product to real estate companies, allowing them to forgo traditional rental deposits from tenants, and offering renters an insurance product that provides similar utility for a regular fee.</p>
<p>As part of its funding news, Rhino disclosed that its contracted ARR has scaled quickly in recent years, from $4 million in January 2019 to $60 million in January 2021. The ARR figure represents the amount of expected customer volume from buildings that Rhino has contracted with. The company&#8217;s co-founder and chairman <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://twitter.com/ankurjain_2?lang=en">Ankur Jain</a></span> described the number as conservative in a phone call with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Jain, who is also<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the CEO of Kairos, a brand portfolio that includes the insurance startup, about its new investment. Kairos, Jain said, wants to lower costs for younger generations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rhino fits that goal as upfront costs for renting can be prohibitive and its service could make the process less dependent on renters having lots of cash that they can lock up for the period of their lease.</span></p>
<p>Jain described Rhino as something that can help landlords and renters by lowering the barrier to renting a unit, thus widening the potential customer pool. More possible customers, the logic goes, the more units that may be rented.</p>
<p>The economics of the business appear favorable for Rhino. Jain told TechCrunch that COVID-19 did not push the economics &#8212; the contribution margin of its core insurance product &#8212; negative. Given how we&#8217;ve seen some high-growth insurance products post histories of negative contribution margins, Rhino appears to be in good health. (TechCrunch confirmed that this result was <em>inclusive</em> of loss-adjustment expenses.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AgentSync lands consecutive rounds as insurtech booms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/embed/#?secret=4Ko02wEDnF" data-secret="4Ko02wEDnF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Sufficient health to take it public in time? Perhaps. Jain told TechCrunch that its new lead investor Tiger has lots of experience taking companies public, something that his company might pursue in 12 to 24 months.</p>
<p>Given the climate, we asked the SPAC question. The CEO said that traditional IPO was more the goal.</p>
<p>If you are surprised to see the CEO of a yet-startup talk about going public so honestly, recall that Lemonade went public in mid-2020 with modest revenues to great effect. Another neo-insurance provider, Root, also went public though it has lost ground since. MetroMile, yet another player in the world of startups offering insurance products, intends to list via a SPAC.</p>
<p>And more startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/loop-launches-out-of-stealth-to-make-auto-insurance-more-equitable/">working on related problems</a>. The insurtech boom appears to be continuing its 2020 excitement in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://credibook.com/">CrediBook</a>, a startup that helps Indonesian retail wholesalers digitize the financial side of their operations, has raised $1.5 million in pre-Series A funding led by Wavemaker Partners, with participation from Alpha JWC Ventures and Insignia Ventures Partners. The capital will be used for product launches and expansion into more Indonesian cities.</p>
<p>Founded in February 2020, CrediBook is part of a wave of startups focused on digitizing small- to medium-sized businesses in Indonesia. SMEs contribute more than <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/07/17/smes-safeguard-economy.html">60% of the country’s gross domestic product</a>, but many still use traditional bookkeeping systems like paper ledgers. Digitizing them makes it easier for them to use services like online invoicing and payments, and keep financial records to apply for working capital loans.</p>
<p>Some other startups serving Indonesian SMEs include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/bukukas-raises-10-million-led-by-sequoia-capital-india-to-build-a-end-to-end-software-stack-for-indonesian-smes/">BukuKas</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/indonesian-fintech-startup-bukuwarung-gets-new-funding-to-add-financial-services-for-small-merchants/">BukuWarung</a>, two digital bookkeeping apps for small B2C businesses like neighborhood stores and restaurants (both have also recently raised funding). <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/moka-raises-24m/">Moka</a> and <a href="https://www.jurnal.id/en/">Jurnal</a>, meanwhile, are used by larger companies. CrediBook is carving out a niche for itself by serving small-to-medium sized B2B businesses in the retail sector, including wholesalers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Gabriel Frans told TechCrunch that the company is moving toward a profitable business model and currently has more than 500,000 customers, who use the app for bookkeeping, tracking orders from retailers and digital payments. CrediBook also works with financial services provider PayFazz, one of its <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/credibook-seed-round">seed investors</a>, to provide financing to SMEs.</p>
<p>Frans said CrediBook plans to add more features, including online invoicing, to create an end-to-end platform like Tel Aviv and New York-based B2B payment startups Melio, which announced a round of funding this week that brought its valuation to $1.3 billion. &#8220;We are digitizing not only the bookkeeping, but also the invoicing and payment processing,&#8221; Frans said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zOQYC0k4jf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/melio-raises-110m-on-a-1-3b-valuation-to-bring-b2b-payments-for-smbs-into-the-21st-century/">Melio raises $110M on a $1.3B valuation to bring B2B payments for SMBs into the 21st century</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Melio raises $110M on a $1.3B valuation to bring B2B payments for SMBs into the 21st century&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/melio-raises-110m-on-a-1-3b-valuation-to-bring-b2b-payments-for-smbs-into-the-21st-century/embed/#?secret=zOQYC0k4jf" data-secret="zOQYC0k4jf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Most of CrediBook&#8217;s customers are currently concentrated in the cities of Jabodetabek and Bandung, and part of its funding will be used for building its user base in more areas. Frans said many of the startup’s customers relied on paper ledgers before signing up for CrediBook, so part of the process of convincing them to go online includes demonstrating how having more visibility into their finances can grow their businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very close to our users because this is a very localized market,&#8221; said Frans, who previously worked at O2O platform Kudo (now called GrabKios after its acquisition by Grab in 2017) and bookings platform Traveloka. &#8220;I was already familiar with the industry based on my previous experience, and if they try our app and experience the benefit of how it will make their day-to-day problems less, they will love it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is getting into the newsletter business.</p>
<p>The social media company is announcing that it has acquired <a href="https://www.getrevue.co">Revue</a>, a Dutch startup that allows users to publish and monetize email newsletters. While Revue hasn&#8217;t driven the same wave of &#8220;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/is-substack-the-media-future-we-want">is this the future of media?</a>&#8221; think pieces as Substack, it counts major publishers like Vox Media and The Markup as customers.</p>
<p>Newsletters aren&#8217;t the most obvious fit for Twitter&#8217;s platform, but in <a href="https://blog.twitter.com">a blog post</a>, Product Lead Kayvon Beykpour and VP of Publisher Products Mike Park suggested that that this is a new way for Twitter to serve writers and publishers who have built a following with their tweets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make it easy for them to connect with their subscribers, while also helping readers better discover writers and their content,&#8221; Beykpour and Park wrote. &#8220;We’re imagining a lot of ways to do this, from allowing people to sign up for newsletters from their favorite follows on Twitter, to new settings for writers to host conversations with their subscribers. It will all work seamlessly within Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5irM28pUU7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/revue-the-newsletter-publishing-tool-now-lets-you-charge-subscribers/">Revue, the newsletter publishing tool, now lets you charge subscribers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Revue, the newsletter publishing tool, now lets you charge subscribers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/revue-the-newsletter-publishing-tool-now-lets-you-charge-subscribers/embed/#?secret=5irM28pUU7" data-secret="5irM28pUU7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>They also suggested that this will give writers additional ways to make money. Revue already supports paid subscriptions, and Beykpour and Park said that the company will continue developing new monetization features, &#8220;whether it’s helping broaden revenue streams or serving as a cornerstone of someone’s business.&#8221;</p>
<p>They added that Twitter will continue to operate Revue as a standalone product, with its team remaining &#8220;focused on improving the ways writers create their newsletters, build their audience and get paid for their work.&#8221; The company is also making the platform&#8217;s pro features free for all users and lowering the fee charged on paid newsletters to 5%.</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/revue/company_financials">According to Crunchbase</a>, Revue had raised €400,000 from various angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fleksy.com">Fleksy</a>, an autocorrecting AI keyboard which competes with big-guns like Google&#8217;s Gboard and Microsoft&#8217;s Swiftkey, has a new way to catch users&#8217; eyes: Art keyboards.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just launched <a href="http://www.fleksy.com/fleksyart">FleksyArt</a>: A marketplace for artists to sell digital works to its users so they can customize the look of their keyboards.</p>
<p>Fleksy has had keyboard themes before. But the art marketplace aims to go further &#8212; opening its platform up to all sorts of artists to digitally distribute work to its &#8220;millions&#8221; of users for display on a piece of essential smartphone real-estate (it points out the keyboard is the second most used app on phones, after all).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As this is keyboard art, the illustrations and artworks appear with the letters of Fleksy&#8217;s keyboard overlaid. So the startup warns legibility is important. Clearly some designs are going to work better than others. But beyond that the creative sky is the limit.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100566" style="width: 542px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100566" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2100566" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fleksyart_collage.png?w=532" alt="" width="532" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fleksyart_collage.png 1188w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fleksyart_collage.png?resize=117,150 117w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fleksyart_collage.png?resize=235,300 235w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fleksyart_collage.png?resize=768,981 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fleksyart_collage.png?resize=532,680 532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/fleksyart_collage.png?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100566" class="wp-caption-text">A collage of some of the different artworks available on the FleksyArt marketplace (Image credit: Fleksy)</p></div></p>
<p>FleksyArt is starting with several digital artists onboard, including María Picasso i Piquer, Lucila Dominguez, URKO and Maru Ceballos.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s inviting other artists to sign up by submitting a portfolio of work for review <a href="https://www.fleksy.com/fleksyart#form-fleksyart">here</a>.</p>
<p>Victoria Gerchinhoren, Fleksy&#8217;s chief design officer, explains how it works: &#8220;When we receive the portfolios, my design team approves for having the artwork in our marketplace,&#8221; she tells us, noting Fleksy has already handpicked a few artists to get the ball rolling. &#8220;I send them guidelines on how to prepare the assets and I write the last specs before publishing inside the product.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There defined guidelines in terms of the number of pieces (always packs of 2-4 themes) and artists can create as many packs as they want. We suggest the pieces inside each pack have a connection, they can be connected by an idea or style,&#8221; she goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We publish the packs in a dedicated section in the host app (which we redesigned with this in mind not long ago) then communicate in social media. We’ve also just launched the <a href="https://www.fleksy.com/fleksyart">website section</a> with interviews and the artist profiles and bios so they have a nice place to be showcased.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fleksy is setting a flat price of €2.99 for all art packs &#8212; in order that artists selling on the marketplace &#8220;have the same price and competition is fair&#8221;, as Gerchinhoren puts it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s doing a 50:50 revenue split on sales &#8212; after Google&#8217;s 30% commission has been factored in. So this means that Google gets €0.89 per sale, and the artist and Fleksy then split the rest.</p>
<p>Fleksy has also confirmed that artists retain copyright of their works.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re setting this collaboration on a revenue-share model,&#8221; it notes on its website. &#8220;You’ll receive 50% of the revenue after Google&#8217;s 30% commission. We think this is fair since you’ll provide the Artwork and Fleksy implements &amp; distribute your Artwork. Payments are made bi-annually, upon our receipt of a legal invoice from you.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Grindr, a gay, bi, trans and queer hook-up app, is on the hook for a penalty of NOK100,000,000 (aka €10M or ~$12.1M) in Europe.</p>
<p>Norway&#8217;s data protection agency has <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/intention-to-issue--10-million-fine-to-grindr-llc2/">announced</a> it&#8217;s notified the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/grindr-sold-china-national-security/">US-based company</a> of its intention to issue the fine in relation to consent violations under the region&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which sets out strict conditions for processing people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>The size of the fine is notable. GDPR allows for fines to scale up to 4% of global annual turnover or up to €20M, whichever is higher. In this case Grindr is on the hook for around 10% of its annual revenue, per the DPA. (Although the sanction is not yet final; Grindr has until February 15 to submit a response before the <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Datatilsynet</span> issues a final decision.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have notified Grindr that we intend to impose a fine of high magnitude as our findings suggest grave violations of the GDPR,&#8221; said Bjørn Erik Thon, DG of the agency, in a statement. &#8220;Grindr has 13.7 million active users, of which thousands reside in Norway. Our view is that these people have had their personal data shared unlawfully. An important objective of the GDPR is precisely to prevent <em>take-it-or-leave-it</em> &#8216;consents&#8217;. It is imperative that such practices cease.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grindr has been contacted for comment.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/dating-and-fertility-apps-among-those-snitching-to-out-of-control-adtech-report-finds/">Last year</a> a report by Norway&#8217;s Consumer Council (NCC) delved into the data sharing practices of a number of popular apps in categories such as dating and fertility. It found the majority of apps transmitted data to “unexpected third parties”, with users not clearly informed how their information was being used.</p>
<p>Grindr was one of the apps featured in the NCC report. And the Council went on to file a complaint against the app with the national DPA, claiming unlawful sharing of users&#8217; personal data with third parties for marketing purposes &#8212; including GPS location; user profile data; and the fact the user in question is on Grindr.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Dating and fertility apps among those snitching to &#8216;out of control&#8217; ad tech, report finds&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/dating-and-fertility-apps-among-those-snitching-to-out-of-control-adtech-report-finds/embed/#?secret=uGKsrcFiFP" data-secret="uGKsrcFiFP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under the GDPR, an app user&#8217;s personal data may be legally shared if you obtain their consent to do so. However there are a set of clear standards for consent to be legal &#8212; meaning it must be informed, specific and freely given. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Datatilsynet found that Grindr had failed to meet this standard. </span></p>
<p>It said users of Grindr were forced to accept the privacy policy in its entirety &#8212; and were not asked if they wanted to consent with the sharing of their data to third parties.</p>
<p>Additionally, it said sexual orientation could be inferred by a user&#8217;s presence on Grindr; and under regional law such sensitive &#8216;special category&#8217; data carries an even higher standard of explicit consent before it can be shared (which, again, the <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Datatilsynet</span> said Grindr failed to get from users).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr needs consent to share these personal data and that Grindr’s consents were not valid. Additionally, we believe that the fact that someone is a Grindr user speaks to their sexual orientation, and therefore this constitutes special category data that merit particular protection,&#8221; it writes in a <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/intention-to-issue--10-million-fine-to-grindr-llc2/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that this is a serious case,&#8221; added Thon. &#8220;Users were not able to exercise real and effective control over the sharing of their data. Business models where users are pressured into giving consent, and where they are not properly informed about what they are consenting to, are not compliant with the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision could have wider significance as a similar &#8216;forced consent&#8217; complaint against Facebook is still open on the desk of Ireland&#8217;s data protection watchdog &#8212; despite being filed back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">May 2018</a>. For tech giants that have have set up a regional base in Ireland, and made an Irish entity legally responsible for processing EU citizens&#8217; data, GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism has led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-up-to-catch-big-tech-report-warns/">considerable delays in complaint enforcement</a>.</p>
<p>Grindr, meanwhile, changed how it obtains consent in April 2020 &#8212; and the proposed sanction deals with how it was handling this prior to then, from May 2018, when the GDPR came into force.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not to date assessed whether the subsequent changes comply with the GDPR,&#8221; the Datatilsynet adds.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Norwegian Data Protection Authority&#8217;s action in a statement, Monique Goyens, DG of European consumer rights organization Beuc, said: “This is excellent news and sends a clear signal that it’s illegal to monitor consumers 24/7, without their consent, to collect and share their data. The GDPR does have teeth and consumer groups stand ready to act against those who break the law.</p>
<p>“We commend the Norwegian data protection authority for acting swiftly. It is reassuring that GDPR complaints do not have to linger on for years. Too many apps gather and share too much personal data with too many third parties for commercial purposes based on the same flimsy grounds and with no control. This move by the Norwegian authority will reverberate across the entire adtech industry &#8212; and hopefully bring some change.&#8221;</p>

<p>After its report last year, the NCC also filed complaints against five of the third parties who it found to be receiving data from Grindr: MoPub (owned by Twitter), Xandr (formerly known as AppNexus), OpenX Software, AdColony, and Smaato. The DPA notes that those cases are ongoing.</p>
<p>Following the NCC report in January 2020, Twitter told us it had suspended Grindr’s MoPub account while it investigated the “sufficiency” of its consent mechanism. We&#8217;ve reached out to Twitter to ask whether it ever reinstated the account and will update this report with any response.</p>
<p>European privacy campaign group <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/gay-dating-app-grindr-be-fined-almost-eu-10-mio">noyb</a>, which was involved in filing the strategic complaints against Grindr and the adtech companies, hailed the DPA&#8217;s decision to uphold the complaints &#8212; dubbing the size of the fine &#8220;enormous&#8221; (given Grindr only reported profits of just over $30M in 2019, meaning it&#8217;s facing losing about a third of that at one fell swoop).</p>
<p>noyb also argues that Grindr&#8217;s switch to trying to claim legitimate interests to continue processing users&#8217; data without obtaining their consent could result in further penalties for the company.<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;This is in conflict with the decision of the Norwegian DPA, as it explicitly held that &#8220;</span><em style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">any extensive disclosure &#8230; for marketing purposes should be based on the data subject’s consent</em><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;,&#8221; writes Ala Krinickytė, data protection lawyer at<strong> </strong>noyb, in a statement. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;</span>The case is clear from the factual and legal side. We do not expect any successful objection by Grindr. However, more fines may be in the pipeline for Grindr as it lately claims an unlawful &#8216;legitimate interest&#8217; to share user data with third parties &#8212; even without consent. Grindr may be bound for a second round.<em>&#8221; </em></p>

<p>Prior to joining Atomico, he was a consultant at Bain &amp; Company and a software engineer at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He holds a first class BA in Computer Science from Queens’ College, Cambridge.</p>
<p>Also being promoted are associates, Hillary Ball and Luca Eisenstecken, both stepping up to principal.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Perhaps more than most, Reilly Brennan loves cars and trucks. The native Michigander happily did grunt work for an automotive magazine as an undergrad at the University of Michigan before landing a gig as a trackside communications manager at General Motors, spending a few years as an editor and a general manager with an automotive publisher called NextScreen, then becoming a programming director for AOL&#8217;s automotive properties.</p>
<p>His next role would be on the West Coast, as executive director of an automotive research program at Stanford, where Brennan continues to be a lecturer. Little surprise that soon after, a seed-stage fund began to make sense, too, and thus was born <a href="https://www.trucks.vc/">Trucks Venture Capital</a>, which has since made dozens of bets out of a $20 million debut effort and is wrapping up a larger fund soon.</p>
<p>Late last week, we talked with Brennan about two of the fastest-soaring valuations we&#8217;ve seen recently in the automotive sector: that of the electric vehicle company Rivian, which raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">giant new round last week</a> at a nearly $30 billion post-money valuation, and Cruise Automation, which also raised a giant new round last week, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/microsoft-invests-in-cruise-in-new-2-billion-round">also at $30 billion valuation</a>. (Along with some other <a href="https://www.trucks.vc/portfolio">interesting bets</a>, Trucks managed to write an early check for Cruise before it was <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2016/mar/0311-cruise.html">acquired</a> in 2016 by GM, which maintains majority ownership of the company.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We wondered if even an auto aficionado might deem things a little bubbly. You can listen to that full conversation <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/7440469">here</a>. In the meantime, the excerpts below have been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Who are your investors in Trucks VC? Are they individuals? Are any auto manufacturers that are trying to get a look at nascent technologies?</strong></p>
<p>RB: We have some former execs from the car industry in the tech world, and a handful of family offices and definitely some large strategic companies. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t tell you their names because I&#8217;ve signed documents that prevent me from doing that. But one of the cool things about our little Rolodex of [limited partners] is that our founders &#8212; when they want to come in and do something in transportation &#8212; it&#8217;s an easy doggie door into a lot of those entities, whether they&#8217;re people or businesses. One of the things I love about [the mix is] there&#8217;s probably no part of a vehicle, whether you&#8217;re talking about a car, truck, a bike, or a plane, that one of our investors couldn&#8217;t help out with.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you look to be the first money into your deals?</strong></p>
<p>RB: One of the interesting learnings I had in the first fund was, we were just trying to participate; we were just happy to be at the party. So we were participating in rounds that other people were leading, and our checks [from Fund I] were anywhere from $100,000 to a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The new fund is designed to take advantage of leading rounds [because] halfway through our first fund, founders would ask us to lead rounds, and frankly, the fund wasn&#8217;t big enough to do that. Our new fund is really designed so we can lead seed rounds, and that&#8217;s what we do. We&#8217;ll lead or co-lead and sit on the board. Usually, we&#8217;re  owning about 10% to 12% of a company at seed.</p>
<p><strong>TC: One of Truck&#8217;s early checks went to Cruise, the self-driving car company that GM acquired for an amount that has variously been reported as more than $1 billion, as well as for closer to $500 million . . .</strong></p>
<p>RB: The Cruise investment, my [<a href="https://www.trucks.vc/about">fellow general partners</a>] Jeff and Kate made. I can&#8217;t tell you specifically what the acquisition price was, but it was pretty good. That being said, if you read about the valuation of Cruise now within General Motors, or that of another [self-driving] company we invested in, Nutonomy, which was acquired by [automotive supplier] Delphi [for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/24/16533534/delphi-nutonomy-acquisition-450-million-self-driving">$450 million</a> in 2017] and is now essentially a company called <a href="https://motional.com/">Motional</a>, they&#8217;re pretty high.</p>
<p>I think a lot about those early exits because they validated the space, but I also think a lot of the early investors probably wish they had more ownership. I&#8217;m not saying they shouldn&#8217;t have sold. But you look at the valuation of Cruise and Motional today &#8212; if you put those two entities together &#8212; it&#8217;s more than the valuation of General Motors, or maybe Ford Motor Company.</p>
<p><strong>TC: But is Cruise&#8217;s valuation perhaps too high right now? They still have a very long lead time to making money.</strong></p>
<p>RB: I would agree with you that in the public market, it feels a little bubbly when it comes to electric vehicles and some of these ideas related to technology and auto. But I do think a lot of these companies look at the opportunity to automate things greater than just robo-taxis. Last year in particular provided good insight into how the logistics and delivery part of automation is probably on the nearer term horizon than robo-taxis and therefore more valuable.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How much have valuations been driven up by Tesla, whose valuation now dwarfs all the major car manufacturers?</strong></p>
<p>RB: One of the things the market appears to want is the simple story, and belief in Tesla is now highly aligned to [thinking that] this is just the way that transportation is going to be organized. It&#8217;s going to be a zero-emission vehicle that is highly connected and maybe attached to a consumer in a new way.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re seeing the same with a lot of these pure-play EV companies, whether it&#8217;s [carmaker] Fisker doing a SPAC or the way that [carmaker] <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/15/investing/nio-stock-intl-hnk/index.html">Neo is received in China</a>. There&#8217;s this purity of their message.</p>
<p>You can argue, successfully, that a lot of other companies have more engineering or a greater dealer network or more IP around a particular idea, but when it comes to the public market stuff, it really is about painting the picture in this one specific way that&#8217;s aligned with the future. And right now, the public markets really don&#8217;t like that composite, liberal arts approach to vehicle manufacturing; they really just want one thing that aligns very well with the future, which they believe is better electric vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This seemingly applies to the Detroit carmaker Rivian. What do you think of this company that&#8217;s valued at nearly $30 billion yet hasn&#8217;t yet sold a truck or SUV? You aren&#8217;t one of its investor. Does its valuation make sense to you?</strong></p>
<p>RB: From an engineering perspective, Rivian is probably one of the companies I respect most out of this new breed of manufacturers.</p>
<p>Tens years ago, when they started, there were a lot of new supercar entrepreneurs who were trying to start something new, but they were always small batch ideas. Like, maybe you could get 100 people to buy one. But they weren&#8217;t really well-aligned with what consumers were buying, which is increasingly utilities and trucks. So Rivian&#8217;s approach, with the segment it&#8217;s going after, is really smart, and it has fantastic engineering. So I&#8217;m actually quite bullish on Rivian.</p>
<p>In a year&#8217;s time, there will probably be two big events for Rivian. One, they will deliver the first batch of [<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/08/amazon-new-electric-delivery-vans-created-with-rivian-unveiled.html">electric delivery vans</a> being built for investor] to Amazon, along with [other orders] to some of the early customers. It also wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if they&#8217;re public at some point in the next year.<br />
They haven&#8217;t told me that; just my own personal speculation here.</p>
<p><strong>TC: When you say it will go public, do you mean through a traditional IPO or maybe through a giant SPAC? Would what you guess?</strong></p>
<p>I bet that Rivian will probably do a traditional IPO, that&#8217;s my guess. But they could also do a SPAC at some point. [Either way] I think the public markets are going to be really interested in Rivian. I just think there&#8217;s really good stuff there.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Have you been able to test-drive its cars? Have you seen its tech up close? What makes you so confident that what Rivian is building is superior?</strong></p>
<p>RB: I think the point of view they have about the segments is really interesting In the U.S., they are going after two great-growing segments in the business, which is utilities and trucks where, by the way, there&#8217;s a lot of margin, and there&#8217;s nobody specifically going after those segments.</p>
<p>The Rivian engineering that I speak about is really about the hires they&#8217;ve made and a lot of things they&#8217;ve done for years in advance of getting these vehicles ready. They&#8217;ve got a lot of amazing talent from big manufacturers. They made an unusual but really smart investment in a vehicle assembly facility that they purchased for relatively cheap years ago that was owned by Mitsubishi. And they put together all these components well in advance of anybody really even knowing about them, which is really smart.</p>
<p>Obviously, there&#8217;s still a huge amount of risk. What I&#8217;m saying is not investment advice. I just think there&#8217;s a lot of interesting stuff there that&#8217;s head and shoulders above many of the other EV companies, where there&#8217;s not a lot of substance, to be candid.</p>
<p><strong>TC: My colleague Kirsten reported in December that Rivian is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/rivian-is-building-its-own-ev-charging-network-but-with-an-adventurous-twist/">developing a network of charging stations</a> along interstate highways and also at spots like hiking trails to accommodate who it imagines will be its customers. Does that make sense to you? Relatedly, how many different types of charging stations are we going to have in the world?</strong></p>
<p>[Regarding the location of its stations], it&#8217;s definitely a nice ingredient in the story they&#8217;re trying to tell, though I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll see a Rivian charger at the entry point of every national park. They&#8217;ll probably have access to other charging networks. One of the things we&#8217;re seeing in the U.S. is you have some of these dedicated networks like Tesla has, and then you have a lot of agnostic [stations], where you can plug in and charge in a lot of other places, and Rivian will likely take advantage of that. An open question would be whether Rivian builds its own [larger] dedicated network that has a lot of coverage, and I don&#8217;t know about that yet.</p>
<p>The other component about Rivian that&#8217;s really fascinating is what they do for service and maintenance. I saw an open job that Rivian had a few months ago around remote diagnostics, and one of the bullet points of the job posting was that this job was really designed so that people didn&#8217;t have to go back to the dealership. [It begs the question of]: could you design experiences digitally,  as with [on-demand remote doctor visits], where you could potentially talk to somebody live, you could [have Rivian] assess the vehicle, or maybe walk you through a situation where you can fix something that would prevent a lot of the trips to dealer?</p>
<p>If you consider the traditional dealer and OEM relationship, a lot of the ways that cars are designed is that they&#8217;re constantly having to go back to the dealer. Rivian&#8217;s point of view on that is really different, and that&#8217;s one of the other reasons it&#8217;s one to watch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://remagine.io/">Remagine</a>, a financing platform offering banking services to high-growth companies with an ‘impact’ twist, has raised €20 million ($24M) in a Seed funding round. The Berlin-based startup has been operating in stealth mode, but already has 20 clients under its former brand name &#8216;Get Conscious Growth&#8217;. Its backers include former Global Head of Google Payment Jonathan Weiner and former COO of Venmo Michael Vaughn. Remagine’s lead investor is unmade but Techcrunch understands it comprises largely of debt financing.</p>
<p>The fintech will specialize in offering revenue-based financing for high-growth and impact-led businesses, which tends to be more founder-friendly than equity or debt products, allowing them to quickly secure funding while staying in control of their business. Remagine will rollout business accounts in the coming months from its base in Germany, and plans to expand across Europe.</p>
<p>While the fashion in fintech for a while now has been ‘Neo’ or ‘challenger’ banks, there is a new breed arriving: financing platforms. These offer banking services but also offer extra features aimed at new businesses. Another example is Rho in New York, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rho-a-startup-bank-aimed-at-high-growth-businesses-raises-15m-series-a-led-by-m13-ventures/">recently</a> raised $15m.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ‘twist’ is that Remagine is going to aim at business with a ‘sustainable and impactful’ bent to their business model which might have a ‘positive social and environmental impact’. Remagine itself says it is also committing to impact-driven initiatives and will contribute 10% of its profits to impact causes.<br />
 <br />
Founded by Julia M. Profeta Johansson and Sebastian Dienst, co-CEO Dienst said in a statement: “We believe capital and technology can be forces for good. When used together, they can be powerful tools that help shape the future. The challenge now is to shape it in a way that aligns people and planet with profit,” said “We believe that every business – big and small – can be more sustainable and impactful. Remagine has been created to help them achieve this.”<br />
 <br />
Johansson added: “Having already provided financing to numerous companies, the funds raised will allow us to support many more startups towards more impact. With the upcoming launch of our accounts and cards, we’re excited to continue to grow the team, invest further in our products, and help create a world where money and business are forces for good.”<br />
 <br />
Weiner said: “Sustainability and impact have become increasingly relevant for businesses over the past decade and today, research shows that nearly four-fifths of CEOs are planning to align their business strategy with social and environmental goals.. Remagine’s mission and business model enables founders to consider both their bottom line and their impact. This is the future of financing and we’re delighted to be a part of it.”<br />
 <br />
Remagine’s products will include Team cards (unlimited separate cards for team members to improve expense management); Multi-IBANs; analytics; zero negative interest; and free accounts. It’s competitors include <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/finom-e735">Finom</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pentafintech">Penta</a>, but these tend to focus more on SMEs rather than startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Klook, the Hong Kong-based travel activities platform backed by SoftBank Vision Fund, announced the closure of $200 million in funding for its Series E round, lifting the startup&#8217;s total capital raised to date to $720 million.</p>
<p>Aspex Management, an investment fund focused on Asia Pacific led the round, alongside existing backers Sequoia Capital China, Softbank Vision Fund 1, Matrix Partners China, Boyu Capital, as well as a handful of new investors.</p>
<p>Securing sizable funding at a time the COVID-19 pandemic sacks the global economy is congratulatory, not to mention Klook is in an industry severely hit by the virus. The startup, which enables its mostly Asia-based users to book activities in overseas destinations, lost millions of orders over the first few months of travel restrictions. The company quickly regrouped for a pivot to staycation and software-as-a-service for local activity merchants, including ticketing, distribution, inventory management and marketing. Bookings subsequently rebounded.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There are things to do at home, as well as local things to do when people could travel,&#8221; co-founder and chief operating officer Eric Gnock Fah told TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/klook-post-covid/">in an interview last July</a>. &#8220;Now [the pandemic] is giving us an opportunity to add a new aspect to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The arrival of the new funding appears timely. Klook reached profitability in a number of markets by last July but overall was still in an aggressive expansion mode, it told TechCrunch at the time. Founded in 2014, Klook exceeded $1 billion in valuation in 2018 but declined to reveal its latest post-money valuation, which almost certainly has increased since it reached the unicorn status. The company currently has no plans to go public, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AZrNMNuUsZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/klook-post-covid/">COVID-19 pivot: Travel unicorn Klook sees jump in staycations</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;COVID-19 pivot: Travel unicorn Klook sees jump in staycations&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/klook-post-covid/embed/#?secret=AZrNMNuUsZ" data-secret="AZrNMNuUsZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan where COVID-19 restrictions have gradually eased, Klook said it saw increased spending on local activities, with bookings reaching near pre-COVID levels. At the height of the pandemic, Klook onboarded 150% more activities compared to the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>Today, Klook&#8217;s SaaS software powers millions of bookings for more than 2,500 merchants worldwide. With proceeds from the new investment, it will continue working on the development and roll-out of its merchant SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new capital further strengthens our leading position to take us from defense to offense, as domestic tourism becomes ubiquitous and international travel gradually returns,&#8221; said Ethan Lin, co-founder and chief executive at Klook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During a visit to India in 2014, Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos made a splashy announcement: His firm was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/30/amazon-to-invest-2b-in-its-india-marketplace-as-competition-with-flipkart-intensifies/">investing $2 billion</a> in the South Asian nation, just a year after beginning operations in the country.</p>
<p>Amazon’s announcement underscored how far India had come to open up to foreign firms. The nation, which had largely kept doors shut to international giants between its independence in 1947 to liberalization in 1991, has slowly transformed itself into the world’s largest open market.</p>
<p>In a televised interview in 2014, Bezos said that there was a perception about India not being an easy place to do business. But Amazon’s growth in the country, he said, was proof that this belief is not accurate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Are there obstacles? There are always obstacles. Anywhere you go, every country has its own regulations and rules,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Six years, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">more than $4.5 billion of additional investments later</a>, Amazon today appears to be facing more obstacles than ever in India, the second-largest internet market with more than 600 million users.</p>
<p>Long-standing laws in India have constrained Amazon, which has yet to turn a profit in the country, and other e-commerce firms to not hold inventory or sell items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.</p>
<p>India got around to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/amazon-walmart-india-e-commerce-restrictions/">fixing this loophole in late 2018</a> in a move that was widely seen as the biggest blowback to the American firm in the country at the time. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart scrambled to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/01/amazon-flipkart-india-law/">delist hundreds of thousands of items</a> from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.</p>
<p>Now the nation is set to further toughen this approach. Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/india-ecommerce-amazon-walmart/exclusive-india-plans-foreign-investment-rule-changes-that-could-hit-amazon-idUSKBN29O0XG">reported</a> last week that New Delhi is considering making adjustments to some provisions that would prevent affiliated firms to hold even an indirect stake in a seller through their parent.</p>
<p>The Confederation of All India Traders, an Indian trade body that claims to represent over 80 million businesses, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/india-ecommerce-amazon-walmart/indian-trader-group-says-minister-pledges-strict-foreign-investment-rules-for-e-commerce-idUSKBN29R1BK">told the publication</a> that Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has assured the organization that it is working to shortly address concerns about alleged violations of current rules.</p>
<p>The forthcoming policy change is only one of the many headaches for the world’s largest e-commerce firm in India.</p>

Last year, during Bezos&#8217; visit to the country, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">they held several protests</a>.

<p>Amazon is aggressively fighting a battle to block a deal between its estranged partner Future Group and Reliance Retail, the two largest retail chains in India.</p>
<p>Last year, Future Group announced that it would sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">to Reliance Retail for $3.4 billion</a>. Amazon, which in 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/amazon-future-coupons/">bought stakes in one of Future Group’s unlisted firms</a>, says that the Indian firm has breached its contract (which would have given Amazon the right to first refusal) and engaged in insider trading.</p>
<p>Despite technology giants and investors ploughing more than $20 billion to create an e-commerce market in India in the past decade, online retail still accounts for only a single-digit pie of all retail in the country.</p>
<p>In recent years, Amazon, Walmart and scores of other startups have embraced this realization and sought to work with neighborhood stores that dot tens of thousands of cities, towns and villages in India.</p>

<p>With Reliance Retail and telecom giant Jio Platforms, two subsidiaries of one of India’s largest corporates (Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities/">entering the e-commerce market</a>, and receiving the backing of global giants including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/india-approves-googles-4-5-billion-deal-with-reliances-jio-platforms/">Facebook and Google last year</a>, cornering a big stake in Future Group is one of the few ways Amazon can accelerate its growth in India.</p>
<p>The American e-commerce firm has had little luck so far in overturning the deal between the Indian firms. Last year, Amazon reached out to Indian antitrust body Competition Commission of India, and market regulator SEBI to block this transaction. Both the bodies have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/bse-sebi-amazon-reliance-retail-future-india/">ruled in favor</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/india-approves-reliances-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-brings-a-new-headache-to-amazon/">Future Group and Reliance Retail</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon must have foreseen this outcome because it initiated the legal proceedings at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/amazon-legal-notice-india-future-group-deal-reliance-retail/">an arbitration court in Singapore</a>. It’s no surprise that the firm chose to also pursue its legal argument outside of India.</p>
<p>Most cases that reach the Singapore International Arbitration Court have <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/12/12/why-more-indian-business-disputes-are-settled-elsewhere">come from India</a> in recent years. Vodafone, which has invested more than $20 billion in India, and has been dealt with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/vodafone-idea-shares-tumble-23-after-india-orders-it-to-pay-billions-in-dues/">billions of dollars in unpaid taxes by the country</a>, is another high-profile name to have knocked on the door in Singapore. After losing in India, it emerged victorious in the Singapore arbitration court last year.</p>
<p>Amazon on Monday <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Amazon-moves-Delhi-HC-to-enforce-Singapore-order-and-block-Reliance-Future-deal/articleshow/80453045.cms">filed a new petition</a> in Delhi High Court in which it is seeking to enforce SIAC&#8217;s ruling (which ordered last year that the deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/reliance-says-its-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-fully-enforceable-under-indian-law-despite-amazon-winning-an-arbitration-order/">should be temporarily halted</a>) and prevent the Indian firm from going ahead with the deal based on CCI and SEBI’s judgements.</p>
<p>The company alleges that Future Group “deliberately and maliciously” disobeyed the international arbitration ruling from SIAC. In its petition, Amazon is also seeking detention of Kishore Biyani, the founder and chairman of Future Group.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Vocal for Local&#8221;</h2>
<p>As India grappled with containing the spread of the coronavirus last year, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the 1.3 billion citizens to make the country “self-reliant” and “be vocal for local.”</p>
<p>The move to turn inwards contrasts with his major promise in the first few years of assuming power in 2014 when he pledged to make India more welcoming to foreign firms than before. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/technology/india-technology-american-giants.html">recent years</a>, India has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/23/india-modi-silicon-valley-future-internet/">proposed or enforced several regulations</a> that hurt American firms, though none appear to suffer as much as Amazon.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Last year, New Delhi started to enforce a 2% tax on all foreign billings for digital services provided in the country. The U.S. Trade Representative said earlier this month that India was taxing numerous categories of digital services that are “not leviable under other digital services taxes adopted around the world.”</span></p>
<p>The aggregate tax bill for U.S. companies could exceed $30 million per year in India, USTR’s investigation found. In conclusion, it found India’s digital tax move to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/us-says-india-italy-and-turkey-digital-taxes-are-discriminatory-but-wont-take-any-actions-for-now/">inconsistent with international tax principles</a>, unreasonable and burdening or restricting U.S. commerce.</p>
<p>Modi’s new way of life for India will be music to the ears of Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, an ally of the prime minister and India&#8217;s richest man.</p>
<p>Before selling stakes worth over $20 billion in Jio Platforms and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/reliance-retail-raises-1-3-billion-from-pif/">more than $6 billion in Reliance Retail</a> to marquee foreign investors, Ambani famously made a speech in 2019 in which he urged the need to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/18/in-india-amazon-and-walmart-face-off-against-the-countrys-richest-man/">protect Indians’ data in patriotic terms</a>.</p>
<p>“We have to collectively launch a new movement against data colonization. For India to succeed in this data-driven revolution, we will have to migrate the control and ownership of Indian data back to India &#8212; in other words, Indian wealth back to every Indian,” he said.</p>
<p>Why so many international firms have invested in one of Reliance’s properties remains a big question. A senior executive at an American firm told TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity (out of fear of retribution) that the investments in Jio Platforms, which is India’s largest telecom network with nearly 410 million subscribers, and Reliance Retail is a déjà vu moment for the nation, where a few decades ago one of the only ways to do business in the nation was to partner with a local firm with massive political clout.</p>
<p>In a series of tweets, <a href="https://twitter.com/tame_wildcard/status/1283352570614841344">Raman Chima</a>, a former policy executive at Google and who now works at nonprofit digital advocacy group Access Now, alleged that the Android-maker had weighed in 2011-12 partnering and investing in a firm like Reliance to “turn-the-page on Indian political risks.”</p>
<p>The idea prompted concerns about Google’s values, he claimed. “More than one executive involved in those discussions flagged concerns around Reliance’s reputation, particularly around problematic approaches towards gaining influence with policymaking civil servants and politicians, money, ethics in govt-business relationships.”</p>
<p>Amazon itself was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/amazon-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-a-9-9-stake-in-indias-reliance-retail/">rumored</a> to be interested in getting a multi-billion-dollar stake in Reliance Retail last year, but it appears the two firms have stopped engaging on any matter.</p>

<p>While Amazon sorts out these issues, last week delivered another blow to the firm. A senior executive with the firm as well as Indian makers of a mini-series for Amazon Prime Video are under threat of criminal prosecution in the country after Modi’s ruling party deemed the show offensive to the country’s Hindu majority.</p>
<p>A Hindu nationalist group, politicians with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and a BJP group representing members of India’s lower castes, were among those who had filed police reports against the nine-part mini-series “Tandav” and Amazon. The company bowed to the pressure and edited out some scenes.</p>
<p>“The true reason for the complaints against &#8216;Tandav&#8217; may be that the show holds up a mirror uncomfortably close to Indian society and some of the problems blamed on Mr. Modi’s administration. In the opening episode, the show features protesting students and disgruntled farmers, echoing events that have taken place in recent months,” The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/22/business/india-amazon-tandav.html">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>“Mirzapur,” another show of Amazon, also attracted a criminal complaint in India last week for hurting religious and regional sentiments and defaming the Indian town. The Indian Supreme Court has <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-notice-to-mirzapur-makers-amazon-prime-video-on-plea-over-portrayal-of-up-district-in-bad-light-101611211829348.html">issued notices</a> to the makers of “Mirzapur” and has sought responses.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned interview, Bezos said Amazon&#8217;s job was to follow all the unique rules various countries require it to comply with and &#8220;adapt our business practice to those rules.”</p>
<p>In India, the company is increasingly being asked how far it is willing to adapt its business practice. How far is it willing to bend that it&#8217;s no longer the Amazon people care about?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blackberry and Chinese search engine giant Baidu have agreed to expand a partnership that aims to give automakers the tools they need to launch next-generation connected and autonomous vehicles in China.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Baidu&#8217;s high-definition maps will be integrated into Blackberry&#8217;s QNX Neutrino Real-Time Operating System. The embedded system will be mass produced in the upcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the electric vehicle arm of GAC Group, one of the country&#8217;s top three automakers that produces more 2 million vehicles a year.</p>
<p>The aim of this new, expanded partnership is to &#8220;provide car manufacturers with a clear and fast path to the production of autonomous vehicles, with safety and security as the top priority,&#8221; according to a statement from Wang Yunpeng, senior director of the technology department of Baidu&#8217;s Intelligent Driving Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership between Baidu and Blackberry is notable because it inserts a foreign operating system into Chinese-made vehicles even as the government there has called for native tech.</p>
<p>Blackberry&#8217;s QNX software handles the functional safety, network security and reliability pieces, while Baidu has invested in the development of artificial intelligence and deep learning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together, we can help car manufacturers quickly produce safe autonomous vehicles and promote the development collaboratively of the intelligent networked automobile industry,&#8221; Yunpeng said.</p>
<p>Blackberry, once the dominate force in the smart phone industry, has found success getting its QNX technology into vehicles. Today, the software is used in the advanced driver assistance, digital instrument clusters and infotainment systems of more than 175 million vehicles.</p>
<p>The agreement builds on the two companies January 2018 agreement to make BlackBerry QNX&#8217;s operating system the foundation for Baidu&#8217;s &#8216;Apollo&#8217; autonomous driving open platform.</p>
<p>The deal with Baidu also helps Blackberry continue to carve out market share in China, where it&#8217;s a more recent entrant. Last year, Blackberry announced QNX would be integrated into Tesla rival Xpeng&#8217;s electric vehicles in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;With BlackBerry QNX&#8217;s embedded software as its foundation, Baidu has made significant progress as part of its Apollo platform in establishing a commercial ecosystem for innovative technologies that OEMs can leverage for their next generation vehicles,&#8221; Dhiraj Handa, vice president of channel, partners and APAC, BlackBerry Technology Solutions, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Baidu&#8217;s autonomous driving program, known as Apollo, has been described as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/baidus-apollo-platform-becomes-the-android-of-the-autonomous-driving-industry/">“an Android for smart driving.</a>&#8221; The Apollo program has landed more than hundred manufacturing and supplier partners. Baidu has also been busy testing autonomous driving and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3101168/baidu-opens-its-robotaxis-public-beijing-making-it-third-city-china">launch a robotaxi fleet</a> in September.</p>
<p>The deal also comes on the heels of Baidu&#8217;s push beyond automotive software and into the production of vehicles. Baidu announced earlier this month that it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/baidu-electric-car-making/">set up a new company</a> to produce electric vehicles with the help of Chinese automaker Geely. Baidu will provide so-called smart driving technologies while Geely handles will the design, engineering and manufacturing of the vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden said Monday the U.S. government would replace the entire federal fleet of cars, trucks and SUVs with electric vehicles manufactured in the United States, a commitment tied to a broader campaign promise to create 1 million new jobs in the American auto industry and supply chains.</p>
<p>The commitment, if it bears out, could give a boost to U.S. automakers, particularly those that have diverse portfolios that include passenger cars, commercial vans and light trucks.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Biden made the comments prior to signing the Made in America executive order, which places stricter rules on the federal government&#8217;s procurement practices. The government has existing &#8220;buy American&#8221; rules, which states that a certain amount of a product must be made in the U.S. for a purchase to qualify for a federal contract.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Biden said this order closes loopholes and aims to increase purchases of products made in the United States. The executive order increases that product threshold and the price preference for domestic goods — meaning the difference in price from which the government can buy a product for a non-U.S. supplier. It also updates the process for how the government decides if a product was sufficiently made in America.</p>
<p>In the midst of his speech, Biden said the buy American directive would extend to the federal government&#8217;s massive fleet of vehicles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal government also owns an enormous fleet of vehicles, which we&#8217;re going to replace with clean electric vehicles made right here in America, by American workers, creating millions of jobs — a million auto worker jobs.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM targets delivery companies with new EV business unit BrightDrop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/embed/#?secret=9LwXrS4vS6" data-secret="9LwXrS4vS6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The opportunity is a large one. The U.S. government had more than 645,000 vehicles in its fleet in 2019, the <a href="https://d2d.gsa.gov/report/federal-fleet-open-data-visualization">most recent data available</a> from the General Services Agency. Of those, about 224,000 are passenger vehicles and more than 412,000 are trucks.</p>
<p>&#8220;GSA is committed to exploring opportunities to leverage the purchasing and leasing power of the federal government to address the climate crisis, including greening the federal fleet,&#8221; a GSA spokesperson told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. &#8220;GSA currently manages over 224,000 passenger vehicles in its fleet to support the Federal Government’s mission. By leveraging clean energy vehicle technologies, GSA will support the President’s climate goals, while working with the American automotive manufacturing industry to ensure that these next generation vehicles are built in America by American workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The directive won&#8217;t be easy to fulfill. Many of these federal vehicles are leased, which could slow the transition depending on the contract lengths. There are other obstacles, including charging infrastructure and supply. And while it doesn&#8217;t appear to be a requirement, Biden has publicly stated numerous times — including Monday — that he supports union automotive jobs.</p>
<p>Tesla is considered the dominant U.S. manufacturer of electric vehicles. However, the company&#8217;s lack of union workers and the higher cost of its vehicles — even the less expensive Model 3 — could be a barrier.</p>
<p>Ford and GM might not have a vast supply of electric vehicles at the moment, but they do have union shops and both automakers are investing heavily to expand their EV offerings.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">GM launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">new business unit</a> earlier this month to offer commercial customers an ecosystem of electric and connected products as part of the company’s $27 billion bid to become a leading electric automaker. The new business, called BrightDrop, will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimate range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1.</p>
<p>GM has said it plans to bring 30 new electric vehicles to a global market through 2025. More than two-thirds of those launches will be available in North America and every one of GM’s brands, including Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet and Buick, will be represented, according to the automaker.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ford revealed in November a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/ford-unveils-e-transit-its-45000-electric-workhorse/">configurable all-electric cargo</a> van called the E-Transit as part of its $11.5 billion investment in electrification. Ford has largely focused its electrification efforts on the consumer market, notably the Mustang Mach-E. The E-Transit, which will be built at its Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, Missouri, is aimed at the commercial sector.</p>

<p>There are a growing number of newer EV entrants as well, including Rivian, Lordstown Motors and Fisker. Rivian is expected to begin producing and delivering its electric pickup truck in July, followed by its all-electric SUV. Rivian is also developing and assembling electric vans for Amazon.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s call to transform the fleet supports statements he made throughout his campaign. Biden pledged to &#8220;use all the levers of the federal government,&#8221; including purchasing power, R&amp;D, tax, trade, and investment policies to position the U.S. to be the global leader in the manufacture of electric vehicles and their input materials and parts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the United Kingdom <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prepares to sharpen its focus</a> on how it regulates big tech companies, Facebook is taking a big step up in the role it plays in presenting media to the U.K. public, and into how it works with the country&#8217;s media industry.</p>
<p>Today it is launching Facebook News in the U.K., Facebook&#8217;s first market outside of the U.S. for its dedicated, curated news portal &#8212; accessed, like the U.S. version, through a tab in the Android or iOS app menu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical alignright size-large wp-image-2100449" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png?w=311" alt="" width="311" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png 574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png?resize=137,300 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png?resize=311,680 311w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-26-at-12.05.33-AM.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" />The portal will launch with content from hundreds of local and national media organizations including Channel 4 <span class="il">News</span>, Daily Mail Group, DC Thomson, Financial Times, Sky <span class="il">News and</span> Telegraph Media Group. The Economist, The Guardian, The Independent, STV and hundreds of local <span class="il">news</span> sites from Archant, Iliffe, JPI Media, Midlands <span class="il">News</span> Association, and Reach, as well as &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; titles GQ, Cosmopolitan, Glamour, Vogue and others were<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/launching-facebook-news-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> announced</a> in an earlier list of partners last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Again, as with the U.S. version, users will be provided a list of curated top stories of the day; a list of personalized stories based on news sources you might already follow or interests you have (these might be from publications you don&#8217;t already follow); and dedicated news sections for sports, entertainment, health and science and technology. Users can indicate when they like stories, or when they want to hide them to train the algorithms better.</p>
<p>Facebook has confirmed to us that it will be working with a service called Upday to curate<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the stories that appear </span><span class="il" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">on News. &#8220;T</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he product is a mix of curated, top stories and personalized links chosen by algorithm,&#8221; a spokesperson said. Upday appears to be a <a href="https://www.axelspringer.com/en/brands/upday-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint collaboration</a> between </span>German publisher Axel Springer and Samsung, which also <a href="http://upday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">runs a news service</a> on its phones powered by it.</p>
<p>It is not clear what the financial terms of the deal is between Facebook and Upday, but <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/01/facebook-to-pay-uk-media-millions-to-licence-news-stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, the licensing deals Facebook is cutting with publishers to place their content in News collectively run into the tens of millions of pounds, with the biggest publishers making millions a year from the the agreements. While those figures might pale to what Facebook makes in ad revenues globally &#8212; that reaches into the tens of billions of dollars quarterly &#8212; they represent significant sums for the beleaguered U.K. media industry.</span></p>
<p>People have long used newsfeeds on Facebook and other social sites to catch up with news while also browsing posts from friends, Groups and Pages that they follow. Facebook News aims to take that a step further, as a curated page for links and headlines from hundreds of publications in the country to provide users of its mobile apps a one-stop place to read the stories of the moment.</p>
<p>Social media continues to be a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/bad-news-social-media/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major source of news for consumers</a>, but as we&#8217;ve seen, a very skewed and flawed source at that.</p>
<p>Within that context, Facebook says that its intention with Facebook News is to provide a more balanced and dedicated mix of news to people beyond what they might encounter in their newsfeeds, while also tailoring it to users&#8217; interests.</p>
<p>It also helps that Facebook News provides yet another way for Facebook &#8212; which has made efforts in video, entertainment content, mentoring and job-hunting, Nextdoor-style community listings, peer-to-peer selling, and more &#8212; to continue diversifying away from the Newsfeed for those who have grown bored with that: now, people can come to the Facebook app to browse news, too.</p>
<p>Still, this international expansion has been a long time coming: Facebook News first launched as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/facebook-news-tab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test in the US more than a year ago, in October 2019</a>, before rolling out to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/facebook-news-launches-to-all-in-u-s-with-addition-of-local-news-and-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all users last June</a>.</p>
<p>No word from Facebook on how many users or engagement the U.S. version of Facebook News has picked up, except that &#8220;it has grown steadily,&#8221; according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why there&#8217;s been such a long gap between its first efforts in the U.S. and the U.K. launch today, but Facebook has had more going on in addition to securing those licensing deals to roll out in this market.</p>
<p>L<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">aunching a new news portal, with the message that it&#8217;s designed to &#8220;help&#8221; publishers, takes on a new dimension when you consider that</span> Facebook has also been i<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">n the crosshairs of regulators in Europe, who have been on a long-term mission to scrutinize the reach of big tech companies. In the UK, that is soon taking the form of a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;pro-competition&#8221; Digital Market Unit</a> that will re-examine the role companies like Facebook and Google play in advertising, media and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whether those regulatory moves will impact how a service like Facebook News works, or what revenue cuts and usage data are shared with news partners, remains to be seen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the meantime, it&#8217;s full speed ahead for more scaling: Facebook </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/facebook-news-to-expand-internationally-to-the-u-k-germany-france-india-and-brazil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed plans last year</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that its long-term aim is for a bigger international expansion for Facebook News, with the longer list of countries including Brazil, France, Germany, and India. In a blog post today, Facebook&#8217;s director of news partnerships in Europe, Jesper Doub, confirmed France and Germany were next in line for Facebook News, although no launch dates were specified.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If social networks and other platforms are to get a handle on disinformation, it&#8217;s not enough to know what it is — you have to know how people react to it. Researchers at MIT and Cornell have some surprising but subtle findings that may affect how Twitter and Facebook should go about treating this problematic content.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/false-news-fact-check-timing-0125">MIT&#8217;s contribution</a> is a counterintuitive one. When someone encounters a misleading headline in their timeline, the logical thing to do would be to put a warning before it so that the reader knows it&#8217;s disputed from the start. Turns out that&#8217;s not quite the case.</p>
<p>The study of nearly 3,000 people had them evaluating the accuracy of headlines after receiving different (or no) warnings about them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Going into the project, I had anticipated it would work best to give the correction beforehand, so that people already knew to disbelieve the false claim when they came into contact with it. To my surprise, we actually found the opposite,&#8221; said study co-author David Rand in an MIT news article. &#8220;Debunking the claim after they were exposed to it was the most effective.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Tv7mh8bBYj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/why-the-world-must-pay-attention-to-the-fight-against-disinformation-and-fake-news-in-taiwan/">Why the world must pay attention to the fight against disinformation and fake news in Taiwan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why the world must pay attention to the fight against disinformation and fake news in Taiwan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/07/why-the-world-must-pay-attention-to-the-fight-against-disinformation-and-fake-news-in-taiwan/embed/#?secret=Tv7mh8bBYj" data-secret="Tv7mh8bBYj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When a person was warned beforehand that the headline was misleading, they improved in their classification accuracy by 5.7%. When the warning came simultaneously with the headline, that improvement grew to 8.6%. But if shown the warning afterwards, they were 25% better. In other words, debunking beat &#8220;prebunking&#8221; by a fair margin.</p>
<p>The team speculated as to the cause of this, suggesting that it fits with other indications that people are more likely to incorporate feedback into a preexisting judgment rather than alter that judgment as it&#8217;s being formed. They warned that the problem is far deeper than a tweak like this can fix.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no single magic bullet that can cure the problem of misinformation,&#8221; said co-author Adam Berinsky. &#8220;Studying basic questions in a systematic way is a critical step toward a portfolio of effective solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/01/people-follow-crowd-no-matter-its-politics">The study from Cornell</a> is equal parts reassuring and frustrating. People viewing potentially misleading information were reliably influenced by the opinions of large groups — whether or not those groups were politically aligned with the reader.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reassuring because it suggests that people are willing to trust that if 80 out of 100 people thought a story was a little fishy, even if 70 of those 80 were from the other party, there might just be something to it. It&#8217;s frustrating because of how seemingly easy it is to sway an opinion simply by saying that a large group thinks it&#8217;s one way or the other.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BUER0op1i6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/biden-campaign-facebook-letter-trump-jr-army-for-trump/">Ringing alarm bells, Biden campaign calls Facebook &#8216;foremost propagator&#8217; of voting disinformation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ringing alarm bells, Biden campaign calls Facebook &#8216;foremost propagator&#8217; of voting disinformation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/biden-campaign-facebook-letter-trump-jr-army-for-trump/embed/#?secret=BUER0op1i6" data-secret="BUER0op1i6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In a practical way, we’re showing that people’s minds can be changed through social influence independent of politics,&#8221; said graduate student Maurice Jakesch, lead author of the paper. &#8220;This opens doors to use social influence in a way that may de-polarize online spaces and bring people together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Partisanship still played a role, it must be said — people were about 21% less likely to have their view swayed if the group opinion was led by people belonging to the other party. But even so, people were very likely to be affected by the group&#8217;s judgment.</p>
<p>Part of why misinformation is so prevalent is because we don&#8217;t really understand why it&#8217;s so appealing to people, and what measures reduce that appeal, among other simple questions. As long as social media is blundering around in darkness they&#8217;re unlikely to stumble upon a solution, but every study like this makes a little more light.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter pilots a new tool to fight disinformation, Apple brings celebrity-guided walks to the Apple Watch and Clubhouses raises funding. This is your Daily Crunch for January 25, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Twitter unveils Birdwatch</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/twitters-birdwatch-fights-misinformation-with-community-notes/">Twitter launched a new product</a> today that it says will offer &#8220;a community-based approach to misinformation.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Birdwatch, users will be able to flag tweets that they find misleading, write notes to add context to those tweets and rate the notes written by others. This is supposed to be a complement to the existing system where Twitter removes or labels particularly problematic tweets, rather than a replacement.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen: How Twitter will handle it when two or more people get locked into a battle and post a flurry of conflicting notes about whether a tweet is misleading or not.</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/latch/">Latch</a> becomes the latest company to join the SPAC parade. Founded in 2014, the New York-based company came out of stealth two years later, launching a smart lock system. Though, like many companies primarily known for hardware solutions, Latch says it’s more, offering a connected security software platform for owners of apartment buildings.</p>
<p>The company is set to go public courtesy of a merger with blank check company TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp. As far as partners go, Tishman Speyer Properties makes strategic sense here. The New York-based commercial real estate firm is a logical partner for a company whose technology is currently deployed exclusively in residential apartment buildings.</p>
<p>“With a standard IPO, you have all of the banks take you out to all of the big investors,” Latch founder and CEO Luke Schoenfelder tells TechCrunch. “We felt like there was an opportunity here to have an extra level of strategic partnership and an extra level of product expansion that came as part of the process. Our ability to go into Europe and commercial offices is now accelerated meaningfully because of this partnership.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The number of SPAC deals has increased substantially over the past several months, including recent examples like Taboola. According to Crunchbase, Latch has raised $152 million, to date. And the company has seen solid growth over the past year &#8212; not something every hardware or hardware adjacent company can say about the pandemic.</p>
<p>As my colleague Alex noted on Extra Crunch today, “Doing some quick match, Latch grew booked revenues 50.5% from 2019 to 2020. Its booked software revenues grew 37.1%, while its booked hardware top line expanded over 70% during the same period.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been a customer and investor in Latch for years,” Tishman Speyer President and CEO Rob Speyer tells TechCrunch. “Our customers &#8212; the people who live in our buildings &#8212; love the Latch product. So we’ve rolled it out across our residential portfolio […] I hope we can act as both a thought partner and product incubator for them.”</p>
<p>While the company plans to expand to commercial offices, apartment buildings have been a nice vertical thus far &#8212; meaning the company doesn’t have to compete as directly in the crowded smart home lock category. Among other things, it’s probably a net positive if you’re going head to head against, say Amazon. That the company has built in partners in real estate firms like Tishman Speyer is also a net positive.</p>
<p>Schoenfelder says the company is looking toward such partnerships as test beds for its technology. “Our products have been in the field for many years in multifamily. The usage patterns are going to be slightly different in commercial offices. We think we know how they’re going to be different, but being able to get them up and running and observe the interaction with products in the wild is going to be really important.”</p>
<p>The deal values Latch at $1.56 billion and is expected to close in Q2.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Three years ago, we released the first edition of the Matrix Fintech Index. We believed then, as we do now, that fintech represents one of the most exciting major innovation cycles of this decade. In 2020, all the long-term trends forcing change in this sector continued and even accelerated.</p>
<p>The broad movement away from credit toward debit, particularly among younger consumers, represents one such macro shift. However, the pandemic also created new, unforeseen drivers. Among them, millennials decamped from their rentals in crowded cities to accelerate their first home purchases to the benefit of proptech companies and challenger mortgage players alike.</p>
<p>E-commerce saw an enormous acceleration in growth rates, furthering adoption of online payments platforms. Lastly, low interest rates and looming inflation helped pave the way for the price of Bitcoin to charge toward $30,000. In short, multiple tailwinds combined to produce a blockbuster year for the category.</p>
<p>In this year’s refresh of the Matrix Fintech Index, we’ll divide our attention into three parts. First, a look at the public stocks’ performance. Second, liquidity. Third, we highlight one major trend in the sector: Buy Now Pay Later, or BNPL.</p>
<h2>Public fintech stocks rose 97% in 2020</h2>
<p>For the fourth straight year, the publicly traded fintechs massively outperformed the incumbent financial services providers as well as every mainstream stock index. While the underlying performance of these companies was strong, the pandemic further bolstered results as consumers avoided appearing in-person for both shopping and banking. Instead, they sought &#8212; and found &#8212; digital alternatives.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Our own representation of the public fintechs’ performance is the Matrix Fintech Index &#8212; a market cap-weighted index that tracks the progress of a portfolio of 25 leading public fintech companies. The Matrix fintech Index rose 97% in 2020, compared to a 14% rise in the S&amp;P 500 and a 10% drop for the incumbent financial service companies over the same time period.</p>

<p>E-commerce undoubtedly stood out as a major driver. As a category, retail e-commerce grew 35% YoY as of Q3, propelling PayPal and Shopify to add over $160 billion of market capitalization over the year. For its part, PayPal in the third quarter signed up 15 million net new active accounts (its highest ever).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
