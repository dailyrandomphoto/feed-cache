										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nasir Qadree, a Washington-based investor who just raised $62.1 million for his debut venture fund, recently told us that as his fundraising gained momentum, he was approached by established firms that are looking to absorb new talent.</p>
<p>He opted to go it alone, but he’s hardly alone in attracting interest. Anecdotally, bringing emerging managers into the fold is among the newer ways that powerful venture firms stay powerful. Early last year, for example, crypto investor Arianna Simpson &#8212; who founded and was managing her own crypto-focused hedge fund &#8212; was lured into the heavyweight firm Andreessen Horowitz as a deal partner.</p>
<p>Andy Chen, a one-time CIA weapons analyst who spent more than seven years with Kleiner Perkins, was in the process of raising his own fund in 2018 when another prominent firm, the hedge fund Coatue, came knocking. Today he helps lead the firm’s early-stage investing practice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to understand the appeal of such firms, which manage enormous funds and wield tremendous power with founders. Still, as older firms look to recruit from a widening pool of new managers, they might have to wait on the most talented of the bunch; in some cases, they might be out of luck entirely.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nasir Qadree just announced one of the largest debut funds for a solo VC&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/nasir-qadree-grew-up-in-the-projects-now-hes-announcing-one-the-largest-debut-funds-for-a-solo-vc/embed/#?secret=nuuqMQ4djB" data-secret="nuuqMQ4djB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There is, of course, a long list of reasons that so many people are deciding to raise funds these days, from the glut of capital looking to make its way into startups, to tools like Angelist&#8217;s <a href="https://www.angellist.com/blog/rolling-venture-fund-launch">Rolling Funds</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/vc-democratization/">revised regulations</a> around crowdfunding in the U.S.</p>
<p>Emerging managers also seem adept at capitalizing on the venture industry’s blind spots. One is the excessive wealth of more veteran VCs. An investor&#8217;s experience counts for a lot, but there’s a lot to be said for up-and-comers who are still establishing their reputation, who aren’t sitting on more than a dozen boards, and whose future will be closely aligned with their founders.</p>
<p>Yet there are other trends the establishment has long overlooked for too long. Many firms probably regret not taking crypto <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-29-year-old-crypto-billionaire-has-goldman-cme-group-in-his-crosshairs-as-his-exchanges-aims-to-surpass-coinbase-11626278939">more seriously sooner</a>. Many male-heavy teams have also ignored for too long the soaring economic power of women, which new managers are driving home to their own investors.</p>
<p>Not last, many have stubbornly resisted racially diversifying their ranks, creating an opening for investors of color who are acutely aware of changing demographics. According to census projections, white Americans will represent a minority of the U.S. population within 20 years, meaning today’s racial minorities are becoming the primary engine of the country’s growth.</p>
<p>That new managers have shaken up the industry is arguably a good thing. The question some are beginning to wonder is whether they can maintain their independence, and that answer isn&#8217;t yet clear.</p>
<p>Like the startups they fund, many of these new managers are right now operating in the shadows of the firms that came before them. It&#8217;s a seemingly copacetic arrangement, too. Venture is an industry where collaboration between business competitors is inescapable after all, and it’s easy to stay on the good side of giant firms when you’re investing a non-threatening amount into nascent companies you’ll later introduce to the bigger players.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bobby Goodlatte has designs on how to succeed in venture (and so far, so good)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/bobby-goodlatte-has-designs-on-how-to-succeed-in-venture-and-so-far-so-good/embed/#?secret=BuvMGxYkYr" data-secret="BuvMGxYkYr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ensuring that things remain harmonious &#8212; and that deal flow keeps coming &#8212; a growing number of venture firms now plays the role of limited partner, committing capital to new managers. Foundry Group was among the first to do this in an institutionalized way five years ago, setting aside <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/19/foundry-group-just-closed-its-sixth-fund-with-a-record-500-million/">25% of a new fund</a> to pour into smaller venture funds. But it’s happening routinely across the industry. Jake Paul’s new influencer-focused fund? Backed by Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz. Katie Stanton’s Moxxie Ventures?<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/bvc_fund_nine/"> Backed</a> by Bain Capital Ventures.</p>
<p>The running joke is that big firms have raised so much money they don&#8217;t know where to plug all of it, but they&#8217;re also safeguarding what they&#8217;ve built. That was the apparent thinking in 2015, when a then-beleaguered Kleiner Perkins tried to engage in merger talks with Social Capital, a buzzed-about venture firm founded by Chamath Palihapitiya. (The deal reportedly fell apart over who would ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/why-the-kleiner-social-capital-deal-fell-apart/">run the show</a>. Kleiner subsequent underwent a nearly complete <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/kleiner-perkins-early-stage/">management change</a> to regain its footing, while numerous members of Social Capital left to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/05/tribe-capital/">start Tribe Capital</a>.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also why we might see more venture firms begin to gauge the interest of new fund managers who they think could add value to their brand.</p>
<p>Likely, some will say yes for the sheen and economics of a big firm and because teaming up can be far easier than going it alone. Early-stage investor Semil Shah &#8212; who has built up his <a href="https://haystack.vc/">own firm</a> while also working as a <a href="https://lsvp.com/team/">venture partner</a> with different, established outfits (including, currently, Lightspeed Venture Partners) &#8212; thinks it&#8217;s &#8220;natural to assume that lots of new rolling funds&#8221; in particular will either &#8220;burn out, stay small, or try to scale and realize how hard it is, and perhaps go to a bigger firm once they have established a track record.&#8221;</p>
<p>If true, it&#8217;s not a scenario that&#8217;s as widely embraced as some might imagine. Eric Bahn, who cofounded the Bay Area-based seed-stage firm Hustle Fund in 2017, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/ericbahn/status/1412257757206519809?s=20">predicted last week on Twitter</a>&lt; that &#8220;establishment VC funds will acquire emerging VC funds, who are building differentiated networks/brands.&#8221; While in a different era, that might be seen as a cushy landing, Bahn added: &#8220;Not sure how I feel about this. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&#8221;</p>
<p>He also later tweeted that &#8220;to be unequivocal, Hustle Fund is not for sale.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PyFEmWBD5N"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/jake-paul-looks-to-knock-out-the-venture-capital-world-with-anti-fund/">Jake Paul looks to knock out the venture capital world with Anti Fund</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jake Paul looks to knock out the venture capital world with Anti Fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/jake-paul-looks-to-knock-out-the-venture-capital-world-with-anti-fund/embed/#?secret=PyFEmWBD5N" data-secret="PyFEmWBD5N" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For his part, Bahn says he&#8217;s &#8220;nervous about industry consolidation.&#8221; There have been &#8220;systemic issues with VCs being exclusionary in the past when it comes to women and other underrepresented groups.&#8221; He adds that even more recently he has &#8220;met LPs who &#8212; wink wink &#8212; really like men who come from Stanford and have computer science degrees,&#8221; leading him to fret that even a team with &#8220;good intentions can revert back to the mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>An industry friend of Bahn, Lolita Taub of <a href="https://thecommunity.vc/">The Community Fund</a> &#8212;  a $5 million early-stage fund that is focused on community-themed startups and backed by the Boston-based seed-stage venture firm Flybridge &#8212; is more sanguine about emerging managers&#8217; ability to remain independent. Rather than gobble up smaller funds, she foresees more established players begin to fund &#8212; and nurture &#8212; emerging funds that have overlapping areas of interest.</p>
<p>Taub suggests that it&#8217;s the next step beyond VCs who&#8217;ve worked with so-called scouts to find undiscovered gems. &#8220;I think older players are looking to expand their reach beyond what they know.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZUUMLQBSAp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/a-peek-inside-sequoia-capitals-low-flying-wide-reaching-scout-program/">A peek inside Sequoia Capital&#8217;s low-flying, wide-reaching scout program</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A peek inside Sequoia Capital&#8217;s low-flying, wide-reaching scout program&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/a-peek-inside-sequoia-capitals-low-flying-wide-reaching-scout-program/embed/#?secret=ZUUMLQBSAp" data-secret="ZUUMLQBSAp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Both may be right. Either way, the industry is changing shape and some form of consolidation, though not imminent, seems inevitable once the checks inevitably stop flying. Some firms will break out, while others team up. Some managers will find themselves at top firms, while others close up shop.</p>
<p>Almost the only certainty right now is that a larger fund &#8220;buying&#8221; a smaller fund is &#8220;not that complicated,&#8221; according to fund administration expert Bob Raynard of Standish Management in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Asked about the mechanics of such tie-ups, he shares that it &#8220;generally involves changing or adding members at the GP entity level [leading to a] change in control of the funds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe, too, he says, there is a rebranding.</p>
<p>The real challenge, suggests Raynard, is just &#8220;getting two VCs to agree on a value.&#8221; And that depends entirely on their other options.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital payments giant Paytm, one of India’s most valuable startups, plans to raise up to $2.2 billion in an initial public offering, it said in draft papers submitted to the country&#8217;s market regulator on Friday.</p>
<p>The Noida-headquartered firm &#8212; backed by Alibaba, Berkshire Hathaway, and SoftBank among others &#8212; <a href="https://listing.bseindia.com/download/350845/DRHP%20-%20One%2097%20Communications%20Limited_20210716130427.pdf">said</a> (PDF) it will issue new shares worth $1.1 billion and offer sale worth of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>The startup, which competes with PhonePe and Google Pay in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, plans to use the fresh capital of $577 million to broaden its payments services offering and about $269 million to enter into new initiatives and explore acquisition opportunities, it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Paytm, which was launched in 2009 to help users easily make digital payments from their phones, has expanded to a wide-range of services in the past decade. Today it operates a payments gateway, e-commerce marketplace, ticket booking, and also sells insurance and digital gold. In several of the categories where it operates, Paytm is a market leader.</p>
<p>The startup, formally known as One97 Communications and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">last valued at $16 billion</a>, platform has amassed over 333 million users, 114.3 million of whom transact annually, and has onboarded over 21 million merchants, it said in the papers today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have created a payments-led super-app, through which we offer our consumers innovative and intuitive digital products and services,&#8221; the Vijay Shekhar Sharma-led describes itself.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178465" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178465 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="420" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg?resize=300,123 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg?resize=768,315 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg?resize=680,279 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/paytm-offering.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178465" class="wp-caption-text">A look at Paytm&#8217;s numbers shared with market regulator on Friday (Paytm)</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We offer our consumers a wide selection of payment options on the Paytm app, which include (i) Paytm Payment Instruments, which allow them to use digital wallets, sub-wallets, bank accounts, buy-now-pay-later and wealth management accounts and (ii) major third-party instruments, such as debit and credit cards and net banking,&#8221;</p>
<p>Paytm&#8217;s IPO plans come at a time when the pandemic has fuelled India&#8217;s digital economy and local stock exchanges are showing growing appetite for consumer tech stocks. Indian food delivery giant Zomato&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zomato-raises-562-million-from-anchor-investors-ahead-of-ipo/">$1.3 billion IPO this week</a> took only a few hours to be fully subscribed by retail and anchor investors.</p>
<p>A lot is riding on a successful IPO of Paytm, one of the most celebrated startups in India and which reported a consolidated loss of $233.6 million for the financial year that ended in March this year, down from $404 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Paytm&#8217;s Sequoia-backed MobiKwik <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/indian-financial-services-firm-mobikwik-looks-to-raise-255-million-in-ipo/">also filed for an IPO</a>, in which it is seeking to raise about $250 million. SoftBank-backed e-commerce giant Flipkart, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/flipkart-valued-at-37-6-billion-in-new-3-6-billion-fundraise/">raised $3.6 billion at $37.6 billion valuation</a> earlier this week, insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar, make-up retailer Nykaa and delivery startup Delhivery, which on Friday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/india-delhivery-lands-100-million-from-fedex/">announced a $100 million investment from FedEx</a>, may also list in the next three to four quarters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162178" style="width: 775px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162178" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2162178 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg" alt="" width="765" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg 1528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=768,486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/paytm-business.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 765px) 100vw, 765px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162178" class="wp-caption-text">A look at all Paytm businesses. (Bernstein)</p></div></p>
<p>Bankers and analysts are bullish on Paytm, whose mobile wallet business has lost lustre in recent years as UPI &#8212; a payments framework backed by banks in India &#8212; found takers in Google, PhonePe and others and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">took the market by storm</a>. But Paytm has bounced back, analysts argue.</p>
<p>“With the advent of UPI, there has been a rising narrative that questioned Paytm’s market leadership,” the analysts wrote, referring to the exponential growth of payments stack developed by retail banks in India that has been adopted by several firms, including Google and PhonePe (as well as Paytm), and which has somewhat lowered the appeal of mobile wallets in India,&#8221; analysts at Bernstein wrote in a recent report to clients.</p>
<p>“However, under the hood, Paytm leads on merchant payments and has built an ecosystem of synergistic fintech verticals around its ‘super-app.’ The ecosystem spans payments (wallet/UPI), full-suite merchant acquiring, credit tech, digital bank, wealth, and insurance tech. We believe the super-app battle in India is not a ‘winner takes all’ but a game of execution, business building, and creating a superior customer experience with ecosystem integration,” Bernstein analysts added.</p>

<p>As part of the deal, the companies will enter into a long-term commercial agreement. FedEx Express will focus on international export and import services to and from India, and Delhivery will, in addition to FedEx, sell FedEx Express international products and services in the India market and provide pick-up and delivery services across India. FedEx will transfer certain assets pertaining to its domestic business in India to Delhivery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our aim is to bring new products and opportunities to Indian and global businesses and consumers through unique access to our networks, and our technology and engineering capabilities,&#8221; said Delhivery co-founder Sahil Barua said of Friday&#8217;s investment.</p>
<p>Delhivery began its life <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/delhivery-seriesd/">as a food delivery firm</a>, but has since shifted to a full suite of logistics services in over 2,300 Indian cities and more than 17,500 zip codes. It is among a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/indias-blackbuck-raises-150-million-to-digitize-freight-and-logistics-across-india/">handful of startups</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/rivigo-india-seriese/">attempting to digitize</a> the demand and supply system of the logistics market through a freight exchange platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2159174" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2159174" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2159174 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="508" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=768,390 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=680,345 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/delhivery-platform.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2159174" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Bernstein</p></div></p>
<p>Its platform connects consigners, agents and truckers offering road transport solutions. The startup says the platform reduces the role of brokers, makes some of its assets such as trucking — the most popular transportation mode for Delhivery — more efficient, and ensures round the clock operations.</p>
<p>This digitization is crucial to address the inefficiencies in the Indian logistics industry that has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d529d48c-dc1b-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482">long stunted</a> the national economy. Poor planning and forecasting of demand and supply increases the carrying costs, theft, damages, and delays, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report last month about India’s logistics market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.delhivery.com">Delhivery</a>, which says it has delivered over 1 billion orders, works with “all of India’s largest e-commerce companies and leading enterprises,” according to its website, where it also says the startup has worked with over 10,000 customers. For the last leg of the delivery, its couriers are assigned an area that never exceeds 2 sq km, allowing them to make several delivery runs a day to save time.</p>
<p>Indian logistics market’s TAM (total addressable market) is over $200 billion, Bernstein analysts said. The startup said late last year that it was planning to invest over $40 million within two years to expand and increase its fleet size to meet the growing demand of orders as more people shop online amid the pandemic.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 15, 2021. Good news from the TechCrunch front: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/announcing-the-agenda-for-the-disrupt-stage-this-september/">The agenda is out</a> for our big Disrupt conference coming this September. It’s going to be flat-out amazing, frankly, so take a peek. Also, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1/">latest EC-1 just dropped</a>. So if you want to get the inside scoop on CockroachDB, well, we have just the compendium for you. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/">Revolut is now worth $33B:</a> </strong>U.K.-based neobank Revolut has put together an $800 million round that values the company at $33 billion. The company’s fresh valuation is a multiple of what it was worth in early 2020. Why is it worth so much today? TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revoluts-2020-financial-performance-explains-its-big-new-33b-valuation/">did a little exploring on the matter</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/valve-launches-steam-deck-a-400-pc-gaming-portable/"><strong>Valve is making gaming hardware:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Yes, the folks behind the Steam gaming store are getting into the hand-held gaming market. Their device, the Steam Deck, will cost $399 and will contain “a quad-core Zen 2 CPU, coupled with AMD RDNA 2 graphics and 16 GB of RAM,” per our own Brian Heater. If you want more storage, get ready to shell out up to $649 for the hand-held computer.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/spacs-keep-rolling-as-autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-targets-blank-check-debut-with-13b-valuation/">Autonomous vehicle unicorn Aurora is going public:</a></strong> As TechCrunch previously scooped, autonomous vehicle unicorn Aurora is going public via a SPAC. The company expects to sport a $13 billion valuation when it begins to trade. Recall that Aurora previously absorbed Uber’s self-driving vehicle unit at a roughly $10 billion valuation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>The venture capital market has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">been on fire lately</a>, leading to rapid-fire deal-making and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/your-funding-round-isnt-special-but-you-might-be/">more rounds than journalists can dream of covering</a>. But if you are still in the market to raise capital, then you might want to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/norwests-lisa-wu-explains-how-to-think-like-a-vc-when-fundraising/">listen to Norwest’s Lisa Wu</a>, who has a few tips that might prove useful. Chief among them? Think like a VC when you head out to raise.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/american-express-taps-startup-bodeswell-for-expansion-into-financial-planning/"><strong>AmEx dips its toes into financial planning:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today news broke that credit giant American Express invested in BodesWell last year via its venture arm. Now the credit card company has “launched a pilot of its first self-service digital financial planning tool” in conjunction with the startup. Talk about an early customer for BodesWell.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/abodu-raises-20m-to-build-prefabricated-backyard-homes/"><strong>Prefab construction tries again:</strong></a> That’s the word from a new $20 million round for Abodu — what we presume is a portmanteau of “abode” and “you.” Sure, prefab construction unicorn Katerra is kaput, but Abodu is taking a consumer-focused spin on the model. Norwest led the round, with participation from Initialized Capital.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/lightyear-nabs-13m-series-a-as-online-network-procurement-takes-shape/">Lightyear raises $13.1M for online network procurement:</a> </strong>From the geekier side of tech today was news from Lightyear, a startup that its CEO says is the “the first tool for buying your telecom infrastructure on the web.” Ron Miller notes that everything is heading online, so why not network buying?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/credit-suisse-leads-20m-series-a-in-data-extraction-startup-daloopa/"><strong>$20M for financial data extraction:</strong></a> Daloopa has closed an eight-figure Series A led by Credit Suisse Asset Management’s NEXT Investors to help financial types avoid “repetitive data extraction in order to gather insights for analysis and forecasts,” TechCrunch reports. The deal stood out to us given its obvious corporate venture capital (CVC) angle; CVCs have been more active than ever in recent quarters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The CockroachDB EC-1</h2>
<p>Ants and camels are famously resilient animals, but when it was time to select a name for a startup that offers open-source, cloud-based distributed database architecture, you can imagine why &#8220;Cockroach Labs&#8221; was the final candidate.</p>
<p>Database technology is fundamental infrastructure, which partially explains why it&#8217;s so resistant to innovation: Oracle Database was released in 1979, and MySQL didn&#8217;t reach the market until 1995.</p>
<p>Since hitting the market, CockroachDB has become &#8220;a next-generation, $2-billion-valued database contender,&#8221; writes enterprise reporter Bob Reselman, who interviewed the company&#8217;s founders to write a four-part series:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">Part 1: Origin story:</a></strong> From the creation of the popular open-source image editor GIMP to some of Google’s most well-known infrastructure products.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">Part 2: Technical design:</a></strong> Analyzes the key differentiation that CockroachDB offers, particularly its focus on geography and data storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-developers/"><strong>Part 3: Developer relations and business:</strong></a> How CockroachDB engages with developers while pivoting to the cloud at a key inflection point.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-future/"><strong>Part 4: Competitive landscape and future:</strong></a> A look at the fierce competition, and what possible exit routes might look like.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/what-impact-will-apples-buy-now-pay-later-push-have-on-startups/">Apple hearts fintech:</a></strong> News this week that Apple is considering jumping into the buy now, pay later sector rocked the share price of Affirm and Afterpay. But what about startups in the space? TechCrunch did a little noodling on the question.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/xiaomi-global-shipments-push-past-apple-for-no-2-spot/">Xiaomi snags Apple’s No. 2 handset mark:</a> </strong>Apple’s handset shipments grew in the second quarter, but a huge 83% gain at Xiaomi put the Chinese hardware company above Cupertino and its iPhone line, per Canalys data. Samsung remains the world’s largest smartphone company by unit volume.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/blue-origins-final-passenger-for-its-first-human-spaceflight-will-be-18-year-old-oliver-daemen/"><b>Be jealous of this 18-year-old:</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After the winning bidder for a space flight on Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin sold for $28 million to someone who couldn’t be bothered to make the first flight, an 18-year-old “high school graduate bound for the University of Utrecht” will go instead. Oliver Daemen, enjoy the trip, we’re jealous. (Yes, <a href="https://twitter.com/taragolshan/status/1415778117629759488">Daemen’s parents are rich</a>.)</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn&#8217;t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we&#8217;re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that&#8217;s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition?ref=12c1c3225394">July 21</a> and <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-july-28?ref=05f802c5b3e8">July 28</a>, Extra Crunch Live will feature startups exhibiting in the Startup Alley at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=ecljuly2021suapost&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=eclsuajuly&amp;display=TRUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> in September. Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it&#8217;s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On July 21, our expert VC judges will be Alexa von Tobel of Inspired Capital and Anis Uzzaman from Pegasus Tech Ventures.</p>

<p>Alexa von Tobel founded LearnVest, which sold for hundreds of millions of dollars. She then went on to found and serve as general partner at Inspired Capital. She&#8217;s been to plenty of TechCrunch events, and has even been a guest on Extra Crunch Live earlier this year. Long story short: She&#8217;s a smarty pants and an all-around fun person to hang out with.</p>
<p>Anis Uzzaman is founder and partner at Pegasus Tech Ventures, whose portfolio includes SpaceX, 23andme, Airbnb, Sofi, Coinbase, Robinhood, DoorDash and many more. Before Pegasus, he was at IBM and Cadence, where he drove strategic investments in software development, microelectronics and e-commerce. And if that weren&#8217;t enough, he&#8217;s founded several companies.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">On July 16th, <em>Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain</em> will open in US theatres. Like many documentaries, the film pieces together archival footage, including interviews and show outtakes, to attempt to tell the story of its subject in their own words. It also includes words Bourdain never spoke to a camera before his death by suicide in 2018, and yet you’ll hear his voice saying them.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-haunting-afterlife-of-anthony-bourdain" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>The New Yorker</ins></em></a>, the film’s director, Morgan Neville, said there were three quotes he wanted Bourdain to narrate where there were no recordings, and so he recreated them with software instead. “I created an AI model of his voice,” he told the magazine.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihEEjwRlghQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>It appears that was no easy feat either. In a separate <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/anthony-bourdain-morgan-neville-roadrunner-documentary" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><ins>interview with </ins><em><ins>GQ</ins></em></a>, Neville said he contacted four different companies about the project before deciding on the best one. That company fed about a dozen hours of audio to an AI model. A lot of the work involved deciding the exact tone of Bourdain’s voice Neville wanted the software to replicate since the way the author and travel host narrated his writing changed so much over the years he was on TV.</p>
<p>Compared to some of the other ways we’ve seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-24-facebook-fact-check-nancy-pelosi-video.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">AI</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netherlands-deepfake-video-chat-navalny-212606049.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">deepfakes</a> used to trick people, this isn&#8217;t the worst example, but the ethics of it are still questionable. The film, as far as we’re aware, doesn’t include a disclosure that AI was used to replicate Bourdain’s voice. “If you watch the film, other than that line you mentioned, you probably don’t know what the other lines are that were spoken by the AI, and you’re not going to know,” Neville told <em>The New Yorker</em>. “We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later.” In his interview with <em>GQ</em>, he said Bourdain’s family told him “Tony would have been cool with that,” adding, “I was just trying to make [the quotes] come alive.”</p>

<h2>A look under the hood</h2>
<p>Before I discuss the changes that produced the lift, it is important that I quickly go over the research that informed those changes. Why? Because it is a critical aspect of the process and too many CRO practitioners do not devote enough attention to figuring out why more site visitors aren’t converting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A banner quarter for Xiaomi helped the Chinese mobile company snag the No. 2 spot in global smartphone shipments, according to<a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021?ctid=2143-1ae766ab9e27fab872ea0ad5e1320017"> newly posted Q2 numbers</a> from research firm Canalys. It’s pretty stunning growth for the company, up 83% year-over-year for the quarter and capturing 17% of the global market.</p>
<p>The surge puts Xiaomi at No. 2, globally, behind only Samsung’s 19% by a relatively small margin. Apple is at third with 14% (after its own solid growth has slowed), while fellow Chinese manufacturers Oppo and Vivo round out the top five at 10% a piece.</p>
<p>Huawei, of course, is nowhere to be seen among the top companies. It’s a pretty massive drop, due in no small part to blacklisting that has both barred the company from certain markets (namely, the U.S.) and cut off access to U.S. mobile products, including Google’s Android and various apps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2178297" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178297" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178297" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178297" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p>
<p>Canalys cites aggressive pricing as a big factor in Xiaomi&#8217;s success &#8212; particularly contrasted with premium priced offerings from Samsung and Apple.</p>
<p>“It is now transforming its business model from challenger to incumbent, with initiatives such as channel partner consolidation and more careful management of older stock in the open market,” the analyst firm’s Research Manager Ben Stanton said in a release. “It is still largely skewed toward the mass market, however, and compared with Samsung and Apple, its average selling price is around 40% and 75% cheaper respectively. So a major priority for Xiaomi this year is to grow sales of its high-end devices, such as the Mi 11 Ultra.”</p>
<p>The company certainly isn’t a household name in the States (the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/us-removes-xiaomis-designation-as-a-communist-chinese-military-company/">dealt with its own issues here</a>), but of late it has found particular success in Latin America, Africa and Western Europe. It seems that there are still plenty of markets available to continue its expansion as it looks to take on Samsung, even as Oppo and Vivo hope to continue their own respective rapid global growth.</p>

We have an incredible lineup of speakers both on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost">Disrupt Stage and the Extra Crunch Stage</a>. And, of course, we can&#8217;t forget the Startup Battlefield, which has been a launch pad for some of the biggest tech companies in the world today, including Dropbox, Mint and Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re excited to give you a closer look at the Disrupt Stage, where the biggest names in tech talk about their companies, their plans, and what&#8217;s next for the greater tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg when it comes to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost&amp;display=true">three jam-packed days</a> we&#8217;re planning for you at Disrupt.

<p>So without any further ado, check out the current agenda for the Disrupt Stage:</p>
<h2>HEALTH/BIOTECH</h2>
<h3>Saving the World with Ugur Sahin (BioNTech) and Ursheet Parikh (Mayfield Fund)</h3>
<p>COVID-19 changed everything. It not only threatened our individual health and well-being, but shook industries and economies across the globe. But the same could be said about the COVID-19 vaccines. Hear from BioNTech co-founder and CEO Ugur Sahin on the process of rapidly developing the world&#8217;s most sought-after vaccine, alongside Pfizer, and the long-term potential of mRNA-based therapies. Sahin will be joined by Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield Fund to discuss what&#8217;s next for startups in this rapidly evolving industry.</p>
<h3>Democratizing Healthcare with Toyin Ajayi (Cityblock Health), Adrian Aoun (Forward),and Eren Bali (Carbon Health)</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the current healthcare system in America is broken. Technology stands to make a huge difference, especially in the backdrop of eased regulations due to COVID-19. Hear how startup founders from Forward, Carbon Health and Cityblock Health decided to tackle the behemoth, backward industry of healthcare, as well as talk through their plans to democratize access and digitize the industry.</p>
<h3>Pot, Pottery and Beyond with Seth Rogen (Houseplant), Haneen Davies (Houseplant), and Michael Mohr (Houseplant)</h3>
<p>Somehow we live in world where alcohol is sold in grocery stores and weed is considered a gateway drug. But that is rapidly changing. The legalized cannabis industry is estimated to be worth more than $13 billion in 2021, and major players from big food, pharma, etc. all want a slice of the pie. Hear from actor and comedian Seth Rogen on his well-known passion for pot, and how it led him to start Houseplant. Rogen will also be joined by Houseplant Chief Commercial Officer Haneen Davies and co-founder and CEO Michael Mohr.</p>

Hear from Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce President and COO Bret Taylor about the future of the combined entity, why the deal made sense, and what it&#8217;s like to write down that many 0s.</p>
<h3>Dogmatic Design with Melanie Perkins (Canva)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rapid evolution of the design industry can&#8217;t be understated.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new challenger has emerged in the gaming hardware category. Game distribution giant <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/hardware">Valve today announced the launch of Steam Deck</a>, a $399 gaming portable designed to take PC games on the go.</p>
<p>The handheld (which has echoes of several portable gaming rigs of years past) features a seven-inch screen and runs on a quad-core Zen 2 CPU, coupled with AMD RDNA 2 graphics and 16GB of RAM. Storage runs 64GB to 512GB, the latter of which bumps the price up to $649. The built-in storage can be augmented via microSD.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178258" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178258" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hero-banner-sequence-english.2021-07-15-13_49_51.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178258" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Valve</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Naturally, the thing is custom built for Valve’s wildly popular Steam platform (it’s right there in the name, after all). Users log into their Steam account and their library &#8212; and friends list &#8212; are right there, ready to go. There’s even a dedicated Steam button.</p>

<p>The system has been rumored for some time now, but it enters the world during a rapidly evolving era for gaming. Essentially the company is hoping to outperform the admitted graphical limitations of Nintendo’s Switch (OLED or no), while filling in the gap as cloud-based gaming from companies like Microsoft are still working on a foothold as they deal with latency and other technical limitations. There’s also the Nvidia Shield Portable &#8212; though we’ve not heard much from that project, of late.</p>

<p>Flanking the 1280 x 800 touchscreen are a pair of trackpads and thumb sticks. A built-in gyroscope also uses movement to control the gaming experience. There’s a single USB-C port for charging, peripherals and connecting to a big screen, while a 40Wh battery promises between 7-8 hours of gameplay, by Valve’s numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DeepMind stunned the biology world late last year when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/">its AlphaFold2 AI model</a> predicted the structure of proteins (a common and very difficult problem) so accurately that many declared the decades-old problem &#8220;solved.&#8221; Now researchers claim to have leapfrogged DeepMind the way DeepMind leapfrogged the rest of the world, with RoseTTAFold, a system that does nearly the same thing at a fraction of the computational cost. (Oh, and it&#8217;s free to use.)</p>
<p>AlphaFold2 has been the talk of the industry since November, when it blew away the competition at CASP14, a virtual competition between algorithms built to predict the physical structure of a protein given the sequence of amino acids that make it up. The model from DeepMind was so far ahead of the others, so highly and reliably accurate, that many in the field have talked (half-seriously and in good humor) about moving on to a new field.</p>
<p>But one aspect that seemed to satisfy no one was DeepMind&#8217;s plans for the system. It was not exhaustively and openly described, and some worried that the company (which is owned by Alphabet/Google) was planning on more or less keeping the secret sauce to themselves — which would be their prerogative but also somewhat against the ethos of mutual aid in the scientific world.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: In something of a surprise, DeepMind published more detailed methods <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">in the journal Nature today</a>. The code is available <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold">on GitHub</a>. This does considerably lessen the aforementioned concern, but the advance described below is still highly relevant. I&#8217;ve also added a comment from that team at the bottom of the article.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hfpbOm04m6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/">Alphabet&#8217;s DeepMind achieves historic new milestone in AI-based protein structure prediction</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alphabet&#8217;s DeepMind achieves historic new milestone in AI-based protein structure prediction&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/embed/#?secret=hfpbOm04m6" data-secret="hfpbOm04m6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That concern seems to have been at least partly mooted by work from University of Washington researchers led by David Baker and Minkyung Baek, published in the latest issue of the journal Science. Baker, you may remember, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/3m-breakthrough-prize-goes-to-scientist-designing-molecules-to-could-fight-covid-19/">won a Breakthrough Prize</a> for his team&#8217;s work combating COVID-19 with engineered proteins.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s new model, RoseTTAFold, makes predictions at similar accuracy levels using methods that Baker, responding to questions via email, candidly admitted were inspired by those used by AlphaFold2.</p>
<p>&#8220;The AlphaFold2 group presented several new high-level concepts at the CASP14 meeting. Starting from these ideas, and with a lot of collective brainstorming with colleagues in the group, Minkyung has been able to make amazing progress in very little time,&#8221; he said. (&#8220;She is amazing!&#8221; he added.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177788" style="width: 374px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-predict.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177788" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2177788" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-predict.png" alt="" width="364" height="485" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-predict.png 728w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-predict.png?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-predict.png?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-predict.png?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/protein-predict.png?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2177788" class="wp-caption-text">Examples of predicted protein structures and their ground truths. A score above 90 is considered extremely good. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> UW/Baek et al</p></div></p>
<p>Baker&#8217;s group more or less placed second at CASP14, no mean feat, but hearing DeepMind&#8217;s methods described even generally set them on a collision course. They developed a &#8220;three-track&#8221; neural network that simultaneously considered the amino acid sequence (one dimension), distances between residues (two dimensions) and coordinates in space (three dimensions). The implementation is beyond complex and far outside the scope of this article, but the result is a model that achieves almost the same accuracy levels — levels, it bears repeating, that were completely unprecedented less than a year ago.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, RoseTTAFold accomplishes this level of accuracy far more quickly — that is, using less computation power. As the paper puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>DeepMind reported using several GPUs for days to make individual predictions, whereas our predictions are made in a single pass through the network in the same manner that would be used for a server&#8230;the end-to-end version of RoseTTAFold requires ~10 min on an RTX2080 GPU to generate backbone coordinates for proteins with less than 400 residues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hear that? It&#8217;s the sound of thousands of microbiologists sighing in relief and discarding drafts of emails asking for supercomputer time. It may not be easy to lay one&#8217;s hands on a 2080 these days, but the point is any high-end desktop GPU can perform this task in minutes, instead of requiring a high-end cluster running for days.</p>
<p>The modest requirements make RoseTTAFold suitable for public hosting and distribution as well, something that might never have been in the cards for AlphaFold2.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a public server that anyone can submit protein sequences to and have the structures predicted,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;There have been over 4,500 submissions since we put the server up a few weeks ago. We have also made the source code freely available.&#8221;</p>
<p>This may seem very niche, and it is, but protein folding has historically been one of the toughest problems in biology and one toward which countless hours of high-performance computing have been dedicated. You may recall Folding@Home, the popular distributed computing app that let people donate their computing cycles to attempting to predict protein structures. The kind of problem that might have taken a thousand computers days or weeks to do — essentially by brute-forcing solutions and checking for fit — now can be done in minutes on a single desktop.</p>
<p>The physical structure of proteins is of utmost importance in biology, as it is proteins that do the vast majority of tasks in our bodies, and proteins that must be modified, suppressed, enhanced and so on for therapeutic reasons; first, however, they need to be understood, and until November that understanding could not be reliably achieved computationally. At CASP14 it was proven to be possible, and now it has been made widely available.</p>
<p>It is not, by a long shot, a &#8220;solution&#8221; to the problem of protein folding, though the sentiment has been expressed. Most proteins at rest in neutral conditions can now have their structure predicted, and that has huge repercussions in multiple domains, but proteins are seldom found &#8220;at rest in neutral conditions.&#8221; They twist and contort to grab or release other molecules, to block or slip through gates and other proteins, and generally to do everything they do. These interactions are far more numerous, complex and difficult to predict, and neither AlphaFold2 nor RoseTTAFold can do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many exciting chapters ahead&#8230; the story is just beginning,&#8221; said Baker.</p>
<p>Regarding the DeepMind paper, Baker offered the following comment in the spirit of collegiate camaraderie:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve read through, and think this is a beautiful paper describing fantastic work.</p>
<p>The DeepMind paper is actually very complementary to our paper, and I think it is appropriate that it is not coming out after ours, as our work is really based on their advances.</p>
<p>I think that readers will enjoy reading both papers — they are very far from being duplicative. As we point out in our paper, their method is more accurate than ours, and now it will be very interesting to see what features of their approach are responsible for the remaining differences. We are already using RoseTTAFold for protein design and more systematic protein-protein complex structure prediction, and we are excited about rapidly improving these, along with traditional single chain modeling, by incorporating ideas from the DeepMind paper.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the science and the potential repercussions, <a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/">consider reading this much more detailed and technical account</a> of the methods and possible next steps written in the wake of AlphaFold2&#8217;s CASP14 performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In our review last year, we called the Freewrite Traveler “outstanding, but expensive.” The latest version of Astrohaus’ distraction-free word processing hardware tool does little to address the latter concern. In fact, the Ernest Hemingway Freewrite Signature Edition comes in at a full $300 more than its predecessor.</p>
<p>But the latest edition of the hardware strives to be something more than just a utilitarian writing tool. In fact, Astrohaus secured the blessing from the Ernest Hemingway estate for the new version of a product that began life as the “Hemingwrite” for its 2014 Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2178117" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product strives to live up to some of the ethos and/or aesthetics of &#8220;The Sun Also Rises&#8221; author. “Even though we changed the name to Freewrite in 2015, the original Hemingwrite concept is what captured the world’s attention,” co-founder and CEO Adam Leeb said in a release tied to the news. This time out, however, the company secured the family’s blessing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9nvt0TaY5u"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/the-freewrite-traveler-is-an-outstanding-but-expensive-dedicated-portable-writing-laptop/">The Freewrite Traveler is an outstanding, but expensive, dedicated portable writing laptop</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Freewrite Traveler is an outstanding, but expensive, dedicated portable writing laptop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/the-freewrite-traveler-is-an-outstanding-but-expensive-dedicated-portable-writing-laptop/embed/#?secret=9nvt0TaY5u" data-secret="9nvt0TaY5u" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new version trades portability for aesthetic, with the inclusion of an attaché case that brings to mind both writers&#8217; tools of yore and, more recently, retro turntables from companies like Crosley. There were, of course, travel typewriters that came with their own carrying case, but the Freewrite’s significantly slimmer profile makes the setup far more compact.</p>

<p>Here’s Astrohaus’ write-up of the hardware [best read in a Ron Burgundy voice]:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Hemingwrite features an exclusive design with green keycaps and a hand-polished aluminum chassis that is uncoated and will develop a unique patina over time. Each unit is finished by hand &#8211; no two are exactly alike. Every Hemingwrite comes with a Hemingway monogramed cleaning cloth and an exclusive attaché case to safely store the device and elegantly transport it anywhere inspiration is found. The hard-sided Hemingwrite Attaché Case is crafted from rich cognac leather and a cream-colored velvet lining. A deep pocket is located inside to store books, pens, notebooks, or other pieces of writing inspiration.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you’re looking for something to reduce the distractions that come from writing on a laptop, while ramping up the aesthetic homage to days of yore, the Ernest Hemingway Freewrite Signature Edition is available now for $899.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Express is branching out into financial planning, with a little help from a seven-person startup called BodesWell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, the credit card giant launched a pilot of its first self-service digital financial planning tool, dubbed “My Financial Plan (MFP).” The six-month pilot kicked off on July 11 with about 25,000 select Amex cardmembers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Express quietly invested in BodesWell in late 2020 via its venture arm, Amex Ventures. Since then, the financial services behemoth teamed up with the tiny startup to develop the financial planning tool for its users. The new product is designed to give users a complete picture of their financial health and help them make and achieve major life goals, such as buying a house or retirement.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with Amex Ventures’ Julia Huang, who led the investment and strategy around the new product, and BodesWell co-founder and CEO Matthew Bellows to learn more details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair actually met while serving on a panel together in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was drawn to the fact that it was not a round-up savings tool, but rather a holistic tool to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand your full financial picture that could be used to plan for the financial impact of your life decisions,” Huang told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before deciding to invest in BodesWell, Huang says Amex Ventures &#8212; which over time has backed more than 70 startups &#8212; had “evaluated the space quite extensively.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huang introduced Bellows and his staff to Amex’s Digital Labs team and they embarked on jointly developing a specialized offering for Amex customers. (While Bellow is based in Boston, he says the startup is “globally distributed.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to democratize financial planning with our cardmembers by providing detailed insights and forecasts to help them with their holistic planning,” she told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178172" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178172" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2178172 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="419" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg 3620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=680,419 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=1536,945 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=2048,1260 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MFP-expenses.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178172" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Amex Ventures</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bellows started BodesWell in early 2019 with the goal of empowering clients and customers to build their own financial plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So much of financial planning software is aimed at financial advisors, and requires them to run it,” he said. “So, most people can’t get the benefits of financial planning&#8230;Our hope is to expand benefits to a lot more people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BodesWell will guide users in setting up a financial plan and will work even better if they sync with their other financial information via Plaid so it can “update in real time,” Huang said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tool “takes into account income, assets, expenses and liabilities &#8212; what cash flow looks like holistically so that users can drag &amp; drop to plan life events,” Bellow said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 85 million American households don’t have a financial, planner for a variety of reasons &#8212; including mistrust of a planner’s intentions or just feeling overwhelmed by the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product is free during the pilot phase and American Express hasn’t yet determined if it will charge for it afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re gauging first for engagement and the power of the product for our customers,” Huang told TechCrunch. “We want to make sure the product resonates and that we iterate on the product to make sure it’s good for the broader population. Our primary goal is that our customers use it and find it valuable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amex Ventures has formed “some level of partnership” with more than two-thirds of its portfolio companies, she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We try to engage with our portfolio in that way, to provide value with our startup ecosystem,” Huang said.</span></p>
<p>For its part, BodesWell had previously raised about $1.5 million from investors such as Cleo Capital, Ex Ventures, Riot.vc, GritCapital and Argon Capital and angels like HubSpot CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhalligan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhalligan/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626448853144000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXPvXUtd-poQKbMwKiX1jEXA4Axg">Brian Halligan</a> and Kintent CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sravishsridhar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/sravishsridhar/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626448853144000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB6o2j7LIb1gY7mzuLvwAC2oiTDg">Sravish Sridhar.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The General Services Administration has denied a senator&#8217;s request to review documents Zoom submitted to have its software approved for use in the federal government.</p>
<p>The denial was in response <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wyden-zoom-gsa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a letter</a> sent by Democratic senator Ron Wyden to the GSA in May, expressing concern that the agency cleared Zoom for use by federal agencies just weeks before a major security vulnerability was discovered in the app.</p>
<p>Wyden said the discovery of the bug raises &#8220;serious questions about the quality of FedRAMP’s audits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoom was approved to operate in government in April 2019 after receiving its FedRAMP authorization, a program operated by the GSA that ensures cloud services comply with a standardized set of security requirements designed to toughen the service from some of the most common threats. Without this authorization, federal agencies cannot use cloud products or technologies that are not cleared.</p>
<p>Months later, Zoom was forced to patch its Mac app after a security researcher found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/a-vulnerability-in-zooms-mac-client-could-allow-websites-to-turn-on-cameras-without-permission/">a flaw</a> that could be abused to remotely switch on a user&#8217;s webcam without their permission. Apple was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/">forced to intervene</a> since users were still affected by the vulnerabilities even after uninstalling Zoom. As the pandemic spread and lockdowns were enforced, Zoom&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/zooms-paid-usage-skyrockets-as-remote-work-takes-over/">popularity skyrocketed</a> — as did the scrutiny — including a technical analysis by reporters that found Zoom <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">was not truly end-to-end encrypted</a> as the company long claimed.</p>
<p>Wyden wrote to the GSA to say he found it &#8220;extremely concerning&#8221; that the security bugs were discovered after Zoom’s clearance. In the letter, the senator requested the documents known as the &#8220;security package,&#8221; which Zoom submitted as part of the FedRAMP authorization process, to understand how and why the app was cleared by GSA.</p>
<p>The GSA declined Wyden&#8217;s first request in July 2020 on the grounds that he was not a committee chair. In the new Biden administration, Wyden was named chair of the Senate Finance Committee and requested Zoom&#8217;s security package again.</p>
<p>But in a new letter sent to Wyden&#8217;s office late last month, GSA declined the request for the second time, citing security concerns.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;GSA&#8217;s refusal to share the Zoom audit with Congress calls into question the security of the other software products that GSA has approved for federal use.&#8221; <cite>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR)</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>&#8220;The security package you have requested contains highly sensitive proprietary and other confidential information relating to the security associated with the Zoom for Government product. Safeguarding this information is critical to maintaining the integrity of the offering and any government data it hosts,&#8221; said the GSA letter. &#8220;Based on our review, GSA believes that disclosure of the Zoom security package would create significant security risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to the GSA&#8217;s letter, Wyden told TechCrunch that he was concerned that other flawed software may have been approved for use across the government.</p>
<p>“The intent of GSA&#8217;s FedRAMP program is good — to eliminate red tape so that multiple federal agencies don’t have to review the security of the same software. But it’s vitally important that whichever agency conducts the review do so thoroughly,&#8221; said Wyden. &#8220;I’m concerned that the government’s audit of Zoom missed serious cybersecurity flaws that were subsequently uncovered and exposed by security researchers. GSA’s refusal to share the Zoom audit with Congress calls into question the security of the other software products that GSA has approved for federal use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the people we spoke with who have firsthand knowledge of the FedRAMP process, either as a government employee or as a company going through the certification, FedRAMP was described as a comprehensive but by no means an exhaustive list of checks that companies have to meet in order to meet the security requirements of the federal government.</p>
<p>Others said that the process had its limits and would benefit from reform. One person with knowledge of how FedRAMP works said the process was not a complete audit of a product&#8217;s source code but akin to a checklist of best practices and meeting compliance requirements. Much of it relies on trusting the vendor, said the person, describing it like &#8220;an honor system.&#8221; Another person said the FedRAMP process cannot catch every bug, as evidenced by executive action taken by President Biden this week aimed at <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">modernizing and improving the FedRAMP process</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the people we spoke to weren&#8217;t surprised that Wyden&#8217;s office was denied the request, citing the sensitivity of a company&#8217;s FedRAMP security package.</p>
<p>The people said that companies going through the certification process have to provide highly technical details about the security of their product, which if exposed would almost certainly be damaging to the company. Knowing where security weaknesses might be could tip off cybercriminals, one of the people said. Companies often spend millions on improving their security ahead of a FedRAMP audit but companies wouldn&#8217;t risk going through the certification if they thought their trade secrets would get leaked, they added.</p>
<p>When asked by GSA why it objected to Wyden&#8217;s request, Zoom&#8217;s head of U.S. government relations Lauren Belive argued that handing over the security package &#8220;would set a dangerous precedent that would undermine the special trust and confidence&#8221; that companies place in the FedRAMP process.</p>
<p>GSA puts strict controls on who can access a FedRAMP security package. You need a federal government or military email address, which the senator&#8217;s office has. But the reason for GSA denying Wyden&#8217;s request still isn&#8217;t clear, and when reached a GSA spokesperson would not explain how a member of Congress would obtain a company&#8217;s FedRAMP security package</p>
<p>&#8220;GSA values its relationship with Congress and will continue to work with Senator Wyden and our committees of jurisdiction to provide appropriate information regarding our programs and operations,&#8221; said GSA spokesperson Christina Wilkes, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>GSA works closely with private sector partners to provide a standardized approach to security authorizations for cloud services through the [FedRAMP]. Zoom’s FedRAMP security package and related documents provide detailed information regarding the security measures associated with the Zoom for Government product. GSA’s consistent practice with regard to sensitive security and trade secret information is to withhold the material absent an official written request of a congressional committee with jurisdiction, and pursuant to controls on further dissemination or publication of the information.</p></blockquote>
<p>GSA wouldn&#8217;t say which congressional committee had jurisdiction or whether Wyden&#8217;s role as chair of the Senate Finance Committee suffices, nor would the agency answer questions about the efficacy of the FedRAMP process raised by Wyden.</p>
<p>Zoom spokesperson Kelsey Knight said that cloud companies like Zoom &#8220;provide proprietary and confidential information to GSA as part of the FedRAMP authorization process with the understanding that it will be used only for their use in making authorization decisions. While we do not believe Zoom’s FedRAMP security package should be disclosed outside of this narrow purpose, we welcome conversations with lawmakers and other stakeholders about the security of Zoom for Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoom said it has &#8220;engaged in security enhancements to continually improve its products,&#8221; and received FedRAMP reauthorization in 2020 and 2021 as part of its annual renewal. The company declined to say to what extent the Zoom app was audited as part of the FedRAMP process.</p>
<p>Over two dozen federal agencies use Zoom, including the Defense Department, Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Executive Office of the President.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More details are beginning to emerge on Houston-based Axiom Space’s ambitious project to build and operate the world’s first commercial space station.</p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space, a European aerospace manufacturer, will develop the two pressurized modules of the Axiom Space Station. The two elements, which are scheduled to launch in 2024 and 2025, will dock to the International Space Station before eventually detaching and operating as a fully independent, commercial station.</p>
<p>The two companies announced the signing of the final contract, valued at €110 million ($130 million), on Thursday. Each module will be able to accommodate four people. Thales will also be designing the micrometeoroid and debris protection system for each module.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The modules are still in their design phase, Thales Alenia said. The company recently completed development of the first module’s four radial bulkheads at its facility in Turin, Italy. The bulkheads, once connected, will form a cylinder. That structure will attach to the common berth mechanisms, parts of the module that will connect to the ISS and hatches.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178177" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178177" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg 5056w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178177" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://thalesgroup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thales Alenia Space <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The two modules have a long road ahead of them. Thales Alenia, a joint venture between French company Thales Group and Italian conglomerate Leonardo, will begin welding on the first module this September through to next year. That module will be sent to Axiom’s Texas facilities in July 2023, where Axiom will then integrate the core systems and prepare it for launch in 2024.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/nasa-taps-startup-axiom-space-for-the-first-habitable-commercial-module-for-the-space-station/">tapped Axiom</a> to build the first commercial living quarters for the ISS in January 2020. Once the ISS is decommissioned, Axiom’s station will detach and function as a commercial center for future missions and scientific experiments. It’s a major part of NASA’s plans to encourage the growth of the burgeoning low Earth orbit economy and the buildout of other private orbital labs and commercial facilities.</p>
<p>Axiom will also operate the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/axiom-space-and-nasa-detail-first-fully-private-human-launch-to-the-space-station-set-for-january-2022/">first fully private</a> mission to the ISS, scheduled for January 2022. Axiom Mission 1 will send four private astronauts to space onboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon, for an eight-day mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM and its new EV business unit BrightDrop are launching a fleet charging service as the automaker aims to ramp up its bet on connected and electric commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>The service, branded Ultium Charge 360 fleet charging service in a nod to GM&#8217;s new electric architecture and batteries that will be the foundation of its future EV plans, offers many of the tools that a commercial delivery, sales or motor pool business might need. It also includes an effort to add home charging for drivers.</p>
<p>The charging service is the latest addition to BrightDrop, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">launched in January</a>. The business unit offers commercial customers — starting with FedEx — an ecosystem of electric and connected products. BrightDrop has said it will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimated range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1. BrightDrop is part of GM&#8217;s aim to reach 1 million EV sales globally by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM and BrightDrop are launching the charging service with Duke Energy company eTransEnergy, EVgo, In-Charge Energy and Schneider Electric, four companies that can provide the infrastructure needed to keep the commercial vans properly powered.</p>
<p>On the home-charging front, GM said it will expand an existing agreement with Qmerit.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The service is meant to provide tools for fleet operators, which Alex Keros, GM&#8217;s lead architect of EV Infrastructure, noted in a call with reporters Thursday are an important market growth segment and a critical piece of the electrification puzzle. The company looked at &#8220;how to put the right customer experiences together &#8230; you know, when you think about fleets these are cars that come home with employees for example, and we&#8217;ll have to help those companies and employees figure out charging in their home.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's not super stupid to value Revolut far more richly with massively improved gross margins, profitability and more proven revenue growth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News broke this morning that Revolut, a U.K.-based consumer fintech player, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/">raised a Series E round of funding worth $800 million</a> at a valuation of $33 billion. Those figures are breathtaking not only due to their sheer scale, but also thanks to their radical divergence from Revolut&#8217;s preceding funding event.</p>
<p><em>At times, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">The Exchange</a>, TechCrunch&#8217;s markets-and-startups column, runs into two topics worth exploring in a single day. Today is such a day. You can check out our earlier notes on the buy now, pay later startup market and Apple&#8217;s entrance into the BNPL space here. Now, let&#8217;s talk about</em> <em>neobanks</em>.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/ingridlunden">Ingrid Lunden</a> wrote earlier today concerning the news:</p>
<blockquote><p>This latest Series E is being co-led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global, who appear to be the only backers in this round. It comes on the heels of <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/klarna-effect-propels-digital-bank-revolut-to-30bn-valuation-in-softbank-talks-12347766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors earlier this month</a> Revolut was raising big. Revolut last raised about a year ago, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/revolut-extends-series-d-round-to-580-million-with-80-million-in-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed out a Series D at $580 million</a>, but what is stunning is how much its valuation has changed since then, growing 6x (it was $5.5 billion last year).</p></blockquote>
<p>Stunning indeed.</p>
<p>Lunden also went on to report on the company&#8217;s changing financial picture based on Revolut&#8217;s recently released 2020 results. In this entry, we&#8217;re digging more deeply into those financial results and usage metrics detailed by the fintech megacorn.</p>

<p>The picture that emerges is one of a company with a rapidly improving financial image, albeit with some blank spaces regarding recent customer growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Shortly after the first  <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626363395439000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnejcRsz6jYLrLkHznqKjW4-FB2Q">Sight Tech Global</a> event, in December last year, Apple and Microsoft announced remarkable new features for mobile phones. Anyone could point the phone camera at a scene and request a “scene description.” In a flash, a cloud-based, computer vision AI determined what was in the scene and a machine-voice read the information. Learning that “a room contains three chairs and a table” might not seem like a big advance for the sighted, but for blind or visually impaired people, the new feature was a notable milestone for accessibility technology: An affordable, portable and nearly universal device could now “see” on behalf of just about anyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Technologies like scene description will be on the agenda at the second annual Sight Tech Global event, December 1-2, 2021. The free, sponsor-supported, virtual and global event will convene many of the world’s top technologists, researchers, advocates and founders to discuss how rapid advances in technology, many centered on AI, are altering &#8212; both improving and complicating &#8212; accessibility for people with sight loss.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform">Register</a> today &#8212; it’s free.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">At the heart of Sight Tech Global is the hard question: How do highly advanced, AI-based technologies actually become compelling, affordable products that folks who are blind or visually impaired readily adopt? It took 40 years, for example, for the $50,000 “Kurzweil reading machine,” a boxy desktop device, to evolve into what blind people take for granted today, a free app available on any mobile phone that can “read” just about any text. As anyone working in the field will tell you, shaping technologies into truly useful, everyday, affordable tools for people with vision loss is no less demanding than it was 40 years ago.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The overlapping in job roles is uncanny: The best investors and founders have to find focus through the noise, understand the weight of due diligence and pitch others with conviction.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event last week, <a href="https://www.nvp.com/">Norwest Venture Partners</a>&#8216; <a href="https://www.nvp.com/team/lisa-wu/">Lisa Wu</a> took the stage to discuss how founders can think like venture capitalists in all facets of their business. The overlapping in job roles is uncanny: The best investors and founders have to find focus through the noise, understand the weight of due diligence and pitch others with conviction. Wu, who has investments in Plaid, Calm and Ritual, used anecdotes and exercises &#8212; such as the eyebrow test &#8212; in the tactical, engaging chat.</p>
<h2>Pitch deck or pitch blurb?</h2>
<p>Startup founders often turn to pitch decks when fundraising as a visual representation of their story &#8212; from the origins to total addressable market to those juicy metrics. While the format definitely works, the influx of pitch decks in a hot deal environment makes it harder to stand out.</p>
<p>Wu gave some pointers on how she reacts to cold pitch decks, and why founders may want to take some unconventional advice.</p>
<blockquote><p>I love it because I can quickly flip through the deck and generally form an opinion on it. And I think I&#8217;ve read some stat recently, which is that investors really spend 2 minutes and 47 seconds per deck. It&#8217;s an easy way for me to, in that short amount of time, just get a calibration of the business to decide whether to move forward.</p>
<p>But, as the founder, I&#8217;ll probably tell you don&#8217;t do [the cold pitch deck]. Because if you&#8217;re sending me the pitch deck, I&#8217;m quickly screening and then I&#8217;m making a decision of whether it makes sense to meet, but your goal is really just to try to get the meeting with me to tell the story and let that unfold. And so, give us enough of it &#8212; like a blurb to tease us to want to continue to engage is great. But if it is possible, I would suggest a late pullback of the pitch deck, even though I love to receive it in advance.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 21:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, she loves founders sliding into the DMs with pitch decks, but doesn&#8217;t think that strategy always gives the founder storytelling power.</p>
<p>This answer triggered a series of questions from attendees on whether pitch decks are even necessary in the first place. Here, Wu explains how the competitive venture market has impacted her preferences &#8212; and her interest in what I&#8217;d describe it as a private beta, except for fundraising rounds.</p>
<blockquote><p>So, everything is shifting these days. Because there&#8217;s so much capital [and competition] out there, sometimes if I&#8217;m chasing a really hot company, I actually prefer that they don&#8217;t have a deck, or they haven&#8217;t created one yet. Because once you have a deck, that means you can go and take it out to a bunch of other investors, too. And so it&#8217;s helpful to structure the conversation and to storytell around it. I think I like a deck more so than not, unless it&#8217;s in a competitive situation. If I&#8217;m trying to close the deal, I actually prefer just an open dialogue.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 23:30)</strong></em></p>
<p>We just have them come in and we just prepare our team internally to let them know that there&#8217;s no deck here. And so, it&#8217;s just up to the founders to really just tell the story to us. And, it&#8217;s worked.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 24:20)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for more affordable housing has never been more urgent as a shortage in the U.S. housing market persists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups attempting to help address the shortage in a variety of ways abound. One such startup, </span><a href="http://www.abodu.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abodu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners. Previous backer Initialized Capital also participated in the financing, along with Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman, former Stockton, California Mayor Michael Tubbs, GGV investor Hans Tung and Paradox Capital’s Kyle Tibbitts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California legislature changed laws in 2017 to make it easier to build Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). Then on January 1, 2020, the state of California made it dramatically easier to add extra housing units to single-family home sites. Cities and local agencies have to quickly approve or deny ADU projects within 60 days of receiving a permit application. The state also now prevents cities from imposing minimum lot size requirements, maximum ADU dimensions or off-street parking requirements. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redwood City, California-based Abodu, which builds prefabricated ADUs, was founded in 2018 to serve as a “one-stop shop” for building an ADU, or as some describe it, a home in a backyard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sets the company apart from others in the space, its execs claim, is that it not only builds and installs the units, it helps homeowners with the painful process of getting permits. <span class="il">Abodu</span> says it pre-approves its structural engineering with California state-level agencies to ensure its units can be built statewide and works with local agencies to pre-approve its foundation systems to ensure projects can proceed on predictable timelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also claims to offer a cheaper and faster process than if one were to build an ADU from start to finish. Specifically, the startup claims that one of its backyard homes can be installed in just 10% of the time it would take for a traditional ADU to be built. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abodu has been active in the market, selling and building its ADUs since the fall of 2019. Since then, it has put “dozens and dozens” of units in the ground, and has multiple dozen units in production on top of that, according to CEO and co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Geary. So far, it’s operating in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Seattle. The company claims it can deliver an ADU in as little as 30 days in San Jose and Los Angeles thanks to the cities’ pre-approval process. In other cities in California and Washington, turnaround is “as little as 12 weeks.” But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a standard bespoke project takes 4-5 months from start to finish, according to Geary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s three products include a 340-square foot studio; a 500-square foot one bedroom, one bath, and a 610-square foot two bedroom unit. All have kitchens and living space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing starts at $190,000, but the average project cost across all sizes is around $230,000, Geary said, inclusive of permits and site work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of use cases for ADUs, the most popular of which is to house family and for rental income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the pandemic, multigenerational living has been at an all-time high. There are acute family needs that people are trying to solve for,” Geary said. “In addition, folks are earning extra money by renting them out to members of the community such as teachers or fireman, a single person or younger couple.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, Abodu is eyeing the San Diego market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, we covered the recent raise of Mighty Buildings, another Bay Area-based startup building ADUs and other housing. The biggest difference between the two companies, according to Geary, is that Mighty Buildings is focused on innovation in construction with its 3D-printed method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We decided early on that we didn&#8217;t want to reinvent the wheel from the construction standpoint,” Geary said. “Instead, we looked at ‘how can we solve for speed and ease?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abodu operates with an asset-light model, and doesn’t own any factories. Instead, it has built a network of factory “partners” across the Western U.S. that builds its units depending on how their capacities look at any given time.</span></p>
<p>Naturally, the company&#8217;s investors are bullish on the company&#8217;s business model.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Crowe, managing partner of Norwest Venture Partners, believes that Abodu’s &#8220;beautifully crafted units&#8221; are just one of the company&#8217;s selling points. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;John, Eric, and their team manage the end-to-end process of permitting, building, and installing on behalf of their customers,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;And with the expedited permitting that Abodu has been granted in over two dozen cities, it has faster time-to-installation than other ADU market participants.  The result has been very high levels of customer satisfaction and rapid growth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Former Stockton Mayor Tubbs said Abodu is tacklin<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">g two of California’s most consequential issues: the statewide housing shortage and its impacts on racial and economic segregation in our neighborhoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;By making it fast and accessible for normal homeowners to build high-quality backyard housing units, Abodu’s success will mean integrating options for both renters and homeowners in the same neighborhoods, while supporting small landlords and property owners in building equity in their homes,&#8221; he wrote via email.</span></p>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Tubbs went on to describe the speed that Abodu can deliver housing units to customers in certain parts of California &#8220;astounding.&#8221; </span></div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Abodu’s team has done some of the most difficult legwork for property owners by building local contractor relationships with reliable, vetted, high-quality partners,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a homeowner myself, I know the challenges of permitting and finding contractors during construction. It’s this thoughtful attention to detail and customer trust that sets Abodu apart from other similar offerings.&#8221;</span></div>
