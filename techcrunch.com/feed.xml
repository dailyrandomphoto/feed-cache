										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toxic culture, deadly conspiracies and organized hate have exploded online in recent years. At TechCrunch Sessions: Justice we talked about how much responsibility social networks have in the rise of these phenomena and how to build healthy online communities that make society better, not worse with <a href="https://colorofchange.org/">Color of Change&#8217;s</a> Rashad Robinson, <a href="https://accountabletech.org/">Accountable Tech&#8217;s</a> Jesse Lehrich and Naj Austin, of <a href="https://www.somewheregood.com/">Somewhere Good</a> and <a href="https://www.ethelsclub.com/">Ethel&#8217;s Club</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On building intentional social spaces that cultivate positive behavior</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">When we think of social networks, we think of the huge platforms that dominate that conversation today. But those aren&#8217;t the only models for how digital communities can grow. Alternative social networks designed with specific communities in mind could cultivate healthier, more positive experiences for the people who need those spaces most.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Austin:</strong> One of the aspects that was really important to us when we got started was size. And so one of the factors of somewhere good is kind of connecting people with smaller, more intimate communities, because people tend to behave better in smaller networks. One of the things that we use in our product meetings to kind of base a lot of our decisions off of is mimicking a real life dinner party. Who would you invite to that party? How do people interact when they&#8217;re in those kinds of smaller intimate spaces, it tends to, again, be a lot more aligned with better behavior. And then that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s our perspective in terms of the many ways in which social networks can sort of be more user friendly and a multitude of ways. (1:26)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Even with Ethel&#8217;s Club, the physical location in Brooklyn, we built it out, so that it necessitated smaller, more intimate interactions with our members. And so we took that same little nugget of knowledge and used it digitally and Somewhere Good is now our technology platform that allows us to build that out on a much larger, faster scale, but still at that level of intention that people want to be connected in a more intimate manner with one another.&#8221; (2:49)</p></blockquote>

<h3>On tech industry exceptionalism</h3>
<p>Tech, in spite of its historic wealth and power, lobbying efforts, addictive products and global effects would never liken itself to something like the oil and gas or tobacco industries. But now that we&#8217;re seeing some of the society-wide ills Silicon Valley has sown, tech&#8217;s exceptionalism is looking more misguided than ever.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Robinson:</strong> I do think that in Silicon Valley, there&#8217;s&#8230; a tendency for people to be maybe a lot more impressed with themselves and impressed with their politics and impressed with their sort of like, ability to believe in something bigger&#8230;</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s a lot easier to deal with a Coca Cola where like I go in, and I know that these people think that they&#8217;re making soda, not making like a new society for all of us. And I can like, deal with the impacts of something that they&#8217;re doing. And we can all be on the same page, because they don&#8217;t think that they should get a Nobel Peace Prize. But in tech world, they people think that they can code, we can code our way out of structural racism, when in fact, the code is just amplifying structural racism. (8:15)</p></blockquote>

<h3>On lessons about online hate and disinformation from the Clinton campaign</h3>
<p>In 2021&#8217;s pandemic-ravaged world, 2016 feels like a world away but Donald Trump&#8217;s successful campaign for president, the Russian disinformation scandal and an open embrace of white supremacy in mainstream politics gave a telling glimpse of what was to come in the next four years — and beyond.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lehrich:</strong> Did I see QAnon coming? Probably not. But did I see this, like, horrifying crawl toward more and more explicit, you know, racism that&#8217;s always been there, obviously, but had been sort of at least relegated to the corner&#8230; You know, like, out and out racists like proud to be part open out in the open being part of these kinds of communities? That was that we definitely saw that on the horizon.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t think we necessarily grappled with it the right way. I don&#8217;t know, it was a really challenging thing to try to navigate at the time, but I very much felt like something really ugly is coming. And I definitely poured every hour of my waking time during the year and a half into that campaign, in part because I was like, terrified of where the country was headed if we didn&#8217;t win the election, and everything and more that I shared has definitely come to fruition.

<h3>On how social platforms mirrored entrenched racism in society</h3>
<p>Like more traditional sectors, the tech industry is dominated by white men who have created wealth by building what they know. The industry may be ahistorical by definition, but without looking back and grappling with the ugly side of societal power structures like misogyny and white supremacy, tech is doomed to perpetuate those same inequities at scale.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Austin:</strong> I don&#8217;t think the issues we&#8217;re seeing come from the internet and social platforms being free. I think it&#8217;s deep embedded systemic problems, as Rashad mentioned, that have haunted this country since day zero, think the people that are creating these platforms are creating what they know, which is to create, patriarchal, you know, systems that live within platforms that look glossy, and have illustrations and use fun, human centric language, but at the heart of it don&#8217;t make space for what marginalized communities feel on those platforms. And so I think that&#8217;s just embedded in almost every platform we use. As Rashad mentioned, we&#8217;ve got&#8230; the fact that [Zoom] didn&#8217;t recognize that there are people who want to purely cause terror to black people and people of color, for fun — it is a big issue.

<hr />
<h3>On how lived experience influences design</h3>
<p>One way to build social networks that allow a diverse range of communities flourish is to have those people in the room to begin with, building together on day one. Imagining online social spaces that feel safe and enriching is a natural process when your community has had to deal with online hate and harassment everywhere else for years.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Austin:</strong> How do you get in front of these issues that my team which is composed of black people, Latino people, Asian American people, queer people, non binary people, the things that we experience every single moment of being online and sort of a larger explanation of that, right? That can be Tumblr, it can be Twitter, it can almost be can every platform. All the things that we&#8217;ve lived through, we are saying, What if we didn&#8217;t have to? (16:35)</p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On how the government should hold social platforms accountable</h3>
<p>Federal and state governments are interested in cracking down on tech&#8217;s outsized power for the first time. A good place to start might be looking at tech like we already look at regulation on issues like food safety.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Robinson:</strong> We need some sort of CFPB, FDA version of infrastructure at the government level. Because anyone who has watched some of the hearings, knows that the hearings on nuclear power, or even keeping our milk safe, would look the same if we didn&#8217;t actually have government infrastructure, people who we elect to be in Congress or Senate can&#8217;t be experts on all these issues.</p>
<p>And so part of having that infrastructure is the same way I talked about having buildings that meet code. It&#8217;s not because of our elected officials or experts. It&#8217;s because we build the infrastructure at the government level, and that we actually have fines and accountability that&#8217;s at scale to make sure that they&#8217;re that they&#8217;re that there&#8217;s consequences. (22:19)</p></blockquote>
<p>The big challenge in regulating big tech companies is that they&#8217;ve become so large and so powerful that financial punishments can&#8217;t even make a dent at this point. Meaningful change needs to realign the industry&#8217;s incentives by examining the structures that allowed these companies to grow so powerful with no oversight to begin with.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lehrich:</strong> The fundamental incentive structure around large social media platforms right now is so perverse, they are incentivized to amplify the most toxic content, disinformation, hate speech — like that stuff drives engagement. And so long as they have platforms that where they have no accountability&#8230; talking about Section 230 reform, there&#8217;s no way to hold them liable from a legal standpoint, the FTC is not hitting them with fines that really hurt them. They don&#8217;t have ends and, and there&#8217;s just no friction anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8230; Until we fundamentally, fundamentally upend that incentive structure, they&#8217;re gonna continue profiting off hate and distortion and deceit and delusion and discrimination. And that&#8217;s just the reality.&#8221; (24:39)</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/">made a significant change</a> to its Google Shopping destination by making it free for e-commerce retailers to sell on Google, when before the Shopping tab had been dominated by paid product listings. It also made it free for partners to participate in Google Flights. Today, the company announced it&#8217;s now doing the same thing for hotel booking links on the Google.com/travel vertical.</p>
<p>Beginning this week, Google will make it free for hotels and travel companies around the world to appear in hotel booking links on Google.com/travel &#8212; a change that will give users a more comprehensive look into hotel room availability as they research and plan their trips.</p>
<p>The company is positioning this change as a way it can better help meet consumers&#8217; needs, ahead of the expected return of travel as the pandemic comes to an end.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When travel does resume in earnest, it’s crucial that people can find the information they’re looking for and easily connect with travel companies online,&#8221; <a href="https://blog.google/products/flights-hotels/more-choice-travelers-free-hotel-booking-links">writes</a> Richard Holden, VP of Product Management for Google&#8217;s Travel efforts, in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>In reality, the adoption of free listings is part of a larger effort underway at Google to shift many of its destinations that were previously powered by paid ads to become free listings. On the e-commerce front, this shift was meant to strategically counteract the growing threat from Amazon in e-commerce, which has steadily grown its ad business over the years. Amazon is also now often the first place users go to search for products, bypassing Google entirely &#8212; a worrying threat to Google&#8217;s core ad business.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122863" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122863" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122863" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg 2106w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=1536,904 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1206 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122863" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Shortly after the launch of free e-commerce listings, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/free-google-product-listings-expand-to-knowledge-panels-336797">Google said it saw increases</a> in clicks to its Shopping tab (70% lift as of last June) and an increase of impressions on the Shopping tab (130% lift). The idea is that, over time, Google will be able to pull in more brands to its e-commerce platform, increasing competition. As the market becomes more crowded, some brands that were previously benefitting from the free listings will turn to ads in order to increase their visibility.</p>
<p>Travel, including flights and hotels, are other areas where Google is positioned to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/cramer-to-investors-post-covid-travel-boom-could-be-skys-the-limit.html">grow in terms of post-COVID web traffic</a>. For the past several years, however, hotel booking links were offered on Google through paid Hotel Ads, which would display the real-time pricing and availability for specific travel dates.</p>
<p>With these listings now becoming free, consumers will have an expanded set of options. And that will make Google a more reliable place to search for bookings. It could help Google compete with an array of travel booking apps and services, which are also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/cramer-to-investors-post-covid-travel-boom-could-be-skys-the-limit.html">expected to boom</a> in the post-COVID months to come. And though the pandemic is not over yet, there are already signals that some are treating it as such in the U.S., with states <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mask-mandates-workers-health-safety-concerns/">lifting</a> mask mandates and Spring Breakers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/travelers-are-flocking-to-miami-for-spring-break-despite-covid-2021-3">planning their annual trips</a> to Florida beaches, for example. The full effect of the pandemic&#8217;s end hasn&#8217;t yet to be seen in travel, but consumer appetite is surely there after a year of locking down and staying at home.</p>
<p>Google today argues that the addition of the free listings will generate increased booking traffic and user engagement on its platform. And this will, in turn, expand the reach of advertisers&#8217; Hotel Ads campaigns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the shift to free listing will help bring potential new advertisers into the pipeline, too, as hotel and travel companies will be able to list for free by establishing a Hotel Center account. Over time, Google says the onboarding process will be made even easier and it will reduce the complexity of its tools to provide the hotel listings. It notes that its existing hotel partners who already participate in the Hotel Prices API and Hotel Ads don&#8217;t have to take any action to appear in free booking links.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wrapbook.com/">Wrapbook</a>, a startup that simplifies the payroll process for TV, film and commercial productions, has raised $27 million in Series A funding from noteworthy names from both the tech and entertainment worlds.</p>
<p>The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Equal Ventures and Uncork Capital, as well as from WndrCo (the investment and holding company led by DreamWorks and Quibi founder/co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg) and from CAA co-founder Michael Ovitz.</p>
<p>“It’s time we bring production financial services into the 21st century,” Katzenberg said in a statement. “We need a technology solution that will address the increasing complexities of production onboarding, pay and insuring cast and crew, only exacerbated by COVID-19, and I believe that Wrapbook delivers.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wrapbook co-founder and CEO Ali Javid explained that entertainment payroll has remained a largely old-fashioned, paper-based process, which be particularly difficult to track as cast and crew move from project to project, up to 30 times in single year. Wrapbook digitizes and simplifies the process — electronically collecting all the forms and signatures needed at the beginning of production, handling payroll itself, creating a dashboard to track payments and also making it easy to obtain the necessary insurance.</p>

<p>Although the startup was founded in 2018, Javid told me that demand has increased dramatically as production resumed during the pandemic, with COVID-19 &#8220;totally&#8221; changing the industry&#8217;s culture and prompting production companies to say, &#8220;Hey, if there’s an easier, faster way to do this from my house, then yeah let’s look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Javid also described the Wrapbook platform as a &#8220;a vertical fintech solution that&#8217;s growing really fast in an industry that we understand really well and not many others have thought about.&#8221; In fact, he said the company&#8217;s revenue grew 7x in 2020.</p>
<p>And while Wrapbook&#8217;s direct customers are the production companies, co-founder and CMO Cameron Woodward (who previously worked in filmmaking insurance and commercial production) said that the team has also focused on creating a good experience for the cast and crew who get paid through the platform — a growing number of them (12% thus far) have used their Wrapbook profiles to get paid on multiple productions.</p>

<p>The startup <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2020/08/wrapbook-raises-3-6m-in-seed-funding.html">previously raised $3.6 million in seed funding</a>. Looking ahead, Javid and Woodward said that Wrapbook&#8217;s solution could eventually be adopted in other project-based industries. But for now, they see plenty of opportunity to continue growing within entertainment alone — they estimated that the industry currently sees $200 billion in annual payments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to double down on what’s working and build things out based on what customers have asked for within entertainment,&#8221; Javid said. &#8220;To that end, we&#8217;re working towards hiring 100 people in the next 12 months.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pegasustechventures.com/">Pegasus Tech Ventures</a>, a firm that helps corporations launch startup investment funds, announced a new partnership with <a href="https://www.japanet.co.jp/shopping/">Japanet</a> today. Japanet, one of Japan&#8217;s largest television shopping companies, and Pegasus have established a $50 million venture fund to invest in startups from around the world, including for a major new development in Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Japanet is looking for startups to support its expansion into new sectors. These include a building project called Stadium City in Nagasaki that will open in 2024. It will center around a sports stadium, and include mixed-use facilities like offices, retail stores, hotels and event venues. Japanet also plans to focus on new services for elderly people, and children’s education.</p>
<p>Anis Uzzaman, general partner and chief executive officer of Pegasus Tech Ventures, told TechCrunch that Stadium City was created to help revitalize Nagasaki’s economy and bring new products and services, including tech, from around the world to the city. Japanet’s plan is to &#8220;both co-develop solutions with earlier-stage startups over time, as well as help later-stage startups localize and deploy in the Stadium City,&#8221; said Uzzaman.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Preply, a tutoring marketplace for language learning, has raised a $35 million Series B co-led by Full In Partners and Owl Ventures, an edtech fund that has backed Byju’s and Newsela. The raise comes nearly a year after the company landed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/online-tutoring-marketplace-preply-banks-10m-to-fuel-growth-in-north-america-europe/">$10 million Series A</a>. Investors in Preply include Point Nine Capital, Hoxton Ventures, EduCapital, All Iron, Diligent Capital and Evli Growth Partners.</p>
<p>Preply’s recent growth, as well as a global boom in language learning, explains the current investor interest.</p>
<p>When it closed its Series A, Preply had 2 million booked lessons and 10,000 vetted tutors. One year later, there have been over 10 million lessons booked on the platform, and the tutor network has grown to 40,000 people across 190 countries. The startup was eyeing United States expansion in 2020, and today, ⅓ of its revenue comes from the country, making it the single largest market that the company has customers in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The growth signals that Preply is finding traction despite heavyweight competitors such as Duolingo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/duolingo-ceo-explains-language-apps-surge-in-bookings/">which plans to IPO this year</a>, and Babbel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/language-learning-service-babbel-adds-live-classes-games-and-more/">which crossed $150 million in recognized revenue in 2019</a>. Bigali says it’s been able to differentiate itself from others because of its technology, which uses artificial intelligence to connect students with tutors.</p>
<p>Preply’s sell is that it can connect students to the tutors that are best for their specific learning needs, weighing over 400 parameters before connecting two within a marketplace. For example, Bigali said that Preply can connect a student in San Francisco who likes studying in evenings with a tutor in a conducive timezone. It can also help students find tutors who have similar backgrounds than them, such as a bi-lingual base to help go in between languages for learning.</p>
<p>Preply’s largest difference from competitors is in its philosophy of how learning should be done. Preply believes that learning should be live and with a native speaker, while a company like Duolingo thinks it can be gamified and self-led.</p>

<p>“Our customers think that our way of learning a foreign language is much more effective than language learning apps,” CEO Kirill Bigali said. Preply supports 50 different languages, including Spanish, English, French, as well as niche languages such as Icelandic, Tibetan and Catalan.</p>
<p>Other language learning apps have similarly been able to grow amid the pandemic even despite historical disinterest in the edtech subsector and existing players. Fluent Forever raised $4.9 million for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/fluent-forever-raises-4-9m-for-its-language-learning-system/">language learning system</a>, and Fluent City, which is a different company, launched subscription service.</p>
<p>Biglai sees a big opportunity for Preply in the enterprise. The company began selling to globally distributed businesses, as a solution to help employees learn languages of their colleagues and clients, in 2019. This year, Preply should have “hundreds and hundreds” of enterprise customers, Biglai said.</p>
<p>The company makes money by revenue-share agreements with its tutors. It takes 20% of each lesson fee, which ranges from $15 to $20 per hour, as well as the entire cost of the first lesson, as a lieu of a lead generation. With the enterprise offering, Preply has the same business model but the hours per employee are capped with the employer taking the cost.</p>
<p>Preply wouldn’t share teacher retention metrics, which would indicate how long teachers stay on the platform (which is key for student comprehension and continuity in learning experiences). Bigali did say that 30% of its top teachers stay on for numerous years.</p>
<p>The company refused to share revenue, but said that it could be profitable if it wanted to be. For now, it’s prioritizing growth in its B2B offering and business development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mainspringenergy.com/">Mainspring Energy</a>, the developer of a new generator technology that use fuels like biogas and hydrogen, has unveiled its Mainspring Linear Generator, with a $150 million contract with NextEra Energy Resources.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology represents a significant step in the transition to a zero-carbon power grid given its ability to shift between traditional natural gas sources and alternative fuel sources like biogas and hydrogen.</p>
<p>So far, the company&#8217;s generators are under contract with a national supermarket chain that&#8217;s using the company&#8217;s tech at 30 of its grocery stores. The company began shipping pilot units in June and will begin commerical statements in mid-2021 according to a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s tech was initially developed at a thermodynamics lab in Stanford University where co-founders Shannon Miller, Matt Svrcek and Adam Simpson were working. Its design enables the rollout of generators that can replace traditional diesel and be used to improve the resilience of industrial sites against natural disasters.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Their linear generator, which the company said differs from engines, microturbines, and fuel cells, is a device that converts motion along a straight line into electricity using heat or chemical energy. In Mainspring&#8217;s case, a low temperature reaction of air and fuel drives magnets through copper coils to produce electricity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the combination of the design and control software developed by the company that allows its equipment to produce high-efficiency, dispatchable power, without the nitrogen oxide emissions associated with other generators, the company said.</p>
<p>The technology caught the eye of investors like Bill Gates and Vinod Khosla&#8217;s eponymous investment firm Khosla Ventures, along with some oil and gas companies like Equinor and utilities like American Electric Power. To date, Mainspring, which used to go by the name Etagen, has raised well over $80 million in financing.</p>
<p>In its approach to energy generation without the need for more complex mechanical systems or catalysts, Mainspring is akin to other startups like the Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Gates-backed Turntide Technologies that are trying to provide more elegant, software enabled solutions to motors and generator technologies.</p>
<p>Mainspring&#8217;s generators achieve their low capital and maintenance costs through use of standard materials, only two moving parts, and an innovative air bearing system that eliminates the need for oil, the company said. It operates without the use of complex mechanical systems or expensive catalysts.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Firms backed by Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Gates have funded an electric motor company that slashes energy consumption&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/firms-backed-by-robert-downey-jr-and-bill-gates-have-funded-an-electric-motor-company-that-can-slas/embed/#?secret=ktguf9xmMC" data-secret="ktguf9xmMC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company also touted its ability to spin up and spin down in response to conditions on the energy grid, which means that it can pair well with solar power or battery storage.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our customers&#8217; key drivers, in addition to carbon savings, is to save cost from their current grid prices,&#8221; said Miller, in a statement. &#8220;Our products can provide substantial savings to commercial customers on their electricity costs with a typical Energy Services Agreement. In this energy-as-a-service scenario, customers pay nothing up front and realize annual savings starting in the first year.”</p>
<p>Mainspring&#8217;s first commercial product is designed for a rated output of 250 kW and packaged in a standard 8&#8242; x 20&#8242; container, according to a statement. Those packages integrate two of the company&#8217;s125 kW linear generator cores, working in tandem, and combines UL-listed grid-tie inverters and auxiliaries into a turn-key package, the company said. Future configurations will provide higher power output to serve industrial businesses, data centers, hospitals, smart cities, and utility grid-level applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many commercial and industrial customers as well as utilities want clean, reliable power generation, with the capability to switch to 100% renewable fuels like biogas and hydrogen as they become available,&#8221; said NextEra Energy Resources President and CEO John Ketchum, in a statement. &#8220;Mainspring is able to integrate clean onsite generation with both renewables and the grid and we&#8217;re pleased to support bringing this innovative product to market.&#8221; <u></u></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rep. Barbara Lee (D-13 California) took time out of her busy schedule this week to join us for TechCrunch Sessions: Justice. During our our wide-ranging discussion, she talked about the issues in tech that unfortunately do not get enough attention: a lack of diversity in tech, the so-called pipeline problem, the digital divide and access for all to the legal cannabis marketplace.</p>
<p>Rep. Lee has represented the 13<sup>th</sup> District of California &#8212; Oakland and the surrounding East Bay cities &#8212; since 1998. Since then she has been an active member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which formed 50 years ago this month with 13 members and continues to have an enduring impact on the nation.</p>
<p>“They were truly the conscience of the Congress,” Lee says, “because these 13 members of Congress on each and every issue, they pushed the envelope for justice &#8212; for racial justice. Yes, for the African American community, but in their initial founding statement, they said for all marginalized communities in this country. And so if you fight for justice for African Americans, you&#8217;re fighting for justice and equality for everyone who has been left out of this country&#8217;s promise of the American dream.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<hr />
<h3>On a lack of diversity in tech</h3>
<p>Rep. Lee, along with Rep. Maxine Waters and other Congressional Black Caucus members have visited companies in Silicon Valley and New York to address the issue of diversity in tech. In 2015, as a part of <a href="https://cbc.house.gov/uploadedfiles/cbc_tech_2020___updated.pdf">TECH2020</a> [PDF], the members met with CEOs of some of the biggest companies in the world to get their take on diversity in tech and the struggles the wider industry seems to have when it comes to increasing representation on their teams.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve made many trips to Silicon Valley and to New York and have met with the tech sector over and over and over again. We see a glimmer of hope, but not much. When you look at the numbers of the workforce in terms of employees, I think we&#8217;re looking from maybe &#8212; as it relates to African Americans &#8212; but maybe from 2 to about 7%. If that. When you look at the retention numbers, cultural hostility in many respects that tech sector employees tell me they were faced once they&#8217;re in, they don&#8217;t stay a long time, because the culture has not been a culture friendly for African Americans and Latinx individuals. And it&#8217;s a problem. And we&#8217;re gonna keep pushing. I co-chair TECH2020, which we started five years ago. And we&#8217;ve heard so many excuses from tech sector.… We’ve got to crack that culture. And I&#8217;m telling you, we&#8217;ve got to do before we exercise our regulatory reform, and I&#8217;ll stick because there&#8217;s no way in America, any tech sector, any company should have only &#8212; and especially in California, only 2 to 7% of African Americans in the in the workforce. <strong>(</strong><em><strong>Timestamp: 2:48)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The conversation around diversity in tech is one that began years ago. Public diversity reports illustrate the struggle that companies still find themselves engaged in. And potential unwillingness to address the issue. Rep. Lee says she and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus have their eyes on the industry as a whole. And she talked a bit more about what tools the federal government has in its arsenal to help encourage companies to engage in equitable hiring.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have Black members everywhere on key committees that are conducting oversight and making sure that the tech sector, especially those &#8212; many received federal contracts, and they&#8217;re required to comply with executive order 11924. And they just don&#8217;t. They get away with it. And so no, I&#8217;m not satisfied. I think we made some progress, we see more diversity officers and more human resources officers who are African American, and I work closely with them. And I know the challenges that they&#8217;re faced with it. So I try to help them from the outside to make those companies respond in a more adequate and in a fair and equitable manner. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 5:26)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On the so-called ‘pipeline problem’</h3>
<p>The “pipeline.” It’s what company heads point to when they’re asked why their rosters lack diversity. The thing is, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">it’s not real</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a total myth. First of all, we have &#8212; I know African American engineers, African American professionals who, quote qualify for these jobs. But I do know there&#8217;s unconscious bias, i.e. racism in the companies. And so a lot of the companies have developed these anti-racist policies and programs where they tried to do the deep dive and try to help people understand unconscious bias and what have you, but they don&#8217;t take the results and implement them. And so it&#8217;s just really, you know, it&#8217;s not good. When you look at the tech sector jobs, I believe it&#8217;s about 40% are non-tech-related. And so you can&#8217;t tell me that we don&#8217;t have African American accountants, and, you know, auditors, African American communications firms, all of the services that they buy, they don&#8217;t contract with, and the non-tech jobs they don&#8217;t hire black people for. And so it&#8217;s a shame and disgrace, but we&#8217;re gonna keep pushing. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 6:08)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On investing in diversity</h3>
<p>Oakland, Calif.-based Kapor Capital, the investment arm of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/kapor-capital-is-raising-a-125-million-fund/">raised $125 million</a> for its third fund. The firm’s investing thesis promotes startups that are committed to building diverse teams and a culture of inclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank god for Kapor… They’re committed to racial equity and racial justice. And in terms of their venture capital strategies in terms of how they seed firms to begin to enter into this space. What they do all over the state and in the country is remarkable. And I&#8217;m so proud that they are in Oakland, because Oakland, I think, is a microcosm of all of the possibilities, but all the challenges that we as African Americans and people of color have in America. <strong>(</strong><em><strong>Timestamp: 10:55)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On cannabis</h3>
<p>There remains a disproportionate number of Blacks incarcerated due to drug offenses. And as states continue to legalize marijuana, most recently in New Jersey just last week, the industry is seeing incredible growth. But Black Americans are being excluded from the economic benefits of that. As the co-chair of the Cannabis Caucus, Rep. Lee has plans to ensure the capital in the burgeoning legal cannabis market is available to all.</p>
<blockquote><p>I also have legislation is called the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/163/text">RESPECT Act</a>, which is about equity in the industry. The licenses &#8212; as of last year only maybe 1% or less were granted to African Americans. This is a trillion-dollar industry. And I don&#8217;t want to see what&#8217;s happening in the tech sector happening in the cannabis sector now, so we&#8217;re at the beginning of this. So we have in the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884/text">MORE Act</a> and in my bills, requirements to set up offices of equity and how you bring companies and help companies &#8212; I know in my own district we have an Office of Equity &#8212; to help them weed through the bureaucracy to get their licenses. But also access to capital. Sometimes it&#8217;s [$300K] to $500K just for a license… But I am determined &#8212; I am determined that we&#8217;re going to see those who have been most affected by these, this horrific draconian war on drugs get access to the industry and to the benefits. This industry creates jobs – good-paying jobs. They create economic opportunities, and they create community reinvestment opportunities, and so why not? And we&#8217;ve got to move forward. And we&#8217;re making a lot of progress. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 13:03)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new alliance between Swedish electric performance automaker Polestar and EV infrastructure startup ChargePoint takes aim at the charging experience with the debut of an in-car app that will let customers seamlessly charge their Polestar 2 model vehicles.</p>
<p>Seamless charging—being able to pull up to a charging station, plug in and let the vehicle handle billing and payment—has been dominated by Tesla through its branded Supercharger network. Most other EV drivers have to pay for charging using an RFID card or smartphone, and the convenience level is on-par with a traditional gas station. The partnership eliminates the need for these extra items at ChargePoint’s more than 130,000 stations. The app will embed directly into Polestar 2’s in-car “infotainment system,” which runs on Google’s Android Automotive OS.</p>

<p>There have been some inroads into seamless charging elsewhere, most notably by Electrify America, the entity established by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel-emissions scandal. It introduced an in-car payment technology dubbed Plug&amp;Charge last November that will allow 2021 models of the Porsche Taycan, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Lucid Air to seamlessly charge at its stations.</p>
<p>The partnership also takes aim at the buying experience, another area that Tesla’s cornered with its branded Wall Connector home charger. Polestar 2 drivers will now be able to order the $699 ChargePoint Home Flex home charger alongside the purchase of a Polestar 2 and arrange for home installation prior to vehicle delivery.</p>
<p>It’s a blueprint for future collaboration between the two companies, ChargePoint senior VP Bill Loewenthal said in a statement. The partnerships may be the start of many more alliances between automakers and EV infrastructure companies who see user experience as a key part of their value proposition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arlan Hamilton, the Backstage Capital founder and managing partner, joined us at TC: Sessions Justice to chat about how she vets founders beyond Stanford signal, the changing role of venture capital, how raising money from the community, versus institutional LPs, can impact Backstage strategy.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>On what makes a founder make sense for Backstage Capital</strong></h3>
<p>In a world of $1 billion valuations for beta-stage startups and deals closed over the Twitter DMs within hours, it feels like the noisiest time in venture in the recent past. Hamilton talked a bit about how her firm, which has backed over 170 companies founded by underestimated founders, keeps focus. She got into if she follows trends, the dynamic of invite-only apps, and, of course, Twitter.</p>
<blockquote><p>I just don&#8217;t engage and follow and I just don&#8217;t have the that same need to be on everything early in first and be everywhere. Really. So, I like to watch people kind of run around and ask for invites and things like that. It&#8217;s just not as important to me. It&#8217;s just a strategy of like keeping myself calm, because there&#8217;s always a VIP to the VIP section, there&#8217;s always a further, further, further, and I find some of it quite distracting. I think it helps just to know where I was just a few years ago, and to know, kind of what&#8217;s important&#8230;and not get caught up in any hype anytime. And I think that serves me well when I&#8217;m making investment decisions, too. Because people who interview me or are, you know, want insights from me, they are always asking me about &#8220;trends.&#8221;  And I just don&#8217;t know the trends. We&#8217;re kind of counter-intuitive and and dancing to the sound of a different beat anyways. So I think that&#8217;s all helpful when we&#8217;re looking at companies and finding things in different places.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 1:32)</strong></em></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Backstage Capital was in the fortuitous spot of being built on remote work before the pandemic made it necessary. Still, Hamilton said that vetting early-stage founders is a difficult thing to do, and Backstage Capital only backs about 2% of the founders it sees.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you talk about founder product fit, we have that in spades. I am gay, and if I wanted to my wife and I wanted to have a child, there would be a lot that goes into that. There&#8217;s no accidental pregnancy with us. And so many people, you know, in the same boat, it&#8217;s almost like that with underrepresented, underestimated founders. They have so much to lose [and] I think they don&#8217;t have a second and a third and a fourth chances are that afforded to them. And so a lot of times, you&#8217;ll see companies that are built from such authenticity, and such genuine concern about a problem that they&#8217;re trying to solve, rather than so many companies I see elsewhere, that are how do we get rich the fastest way we possibly can. And that doesn&#8217;t always set you up with the right with the right recipe for success.<strong><em> (Timestamp 8:04)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3><strong>On the future of venture capital as an asset class </strong></h3>
<p>One thing that came up during the conversation was that Hamilton doesn&#8217;t see Backstage Capital staying within the definition of a traditional venture capital firm. At first thought, this shouldn&#8217;t come as a total surprise, considering the rise in popularity of alternative financing among startups, from debt raises, to rolling funds, to revenue-based financing loans.</p>
<p>But in reality, Hamilton says that she has always known that Backstage Capital was a vector into the exclusive world of investment, which despite modest progress has still been reserved for wealthy, white men. Here&#8217;s what she said when I asked where she sees herself in five years:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve always said this, I don&#8217;t know if people pay too much attention to it, but I&#8217;ve always said that venture capital was the tool. It was the mechanism for which I could get in. I couldn&#8217;t be an angel investor, couldn&#8217;t do all these things. But, I could earn and learn my way in to venture capital. I&#8217;ve never been beholden to it. I&#8217;ve always said to that, I don&#8217;t know what the future holds. But I think maybe there&#8217;s another asset class that gets born. And we would certainly be part of that. And if that&#8217;s the case, I just think it&#8217;s a broken system. It&#8217;s an old system. There is a lot that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>And, again, it&#8217;s the people are kind of living in a fantasy world&#8230;So I think, just the way that I came in, I&#8217;ll probably pivot or or backstage, we&#8217;ll find ways we&#8217;ve already started. I mean, if you look at the rays that we did on Republic recently, that were that were, you know, still you could still be part of it, it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s an interesting thing. It didn&#8217;t exist, the way that we wanted it to exist this ability to to go to the crowd as a fund. And we trailblazing made a way we made a path. And I think that&#8217;s what founders are doing. We were just inspired by founders who are making a way for themselves left and right.<em> <strong>(Timestamp: 15:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">Examining the pipeline problem</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Her confidence in a potential pivot of Backstage Capital also stems from the fact that venture capital has stagnated, as an industry, to invest in underrepresented founders. The investor explained how the industry might lag behind from big deals if they continue to skip over diverse founders. Venture capital, as she sees it, might become less relevant in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>And eventually what&#8217;s going to happen is what I&#8217;ve seen so much of the same way people are leaving San Francisco in droves, they&#8217;re going to leave the arena of venture capital in droves. because so many people have just said I&#8217;m done trying to play that game. I&#8217;m going to bypass this altogether. I&#8217;m going to bootstrap I&#8217;m going to crowdfund I&#8217;m going to go with family offices. And venture capitalists don&#8217;t have that same sway and that same importance that they once did. And you may not feel that today, but you feel it soon. And you&#8217;re going to be the person who did not invest in Bumble, you&#8217;re going to be the person who did not invest in XYZ. So it&#8217;s at your own peril that you keep being blind to this in my opinion.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 14:38)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On raising from a community</h3>
<p>Since founding Backstage Capital, Hamilton has been clear that she believes the biggest opportunity for investment is underrepresented founders. Toddy, she talked about her decision to bring let others into the process through Republic.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s be clear: equity crowdfunding isn’t a new concept, but this year will likely bring some healthy energy to the fundraising technique. It’s because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/will-new-sec-equity-crowdfunding-rules-encourage-more-founders-to-pass-the-hat/">new SEC rules</a> allow companies to now raise $5 million a year through the fundraising channel. Republic is enabling startups and firms to take advantage of these new rules: the platform had more than $150 million in capital deployed across 150 deals in 2020.</p>
<p>In the chat, Hamilton explained why raising from supporters one by one instead of an institutional fund is important toher.</p>
<blockquote><p>For so many years, we had been beholden to &#8216;you need to raise a large fund, and then you need the management fee to pay for your operations, to keep you in business.&#8217; And every single year, we found a different way to do that, by necessity. It has been so difficult to raise. And this time, the crowd comes into play. That&#8217;s a grand and a great responsibility to have 1000s of people who are looking to you, looking for updates, and wanting you to win. I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. I&#8217;d much rather have 5000 people get a few extra bucks every year and be part of this, then to watch one or two institutional just get fatter. It&#8217;s just not as exciting.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> announced today that it plans to acquire <a href="https://www.docsend.com/">DocSend</a> for $165 million The company helps customers share and track documents by sending a secure link instead of an attachment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re announcing that we&#8217;re acquiring DocSend to help us deliver an even broader set of tools for remote work, and DocSend helps customers securely manage and share their business critical documents, backed by powerful engagement analytics,&#8221; Houston told me.</p>
<p>When combined with the electronic signature capability of HelloSign, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/dropbox-snares-hellosign-for-230m-gets-workflow-and-esignature/">Dropbox acquired in 2019</a>, the acquisition gives the company an end-to-end document sharing workflow it had been missing. &#8220;Dropbox, DocSend and HelloSign will be able to offer a full suite of self-serve products to help our millions of customers manage the entire critical document workflows and give more control over all aspects of that,&#8221; Houston explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Houston and DocSend co-founder and CEO Russ Heddleston have known each for other years, and have an established relationship. In fact, Heddleston worked for Dropbox as a summer in intern in 2010. He even ran the idea for the company by Houston prior to launching in 2013, who gave it his seal of approval, and the two companies have been partners for some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just been following the thread of external sending, which has just kind of evolved and opened up into all these different workflows. And it&#8217;s just really interesting that by just being laser focused on that we&#8217;ve been able to create a really differentiated product that users love a ton,&#8221; Heddleston said.</p>
<p>Those workflows include creative, sales, client services or startups using DocSend to deliver proposals or pitch decks and track engagement. In fact, among the earliest use cases for the company was helping startups track engagement with their pitch decks at VC firms.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jNxt2NVT6e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/11/docsend-funding/">DocSend raises $8M for smarter document sharing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DocSend raises $8M for smarter document sharing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/11/docsend-funding/embed/#?secret=jNxt2NVT6e" data-secret="jNxt2NVT6e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company raised a modest amount of the money along the way, just $15.3 million, according to Crunchbase, but Heddleston says that he wanted to build a company that was self-sufficient and raising more VC dollars was never a priority or necessity. &#8220;We had [VCs] chase us to give us more money all the time, and what we would tell our employees is that we don&#8217;t keep count based on money raised or headcount. It&#8217;s just about building a great company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That builder&#8217;s attitude was one of the things that attracted Houston to the company. &#8220;We&#8217;re big believers in the model of product growth and capital efficiency, and building really intuitive products that are viral, and that&#8217;s a lot of what what attracted us to DocSend,&#8221; Houston said. While DocSend has 17,000 customers, Houston says the acquisition gives the company the opportunity to get in front of a much larger customer base as part of Dropbox.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Box offers a similar secure document sharing capability enabling users to share a link instead of using an attachment. It recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">bought e-signature startup SignRequest for $55 million</a> with an eye toward building more complex document workflows similar to what Dropbox now has with HelloSign and DocSend. <a href="http://www.pandadoc.com/">PandaDoc</a> is another competitor in this space.</p>
<p>Both Dropbox and SendDoc participated in the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield with Houston <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frsVoYyKpTk">debuting Dropbox in 2008</a> at the TechCrunch 50, the original name of the event. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/docsend-gives-you-analytics-for-documents/">DocSend participated in 2014</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York City.</p>
<p>DocSend&#8217;s approximately 50 employees will be joining Dropbox when the deal closes, which should happen soon, subject to standard regulatory oversight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://demostack.com/">Demostack</a>, an early stage startup that wants to make it easy for companies to build software demos, announced $17.3 million in funding today. The company also announced it was coming out of stealth.</p>
<p>That investment breaks down into a $13.3 million Series A led by Bessemer Venture Partners with help from GTM Fund and several individual investors. They also announced a $4 million seed from last December led by Amiti Ventures with participation from Operator Collective, Cerca Partners and a slew of individual investors. All the seed investors also participated in the A round, according to the company.</p>
<p>Software companies of all types face challenges in building a quality demo, one that doesn&#8217;t expose actual customer information, yet shows all of the functionality in a reasonably realistic way. It&#8217;s a problem that co-founder and CEO Jonathan Friedman experienced in his previous job and he wanted to do something about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a perfect demo environment. And what that means is that it&#8217;s one that is controlled by sales or marketing. [&#8230;] There is no need for [engineering] at all, and it&#8217;s customized for each prospect by default,&#8221; Friedman explained.</p>
<p>He said that it removes that anxiety that the demo won&#8217;t work, or that you will expose data you&#8217;re not supposed to. &#8220;Demo anxiety is real. Just having to worry about PII (personally identifiable information), and having people logging on and coming in and creating stuff within our production environment was unsustainable,&#8221; he told me.</p>
<p>Friedman founded Demostack to change that. They provide a full demo building tool that starts with a recording of the environment, so it looks and feels like the live product, and you can create auto customization with variables like customer name that link to the CRM tool and pull in information for you as you build the demo for a particular prospect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a solution that caught the attention of Adam Fisher, partner at lead investor Bessemer Venture Partners. &#8220;Demostack gives every software business a powerful competitive advantage, allowing them to better engage their prospective customers, doing away with old school temperamental demos,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Demostack already has 20 employees with plans to triple that number by the end of this year. He said the company is already embracing diversity among its early employees, and sees this as an important building block.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the main reasons that we wanted to lean into this early is because being a diverse company is not a bonus. It&#8217;s not like, &#8216;Oh I&#8217;ll do this to make people happy about me&#8217;. You can&#8217;t understand how people from different walks of life see reality. Everyone sees a different slice of reality. If you can&#8217;t grasp that you will never build a company that is successful,&#8221; Friedman said.</p>
<p>The company launched last September and released an early version of the product in February. Today, Demostack is publicly unveiling the company, although it doesn&#8217;t expect to have the complete product ready for distribution until mid-year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Apple announced early results from its ongoing hearing health study. Conducted alongside the University of Michigan School of Public Health, the figures were released to mark World Hearing Day. Now, a day after International Women’s Day, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apple-womens-health-study-releases-preliminary-data-to-help-destigmatize-menstrual-symptoms/">it’s releasing results</a> tied to its Women’s Health Study.</p>
<p>As with the hearing study, the figures are collected from those who choose to participate via the Research app the company launched back in 2019. It’s all a part of Apple’s attempts to take a more serious approach to user health, built, in part, on data collected through the Apple Watch and iPhone.</p>
<p>Early results note that symptoms like nausea and sleep changes are common, along with more frequently discussed things like bloating and cramps. The study also notes that many of the tracked symptoms are common and consistent across age, race and location &#8212; even though they may not be widely discussed. The company says the efforts are, in part, to de-stigmatize discussions around these sorts of symptoms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Data was collected from some 10,000 participants around the U.S. with a range of different ages and ethnic backgrounds. While much of the data collection is still in early stages, Apple and research partner Harvard are looking to study the connection between menstrual cycles and a variety of different health conditions, including infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome and perimenopause.</p>
<p>&#8220;What researchers and physicians in the scientific community want and need to know is more about the menstrual cycle, its relation to long-term health, as well as more about what environmental factors might affect cycle length and characteristics,” Harvard&#8217;s Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah said in a statement. “With this study, we are creating a larger foundational data set on this topic, which can eventually lead to further discovery and innovation in women’s health research and care.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A little over one year ago, <a href="https://www.pipe.com">Pipe</a> raised a $6 million seed round led by Craft Ventures to help it pursue its mission of giving SaaS companies a funding alternative outside of equity or venture debt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The buzzy startup’s goal with the money was to give SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts. (Pipe describes its buy-side participants as “a vetted group of financial institutions and banks.”)</p>
<p dir="ltr">A few months after that initial seed raise, Pipe brought in another $10 million in funding as an extension of that round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">And now today, Miami-based Pipe is announcing a new raise &#8212; $50 million in “strategic equity funding” from a slew of high-profile investors. Siemens&#8217; Next47 and Jim Pallotta’s Raptor Group co-led the round, which also included participation from Shopify, Slack, HubSpot, Okta, Social Capital&#8217;s Chamath Palihapitiya, Marc Benioff, Michael Dell’s MSD Capital, Republic, Alexis Ohanian and Joe Lonsdale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While most of the round is dedicated to purchasing primary equity, a minority of the round is allocated toward buying secondary equity (meaning that a small portion of the dollars raised went toward buying shares from existing shareholders, such as employees and executives).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pipe co-CEO and co-founder Harry Hurst is loath to label the latest raise with a stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We don’t want to play the alphabet game,” he said. “This wasn’t about the money. We had five or six years of runway going into this round. It was about getting the right partners on our cap table.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In conjunction with the new financing, Pipe said it is also broadening the scope of its platform beyond strictly SaaS companies to “any company with a recurring revenue stream.” This could include D2C subscription companies, ISP, streaming services or a telecommunications companies. Even VC fund admin and management are being piped on its platform, for example, according to Hurst.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When we first went to market, we were very focused on SaaS, our first vertical,” he said. “Since then, over 3,000 companies have signed up to use our platform.” Those companies range from early-stage and bootstrapped with $200,000 in revenue to publicly traded companies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pipe’s platform assesses a customer’s key metrics by integrating with its accounting, payment processing and banking systems. It then instantly rates the performance of the business and qualifies them for a trading limit. Trading limits currently range from $50,000 for smaller early-stage and bootstrapped companies to over $100 million for late-stage and publicly traded companies, although there is no cap on how large a trading limit can be.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Revenue-based financing: The next step for private equity and early-stage investment&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/revenue-based-financing-the-next-step-for-private-equity-and-early-stage-investment/embed/#?secret=l3okwL6YKK" data-secret="l3okwL6YKK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">“The best way to summarize it is we can work with any company that has a high degree of predictability around their revenue,” Hurst said. Pipe, he added, aims to turn that monthly recurring revenue into annual recurring revenue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the first quarter of 2021, tens of millions of dollars were traded across the Pipe platform. Between its launch in late June 2020 through year’s end, the company also saw “tens of millions” in trades take place via its marketplace. Tradable ARR on the platform is currently in excess of $1 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re helping companies grow on their own terms,” Hurst said. “Or, you could say we’re building the Nasdaq for revenue. Virtually every company in the world has a recurring revenue model already, or if they don’t, they’re thinking about how they can shift to it.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Pipe is also using its new capital and partnerships to take its platform to a global stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup officially launched in the U.S. but is seeing traction in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada. Long-term, Hurst expects India to be one of its largest markets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When we talk about global expansion, we’re talking about multi-currency support,” Hurst said. “And, teams on the ground in local markets. Technically we’ve served a global audience from day one.”</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Some context</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Hurst, Josh Mangel and Zain Allarakhia founded Pipe in September 2019.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal of the platform is to offer companies with recurring revenue streams access to capital so they don’t dilute their ownership by accepting external capital or forcing them to take out loans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pipe, essentially, is a trading platform for a new asset class: recurring revenue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But Hurst is also quick to say the 25-person company doesn’t view its solution as an alternative to equity in every case.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We feel like there’s a very important time and place for equity,” he said. “The fundamental problem with equity is that selling it becomes more valuable over time as you grow.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pipe, he said, has no cost of capital. Institutional investors compete against each other for deals on its platform. In return, Pipe charges both parties on each side of the transaction a fixed trading fee of up to 1%, depending on the volume.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its goal with the latest round is to partner with its investors “to provide access to growth capital for the millions of customers they collectively service.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They’re building tools on the product side and we’re providing access to capital markets, and especially in the case of early-stage companies that would not otherwise have access to capital, we’re trying to level the playing field,” Hurst said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its investors all echo a similar sentiment: that they like how Pipe gives companies an alternative to traditional funding mechanisms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Monty Gray, SVP Corporate Development at Okta, believes Pipe’s platform “simplifies the time-consuming process of traditional fundraising, allowing founders to focus on their core product growth.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are excited to see how Pipe can help not only Okta Ventures&#8217; portfolio startups approach financing, but also Okta’s large customer base,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Social Capital founder &amp; CEO Palihapitiya</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pipe is leveling the playing field for companies in the capital markets.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By taking the underlying contracts that generate recurring revenue</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">streams and making them tradable for the first time, Pipe has unlocked a multi-trillion dollar asset</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">class, revenue,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/">raising a Series C worth $45 million</a>, Chicago-based <a href="https://www.m1finance.com/">M1 Finance</a> announced a new round of capital today. A Series D, the new $75 million investment was led by Coatue, with two prior investors &#8212; Left Lane Capital and Clocktower Technology Ventures &#8212; also taking part.</p>
<p>The new financing comes after M1 raised twice in 2020, including the previously mentioned Series C and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/m1-finance-raises-33m-series-b-as-it-reaches-1-45b-aum/">smaller $33 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>While rapid-fire fundraising has become increasingly common in recent years, M1 Finance&#8217;s recent capital accretion remains notable for its pace and scale. And as the company has been comparatively free with both growth metrics and notes about its long-term business model, TechCrunch has been able to keep tabs on its expansion over the past few quarters.</p>
<h2>M1 Finance&#8217;s growth</h2>
<p>In February of 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/chicagos-m1-finance-a-consumer-focused-fintech-platform-reaches-1b-under-management/">M1 announced</a> it had reached the $1 billion assets-under-management (AUM) mark after starting the year at $800 million. At the time, the company&#8217;s CEO Brian Barnes told TechCrunch that his company was targeting to generate revenues of around 1% of consumer AUM. That provided a good toe-hold into tracking how quickly the startup was scaling its revenues as it grew its asset base.</p>
<p>In June of 2020, the company announced its Series B and a new AUM milestone: $1.45 billion. That was something akin to 50% growth in les than half a year. Not bad.</p>
<p>When M1 Finance raised its Series C later that year, it had scaled to $2 billion in AUM. That was double its earlier-year tally, and was big enough to secure more of our attention. Then in January of 2021 the company <a href="https://www.m1finance.com/blog/m1-hits-3-billion-in-client-assets/">announced $3 billion in AUM</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As expected, stock trading service Public raises $220M at unicorn valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/embed/#?secret=Kh0ReiKuHd" data-secret="Kh0ReiKuHd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you can quickly math out, 1% of $3 billion is $30 million in yearly income, provided that M1 is hitting its revenue goals. Today as part of its Series D, the company announced that it has reached $3.5 billion in AUM.</p>
<p>How did it manage such quick growth, adding $500 million in AUM in just a few months? According to Barnes, partially due to an expanding product mix. The startup added a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190128005559/en/M1-Finance-Announces-Checking-Integrated-with-Automated-Investment-Portfolio">cash-management product in early 2019</a>. That service has reached hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, the CEO said. The company&#8217;s borrowing product has also seen rapid growth, quadrupling as a percentage of assets in the last year, he added.</p>
<p>AUM expansion has also been driven in part by the company&#8217;s user base. Barnes told TechCrunch that his company has around 500,00 funded accounts, a growing tally that has helped with word-of-mouth marketing in recent quarters. And, finally, AUM growth has come from existing user cohorts adding more capital to their M1 accounts over time, the CEO said.</p>
<p>Of course the company is not the only service in the savings, investing and spending spaces that has seen growth in the last year. Robinhood and Public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/">have done well on</a> the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">investing side of things</a>, and Chime has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">scaled quickly</a> in the spending and saving markets.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s ahead</h2>
<p>M1 has more money than ever after this round, with its CEO telling TechCrunch that he had had no intention of raising new capital, and that his company had only barely touched its Series B while its entire Series C is untapped. But now with a fresh forklift of funds, perhaps M1 can boost its advertising spend to help keep its user growth strong; and the extra capital won&#8217;t hurt when it comes to competing with even better-funded rivals that also want to build consumer fintech super apps.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll check back with M1 Finance when it reaches $10 billion AUM. Its CEO thinks that the company could reach double-digit billions of AUM by the end of the year, or early 2022. Let&#8217;s see how fast it reaches that next milestone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.cubesoftware.com/">Cube</a>, a startup that builds FP&amp;A software for the mid-market, announced that it has raised a $10 million Series A. The company previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/cube-closes-5m-seed-round-to-scale-its-financial-planning-software/#:~:text=This%20morning%20Cube%20announced%20that,an%20earlier%20Pre%2DSeed%20round.">raised a $5 million seed round</a> that TechCrunch covered last August. Mayfield led its Series A, which saw participation from Operator Collective and Bonfire Ventures.</p>
<p><em>FP&amp;A</em> is probably not an acronym that you come across often. It spells out to <em>financial planning and analysis</em>, or the process by which companies outline their financial future. It&#8217;s pretty damn important. But like lots of the tech that CFOs and other financial types use, software in the FP&amp;A space is often a mix of antiquated, expensive and slow.</p>
<p>Just ask the CFO you know best. Cube wants to build software for FP&amp;A work that at once isn&#8217;t awful, and doesn&#8217;t require companies to stop using spreadsheets. The company&#8217;s software absorbs information from a company&#8217;s general ledger (accounting software), CRM (Zoho CRM, perhaps) and payroll service into one location. From there, CFOs and their team can view the past and sketch their financial future using a few different viewing methods, including the venerable spreadsheet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When TechCrunch last checked in on Cube, we said that we&#8217;d report back when the company had growth numbers to share. Happily the startup&#8217;s CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinacalross/">Christina Ross</a> was willing to share. Per the founder, Cube customers have scaled 4x since its seed round, and revenue growth is tracking ahead of customer growth. Even better, Cube&#8217;s contract mix has shifted, with the company now securing more than half of its deals with multi-year terms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IxmdrUmBdP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/cube-closes-5m-seed-round-to-scale-its-financial-planning-software/">Cube closes $5M Seed round to scale its financial planning software</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cube closes $5M Seed round to scale its financial planning software&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/cube-closes-5m-seed-round-to-scale-its-financial-planning-software/embed/#?secret=IxmdrUmBdP" data-secret="IxmdrUmBdP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When we spoke to Ross, her newest investor, Mayfield&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/rbatra">Rajeev Batra</a>, was also on the call. He added that Cube has seen deal win rates in the 60% to 70% range, implying that it has found product-market fit. As Cube&#8217;s software starts at $850 per month for its service, any deal win is material annual recurring revenue (ARR) for the early-stage startup. Batra also stressed that Cube is seeing strong engagement inside of its product.</p>
<p>What is Cube going to do with its new capital? Ross said that she&#8217;s a trained CFO and knows the worries of raising too much money. She knows where the money is going, she added. One place the company intends to spend is headcount. The startup plans to triple its personnel base by the end of 2021, hiring for both product and go-to-market (GTM) roles. Ross also noted her company had built out its sales function after its seed round, and intends to grow its marketing efforts now that it has secured new capital.</p>
<p>Cube fits neatly into a trend that we&#8217;re seeing in recent months of companies not merely raising successive funding rounds more rapidly than the old-fashioned 18-month cadence. It&#8217;s somewhat common lately to see some startups raising new rounds just a few quarters after their last capital event. <a href="https://www.m1finance.com/">M1 Finance</a> also announced a new round this morning, for example; it raised twice in 2020.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what Cube can do with its Series A. If it can keep its recent pace of growth up, perhaps it will raise again this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Swiss-based, venture capital-backed, direct air capture technology developer <a href="https://climeworks.com/">Climeworks</a> is partnering with a joint venture between the government of Norway and massive European energy companies to map the pathway for a business that could provide not only the direct capture of carbon dioxide emissions from air, but the  underground sequestration and storage of those emissions.</p>
<p>The deal could pave the way for a new business that would offer carbon capture and sequestration services to commercial enterprises around the world, if the joint venture between the Climeworks and the newly formed <a href="https://northernlightsccs.com/">Northern Lights</a> company is successful. It would mean the realization of a full-chain carbon dioxide removal service that the two companies called a necessary component of the efforts to reverse global climate change.</p>
<p>Northern Lights was incorporated in March as a joint venture between Equinor, Shell and Total to provide processing, transportation and underground sequestration services for captured carbon dioxide emissions. The business is one of the lynchpins in the Norwegian government&#8217;s efforts to capture and store carbon emissions safely underground under a plan called<a href="https://northernlightsccs.com/about-the-longship-project/"> The Longship Project</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“There is growing awareness of the need to build capacity to remove CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere to achieve net zero by 2050. We are enthusiastic about this collaboration with Climeworks. Combined with safe and permanent storage, direct air capture has the potential to get the carbon cycle back in balance,” said Børre Jacobsen, the  Managing Director of Northern Lights, in a statement.</p>
<p>The two companies are hoping to prove that Northern Lights facilities combined with Climeworks direct air capture technologies can prove to be a part of a push towards negative emissions technologies that allow companies in non-industrial sectors to become either carbon neutral or carbon negative.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of caveats to the project, which reveal both the potential promise and pitfalls of direct air capture initiatives and sequestration and monitoring projects.</p>
<p>The first issue is the need to set a global price for carbon dioxide emissions that would take to make the projects economically viable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is one legislation worldwide that is paying for direct air capture of CO2 and that is the <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/low-carbon-fuel-standard">Low Carbon Fuel Standard</a> in California,&#8221; said Christoph Gelbad, the co-chief executive and co-founder of Climeworks. &#8220;It’s paying up to $200 per ton… this price range is the price range that will be needed to make this full chain, really going from the atmosphere to direct air capture to underground storage and monitoring. That will be the price range needed to build up the infrastructure and finance it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122811" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122811" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2122811" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="570" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg 2822w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=1536,856 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=2048,1141 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ClimeWorks.Cost_.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122811" class="wp-caption-text">A breakdown of the costs associated with different carbon capture technologies.Image Credit: Climeworks</p></div></p>
<p>That price is on the highest end of any that world leaders have discusses as a potential cost for carbon emitting industries (and it&#8217;s well below the price that China has set for carbon emissions, which is important to note given the scale of China&#8217;s contribution to the production of greenhouse gases that cause global warming).</p>
<p>Beyond any pricing concerns associated with making these direct air carbon capture and storage solutions viable, there&#8217;s the scale at which these projects would need to be developed to make a real dent in global emissions.</p>
<p>Here again, Gelbad offers a clear-eyed assessment of his company&#8217;s capabilities and the size of the problem.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The numbers given by science 10 to 20 billion tons of CO2 for removal,&#8221; Gelbad said. &#8220;Direct Air Capture will need to grow at a gigaton scale. This [potential] site will be in the megaton scale. [But] this is the range where our journey together with Northern Lights definitely could go. We see it going into the megaton ranges.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Climeworks uses renewable energy and waste heat to power modular collectors that can be stacked into machines at any size. The only limit to the company&#8217;s ability to capture carbon dioxide is the availability of power, according to Gelbad.</p>
<p>The company already has a collaboration with an Icelandic company called Carbfix, where the Climeworks technology is used to capture carbon dioxide and store it in mineralized basalt. The company said in a statement that it&#8217;s looking globally for other opportunities for permanent carbon dioxide storage and that the Northern Lights solution of deep geological sequestration in an offshore saline aquifer under the North Sea represents an ideal alternative site.</p>
<p>To develop its technology, Climeworks has raised over $150 million from investors including the Swiss lender Zuercher Kantonalbank.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Northern Lights is already planning on capturing carbon dioxide from industrial point sources in the Oslo region, which will then be shipped to an onshore terminal on the Norwegian coast. A facility there will transport the liquefied carbon dioxide by pipeline to an offshore storage location 1.62 miles below the seabed in the North Sea.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Northern Lights is offering carbon capture and sequestration as a service. From the idea of doing this project and from the early days of working with the ministry … my biggest surprise was the level of interest in [carbon capture and sequestration] among emitters in Europe,&#8221; said Jacobsen. &#8220;This awareness. This interest. And the need to find a solution is accelerating. We are talking about what are the possibilities and what are the solutions. Northern Lights offers a great part of the value chain.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some companies are already interested in becoming early customers for the project, Jacobsen said. &#8220;We have a number of MOUs and confidentiality agreements with customers and letters of support. Big interest in discussing with us. The key will be that we have to bring conversations into agreements so that we can bring this business forward.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The vast majority of startups remain focused on consumers, knowledge workers and the opportunities to provide services to those that are already operating completely, or at least partially, in digital environments. But today comes news of funding for a startup building a social network for what is probably one of the least digital business sectors of all: independent, small-hold farmers in the developing world.</p>
<p><a href="http://about.wefarm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wefarm</a>, a social networking platform aimed at independent farmers to help them meet each other, exchange ideas and get advice, and sell or trade equipment and supplies, has raised $11 million funding to continue expanding its business, which now has 2.5 million users.</p>
<p>To put that number and the growth opportunity into some perspective, Wefarm estimates that there are some 400 million small-hold farmers globally, with a large proportion of them in developing markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding, an extension to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/wefarm-rakes-in-13m-to-grow-its-marketplace-and-network-for-independent-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 Series A</a>, is being led by Octopus Ventures. True Ventures (which led the 2019 round), Rabo Frontier Ventures, LocalGlobe, June Fund and AgFunder also participated. Wefarm has raised $32 million since being founded in 2015.</p>
<p>To date, London-based Wefarm has primarily found traction in countries in East Africa. Its service is available via a website, but most of its users are accessing without any internet use at all, via the company&#8217;s SMS interface. The SMS format has now hosted more than 37 million conversations from farmers engaging in around 400 different types of farming (from livestock or dairy to grains and fruits and vegetables) and $29 million in marketplace sales, the company said.</p>
<p>But rolling out SMS services can be slow, in part because it requires Wefarm to strike local deals with carriers over data usage. (That has also meant that the company has tightly controlled growth: if you go to the main site, you&#8217;ll see that you can either join a waitlist or join by way of an invitation from an existing member.)</p>
<p>Kenny Ewan, Wefarm&#8217;s founder and CEO, said this latest tranche of funding in part will be used to roll out an app (currently in beta) that will help it launch in more countries and pick up more farmers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big step we’re taking is going from SMS a digital, app-based service, which will remove the digital barrier,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;We compare it to the shift from sending DVDs in the mail to streaming video online. We feel like the time is right and believe it could take us to the 100 million mark of users.&#8221;</p>
<h2>From pandemics to locust plagues</h2>
<p>Wefarm&#8217;s role in helping link up independent farmers &#8212; traditionally and by its nature one of the most analogue of industries &#8212; has taken on an interesting profile particularly in the last year.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a stark light on a number of digital divides in the world, and one of most distinctive has been in the wider world of business. Entrepreneurs, companies and organizations that had digital strategies in place could hit the ground running to adapt to a &#8220;new normal&#8221; with less physical interaction. Those that did not had to scramble to get there to avoid a nosedive in activity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122800" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122800" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2122800" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?w=212" alt="" width="212" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png 996w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?resize=106,150 106w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?resize=212,300 212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?resize=768,1089 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?resize=480,680 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-1.02.22-PM.png?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122800" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://wefarm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wefarm <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Wefarm was around for years before the Covid-19 pandemic, and in some regards it has always been championing and giving a digital voice to the underdogs.</p>
<p>The wider agricultural industry &#8212; globally a multi-trillion dollar enterprise, accounting for <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 25% of GDP in some markets</a> &#8212; has undergone some significant digital transformation, but that has been focused on tools and other technology for the agribusiness sector, which includes the giant conglomerates and multinationals like Cargill, Archer-Daniels-Midland, Bayer (Monsanto&#8217;s parent), John Deere and others.</p>
<p>Wefarm&#8217;s importance (and often singular presence) as a tool for independent farmers to communicate, trade and generally network with others like them was already playing out before Covid-19. When we covered the company&#8217;s previous raise in 2019 (the first part of its Series A, a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/wefarm-rakes-in-13m-to-grow-its-marketplace-and-network-for-independent-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> $13 million round</a>) it had already grown to 1.9 million members. And, as it happens, for many of its users, Covid-19 was in some regards the least of their concerns:</p>
<p>&#8220;In reality a lot of people in rural Africa were concerned about the weather, or the effect of a locust plague,&#8221; Ewan said. &#8220;What we saw was traffic around not Covid, but these topics. They had different preoccupations.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the pandemic has had an impact, nevertheless. On the platform itself, as we saw in other e-commerce scenarios, Wefarm emerged as an essential service for trading at a time when in-person meetings were halted. As for Wefarm as a business, Ewan said that it essentially meant that the company&#8217;s country expansion plans had completely halted mainly because business development teams could no longer travel as they had before: another reason why launching an app could be a useful growth tool.</p>
<p>(That lack of travel was also potentially helpful to Wefarm: despite that the company still managed to grow by 600,000 more users, Ewan pointed out, underscoring a clear demand for the service among its target audience.)</p>
<p>Going forward, there are other ways in which Wefarm aims to leverage its user base, its network and the data that it potentially can amass from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see the possibility of providing more analytics and data. Our users want that very much,&#8221; Ewan said. &#8220;We now know more about small scale farmers than any one else, because they talk to us.&#8221; Areas that Wefarm is considering to develop over the next two years are whether it can help provide more insight into more workable business models, pricing models and more data on particular aspects like ripening periods.</p>
<p>“By building a highly engaged community of millions of small-holder farmers, Wefarm has created a powerful platform providing greater access to vital knowledge and information, which allows farmers to unlock greater economic potential from their land,” said Kamran Adle, early stage investor at Octopus Ventures. “In practice that might mean understanding which fertilisers work best, what the market price is for certain goods, or new farming techniques that result in better yields, all of which can make a significant difference to livelihoods. It’s also an enormous market with more than 400 million small-holder farmers globally who collectively spend around $400 billion on farming inputs. There is a huge opportunity for Kenny and the team at Wefarm to achieve incredible scale and we’re excited for the launch of its digital platform which will further accelerate growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel-based <a href="https://ibex-ai.com/">Ibex Medical Analytics</a>, which has an AI-driven imaging technology to detect cancer cells in biopsies more efficiently, has raised a $38 million Series B financing round led by <a href="https://octopusventures.com/">Octopus Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.83north.com/">83North</a>. Also participating in the round was aMoon, Planven Entrepreneur Ventures and Dell Technologies Capital, the corporate venture arm of Dell Technologies. The company has now raised a total of $52 million since its launch in 2016. Ibex plans to use the investment to further sell into diagnostic labs in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Originally incubated out of the <a href="https://www.kametventures.com/">Kamet Ventures</a> incubator, Ibex’s “Galen” platform mimics the work of a pathologist, allowing them to diagnose cancer more accurately and faster and derive new insights from a biopsy specimen.</p>
<p>Because rates of cancer are on the rise and the medical procedures have become more complex, pathologists have a higher workload. Plus, says Ibex, there is a global shortage of pathologists, which can mean delays to the whole diagnostic process. The company claims pathologists can be 40% more productive using its solution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Joseph Mossel, Ibex CEO and Co-founder said: “You can think of it as a pathologist&#8217;s assistant, so it kind of prepares the case in advance, marks the regions of interest, and allows the pathologist to achieve the efficiency gains.”</p>
<p>He said the company has secured the largest pathology network in France, and LD path, which is five pathology labs that service 24 NHS trusts in the UK, among others.</p>
<p>Michael Niddam, of Kamet Ventures said Ibex was an “excellent example of how Kamet works with founders very early on.” Ibex founders Joseph Mossel and Dr. Chaim Linhart had previously joined Kamet as Entrepreneurs in Residence before developing their idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Each of the big three cloud vendors &#8212; Amazon, Microsoft and Google &#8212; has a marketplace where software vendors can sell their wares. It seems like an easy enough proposition to throw your software up there and be done with it, but it turns out that it&#8217;s not quite that simple, requiring a complex set of business and technical tasks.</p>
<p><a href="http://tackle.io">Tackle</a>, a startup that wants to help ease the process of getting a product onto one of these marketplaces, announced a $35 million Series B today. Andreessen Horowitz led the investment with help from existing investor Bessemer Venture Partners. The company reports it has now raised $48.5 million.</p>
<p>Company founder Dillon Woods says that at previous jobs, he found that it took several months with a couple of engineers dedicated to the task to get a product onto the AWS marketplace, and he noticed that it was a similar set of tasks each time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What I saw [in my previous jobs] was that we were kind of redoing the same work. And I thought everybody out there was probably reinventing the same wheel. And so when I started Tackle, my goal was to create a software platform that would take that time down to one or two days. So it&#8217;s really a no code solution, and it makes it much more of a business decision, rather than this big technical integration project,&#8221; Woods told me.</p>
<p>While you may think it&#8217;s a pretty simple task to put an app on one of these marketplaces, Woods points out that the AWS user guide explaining the ins and outs is a 700 page pdf. He says that it&#8217;s not just the technical complexity of setting up the various API calls to get it connected, there is also the business side of selling in the marketplace, and that requires additional APIs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not just the initial sale. There could be things later like upgrades, refunds, cancellations &#8212; maybe you need to do overage charges against that same contract. And so there are all of these downstream things that happen that all require API integration, and Tackle takes care of all of that for you,&#8221; Woods explained.</p>
<p>CEO John Jahnke says that the company usually starts with one product in one marketplace, which acts as a kind of proof of concept for the customer, then builds up from there. Once customers see what Tackle can do, they can expand usage.</p>

<p>It seems to be working with the startup reporting that it tripled annual recurring revenue (ARR), although it didn&#8217;t want to share a specific number. It also doubled headcount and the number of customers and was responsible for over $200 million in transactions across the three cloud marketplaces.</p>
<p>Jahnke didn&#8217;t share the exact number of customers, but he said there were currently hundreds on the platform including companies like Snowflake, GitHub, New Relic and PagerDuty.</p>
<p>The company currently has 67 employees spread across 25 states with plans to almost double that by the end of 2021. He says that it&#8217;s essential to put systems in place to build a diverse company now.</p>
<p>&#8220;How we scale through this next 100% increase in headcount is going to define the mix of the company into the future. If we can get this right right now and continue to extend on the foundation for diversity and inclusion that we started and make it a real part of our conversation at some scale, we think we&#8217;ll be set up as we go from 100 employees to 1000 employees over the long period of time to continue to grow and create opportunities for people wherever they are,&#8221; Jahnke said.</p>
<p>Martin Casado, general partner at lead investor a16z, says this type of selling has become essential for businesses and that&#8217;s why he wanted to invest in the company. &#8220;Cloud marketplaces have become a primary channel for selling software quickly and conveniently. Tackle is the leading player for enabling companies to sell software through the cloud,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a>, the Israel-focused cybersecurity seed fund, today announced that it has sold its stake cybersecurity asset management startup <a href="https://www.axonius.com/">Axonius</a>, which only a week ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/axonius-nabs-100m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-for-its-asset-management-cybersecurity-platform/">announced</a> a $100 million Series D funding round that now values it at around $1.2 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://iconiqcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://iconiqcapital.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615346206056000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMwYmIh0wTsjpFoZBBQTXJnE8Adw">ICONIQ Growth,</a> <a href="https://www.alkeoncapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.alkeoncapital.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615346206056000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8ZEdl0rvOkh9lPE8gAPVsQgI3Sg">Alkeon Capital Management</a>, <a href="http://dtcp.capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://dtcp.capital/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615337006555000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCgZVf3YY_7dsKvTC0HReHKrBdzA">DTCP</a> and <a href="https://www.harmonyvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.harmonyvp.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615337006555000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnVA4-avi6F-IVkP7KfgiZZ9mv7w">Harmony Partners</a> acquired YL Venture&#8217;s stake for $270 million. This marks YL&#8217;s first return from its third $75 million fund, which it raised in 2017, and the largest return in the firm&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>With this sale, the company&#8217;s third fund still has six portfolio companies remaining. It closed its fourth fund with $120 million in committed capital in the middle of 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike YL, which focuses on early-stage companies &#8212; though it also tends to participate in some later-stage rounds &#8212; the investors that are buying its stake specialize in later-stage companies that are often on an IPO path. ICONIQ Growth has invested in the likes of Adyen, CrowdStrike, Datadog and Zoom, for example, and has also regularly partnered with YL Ventures on its later-stage investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The transition from early-stage to late-stage investors just makes sense as we drive toward IPO, and it allows each investor to focus on what they do best,&#8221; said Dean Sysman, co-founder and CEO of Axonius. &#8220;We appreciate the guidance and support the <span class="il">YL</span> <span class="il">Ventures</span> team has provided during the early stages of our company and we congratulate them on this successful journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>To put this sale into perspective for the Silicon Valley- and Tel Aviv-based YL Ventures, it&#8217;s worth noting that it currently manages about $300 million. Its current portfolio includes the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/orca-security-raises-55m-for-its-cloud-native-security-platform/">Orca Security</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/hunters-raises-additional-growth-funding-from-snowflake-ventures/">Hunters</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/cycode-raises-4-6m-seed-round-to-keep-your-source-code-safe/">Cycode</a>. This sale is a huge win for the firm.</p>
<p>Its most headline-grabbing exit so far was Twistlock, which was acquired by Palo Alto Networks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/palo-alto-networks-to-acquire-container-security-startup-twistlock-for-410m/">for $410 million in 2019</a>, but it has also seen exits of its portfolio companies to Microsoft, Proofpoint, CA Technologies and Walmart, among others. The fund participated in Axonius&#8217; $4 million seed round in 2017 up to its $58 Million Series C round a year ago.</p>
<p>It seems like YL Ventures is taking a very pragmatic approach here. It doesn&#8217;t specialize in late-stage firms &#8212; and until recently, Israeli startups always tended to sell long before they got to a late-stage round anyway. And it can generate a nice &#8212; and guaranteed &#8212; return for its own investors, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;This exit netted $270 million in cash directly to our third fund, which had $75 million total in capital commitments, and this fund still has 6 outstanding portfolio companies remaining,&#8221; Yoav Leitersdorf, YL Ventures&#8217; founder and managing partner, told me. &#8220;Returning multiple times that fund now with a single exit, with the rest of the portfolio companies still there for the upside is the most responsible &#8212; yet highly profitable path &#8212; we could have taken for our fund at this time. And all this while diverting our energies and means more towards our seed-stage companies (where our help is more impactful), and at the same time supporting Axonius by enabling it to bring aboard such excellent late-stage investors as ICONIQ and Alkeon &#8211; a true win-win-win situation for everyone involved!&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that this sale achieved a top-decile return for the firm&#8217;s limited partners and allows it to focus its resources and attention toward the younger companies in its portfolio.</p>
