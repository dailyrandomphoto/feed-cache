										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz laid out Thursday a 40 billion-euro ($47B) plan to become an electric-only automaker by the end of the decade, a target that will push the company to become more vertically integrated, train its workforce and secure the batteries needed to power its products.</p>
<p>The company has already taken action, announcing Thursday it acquired UK-based electric motor company YASA and has determined it will need battery capacity of more than 200 gigawatt hours. To hit meet those needs, Mercedes plans to set up eight battery factories with partners to produce cells.</p>
<p>The new plants, one of which will be located in the United States, is on top of the company&#8217;s already planned network of nine factories that will be dedicated to building battery systems. The company said it will team up with new European partners to develop and efficiently produce future cells and modules. That &#8220;European partners&#8221; designation is strategic and one that Mercedes says will ensure the region &#8220;remains at the heart of the auto industry.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mercedes said it has partnered with Sila Nano, the Silicon Valley battery materials startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/sila-nanotechnologies-raises-590m-to-fund-battery-materials-factory/">raised $590 million</a> earlier this year, to help it improve its next generation of batteries. Specifically, SilaNano is helping Mercedes  increase energy density by using silicon-carbon composite in the anode, which should boost range and allow for shorter charging times.</p>
<p>Mercedes is also looking into solid-state battery technology and said it is in talks with partners to develop batteries with even higher energy density and safety.</p>
<p>The plan unveiled Thursday piggybacks on previous goals to build and sell more EVs. Back in 2017, Mercedes said it would electrify — which means gas-hybrid, plug-in hybrid or battery electric — its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/11/mercedes-benz-will-electrify-its-entire-car-lineup-by-2022/">entire lineup by 2022</a>. The German automaker said Thursday that by next year it will offer battery-electric vehicles in every segment that it serves.</p>
<p>Its EV-only plan will accelerate from there. By 2025, the company said its three newly launched vehicle architectures will be electric-only. The company said it expects that all-electric and hybrids will make up 50% of its sales. Customers will also be to choose an all-electric alternative for every model the company makes.</p>
<p>Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz AG CEO Ola Källenius said the company&#8217;s goal marks a &#8220;profound reallocation of capital.&#8221; He stressed that the company&#8217;s profitability targets would be safeguarded and met despite this hefty investment and shift away from the internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>To meet this target, Mercedes is launching three electric-only architectures which will form the basis of all of its new vehicles. It&#8217;s so-called MB.EA platform will be used for its medium to large passenger cars, while AMG.EA will underpin its performance Mercedes-AMG cars and the VAN.EA will be dedicated architecture for electric passenger minivans and light commercial vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DeepMind and several research partners have released a database containing the 3D structures of nearly every protein in the human body, as computationally determined by the breakthrough protein folding system demonstrated last year, AlphaFold. The freely available database represents an enormous advance and convenience for scientists across hundreds of disciplines and domains, and may very well form the foundation of a new phase in biology and medicine.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">AlphaFold Protein Structure Database</a> is a collaboration between DeepMind, the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute</a>, and others, and consists of hundreds of thousands of protein sequences with their structures predicted by AlphaFold — and the plan is to add millions more to create a &#8220;protein almanac of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that this work represents the most significant contribution AI has made to advancing the state of scientific knowledge to date, and is a great example of the kind of benefits AI can bring to society,&#8221; said DeepMind founder and CEO Demis Hassabis.</p>
<h2>From genome to proteome</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with proteomics in general — and it&#8217;s quite natural if that&#8217;s the case — the best way to think about this is perhaps in terms of another major effort: that of sequencing the human genome. As you may recall from the late &#8217;90s and early &#8217;00s, this was a huge endeavor undertaken by a large group of scientists and organizations across the globe and over many years. The genome, finished at last, has been instrumental to the diagnosis and understanding of countless conditions, and in the development of drugs and treatments for them.</p>
<p>It was, however, just the beginning of the work in that field — like finishing all the edge pieces of a giant puzzle. And one of the next big projects everyone turned their eyes toward in those years was understanding the human <em>proteome</em> — which is to say all the proteins used by the human body and encoded into the genome.</p>
<p>The problem with the proteome is that it&#8217;s much, <em>much</em> more complex. Proteins, like DNA, are sequences of known molecules; in DNA these are the handful of familiar bases (adenine, guanine, etc), but in proteins they are the 20 amino acids (each of which is coded by multiple bases in genes). This in itself creates a great deal more complexity, but it&#8217;s only the start. The sequences aren&#8217;t simply &#8220;code&#8221; but actually twist and fold into tiny molecular origami machines that accomplish all kinds of tasks within our body. It&#8217;s like going from binary code to a complex language that manifests objects in the real world.</p>
<p>Practically speaking this means that the proteome is made up of not just 20,000 sequences of hundreds of acids each, but that each one of those sequences has a physical structure and function. And one of the hardest parts of understanding them is figuring out what shape is made from a given sequence. This is generally done experimentally using something like x-ray crystallography, a long, complex process that may take months or longer to figure out a single protein — if you happen to have the best labs and techniques at your disposal. The structure can also be predicted computationally, though the process has never been good enough to actually rely on — until AlphaFold came along.</p>

<h2>Taking a discipline by surprise</h2>
<p>Without going into the whole history of computational proteomics (as much as I&#8217;d like to), we essentially went from distributed brute-force tactics 15 years ago — remember Folding@home? — to more honed processes in the last decade. Then AI-based approaches came on the scene, making a splash in 2019 when DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold leapfrogged every other system in the world — then made another jump in 2020, achieving accuracy levels high enough and reliable enough that it prompted some experts to declare the problem of turning an arbitrary sequence into a 3D structure solved.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m only compressing this long history into one paragraph because it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/">extensively covered at the time</a>, but it&#8217;s hard to overstate how sudden and complete this advance was. This was a problem that stumped the best minds in the world for decades, and it went from &#8220;we maybe have an approach that kind of works, but extremely slowly and at great cost&#8221; to &#8220;accurate, reliable, and can be done with off the shelf computers&#8221; in the space of a year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180805" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180805" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2180805" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg" alt="Examples of protein structures predicted by AlphaFold" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Proteins.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2180805" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DeepMind</p></div></p>
<p>The specifics of DeepMind&#8217;s advances and how it achieved them I will leave to specialists in the fields of computational biology and proteomics, who will no doubt be picking apart and iterating on this work over the coming months and years. It&#8217;s the practical results that concern us today, as the company employed its time since the publication of AlphaFold 2 (the version shown in 2020) not just tweaking the model, but running it&#8230; on every single protein sequence they could get their hands on.</p>
<p>The result is that 98.5 percent of the human proteome is now &#8220;folded,&#8221; as they say, meaning there is a predicted structure that the AI model is confident enough (and importantly, <em>we</em> are confident enough in <em>its</em> confidence) represents the real thing. Oh, and they also folded the proteome for 20 other organisms, like yeast and E. coli, amounting to about 350,000 protein structures total. It&#8217;s by far — by orders of magnitude — the largest and best collection of this absolutely crucial information.</p>
<p>All that will be made available as a freely browsable database that any researcher can simply plug a sequence or protein name into and immediately be provided the 3D structure. The details of the process and database can be found in a paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03828-1">published today in the journal Nature</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The database as you&#8217;ll see it tomorrow, it&#8217;s a search bar, it&#8217;s almost like Google search for protein structures,&#8221; said Hassabis in an interview with TechCrunch.&#8221;You can view it in the 3D visualizer, zoom around it, interrogate the genetic sequence&#8230; and the nice thing about doing it with EMBL-EBI is it&#8217;s linked to all their other databases. So you can immediately go and see related genes, And it&#8217;s linked to all these other databases, you can see related genes, related in other organisms, other proteins that have related functions, and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180809" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphafold-walkthru.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180809" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2180809" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphafold-walkthru.png" alt="" width="1024" height="601" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphafold-walkthru.png 1541w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphafold-walkthru.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphafold-walkthru.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphafold-walkthru.png?resize=768,451 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphafold-walkthru.png?resize=680,399 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphafold-walkthru.png?resize=1536,901 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/alphafold-walkthru.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2180809" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DeepMind</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;As a scientist myself, who works on an almost unfathomable protein,&#8221; said EMBL-EBI&#8217;s Edith Heard (she didn&#8217;t specify what protein), &#8220;it&#8217;s really exciting to know that you can find out what the business end of a protein is now, in such a short time — it would have taken years. So being able to access the structure and say &#8216;aha, <em>this</em> is the business end,&#8217; you can then focus on trying to work out what that business end does. And I think this is accelerating science by steps of years, a bit like being able to sequence genomes did decades ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>So new is the very idea of being able to do this that Hassabis said he fully expects the entire field to change — and change the database along with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Structural biologists are not yet used to the idea that they can just look up anything in a matter of seconds, rather than take years to experimentally determine these things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I think that should lead to whole new types of approaches to questions that can be asked and experiments that can be done. Once we start getting wind of that, we may start building other tools that cater to this sort of serendipity: What if I want to look at 10,000 proteins related in a particular way? There isn&#8217;t really a normal way of doing that, because that isn&#8217;t really a normal question anyone would ask currently. So I imagine we&#8217;ll have to start producing new tools, and there&#8217;ll be demand for that once we start seeing how people interact with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>That includes derivative and incrementally improved versions of the software itself, which has been released in open source along with a great deal of development history. Already we have seen an independently developed system, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/researchers-match-deepminds-alphafold2-protein-folding-power-with-faster-freely-available-model/">RoseTTAFold</a>, from researchers at the University of Washington&#8217;s Baker Lab, which extrapolated from AlphaFold&#8217;s performance last year to create something similar yet more efficient — though DeepMind seems to have taken the lead again with its latest version. But the point was made that the secret sauce is out there for all to use.</p>

<h2>Practical magic</h2>
<p>Although the prospect of structural bioinformaticians attaining their fondest dreams is heartwarming, it is important to note that there are in fact immediate and real benefits to the work DeepMind and EMBL-EBI have done. It is perhaps easiest to see in their partnership with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Institute.</p>
<p>The DNDI focuses, as you might guess, on diseases that are rare enough that they don&#8217;t warrant the kind of attention and investment from major pharmaceutical companies and medical research outfits that would potentially result in discovering a treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very practical problem in clinical genetics, where you have a suspected series of mutations, of changes in an affected child, and you want to try and work out which one is likely to be the reason why our child has got a particular genetic disease. And having widespread structural information, I am almost certain will improve the way we can do that,&#8221; said DNDI&#8217;s Ewan Birney in a press call ahead of the release.</p>
<p>Ordinarily examining the proteins suspected of being at the root of a given problem would be expensive and time-consuming, and for diseases that affect relatively few people, money and time are in short supply when they can be applied to more common problems like cancers or dementia-related diseases. But being able to simply call up the structures of ten healthy proteins and ten mutated versions of the same, insights may appear in <em>seconds</em> that might otherwise have taken years of painstaking experimental work. (The drug discovery and testing process still takes years, but maybe now it can start tomorrow for Chagas disease instead of in 2025.)</p>

<p>Lest you think too much is resting on a computer&#8217;s prediction of experimentally unverified results, in another, totally different case, some of the painstaking work had already been done. <a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/research/research-centres-and-groups/centre-for-enzyme-innovation">John McGeehan of the University of Portsmouth</a>, with whom DeepMind partnered for another potential use case, explained how this affected his team&#8217;s work on plastic decomposition.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first sent our seven sequences to the DeepMind team, for two of those we already had experimental structures. So we were able to test those when they came back, and it was one of those moments, to be honest, when the hairs stood up on the back of my neck,&#8221; said McGeehan. &#8220;Because the structures that they produced were identical to our crystal structures. In fact, they contained even more information than the crystal structures were able to provide in certain cases. We were able to use that information directly to develop faster enzymes for breaking down plastics. And those experiments are already underway, immediately. So the acceleration to our project here is, I would say, multiple years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan is to, over the next year or two, make predictions for every single known and sequenced protein — somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred million. And for the most part (the few structures not susceptible to this approach seem to make themselves known quickly) biologists should be able to have great confidence in the results.</p>

<p>The process AlphaFold uses to predict structures is, in some cases, better than experimental options. And although there is an amount of uncertainty in how any AI model achieves its results, Hassabis was clear that this is not just a black box.</p>
<p>&#8220;For this particular case, I think explainability was not just a nice-to-have, which often is the case in machine learning, but it was a must-have, given the seriousness of what we wanted it to be used for,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I think we&#8217;ve done the most we&#8217;ve ever done on a particular system to make the case with explainability. So there&#8217;s both explainability on a granular level on the algorithm, and then explainability in terms of the outputs, as well the predictions and the structures, and how much you should or shouldn&#8217;t trust them, and which of the regions are the reliable areas of prediction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless his description of the system as &#8220;miraculous&#8221; attracted my special sense for potential headline words. Hassabis said that there&#8217;s nothing miraculous about the process itself, but rather that he&#8217;s a bit amazed that all their work has produced something so powerful.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was by far the hardest project we&#8217;ve ever done,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And, you know, even when we know every detail of how the code works, and the system works, and we can see all the outputs, it&#8217;s still just still a bit miraculous when you see what it&#8217;s doing&#8230; that it&#8217;s taking this, this 1D amino acid chain and creating these beautiful 3D structures, a lot of them aesthetically incredibly beautiful, as well as scientifically and functionally valuable. So it was more a statement of a sort of wonder.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Fold after fold</h2>
<p>The impact of AlphaFold and the proteome database won&#8217;t be felt for some time at large, but it will almost certainly — as early partners have testified — lead to some serious short-term and long-term breakthroughs. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the mystery of the proteome is solved completely. Not by a long shot.</p>
<p>As noted above, the complexity of the genome is nothing compared to that of the proteome at a fundamental level, but even with this major advance we have only scratched the surface of the latter. AlphaFold solves a very specific, though very important problem: given a sequence of amino acids, predict the 3D shape that sequence takes in reality. But proteins don&#8217;t exist in a vacuum; they&#8217;re part of a complex, dynamic system in which they are changing their conformation, being broken up and reformed, responding to conditions, the presence of elements or other proteins, and indeed then reshaping themselves around <em>those</em>.</p>
<p>In fact a great deal of the human proteins AlphaFold gave only a middling level of confidence to its predictions for may be fundamentally &#8220;disordered&#8221; proteins that are too variable to pin down the way a more static one can be (in which case the prediction would be validated as a highly accurate predictor for that type of protein). So the team has its work cut out for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to start looking at new problems,&#8221; said Hassabis. &#8220;Of course, there are many, many new challenges. But the ones you mentioned, protein interaction, protein complexes, ligand binding, we&#8217;re working actually on all these things, and we have early, early stage projects on all those topics. But I do think it&#8217;s worth taking, you know, a moment to just talk about delivering this big step&#8230; it&#8217;s something that the computational biology community&#8217;s been working on for 20, 30 years, and I do think we have now broken the back of that problem.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA["You may think that the message is boring because you've said it once. But repetition never spoils the prayer."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Caryn Marooney, Silicon Valley communications professional turned venture capitalist, spoke extensively on storytelling at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising. During her talk, she broke down messaging into four critical parts.</p>
<p>Marooney knows what she&#8217;s talking about: Throughout her time in Silicon Valley, she helped companies like Salesforce, Amazon, Facebook and more launch products and maintain messaging. In 2019, she left Facebook, where she was VP of technology communication, and joined Coatue Management as a general partner.</p>
<p>The presentation is summarized below and lightly edited for readability. Marooney breaks down her method into the acronym of RIBS: Relevance, Inevitability, Believability and keeping it Simple. A video of her presentation is also embedded below and contains 20 minutes of Q&amp;A where she answers audience questions and covers a lot of ground.</p>
<p>Marooney has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/caryn-marooney/">written extensively on this subject for TechCrunch,</a> including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/ribs-the-messaging-framework-for-every-company-and-product/">this article,</a> where she describes her RIBS method in detail. Last month, she expanded on this topic with her <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/the-hamburger-model-is-a-winning-go-to-market-strategy/">go-to-market strategy around building a hamburger</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8216;The gift of editing is critical. Do not just write all your ideas and get very excited about what you think and ship it.&#8217;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Relevant</h2>
<p>Why should anyone care? Does anyone care? That&#8217;s the point Marooney is making here. The message must be relevant to the audience before anything else.</p>
<blockquote><p>The very first thing is why anyone should care. And it&#8217;s important to remember that as a startup, you&#8217;re in a situation where nobody knows you. And nobody thinks, &#8220;Oh, I should really care about this. So you need to be very specific about who your audiences are and why they should care and why it matters to them. Early on, too. Relevance is usually to a very small audience, and you earn the right every day to expand that audience.</p>
<p>So, for example, when I was first working with Salesforce, it was a very narrow set of salespeople, for small- and medium-sized businesses, there was always the sense that it was going to be a cloud provider for companies of every size, but you have to start somewhere. And when you&#8217;re starting somewhere, you can paint the bigger picture. But you have to be specific about the benefits to your smaller audience. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 1:48)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Inevitable</h2>
<p>In addition to talking about Tesla, Marooney uses the counter-example of the Segway, which shows a great idea alone is not enough. Even though Segways were introduced as a world-changing mode of transportation, in 2021, Segways are mainly only used by mall cops and tourists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With a couple of generations of wireless earbuds under its belt, OnePlus finally has the AirPods Pro &#8212; and the rest of the premium market &#8212; in its sights. As part of an event today that also includes the launch of its budget Nord 2, the company officially announced the OnePlus Buds Pro.</p>
<p>The top-line feature here is adaptive noise canceling, which uses a trio of on-board mics to filter out ambient sound up to 40 dBs. The company says the tech compares favorably to more standard active noise cancelling, which offers a set level of filtering. The buds are powered by a pair of 11mm dynamic drivers, with support for Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>All told, battery life is up to 10 hours on the buds (sans noise cancelling) and 38 with the case (ditto). The case will charge wireless with third-party Qi pads, or the system can get 10 hours of life with 10 minutes plugged in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180164" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180164" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180164" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1280" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=1229,1536 1229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=1638,2048 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Case-and-earbuds_white.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180164" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OnePlus</p></div></p>
<p>At $150, they’re $100 cheaper than the AirPods, though the number everyone is looking at here is almost certainly the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nothing-founder-carl-pei-on-ear-1-and-building-a-hardware-startup-from-scratch/">$99 price tag Nothing announced</a> for its upcoming Ear (1) buds. OnePlus did manage, however, to beat its co-founder’s new company to the punch by a full week.</p>
<p>Coincidence? You be the judge. (Honestly, it&#8217;s probably a coincide, given that the Ear (1) were delayed, but I digress.)</p>
<p>The price tag puts them more directly in line with the recently announced Beats Studio Buds, along with Google&#8217;s Pixel Buds and Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy Buds Pro &#8212; that is to say, somewhere in the middle of the pack. Design-wise, they appear most similar to the AirPods Pro, albeit with a metallic stem popping out from the bottom of the black or white buds.</p>
<p>I was fairly underwhelmed by the company&#8217;s first fully wireless set, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/oneplus-fully-wireless-earbuds/">the OnePlus Buds</a>. To the company&#8217;s credit, they were extremely aggressively priced, at $70, in keeping with the release of the original Nord handset. The OnePlus Buds Pro will arrive in the U.S. and Canada on September 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thoma Bravo-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sophos/">Sophos</a> has announced it&#8217;s acquiring <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/braintrace">Braintrace</a>, a cybersecurity startup that provides organizations visibility into suspicious network traffic patterns. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Braintrace, which was founded in 2016 and has raised $10 million in funding, has developed a network detection and response (NDR) solution that helps organizations to easily inspect network traffic to identify and filter out suspicious activity. It does this using remote network packet capture (RNCAP) technology, which provides visibility into network traffic patterns, including encrypted traffic, without the need for man-in-the-middle decryption. It also provides visibility into cloud network traffic, a task that typically needs to be carried out on-site, and supports all of the major cloud providers including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aws/">AWS</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/microsoft-azure/">Microsoft Azure</a>.</p>
<p>The deal will see Sophos integrate Braintrace’s NDR technology into its own adaptive cybersecurity ecosystem, which underpins all of its security products and services. The technology will also help Sophos collect data from firewalls, proxies and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/vpn/">VPNs</a>, allowing it to look for network traffic that contains instructions for malware like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/trickerbot-malware-tax-day/">TrickBot</a>, and attackers that misuse Cobalt Strike, as well as pre-empting other malicious traffic that might lead to ransomware attacks</p>
<p>Braintrace’s developers, data scientists and security analysts have joined its global Sophos&#8217; managed threat response (MTR) and rapid response teams as part of the deal.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, which Sophos claims will make it one of the largest and fastest-growing managed detection and response (MDR) providers, the company&#8217;s CEO Joe Levy said: “We’re excited that Braintrace built this technology specifically to provide better security outcomes to their MDR customers. It’s hard to beat the effectiveness of solutions built by teams of skilled practitioners and developers to solve real-world cybersecurity problems.”</p>
<p>Bret Laughlin, co-founder and CEO of Braintrace, added: &#8220;We built Braintrace’s NDR technology from the ground up for detection and now, with Sophos, it will fit into a complete system to provide cross-product detection and response across a multi-vendor ecosystem.”</p>
<p>The deal comes a little over a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/thoma-bravo-completes-3-9b-sophos-acquisition/">Thoma Bravo completed its $3.9 billion takeover of Sophos</a>, and sees the private equity firm further increasing its reach in the cybersecurity space. It acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/thoma-bravo-buys-cybersecurity-vendor-proofpoin-for-12-3b-in-cash/">security vendor Proofpoint</a> for $12.3 billion back in April, and recently led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/zero-trust-unicorn-illumio-closes-225m-series-f-led-by-thoma-brava/">$225 million funding round in zero trust unicorn Illumio</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify announced this morning a new partnership with online GIF database GIPHY to enable discovery of new music through GIFs. No, the GIFs themselves won&#8217;t play song clips, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re thinking. Instead, through a series of new Spotify-linked GIFs, there will be an option to click a button to be taken to Spotify directly to hear the artist&#8217;s music. At launch, artists including <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dojacat-sza-doja-cat-kiss-me-more-K389zFp6niBWAk41i9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/gifs/dojacat-sza-doja-cat-kiss-me-more-K389zFp6niBWAk41i9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDR16INL7zhKuyA7_grltZ9KP9DQ">Doja Cat</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/theweeknd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/theweeknd&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF85_9RxUrSmFIl39NRHkQUlHUmlA">The Weeknd</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/postmalone" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/postmalone&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1u97eHxUnxYzqU_RGSXFpOXybBg">Post Malone</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/nickiminaj" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/nickiminaj&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMie9S4PVq8bEJnEpg7rEIYHDO-g">Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/thekidlaroi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/thekidlaroi&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9DKCd1LBzTTqPWm7EMBrW6HR4hQ">The Kid LAROI</a>, <a href="https://giphy.com/conangray" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://giphy.com/conangray&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627046730181000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5h93zFlIqbYetV2tstiEc96ckag">Conan Gray</a>, and others will have Spotify-linked GIFs available on their official GIPHY profile page. More artists will be added over time.</p>
<p>The idea behind the new integration is to help connect users with Spotify music from their everyday communications, like texts, group chats, and other places where GIFs are used. This is similar to Spotify&#8217;s existing integrations with social media apps like <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-09-09/share-what-youre-listening-to-on-spotify-with-snapchat/">Snapchat</a> and <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8430172/spotify-instagram-stories-users-share-what-listening-to">Instagram</a>, where users can share music through the Stories and messages they post. Essentially, it&#8217;s a user acquisition strategy that leverages online social activities &#8212; in this case, sharing GIFs &#8212; while also benefiting the artists through the exposure they receive.</p>
<p>You can find the new Spotify-linked GIFs on the artist&#8217;s page on GIPHY.com or through GIPHY&#8217;s mobile app. The supported GIFs will include a new &#8220;Listen on Spotify&#8221; button at the bottom which will appear alongside the GIF when it&#8217;s shared. When clicked, users are redirected from the GIF to the artist&#8217;s page on Spotify where they can stream their music or browse to discover more songs they want to hear.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180912" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180912" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2180912" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mobile-promo_doja.gif?w=400" alt="" width="400" height="500" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180912" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify/GIPHY</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify says the feature is part of a broader partnership it has with GIPHY, which will later focus on bringing a more interactive listening experience to users.</p>
<p>The move to partner with GIPHY follows a recent expansion of the existing partnership between Spotify and GIPHY&#8217;s parent company, Facebook. The social networking giant bought the popular GIF platform in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">a deal worth a reported $400 million</a> back in 2020, a couple years after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/google-acquires-gif-platform-tenor/">Google snatched up GIPHY rival, Tenor</a>. Since then, Facebook has worked to better integrate GIPHY with its apps, like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/spotify-adds-timestamped-podcast-sharing-and-other-social-features/"> Facebook and Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Facebook and Spotify had also teamed up<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-is-expanding-spotify-partnership-with-new-boombox-project/"> on a new &#8220;Boombox&#8221; project</a> that allows Facebook users to listen to music hosted on Spotify while browsing through the Facebook app. This is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/facebook-introduces-a-new-miniplayer-that-streams-spotify-within-the-facebook-app/">powered by a &#8220;miniplayer&#8221;</a> that allows anyone who comes across the shared music to click to play the content while they scroll their feed.</p>
<p>Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-07-22/elevate-your-gif-game-with-giphy-and-spotifys-new-music-feature/">says</a> the new feature will be available to users globally from verified GIPHY artists&#8217; pages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More doesn’t necessarily mean better &#8212; and that’s a lesson for life and for tech. To focus on the latter, the startup ecosystem is experiencing a boggling influx of capital right now. However, the increase in dollars isn’t being evenly distributed to all founders. For the vast majority of people, especially women and nonbinary entrepreneurs, it’s still hard to raise money &#8212; and <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">perhaps even harder than before the pandemic. </a></p>
<p>All Raise, a nonprofit that has for years worked to advance women and nonbinary folks within tech, has been watching closely the dip in funding for female and nonbinary founders. Per VP of Marketing Caroline Caswell, while pockets of progress do exist, funding for female founders is still “lukewarm.” She noted how in the first half of this year, 1.6% of venture capital went to female founders, down 30% from 2.3% in 2020, which was already a dip from the year prior, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard">per PitchBook.</a></p>
<p>“The narrative that ‘VC is back?’ ” Caswell said. “It is back for the same people as it was before.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The misconception that the hot-deal summer is benefitting everyone has given All Raise some urgency to launch a new product for women and nonbinary founders, which it’s announcing today.</p>
<p>The nonprofit is <a href="https://allraise.org/masterclasses ">releasing a series of master classes</a> meant to give an inside glimpse at raising first institutional rounds and scaling companies. The material, which includes pre-recorded sessions from All Raise’s in-person Founder Bootcamp, will be free to access for anyone interested.</p>
<p>Instructors include checkwriters such as Cowboy Ventures’ Aileen Lee and Benchmark Capital’s Sarah Tavel, as well as seasoned executives like Figma’s VP of Communications Nairi Hourdajian and Solv Health co-founder and CEO Heather Fernandez. All Raise said that it did not track ethnicity or racial data of its instructors, however it did offer a breakdown of the 400 beta users who tested the master class series.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2180750 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png" alt="" width="828" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png 2668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=768,406 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=1536,813 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=2048,1084 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lesson-Example-Aileen-Lee-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px" /></p>
<div>Users&#8217; self-reported data shows that the largest concentration &#8212; 39% &#8212; of users are White, while 11% are African-American/Black and 6% are Latinx and Hispanic. Most users don&#8217;t identify as white.</div>
<p>There’s constantly a disconnect between tactical content on how to fundraise and true access to capital; tips don’t necessarily lead to a closed check, which leaves some founders skeptical of yet another launch of resources.</p>
<p>That said, Caswell says that the master classes are trying to move beyond the “typical Sandhill Road Medium post” or Twitter threads, and thinks that the explicitness and real-world examples could serve as an empowering tool to founders.</p>
<p>Topics range from basics like how to prepare for your Series A to more nuanced thoughts like the emotions of fundraising, and how to say goodbye to a team. The programming is meant to be a more intimate look at early-stage tech, beyond what you’d find on a Twitter thread, Caswell explains.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180749" style="width: 869px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180749" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2180749" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png" alt="All Raise seed curriculum" width="859" height="396" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png 2666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=768,354 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=680,313 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=1536,708 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=2048,943 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Seed-Fundraising-Masterclass-Curriculum-1.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180749" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> All Raise</p></div></p>
<p>“When it comes to resources and insight for typically underrepresented founders, more is more is more,” she added. Lessons range between three to 60 minutes, and amount to some 15 hours of content.</p>
<p>The structure of All Raise’s master classes looks similar in format to what Y Combinator offers in its free series Startup School, which includes some <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library?query=female%20founder">light content</a> specifically targeted toward female founders. Long-term, it’d be interesting to see how All Raise refreshes material to work more for online learning, as it already has an engaged community that it could easily turn into a living, breathing class that filters through the nonprofit&#8217;s other tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s not too late to enjoy an epic pitch-off of global proportion. The <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extreme-tech-challenge-global-finals-presented-by-techcrunch?ref=713fc34b276b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extreme Tech Challenge (XTC) Global Finals</a> start <em>today</em>, July 22 at 9:00 am (PT). <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extreme-tech-challenge-global-finals-presented-by-techcrunch?ref=713fc34b276b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register here for free,</a> get instant access and tune in to see seven phenomenal startups — each one tackling some of the world’s most daunting social and environmental challenges.</p>
<p>The day also includes a keynote address from Beth Bechdol, the deputy director-general, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, and five panel discussions ranging from powering clean energy startups to going green. Here are just two examples, and be sure to <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extreme-tech-challenge-global-finals-presented-by-techcrunch?ref=713fc34b276b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out the event agenda</a> so you don’t miss a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Powering the Future Through Transformative Tech:</strong> XTC’s co-founders Young Sohn, Chairman of the Board at HARMAN International, and founding Managing Partner at Walden Catalyst, and Bill Tai, Partner Emeritus at Charles River Ventures jump into the breakthrough tech innovations that are transforming industries to build a radically better world. How can business, government, philanthropy, and the startup community come together to create a better tomorrow? Hear from these industry veterans and thought leaders about how technology can not only shape the future, but also where the biggest opportunities lie, including some exciting news about XTC and the FAO of the United Nations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Cutting Out Carbon Emitters with Bioengineering:</strong> Bioengineering may soon provide compelling, low-carbon alternatives in industries where even the best methods produce significant emissions. By utilizing natural and engineered biological processes, we may soon have low-carbon textiles from Algiknit, lab-grown premium meats from Orbillion and fuels captured from waste emissions via LanzaTech. Leaders from these companies will join our panel to talk about how bioengineering can do its part in the fight against climate change.</p>
<p>The main event is, of course, the pitch competition. More than 3,700 startups applied, and these are the seven finalists who will compete one last time for the title of XTC 2021 champion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft has acquired identity and access management (IAM) startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloudknox-security-inc">CloudKnox Security</a>, the tech giant&#8217;s fourth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> acquisition this year.</p>
<p>The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, is the latest cybersecurity acquisition by Microsoft, which just last week announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">it’s buying threat intelligence startup RiskIQ</a>. The firm also recently acquired IoT security startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/microsoft-confirms-acquisition-of-cyberx-to-boost-security-in-its-iot-business/">CyberX</a> and Refirm Labs as it moved to beef up its security portfolio. Security is big business for Microsoft, which made more than $10 billion in security-related revenue in 2020 — a 40% increase from the year prior.</p>
<p>CloudKnox, which was founded in 2015 and emerged from stealth two years later, helps organizations to enforce least-privilege principles to reduce risk and help prevent security breaches.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The startup had raised $22.8 million prior to the acquisition, with backing from ClearSky, Sorenson Ventures, Dell Technologies Capital, and Foundation Capital. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s activity-based authorization service will equip Azure Active Directory customers with “granular visibility, continuous monitoring and automated remediation for hybrid and multi-cloud permissions,” according to <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/21/microsoft-acquires-cloudknox-security-to-offer-unified-privileged-access-and-cloud-entitlement-management/">a blog post</a> by Joy Chik, corporate vice president of identity at Microsoft.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Chik said that while organizations were reaping the benefits of cloud adoption, particularly as they embrace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">flexible working models</a>, they often struggled to assess, prevent and enforce privileged access across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.</p>
<p>“CloudKnox offers complete visibility into privileged access,” Chik said. “It helps organizations right-size permissions and consistently enforce least-privilege principles to reduce risk, and it employs continuous analytics to help prevent security breaches and ensure compliance. This strengthens our comprehensive approach to cloud security.”</p>
<p>In addition to Azure Active Directory, Microsoft also plans to integrate CloudKnox with its other cloud security services including 365 Defender, Azure Defender, and Azure Sentinel.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, Balaji Parimi, CloudKnox founder and CEO, said: “By joining Microsoft, we can unlock new synergies and make it easier for our mutual customers to protect their multi-cloud and hybrid environments and strengthen their security posture.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber Freight, the logistics business spun out of Uber in 2018, has acquired Transplace for about $2.25 billion from private equity group TPG Capital, according to regulatory filings. The deal announced Thursday will involve $750 million in Uber stock with the remainder in cash.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Transplace marks a ramping up of Uber Freight&#8217;s business as it aims to carve out market share in its existing markets and an expansion in Mexico. Uber Freight <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">also sees the acquisition as a means to accelerate the company&#8217;s path to profitability and help the segment to break even on an Adjusted EBITDA basis by the end of 2022, according to the company.</span></p>
<p>The union will fold one of the largest managed transportation and logistics networks into Uber Freight&#8217;s platform, which connects truck drivers with shippers that need cargo delivered. Uber Freight&#8217;s brokerage will continue to operate independently from Transplace&#8217;s services, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is a significant step forward, not just for Uber Freight but for the entire logistics ecosystem,&#8221; Lior Ron, head of Uber Freight, said in a statement. &#8220;This is an opportunity to bring together complementary best-in-class technology solutions and operational excellence from two premier companies to create an industry-first shipper-to-carrier platform that will transform shippers&#8217; entire supply chains, delivering operational resilience and reducing costs at a time when it matters most.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transplace CEO Frank McGuigan said as a result, the combined company expects shippers will see greater efficiency and transparency. &#8220;All in all, we expect to significantly reduce shipper and carrier empty miles to the benefit of highway and road infrastructures and the environment,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Uber Freight launched in 2017. In August 2018, it was spun off into a separate business unit, a move that simultaneously allowed it to gain momentum and burn more cash. After spinning off of Uber, the freight company underwent an expansion. Uber Freight redesigned its app, an improvement that included adding new navigation features to make searching for and filtering loads easier to customize.</p>
<p>The company expanded to Canada and Europe. Uber Freight also established a headquarters in Chicago as part of its parent company&#8217;s broader plan to invest more than $200 million annually in the region, including hiring hundreds of workers. Uber said in September 2019 it would hire 2,000 new employees in the region over the next three years; most would be dedicated to Uber Freight.</p>
<p>Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash/">sold a stake</a> in the freight business last year when investor group led by New York-based investment firm Greenbriar Equity Group committed to invest $500 million in a Series A preferred stock financing for the business. The deal valued the unit at $3.3 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>Uber maintained majority ownership in Uber Freight and used the funds gained from Greenbriar to continue to scale its logistics platform, which helps truck drivers connect with shipping companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Conventional wisdom holds that one ought let sleeping does lie. But no one says you&#8217;re barred from tracking them while they do. New York-based smart collar maker Fi announced today that it’s adding sleep to the list of the device’s tracking.</p>
<p>The added feature uses the collar’s on-board motion sensing to monitor your best friend’s sleep during the day and night (and almost certainly leave you jealous about how much shut-eye they’re getting).</p>
<p>The information is presented on a timeline that should look familiar to anyone who has used the human equivalent. It also offers a live check-in to see what the dog is up to during the day while you’re at work (assuming you ever go back to the office).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2180800" style="width: 722px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180800" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180800" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png" alt="" width="712" height="350" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png 712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-13-at-4.49.34-PM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180800" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fi</p></div></p>
<p>The goal here is to offer up some sharable metrics about your pet that might point to underlying health problems, be it too much sleep, not enough or frequent trips to the water bowl in the middle of the night. Sudden changes also present potential red flags for the dog’s health.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to move into holistic health tracking that empowers dog parents to take the best possible care of their pets,” founder and CEO Jonathan Bensamoun said in a release. “If your dog is tired, it can’t tell you, so Fi will. Fi can answer critical questions like, ‘Is my pet sleeping the right way?’ or ‘Did its activity levels decrease lately?’ long before more serious issues have time to develop.”</p>
<p>Fi raised $30 million back in February and is working to grow its reach in the U.S., including a recent distribution deal with mega-online pet supply seller, Chewy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you can&#8217;t say it with words, say it with an emoji. Facebook is announcing a few minor updates today to its Messenger platform, which make it easier than ever to find the exact emoji you&#8217;re looking for when reacting to a friend&#8217;s message (let&#8217;s be real, there&#8217;s a big difference between the &#8220;crying laughing&#8221; and &#8220;crying&#8221; emoji). This includes a search bar for emoji reactions, and a recently used emojis section. And, if you weren&#8217;t let down by the long-awaited &#8220;Space Jam&#8221; sequel, you can sport your love for hoopster Bugs Bunny with a &#8220;Space Jam 2&#8221; chat theme, available both on Messenger and in Instagram DMs. Don&#8217;t get too excited though &#8212; even though this theme sets a basketball as the chat&#8217;s emoji, the long lost, beloved <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/18/facebook-sneaked-a-seriously-addictive-basketball-game-into-messenger/">basketball mini game</a> has not yet made its triumphant return to the Messenger app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180580" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180580" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2180580" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=1536,1408 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/emoji-search.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180580" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook Messenger</p></div></p>
<p>It may not feel like there&#8217;s room for innovation in, um, the emoji space, but even Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/twitter-is-exploring-the-use-of-facebook-style-emoji-reactions/">explored the option</a> of allowing people to emoji-react to tweets. And as live audio has become ever present &#8212; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/clubhouse-invite-open-to-everyone-exits-beta/">Clubhouse</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">Twitter Spaces</a>, to Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a> &#8212; why not add audio to emojis?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, Messenger debuted Soundmojis, which are what they sound like &#8212; emojis with sounds. On the Messenger app, you can use Soundmojis by clicking the smiley face icon in the chat box, which opens up the expressions menu. When you select the loudspeaker icon, you can select from just under 30 standard emojis, but when you click on them, they play sounds including &#8220;Brooklyn 99&#8221; quotes, Olivia Rodrigo clips, and lines from &#8220;Bridgerton.&#8221; The &#8220;X&#8221; emoji plays &#8220;Oh No&#8221; by Capone, a song that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/capone-oh-no-tiktok-trend">went viral</a> on TikTok.</p>
<p>According to Facebook Messenger, people send more than 2.4 billion messages with emojis on the platform each day. That&#8217;s great and all, but if we can tap the car emoji to hear sounds from &#8220;Fast &amp; Furious,&#8221; when will we be able to tap the soccer emoji to play &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/15/how-to-play-facebook-messengers-new-super-addictive-and-hidden-soccer-game/">keepie uppie</a>&#8221; again?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Magic, a San Francisco-based startup that builds &#8220;plug and play&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/how-startups-can-go-passwordless-thanks-to-zero-trust/">passwordless</a> authentication technology, has raised $27 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The round, led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/northzone/">Northzone</a> and with participation from Tiger Global, Volt Capital, Digital Currency Group and CoinFund, comes just over a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/decentralized-identity-management-platform-magic-launches-from-stealth-with-4m/">Magic launched from stealth</a>, rebranding from its previous name Formatic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The company, like many others, is on a mission to end traditional password-based authentication. Magic’s flagship SDK, which launched in April 2020, enables developers to implement a variety of passwordless authentication methods with just a few lines of code and integrates with a number of modern frameworks and infrastructures.</p>
<p>Not only does the SDK make it easier for companies and developers to implement passwordless auth methods in their applications, but it could also help to mitigate the expensive fallout that many have to deal with as a result of data breaches.</p>
<p>“This is why the password is so dangerous,&#8221; Sean Li, Magic co-founder and CEO tells TechCrunch. &#8220;It’s like a Jenga tower right now — a hacker breaching your system can download an entire database of encrypted passwords, and then easily crack them. It’s a huge central point of failure.”</p>
<p>The company recently built out its SDK to add support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/fido-alliance-and-w3c-have-a-plan-to-kill-the-password/">WebAuthn</a>, which means it can support hardware-based authentication keys like Yubico, as well as biometric-based Face ID and fingerprint logins on mobile devices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It’s less mainstream right now, but we’re making it super simple for developers,” says Li. “This way we can help promote new technologies, and that’s really good for user security and privacy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bet that seems to be working: Magic has recorded a 13% month-over-month increase in developer signups, and the number of identities secured is growing at a rate of 6% weekly, according to Magic. It’s also secured a number of big-name customers, from crypto news publisher Decrypt to fundraising platform Fairmint.</p>
<p>Wendy Xiao Schadeck, a partner at Northzone said: “We couldn&#8217;t be more excited to support Sean and the Magic team as they redefine authentication for the internet from the bottom up, solving a core pain point for developers, users, and companies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“It was clear to us that they&#8217;re absolutely loved by their customers because the team is so obsessed with serving every single part of the developer journey across several communities. What&#8217;s potentially even more exciting is what they will be able to do to empower users and decentralize the identity layer of the web.”</p>
<p>The company now plans to continue to scale its platform and expand its team to meet what Magic describes as “soaring” demand. The startup, which currently has 30 employees that work remotely on a full-time basis, expects to at least double its headcount across all core functions, including product, engineering, design, marketing, finance, people, and operations.</p>
<p>It’s also planning to hope to build out the SDK even further; Li says he wants to be able to plug into more kinds of technology, from low-code applications to workflow automations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The vision is much bigger than that. We want to be the passport of the internet,” Li adds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.indexventures.com/">Index Ventures</a> has closed a trio of new funds: a $900 million early-stage fund, a $2 billion growth-stage fund and a previously announced $200 million seed-stage fund. The close gives Index $3 billion in new capital, its largest tranche yet, to deploy into emerging startups and existing portfolio companies, which include the likes of Plaid, Deliveroo and Revolut, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/">just valued at $33 billion.</a></p>
<p>Index’s new capital comes a little over a year since it closed its last funds, which were a duet of $1.2 billion for growth-stage investments and $800 million for early-stage investments. It also is announced while venture dollars more broadly seem to be growing at an unprecedented rate &#8212; In recent weeks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/accel-closes-on-3b-across-three-funds/">Accel announced that it has closed $3 billion across three funds, too</a>, and Andreessen Horowitz landed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">$2.2 billion fund dedicated entirely to crypto startups.</a></p>
<p>The influx of money means that check sizes and valuations are growing across the entire ecosystem. Index, for example, said that it has grown its Series A check size from $10 million to $15 million, while it increased its growth check from $35 million to $50 million. Its check size in the United States is about 20% higher compared to its check size in Europe, meaning that the former represents between 55% to 60% of the firm’s total investing dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Index’s check size is growing slightly bigger to keep up with competition, partner Mark Goldberg said that the firm is staying disciplined so it doesn’t fall prey to FOMO rounds or buzzy valuations.</p>
<p>“There have been situations where two years ago, I would have engaged,” in a competition for a late-stage round, he said. “And now I say that we probably are not going to compete … because at the heart of the matter, I think capital is a commodity.” The partner didn’t point to Accel’s $3 billion close, but instead noted how “Tiger Global and other crossover funds” have created a new capital product, which means that Index’s ability to compete must look different than just offering a ton of money.</p>
<p>“If you’re just looking for capital, we’re probably not going to be the best product for you,” Goldberg added.</p>
<p>Index Partner Martin Mignot thinks that a &#8220;bifurcation is really happening&#8221; in the fundraising market, where some founders are able to raise easily, but many continue to struggle if they&#8217;re not &#8220;at the right sector in the right place at the right time.&#8221; Mignot has been spending time looking at Africa as a potential investment area that continues to be underresourced. He hinted that an official initiative focused on Africa startups may be underway.</p>
<p>The firm said it has &#8220;several initiatives in place related to diversity including increasing the number of individuals on our investment from underrepresented groups and diversifying our investment funnel&#8221; but said that it does not track diversity statistics at a portfolio company level &#8220;yet.&#8221; Index said that its investment team is composed of 38% of individuals who identify as female and 14% of individuals who come from underrepresented groups, although its unclear whether they have check-writing power.<em> </em></p>

<p>Index appears to be going through a period of experimentation when it comes to the services offered to portfolio companies. While the firm declined to give too many specifics on upcoming initiatives around diversity or more generally, it did note its growing TikTok presence as part of its strategy.</p>
<p>The Index Ventures TikTok has over 28,000 followers. Its most viewed video is about Costco’s business model, with 4.8 million views followed by an interview clip from Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, with 315,000 views.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not something where I think the next deal comes from the TikTok account, but it&#8217;s one of those initiatives where … I think it will pay dividends” in helping Index reach a younger audience that isn’t active on tech Twitter or Clubhouse. Index’s TikTok, led by Molly Alter Rex Woodbury, is reminiscent of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/banana-capitals-fund-1-turner-novak/">how some emerging fund managers</a> are approaching creative deal flow.</p>
<p>The firm is also experimenting with incubating startups in-house, which has historically never been a major focus. <a href="https://twitter.com/Mark_Goldberg_/status/1415715109507190790">A tweet suggests</a> that Index is actively recruiting entrepreneurs to join the incubator, which could be divided thematically. Goldberg declined to give more specifics around how incubation programs are structured and what the terms are, saying that the Index Incubator is not an official product yet.</p>
<p>That said, one can only imagine that a firm freshly capitalized with billions of dollars probably has some money to spare — from incubated projects to those growth-stage companies in need of active investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Obé Fitness’ co-founders/co-CEOs Mark Mullett and Ashley Mills toss around the word “entertrainment” a lot. For the record, it’s not a reference to the Butler County, Ohio-based amusement park that serves as the home of the “world’s largest train display,” but rather one of those industry portmanteaus like <em>infotainment</em> or <em>webinar.</em></p>
<p>Here it’s meant to be a reference to what the New York-based company sees as its principle differentiator from an increasingly crowded market. Mills describes it as “where entertainment and fitness meet. Talent is key to that. Not also being able to cast talent that can deliver a great workout, but they also have that X Factor. They have the ability to reach across the screen and make you feel something at home.”</p>
<p>The company has been building up an audience of influencers as well, including Kelly Ripa, Kate Hudson and Tiffany Haddish, the latter of whom participated in the $15 million Series A the company is announcing today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The capital is really about team growth and awareness in a couple of key business development initiatives,&#8221; says Mullett. &#8220;In the current climate, where everyone is talking about their various home workouts, you definitely need resources to grow. So this round is about getting Obé in front of as many people as possible.”</p>
<p>The round was led by CAVU Venture Partners and features Athleta, Samsung Next, Wheelhouse Entertainment and WW International, Inc., along with previous investors Cassius Ventures, Ludlow Ventures, Harris Blitzer Sports Entertainment and BDMI.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2180364" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2180364" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2180364" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Liz-.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2180364" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Obé</p></div></p>
<p>It’s a pretty diverse list of parties with a diverse list of interests in the platform &#8212; take Samsung, which currently offers the Obé platform on its smart TVs. Users can also access it on iOS and Android devices and cast it accordingly to their TV sets.</p>
<p>Obé (pronounced “Obey”) bills itself as a “premium” service. At $27, it’s certainly at the higher end, verses offerings like the $10/month Apple Fitness+ or Peleton’s $13 monthly fee. Unlike Peloton, which has proprietary equipment attached, Obé actually skipped the equipment altogether at launch, though it has slowly expanded its offerings to include things like free weights and trampolines for its bounce classes &#8212; equipment that’s a bit more forgiving in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, the company saw a large increase in users during the pandemic. While Obé doesn’t disclose subscriber counts, its founders told me the platform’s userbase increased 4x last year.</p>
<p>“We started this company three and a half years ago,” says Mullett. “When COVID hit in March of 2020, our team, our talent, our interface &#8212; everyone was ready to receive the rush of new users who needed to be sated by movement and by someone who could keep them inspired, sane and confident during a difficult time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of venture capital investing is a relatively small one, and relationship-based to boot. Family offices and accredited investors are eager to get involved in high-quality funds, but face hurdles like access to fund managers.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://allocate.co/">Allocate</a>. The company, founded by Samir Kaji and Hana Yang in February 2021, is developing an approach to venture capital fund investing that provides a way for investors of any size to participate.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the San Francisco-based company announced it raised $5 million in seed funding from a group of backers including Urban Innovation Fund, Tusk Venture Partners, Basis Set Ventures, Liquid2 Ventures, Fika Ventures, Ulu Ventures and Anthemis Group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pair met as Kauffman Fellows, both with backgrounds in financial services. By the time they met, Yang was working in the nonprofit world, and said they began talking about the friction between the nonprofit and venture capital worlds. Then Yang joined Kaji at First Republic Bank to work together and continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Kaji, <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/global-asset-management-industry-report">citing a Boston Consulting Group report</a>, estimated there are between 8,000 and 11,000 global family offices and nearly 17 million accredited investors that currently control some $42 trillion in assets.</p>
<p>They saw the issue as it related to supply and demand: On the supply side, there are a finite number of institutional investors, “all with their dance cards full,” Kaji told TechCrunch. Fund managers want to get at that nontraditional endowment money and are looking at family offices, but finding those individuals is a challenge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the demand side, family offices have trouble accessing venture capital firms — they don’t know where to look to find managers, don’t have time to cultivate those relationships or can’t make the traditional $1 million commitments.</p>
<p>As a result, Kaji and Yang decided to start Allocate as a way to usher in the next era of venture capital by creating a way for retail investors of any size or background to invest in funds and for managers to find family offices.</p>
<p>Allocate&#8217;s platform curates venture fund products for wealth advisors, family offices and qualified individual investors based on their investment objectives, and any pre- and post-investment transactions and reporting activities are completed on the platform.</p>
<p>The company sets up its own feeder vehicles that aggregate investor capital so that there are lower minimum investments and that capital can easily be managed by fund managers. It then charges a fee, on an annual basis, on investments made.</p>
<p>Currently, investors can choose the funds they want to invest in, but Kaji said Allocate will eventually also offer products that will be like funds of funds, where investments go into a pot that will be invested by a fund manager.</p>
<p>The company is pre-revenue and said it will use the new funding to build out its product and make some key hires over the next year as it gears up for a formal software product launch at the end of the year. It is already attracting a waitlist of several hundred fund managers and investors.</p>
<p>“With the market the way it is, the number of accredited investors is expected to grow by 50% by 2025,” Kaji said. “There is a huge opportunity to unlock the market and have people participate.”</p>
<p>Jordan Nof, co-founder and managing partner at Tusk Ventures, agrees. He sees a lot of economic growth taking place outside the public market, and opportunities present themselves for someone to capitalize on.</p>
<p>Due to the access issue between fund managers and potential investors, there are trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines, he told TechCrunch. With Allocate, Nof saw a way to bridge the two parties with tools for both sides to make sound decisions and further evolve venture capital.</p>
<p>“I have known Samir for quite some time, and he and his team understand this problem set and they have a vision of what the venture capital future looks like,” he added. “This is a cottage industry even though VC is responsible for impacting the largest of technology companies, which have taken VC, yet it is a still super fragmented industry that has no transparency. Allocate is the next transition of a true platform that enables family offices and high-net worth individuals access.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year and a half after <a href="https://www.currencycloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Currencycloud</a> raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/26/currencycloud-nabs-80m-from-visa-world-bank-group-and-more-for-its-cross-border-payments-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$80 million in a round that included Visa</a>, the London-based developer of APIs that powered remittance and currency exchange services is getting even closer to the financial services giant. Today, <a href="https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.18161.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visa announced</a> that it would acquire CurrencyCloud in a deal valued at $963 million (£700 million).</p>
<p>This price is a very decent leap from that last funding round, when sources told us the startup was valued at around $500 million.</p>
<p>(As Visa already has equity in the company, the amount it will actually pay will be reduced by that amount.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CurrencyCloud has some 500 customers in 180 countries that use its APIs to power multi-currency wallets, currency exchange services, and account management, including some of the biggest startups around such as Monzo, Moneze, Starling, Revolut and Dwolla. These will continue, and on top of that Visa will use the startup&#8217;s technology to bolster its own currency exchange rails to provide a wider set of services to its own customers, which include financial institutions, fintechs and more, as well as to build new services for consumers as well.</p>
<p>“At Currencycloud, we’ve always strived to deliver a better tomorrow for all, from the smallest start-up to the global multi-nationals. Re-imagining how money flows around the global economy just got more exciting as we join Visa,” said Mike Laven, CEO, Currencycloud, in a statement. “The combination of Currencycloud’s fintech expertise and Visa’s network will enable us to deliver greater customer value to the businesses moving money across borders.”</p>
<p>Remittance and currency transfers to be big business in the world of financial services, and that opportunity is growing. Two of the factors driving this are that e-commerce has extended well outside of our national borders, especially in the past 18 months, and so have supply chains. (Visa notes that some 43% of all small businesses globally carried out some form of international trade in 2020.) And with the rise of cloud-based, mobile services to facilitate transactions, consumers are ever more globalised in their outlooks, too.</p>
<p>At the same time, remittances and currency transfers are two areas ripe for disruption, with incumbent services often costly and inefficient. All of this sets the stage for a company like CurrencyCloud, which has built a new implementation of currency transfer that can be embedded into other financial services to help them run more smoothly.</p>
<p>The exit is also a classic example of how larger, incumbent financial powerhouses typically find it harder to innovate and jump into new services, so instead they tap smaller and more agile startups that are taking big bets on technology, and pulling it off, to help propel themselves into the next generation of financial services. Whether Visa will be able to successfully integrate and use CurrencyCloud&#8217;s tech and work with its team are two things that were already tested out: the two were strategic partners prior to this deal.</p>
<p>“The acquisition of Currencycloud is another example of Visa executing on our network of networks strategy to facilitate global money movement,” said<strong> </strong>Colleen Ostrowski, Visa’s Global Treasurer, in a statement. “Consumers and businesses increasingly expect transparency, speed and simplicity when making or receiving international payments. With our acquisition of Currencycloud, we can support our clients and partners to further reduce the pain points of cross-border payments and develop great user experiences for their customers.”<strong> </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://tailorbrands.com/">Tailor Brands</a>, a startup that automates parts of the branding and marketing process for small businesses, announced Thursday it has raised $50 million in Series C funding.</p>
<p>GoDaddy led the round as a strategic partner and was joined by OurCrowd and existing investors Pitango Growth, Mangrove Capital Partners, Armat Group, Disruptive VC and Whip Media founder Richard Rosenblatt. Tailor Brands has now raised a total of $70 million since its inception in 2015.</p>
<p>“GoDaddy is empowering everyday entrepreneurs around the world by providing all of the help and tools to succeed online,” said Andrew Morbitzer, vice president of corporate development at GoDaddy, in a written statement. “We are excited to invest in Tailor Brands — and its team — as we believe in their vision. Their platform truly helps entrepreneurs start their business quickly and easily with AI-powered logo design and branding services.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When Tailor Brands, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/tailor-brands-aims-to-bring-small-business-owners-affordable-access-to-professional-design/">launched at TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield in 2014</a>, raised its last round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/09/tailor-brands-series-b/">$15.5 million Series B</a>, in 2018, the company was focused on AI-driven logo creation.</p>
<p>The company, headquartered in New York and Tel Aviv, is now compiling the components for a one-stop SaaS platform — providing the design, branding and marketing services a small business owner needs to launch and scale operations, and within minutes, Yali Saar, co-founder and CEO of Tailor Brands told TechCrunch.</p>

<p>Over the past year, more users are flocking to Tailor Brands; the company is onboarding some 700,000 new users per month for help in the earliest stages of setting up their business. In fact, the company saw a 27% increase in new business incorporations as the creator and gig economy gained traction in 2020, Saar said.</p>
<p>In addition to the scores of new users, the company crossed 30 million businesses using the platform. At the end of 2019, Tailor Brands started monetizing its offerings and “grew at a staggering rate,” Saar added. The company yielded triple-digit annual growth in revenue.</p>
<p>To support that growth, the new funding will be used on R&amp;D, to double the team and create additional capabilities and functions. There may also be future acquisition opportunities on the table.</p>
<p>Saar said Tailor Brands is at a point where it can begin leveraging the massive amount of data on small businesses it gathers to help them be proactive rather than reactive, turning the platform into a “consultant of sorts” to guide customers through the next steps of their businesses.</p>
<p>“Users are looking for us to provide them with everything, so we are starting to incorporate more products with the goal of creating an ecosystem, like WeChat, where you don’t need to leave the platform at all to manage your business,” Saar said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sorry Mr. Putin, but there’s a race on for Russian and Eastern European founders. And right now, those awful capitalists in the corrupt West are starting to out-gun the opposition! But seriously… only the other day a $100 million fund <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/100-million-leta-capital-wants-to-be-a-friend-to-russia-speaking-founders-everywhere/">aimed at Russian speaking entrepreneurs</a> appeared, and others are proliferating.</p>
<p>Now, London-based <a href="https://www.theuntitled.vc">Untitled Ventures</a> plans to join their fray with a €100 million / $118M for its <em>second</em> fund to invest in “ambitious deep tech startups with eastern European founders.”</p>
<p>Untitled says it is aiming at entrepreneurs who are looking to relocate their business or have already HQ’ed in Western Europe and the USA. That’s alongside all the other existing Western VCs who are &#8211; in my experience &#8211; always ready and willing to listen to Russian and Eastern European founders, who are often known for their technical prowess.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Untitled is going to be aiming at B2B, AI, agritech, medtech, robotics, and data management startups with proven traction emerging from the Baltics, CEE, and CIS, or those already established in Western Europe</p>
<p>LPs in the fund include Vladimir Vedeenev, a founder of Global Network Management&gt;. Untitled also claims to have Google, Telegram Messenger, Facebook, Twitch, DigitalOcean, IP-Only, CenturyLinks, Vodafone and TelecomItaly as partners.</p>
<p>Oskar Stachowiak, Untitled Ventures Managing Partner, said: “With over 10 unicorns, €1Bn venture funding in 2020 alone, and success stories like Veeam, Semrush, and Wrike, startups emerging from the fast-growing regions are the best choice to focus on early-stage investment for us. Thanks to the strong STEM focus in the education system and about one million high-skilled developers, we have an ample opportunity to find and support the rising stars in the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Konstantin Siniushin, the Untitled Ventures MP said: &#8220;We believe in economic efficiency and at the same time we fulfill a social mission of bringing technological projects with a large scientific component from the economically unstable countries of the former USSR, such as, first of all, Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, but not only in terms of bringing sales to the world market and not only helping them to HQ in Europe so they can get next rounds of investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: “We have a great experience accumulated earlier in the first portfolio of the first fund, not just structuring business in such European countries as, for example, Luxembourg, Germany, Great Britain, Portugal, Cyprus and Latvia, but also physically relocating startup teams so that they are perceived already as fully resident in Europe and globally.”</p>
<p>To be fair, it is still harder than it needs to be to create large startups from Eastern Europe, mainly because there is often very little local capital. However, that is changing, with the launch recently of CEE funds such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/vitosha-venture-partners-launches-30m-fund-to-back-bulgarian-related-early-stage-startups/">Vitosha Venture Partners</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/launchub-ventures-heading-towards-a-85m-fund-for-south-eastern-european-startups/">Launchub Ventures</a>, and the breakout hit from Romania that was UIPath.</p>
<p><strong>The Untitled Ventures team:</strong><br />
• Konstantin Siniushin, a serial tech entrepreneur<br />
• Oskar Stachowiak, experienced fund manager<br />
• Mary Glazkova, PR &amp; Comms veteran<br />
• Anton Antich, early stage investor and an ex VP of Veeam, a Swiss cloud data management company<br />
acquired by Insight Venture Partners for $5bln<br />
• Yulia Druzhnikova, experienced in taking tech companies international<br />
• Mark Cowley, who has worked on private and listed investments within CEE/Russia for over 20 years</p>
<p><strong>Untitled Ventures portfolio highlights &#8211; Fund I</strong><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Slack set the standard in many ways for what knowledge workers want and expect out of a workplace collaboration app these days, but a lot has been left on the table when it comes to frontline workers. Today, one of the software companies that has built a popular app for that frontline crowd to become a part of the conversation is announcing a funding round that speaks to the opportunity to do more.</p>
<p><a href="https://yoobic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoobic</a>, which provides an app for frontline and service workers to manage tasks, communicate with each other and management, and also go through training, development and and other e-learning tasks, has picked up $50 million.</p>
<p>Highland Europe led the round, a Series C, with previous investors Felix Capital, Insight Partners, and a family office advised by BNF Capital Limited also participating. (Felix led Yoobic&#8217;s Series A, while Insight Partners led the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/yoobic-retail-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B in 2019</a>.) Yoobic is not discussing valuation but from what I understand from a reliable source, it is now between $300 million and $400 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes at a time of strong growth for the company.</p>
<p>Yoobic works with some 300 big brands in 80 countries altogether covering a mammoth 335,000 locations in sectors like retail, hospitality, distribution and manufacturing. Its customers include the likes of the Boots pharmacy chain, Carrefour supermarkets, Lancôme, Lacoste, Logitech, Lidl, Peloton, Puma, Vans, VF Corp, Sanofi, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Untuckit, Roots, Canada Goose, Longchamp, Lidl, Zadig &amp; Voltaire, and Athletico.</span></p>
<p>But that is just the tip of the iceberg. It&#8217;s <a href="http://desklessworkforce2018.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that there are 2.7 billion &#8220;deskless&#8221; (frontline and service) workers globally, accounting for no less than 80% of the world&#8217;s workforce. But here is the shocker: only 1% of IT budgets is currently spent on them. That speaks of huge opportunity for startups to build more here, but only if they (or the workers themselves( can manage to convince those holding the purse strings that it&#8217;s worth the investment.</p>
<p>So to that end, the funding will be used to hire more talent, to expand geographically &#8212; founded in London, the company is now headquartered in New York &#8212; and to expand its product. Specifically, Yoobic plans to build more predictive analytics to improve responsiveness and give more insight to companies about their usage, and to build out more tools to cater to specific verticals in the world of frontline work, such as manufacturing, logistics and transportation, Fabrice Haiat, CEO and co-founder of YOOBIC, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Yoobic started life several years ago with a focus specifically on retail &#8212; an area that it was concentrating on as recently as its last round in 2019, providing tools to help with merchandizing, communicating about stock between stores and more. While retail is still a sizeable part of its business, Yoobic saw an opening to expand into a wider pool of verticals with frontline and service employees that had many of the same demands as retail.</p>
<p>That turned out to be a fortunate pivot as the pandemic struck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Covid-19 had a big impact on us,&#8221; said Haiat, who co-founded the company with brothers Avi and Gilles. &#8220;The first two months we were in panic mode. But what happened was that businesses realized that frontline employees were critical to the success of their operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Covid hit last year, he said that activity on the platform rose by 200%, and earlier this year it passed 1 million activities per month on its platform. &#8220;We are growing like crazy,&#8221; Haiat said.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why building for frontline workers is important. Roaming round without a fixed desk, spending more time with customers than looking at a screen or in meetings, and generally having different business priorities and practices are just a few of the reasons why software built for the former doesn&#8217;t necessarily work for the latter.</p>
<p>There have been a number of companies that have aimed to build services to address that gap &#8212; they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/29/ex-yammer-execs-raise-5-5m-for-cotap-a-mobile-messaging-app-aiming-to-be-whatsapp-for-the-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stretch back years</a>, in fact. And there have been some interesting moves to consolidate in the market among those building some of the more successful tools for people in the field: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/crew-a-workplace-and-slack-messaging-rival-for-shift-workers-raises-35m-adds-enterprise-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crew </a><a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-acquires-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently got acquired by Square</a>; <a href="https://www.servicemax.com/press-releases/servicemax-acquires-zinc-to-expand-service-execution-management-offering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ServiceMax acquired Zinc</a>; and Facebook&#8217;s Workplace has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/workplace-facebooks-enterprise-edition-snaps-up-walmart-as-a-customer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been on a march</a> to amass some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies as customers of its own communications platform with a strong play for frontline workers.</p>
<p>Haiat argues that while all of these are fine and well, none of them understand the full scope of the kinds of tools that those in the field really need. That ranges from practical features (such as a way to handle inventory management), through to features that companies would love to have for their employees as long as they can be delivered in an easy way (such as professional development and training). In that context, the basic communications that all of the current crop of apps for frontline workers offer feel like basic tablestakes.</p>
<p>That close understanding of the gap in the market and what is needed to fix it is one reason why the company has seen such strong growth, as well as interest from investors.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to partner with YOOBIC, which, thanks to the highly impressive team led by Fabrice, Avi and Gilles, has clearly established itself as a leader in the digital workplace space with demonstrable market traction and impressive growth.” said Jean Tardy-Joubert, partner at Highland Europe, in a statement. “While companies have historically focused on digital investments for deskbound employees, the world is becoming distributed and decentralized.  We anticipate a seismic shift that will see huge resources, technology, and capital shifted toward frontline teams.” Tardy-Joubert will be joining the YOOBIC Board with this round.</p>
