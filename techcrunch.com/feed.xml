										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“I like to think of successful brand-building as creating a company that customers would be upset to separate from their identity,” growth marketing expert Julian Shapiro told us earlier this week. “For example, they’d cease to be the man with Slack stickers all over his laptop. Or the woman who no longer wears Nike shoes every day. And that bugs them.”</p>
<p>Shapiro comes from a technical background, as a repeat startup founder and open-source web developer. But these days, as the co-founder of growth education company Demand Curve and startup growth agency Bell Curve, he advocates telling your story by speaking from the heart. We interviewed him earlier this week to hear more about how he sees marketing in 2021.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on TechCrunch and Extra Crunch this week, we published guest columns about using influencers in early-stage brands, the global retail media spending trend and talked to Growth Folks, a growth marketing organization in India.</p>
<p>But first, here are a couple of the most recent recommendations from founders in our startup growth marketer survey. (If there’s a growth marketer that you’ve enjoyed working with, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">please tell us here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Marketer: </strong>Bili Sule, <a href="https://algrowithm.com/">alGROWithm</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Femi Aiki, <a href="https://www.foodlocker.com.ng">Foodlocker</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: “</strong>Bili has a proven track record of driving growth, as the former vice president of Growth Marketing at Jumia Nigeria and as a senior growth consultant for Founders Factory Africa. She’s able to cut through the jargon/vanity metrics and has found a way to consistently and reliably engineer growth for us. What’s unique about Bili’s approach is that her strategy moves beyond just marketing. She is data driven and takes an iterative experimental approach to unlocking growth across various business pillars, from marketing to product and operations.”</p>
<p><strong>Marketer:</strong> <a href="http://jackabramowitz.com/">Jack Abramowitz</a><br />
<strong>Recommended by:</strong> Marwen Refaat, <a href="https://gamefi.com">GameFi</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial:</strong> &#8220;Jack is incredibly talented at both growth hacking as well as building an automated growth engine. He has been tremendously helpful to our team.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/building-a-growth-community-in-india-with-ayush-srivastava-of-growth-folks/">Building a growth community in India with Ayush Srivastava of Growth Folks</a>: India is producing a huge, well-funded new generation of startups and increasing sophistication in growth marketing is one reason why. &#8220;Companies have started realizing the true importance of having a fully functional growth team and they have started acknowledging their one metric that matters as well,&#8221; Srivastava told us in a recent interview. &#8220;The growth marketers have also started setting up a lot of experiments and have taken a data-driven approach to solving a problem. Now, I see many startups going out of the box and putting in efforts to find new ways of acquisition. They haven’t restricted them to acquiring users via the traditional ways and that’s why you see so many ideas going viral so easily.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/early-stage-brands-should-also-unlock-the-power-of-influencers/?tpcc=ECTW2020">(Extra Crunch) Early-stage brands should also unlock the power of influencers:</a> Jonathan Martinez, an experienced growth marketer, breaks down influencer marketing. Martinez notes, “When reaching out to influencers, it’s a sheer numbers game in capturing their attention and pitching your brand, but there are myriad ways to increase response conversion.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/whats-driving-the-global-surge-in-retail-media-spending/">(Extra Crunch) What’s driving the global surge in retail media spending?</a> Cynthia Luo, head of marketing at Epsilo, discusses what modern marketing is in 2021. Luo also talks about how businesses have had to adapt during the COVID-19 pandemic. Luo says, “As e-commerce turns into a dream marketing channel, reaping the benefits of retail marketing is only possible if the marketplace equips brands with the right tools and data sets.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/the-art-of-startup-storytelling-with-julian-shapiro/">The art of startup storytelling with Julian Shapiro:</a> Eric Eldon, Extra Crunch managing editor, spoke with Julian Shapiro, about how companies communicate with the public. Shapiro offered insights from his experience as an angel investor, “I’m interested in businesses with product-led growth, brand affinity moats and who get harder to compete with the larger they get.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/growth-tactics-that-will-jump-start-your-customer-base/">(Extra Crunch) Growth tactics that will jump-start your customer base:</a> Jenny Wang, principal investor at Neo, gives insights on the challenges startups now face to launch their customer base and provides some tactics to help them do so. In this article, Wang discusses what the playbook was like five years ago and says, “ … it’s never been harder to corral eyeballs and hit a breakout adoption trajectory.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/form/state-of-marketing/">Salesforce State of Marketing:</a> Salesforce published a marketing report that uses data from a double-blind survey they conducted. The survey has five main chapters, “Marketers Embrace Change with Optimism,” “As Customers Go Digital, Marketing Steps Up,” “Collaboration Drives the Market-from-Anywhere Era,” “Marketing Is Spelled D-A-T-A” and “Metrics and KPIs Continue to Evolve.” When looking at digital channels, they mentioned that, “Even those digital channels that may have been classified as emerging in recent years are seeing mass adoption. Mobile messaging, for instance, is used by 69% of marketers, and nearly two-thirds of organizations use audio media like podcasts and streaming ads.” The report lists out the five “Most Valuable Marketing Metrics/KPIs” and looks ahead at “Digital Marketing Tactics.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Although older adults are one of the fastest-growing demographics, they&#8217;re quite underserved when it comes to consumer tech.</p>
<p>The global population of people older than 65 will reach 1.5 billion by 2050, and members of this cohort — who are leading longer, active lives — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/the-gray-revolution-fundraising-within-the-older-adult-space/">have plenty of money to spend.</a></p>
<p>Still, most startups persist in releasing products aimed at serving younger users, says Lawrence Kosick, co-founder of GetSetUp, an edtech company that targets 50+ learners.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can provide a valuable, scalable service for the older adult market, there’s a lot of opportunity to drive growth through partnerships,&#8221; he notes.</p>

<p>Singh Cassidy, founder of premium talent marketplace theBoardlist, will discuss making the leap into entrepreneurship after leaving Google, her time as CEO-in-Residence at venture capital firm Accel Partners and the framework she&#8217;s developed for taking career risks.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll take questions from the audience, so please add a reminder to your calendar to join the conversation.</p>

<p>In a candid guest post, Scott Lenet, president of Touchdown Ventures, writes about the cognitive dissonance currently plaguing venture capital.</p>
<p>Yes, there&#8217;s an incredible amount of competition for deals, but there&#8217;s also a path to bringing soaring startup valuations back to earth.</p>
<p>For example, early investors have an inherent conflict of interest with later participants and many VCs are thirsty &#8220;logo hunters&#8221; who just want bragging rights.</p>
<p>At some point, &#8220;venture capitalists need to stop engaging in self-delusion about why a valuation that is too high might be OK,&#8221; writes Lenet.</p>

<p>Aesop&#8217;s fable about the determined tortoise who defeated an arrogant hare has many interpretations, e.g., the value of perseverance, the virtue of taking on bullies, how an outsized ego can undermine natural talent.</p>
<p>In the case of venture capital, the allegory is relevant because a slow, steady and more personal approach generates better outcomes, says Marc Schröder, managing partner of MGV.</p>
<p>“We simply must take the time to get to know founders.”</p>

<p>As the pandemic changed consumer behavior and regulations began to reshape digital marketing tools, advertisers are turning to retail media.</p>
<p>Using the reams of data collected at the individual and aggregate level, retail media produce high-margin revenue streams. &#8220;And like most things, there is a bad, a good and a much better way of doing things,&#8221; advises Cynthia Luo, head of marketing at e-commerce marketing stack Epsilo.</p>

<p>“We lied when we said that The Exchange was done covering 2021 venture capital performance,” Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm admit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, they reviewed a detailed report from NYC-based VC group Work-Bench on the city&#8217;s enterprise tech startups.</p>
<p>“New York City’s enterprise footprint is now large enough that it must be considered a leading market for the startup varietal,” Anna and Alex conclude, “making its results a bellwether to some degree.”</p>
<p>“And if New York City is laying the groundwork for a huge wave of unicorn exits in the coming four to eight quarters, we should expect to see something similar in other enterprise markets around the world.”</p>

<p>Given the rapid pace of digital transformation, nearly every business will eventually migrate some — or most — aspects of their operations to the cloud.</p>
<p>Before making the wholesale shift to digital, companies can start getting comfortable by using disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS). Even a partially managed DRaaS can make an organization more resilient and lighten the load for its IT team.</p>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s also a savvy way for tech leaders to get shot-callers inside their companies to get on board the cloud bandwagon.</p>

<p>“The decisions of government, the broader legal system and its combined level of scrutiny toward a particular subject” can affect market timing and the durability of an idea, Noorjit Sidhu, an early-stage investor at Plug &amp; Play Ventures, writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>There are three areas currently facing regulatory scrutiny that have the potential to “provide outsized returns,” Sidhu writes: taxes, telemedicine and climate.</p>

<p>“China’s technology scene has been in the news for all the wrong reasons in recent months,” Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm write about the Chinese government’s crackdown on a host of technology companies.</p>
<p>“The result of the government fusillade against some of the best-known companies in China was falling share prices,” they write.</p>
<p>But has it affected the venture capital market? SoftBank this week said it would pause investments in China, but the numbers through Q2 indicate China is steadier than Alex and Anna expected.</p>

<p>“This technology isn’t going anywhere, so any platform or tooling that helps make it more secure, simple to use and easy to troubleshoot will be well appreciated by the software development community.”</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 13, 2021. We made it to Friday, everyone. Congratulations! Despite it being the end of the week, we still have lots to talk about. Reddit taking on TikTok. Valuation changes in a key startup sector. And what it may really mean for a workplace to be apolitical. So read on, friends &#8212; there’s a lot to talk about! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios/"><strong>Reddit takes on TikTok:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Recently TikTok announced that it was going to shake up its controls to make its service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/tiktok-to-add-more-privacy-protections-for-teenaged-users-limit-push-notifications/">a bit less addictive</a>. While the social video service works on itself, other companies want to challenge its huge market presence. Reddit is joining YouTube, Snap and others in the war. I wonder where Reddit’s product domain will reach by the time it’s done expanding its feature set.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/what-happens-when-wall-street-falls-out-of-love-with-your-sector/"><strong>Privately loved, publicly panned:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The cohort of insurtech companies that went public in the last year were riding high while private. And they had some pretty reasonable IPOs. Then their valuations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/24/should-we-be-worried-about-insurtech-valuations/">began to fall</a>. And fall. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/a-lot-of-cash-and-little-love-an-insurtech-story/">fall some more</a>. TechCrunch explores what’s going on and what it could mean for startups.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/pushing-for-an-apolitical-workplace-is-immoral-and-unrealistic/"><strong>What does apolitical mean, anyway?</strong></a> A new essay written by Elastic exec Mandy Andress digs into the question. As some companies attempt to banish politics from their workplace, she asks “What might that mean for me as an LGBTQIA+ person in the workplace?” Read it.</li>

<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/argentine-fintech-uala-lands-350m-at-a-2-45b-valuation/">Latin American fintech stays busy:</a></strong> This time ‘round it’s Ualá that has raised more money, a $350 million Series D that values the company at $2.45 billion, to be precise. The Argentine company builds personal financial products, and its new round and resulting multi-unicorn valuation helps underscore just how global the fintech revolution is proving to be.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/orchata-raises-4m-aims-to-build-a-gopuff-for-latin-america/"><strong>Gopuff, but for Latin America:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sticking to the region, Orchata just put together $4 million in new capital. The company wants to replicate the magic that Gopuff has managed to conjure, but farther south of where the U.S. company operates. Given how amply SoftBank has backed Gopuff, we’re counting down until the second Vision Fund arrives to pour cash into the hands of the Y Combinator-backed startup.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/kiddom-series-c/"><strong>Rapid ARR growth helps Kiddom raise more funds:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Kiddom, a “platform that offers a digital curriculum that fits the core standards required by states,” per our own reporting, is growing like a weed. Natasha reports that Kiddom’s ARR scaled 300% from 2020 to 2021. That pace of revenue accretion helped the company secure a $35 million Series C.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/employee-talent-predictor-retrain-ai-raised-another-7m-adds-splunk-as-strategic-investor/"><strong>Reskilling could be big:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Investors just put $7 million into Retrain.ai, a startup that wants to use AI and ML to “help governments and organizations retrain and upskill talent for jobs of the future, enable diversity initiatives, and help employees and jobseekers manage their careers.” All that sounds rather good. Especially as I keep reading about blogging robots that are set to take my job away.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/yc-backed-tablevibes-customer-surveys-help-restaurants-reduce-their-reliance-on-delivery-apps/"><strong>Tablevibe wants to limit what restaurants pay delivery apps:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The food game is a hard one. Margins are low. Customers are whiny. And lately staffing has been an issue. Tablevibe is helping with one particular vector of restaurant pain, namely how much food venues pay the likes of DoorDash and Uber Eats to get their product to customers. Anything to help the small business world makes us sit up and take notice. The company was part of the current Y Combinator batch, notably, so we should hear more from them at demo day.</li>

<h2>There could be more to the Salesforce+ video streaming service than meets the eye</h2>
<p>Salesforce announced this week that it plans to launch a video streaming service.</p>
<p>The industry analysts enterprise reporter Ron Miller interviewed said the initiative has tremendous potential, but one noted that Salesforce will have to dig deep to compete in today&#8217;s crowded media landscape.</p>
<p>Salesforce hasn&#8217;t released details on the type of programming it plans to offer, but given its vast and diverse customer base, its options are many. Said Brent Leary of CRM Essentials:</p>
<blockquote><p>A customer could sponsor a show, advertise a show or possibly collaborate on a show. And have leads generated from the show [which could be] directly tied to the activity from those options and track ROI. And it’s all done on one platform. And the content lives on with ads living on with them.</p></blockquote>

Of a sort. The company has “extended the option of using end-to-end encryption for Messenger voice calls and video calls,” TechCrunch reports. Good.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/amazon-biometric-data-senate-letter/">Lawmakers ask Amazon what it plans to do with biometric data:</a> </strong>Amazon’s push to collect palm prints for its brick-and-mortar stores caught the eye of Congress. But don’t worry, when has any megacorp abused the privacy of the citizenry? Never, right? Right?</li>
<li>To close out today’s news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/twitter-india-head-moves-to-a-different-role/"><strong>Twitter’s head of Indian operations is moving to the States in a new role</strong></a>. Twitter and India have been arguing with one another for some time now, a scrap that included the current Indian government straight up trying to intimidate the U.S. company. It’s pretty gross, frankly, and now Manish Maheshwari is shaking up his job. Look, regulation is fine, but trying to abuse companies and harass their staff for political reasons sucks.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[To hear more about the strategies that are boosting Indian startups, we interviewed Ayush Srivastava, co-founder of growth marketing group Growth Folks (and a growth marketer at Zynga by day).]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian startups of all sizes are raising record amounts of investment funding this year and getting public exits, as we&#8217;ve been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/investors-race-to-win-early-stage-startup-deals-in-india/">covering</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/indian-startups-fundraise-spree/">in recent</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">months</a>. To hear more about the growth behind the numbers we caught up with Ayush Srivastava, a co-founder of growth marketing group <a href="https://www.growthfolks.in/">Growth Folks</a> (and a growth marketer at Zynga by day).</p>
<p>The organization, which describes itself as “India’s largest community of growth enthusiasts,” began as in-person events for growth marketers across major cities, but made the jump to online networking during the pandemic. From there it began an online speaker series for its 1,300-some members, introduced more community networking groups and virtual events, and one-on-one mentoring.</p>
<p>In the interview below, part of our ongoing series profiling growth marketers around the world, he says India&#8217;s startup scene has quickly gotten more sophisticated about growth in recent years. Companies are centering high-quality user growth as a shared team goal, not as a side job, and are thinking more creatively about where and how to find users. &#8220;I am amazed at how the startups are focusing on tier two-three cities here in India. With the pace with which internet access has grown … they are making sure they are solving the problem faced by rural Indians as well. [I] just love the fact that proper solutions are being built in the right manner for the concerned pain point.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>You describe Growth Folks as “India&#8217;s largest community of growth enthusiasts,” with more than 1,300 members. What does “growth enthusiast” mean to you, and how does that term define you?</strong></p>
<p>The terms &#8220;growth&#8221; and &#8220;growth marketing&#8221; have picked up a lot in the last five years in the Indian startup ecosystem. All of a sudden there are more than a million heads who are interested to be a part of this circle or are already a part of this community. This had a positive impact as more and more people started to look at their growth problems and not only just promoting their business. For us, growth enthusiasts are everyone and anyone who is even one percent excited about how to grow a particular brand/service.</p>
<p><strong>How did the focus and efforts of Growth Folks change during the pandemic for community engagement?</strong></p>
<p>In the pre-COVID era, Growth Folks was heavily functional in the offline space. We used to manage and engage the community online but most of the efforts went in and success used to come from the offline activities that we used to organize. From December 2018 through the end of 2019, we organized more than 80+ offline events in nine cities of India. These events were previously panel discussions, industry talks or seminars followed by networking sessions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>[H]owever, once COVID came into the picture, our operations shifted completely online and I must say the shift was quite smooth but exciting for me. We started hosting biweekly online webinars with industry leaders and tried giving our community folks (and new attendees) a look and feel of the physical event in the form of this virtual gathering so that they feel connected.</p>
<p>Ever since lockdown began, we have done over 25+ events and have had speakers from companies like SEMRush, Baremetrics, Zynga, Indigo Airlines, Adjust, Myntra and many more. Not only this, we started a lot of interesting threads on our Facebook group to get people to engage more. Within the same period, we launched our website to give people an idea about all our services.</p>
<p>We made sure that we are having dedicated networking sessions after the webinars for people to interact with each other. In October 2020, we relaunched the online version of “Brunch Sessions” that we used to have in the pre-COVID times. These brunch sessions helped the fellow community people to come together on a single day and interact and chill with each other virtually. We started producing more online content knowing the fact that this could be a way to have a value add and it worked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Growth Folks is multifaceted, offering traditional growth marketing services as well as hosting a “growth hackathon” and community activities. What can a startup expect when working with Growth Folks? How is it different from existing services?</strong></p>
<p>We have been virtually able to connect with so many people and we continue to do so … [W]e started something which is called “growth huddle.” It is a highly curated one-on-one mentorship session with a few of the best talents out there in the growth space. You can book your session and we will take you through the entire process to make sure that the session is right on point and you learn what you want, not what we want.</p>
<p>All of the mentors who were onboarded vary from experience level to expertise and provide the right set of guidance needed for individuals and startups to grow further. We also partnered with startups and companies for various online events to promote them and make sure that the right voice reaches out to the right set of people who matter to them — the Growth Folks. We have collaborated with companies like Adjust, Microsoft, Rocketium, Canva and many more and we have been able to make people learn the right things.</p>
<p><strong>What are startups doing better now than ever before? In India? Around the world?</strong></p>
<p>Companies have started realizing the true importance of having a fully functional growth team and they have started acknowledging their one metric that matters as well. The growth marketers have also started setting up a lot of experiments and have taken a data-driven approach to solving a problem. Now, I see many startups going out of the box and putting in efforts to find new ways of acquisition. They haven’t restricted them to acquiring users via the traditional ways and that’s why you see so many ideas going viral so easily. And all in different ways.</p>
<p>I see so many founders not restricting themselves to hiring just a growth marketer for leading all growth initiatives. Rather, they have spent time understanding the importance of it and have ended up building a full force growth team of marketers, PMs, tech people, designers, etc. I feel that is the best way to look at any growth problem statement.</p>
<p>I am amazed at how the startups are focusing on tier two-three cities here in India. With the pace with which internet access has grown … they are making sure they are solving the problem faced by rural Indians as well. [I] just love the fact that proper solutions are being built in the right manner for the concerned pain point.</p>
<p>Lastly, companies have started considering the importance of the entire customer experience more seriously than ever before. This is helping brands to grow via communities easily and create a strong brand presence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Way back in January 2020, Sonos sued Google over patent infringement. Today, the streaming speaker company scored an early victory with the U.S. International Trade Commission. A preliminary ruling penned by ITC chief administrative law judge Charles Bullock finds that Google infringed on five patents.</p>
<p>“Today the ALJ has found all five of Sonos’ asserted patents to be valid and that Google infringes on all five patents,” Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We are pleased the ITC has confirmed Google’s blatant infringement of Sonos’ patented inventions. This decision re-affirms the strength and breadth of our portfolio, marking a promising milestone in our long-term pursuit to defend our innovation against misappropriation by Big Tech monopolies.”</p>
<p>The finding is still very much early days for what’s likely to be an even more protracted battled battle between the two companies. Sonos’ complaint stems from Google’s own family of streaming speakers. Google entered the category, long dominated by Sonos, roughly four and a half years ago with the original Home speaker. The line now includes a number of products now listed under the Nest banner.</p>
<p>“Google has been blatantly and knowingly copying our patented technology,” Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said in a statement when the suit was initially filed. “Despite our repeated and extensive efforts over the last few years, Google has not shown any willingness to work with us on a mutually beneficial solution. We’re left with no choice but to litigate.”</p>
<p>Sonos noted similar issues with Amazon devices (Google’s chief competitor in the category) at the time, but the company opted to focus its time, money and resources on a battle with Google, instead.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Sonos is hoping to use the ITC to block the import of those smart speakers, along with other Google hardware, including the Chromecast and Pixels. Such a decision would be a massive hit to Google’s hardware ambitions. A final ruling isn’t expected until December 13, however, after which point a potential import ban would take 60 days to go into effect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After teasing its new font in January, Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/twitter-redesigns-website-with-new-font-less-clutter-and-high-contrast-features/">made some major changes</a> to its website and app design this week. But while Twitter framed these updates as making the platform “<a href="https://twitter.com/twitterdesign/status/1425505308563099650?s=21">more accessible</a>,” some accessibility experts say that these changes missed the mark.</p>
<p>Most noticeably, tweets now appear in “Chirp,” Twitter’s proprietary typeface, and the display has even more visual contrast between the background and text. Other updates made the interface less cluttered, removing unnecessary divider lines. For people with low vision, high-contrast design can make websites more legible, but the current contrast level is so high that it’s causing strain for some users. Twitter far exceeds the minimum contrast standards set by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> (WCAG), which provides recommendations for making websites accessible to disabled people. But web accessibility isn’t one-size fits all &#8212; while some users may need a high-contrast display, others who suffer from chronic migraines might require a more muted experience. Research has also shown that dyslexic people <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2012/text-customization/r11">tend to read faster</a> when presented with lower-contrast text.</p>

<p>“When the update hit, I could immediately feel pain in my eyes, and within about half an hour, I was having a tension headache,” said Alex Haagaard, a design researcher and founding member at <a href="https://www.disabledlist.org/">The Disabled List</a>. “I have a lot of chronic pain, and I cannot deliberately expose myself to something that is going to be exacerbating my levels of pain, because then that has cascade effects.”</p>
<p>Up until last year, Twitter’s accessibility team was volunteer-based &#8212; paid employees at Twitter would take on accessibility projects on top of their existing jobs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/somehow-twitter-does-not-have-a-team-dedicated-to-accessibility/">TechCrunch reported</a>. In September, a few months after Twitter had released an <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1273794890543935488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1273794890543935488%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Ftwitters-voice-tweets-upset-users-again-over-accessibility-11593612001">audio tweet feature</a> without accessibility considerations, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible">Twitter introduced</a> two dedicated accessibility teams within its company. But experts emphasize that including disabled people in design decisions from the get-go is necessary when implementing new features.</p>
<p>“They talked a good talk about how they were going to change this, that they were going to integrate accessibility and disabled perspectives more into their design processes, and from this, it seems they have not done an adequate job with that,” said Haagaard. “Engaging people from disabled communities as consultants at the high-level stages, within the research and conceptualization phase, would prevent designers from getting to a point where you’re testing something and you realize it’s fundamentally problematic and it’s too late.”</p>
<p>Twitter told TechCrunch that &#8220;feedback was sought from people with disabilities throughout the process, from the beginning. However, people have different preferences and needs and we will continue to track feedback and refine the experience. We realize we could get more feedback in the future and we&#8217;ll work to do that.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>On its accessibility account Twitter, acknowledged the problems that users were reporting with eye-strain and migraines after the update. This afternoon, the platform added that due to user feedback, it is making contrast changes on all buttons to make them &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1426260504687824905">easier on the eyes</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>“When a design organization makes an announcement, and the accessibility organization alongside it actually has things to say about it, that means they work together, and that’s always a good thing,” said Matt May, head of Inclusive Design at Adobe. “The key thing is to continue to listen and find the people who aren’t being represented, and try to synthesize them within the rest of the system.”</p>

</div>
<p>It’s odd that Twitter neglected to add customization capabilities when it rolled out its higher-contrast display and new default typeface, since the company has a history of offering customization elsewhere in its user experience. Currently, users can toggle among dark, light and dim modes, make their default font size bigger or smaller, and even change the look of buttons and hyperlinks to colors like purple, orange and pink. Even before this week’s update, Twitter’s accessibility panel allowed users to enable a higher contrast mode. But still, there is no way for users to reduce the contrast or change what font the site uses, which experts cite as a design flaw. With its first proprietary typeface Chirp, Twitter sought to “<a href="https://twitter.com/DerritDeRouen/status/1354548649561186306">improve how we convey emotion</a>,” but users reported the font to be more difficult to read than Helvetica, which Twitter used before Chirp.</p>
<p>According to Shawn Lawton Henry &#8212; a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, editor of the WCAG recommendations, and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium’s accessibility education and outreach &#8212; websites should include customization options for users to toggle among fonts, contrast levels and more. WCAG doesn’t require this currently, but Henry says that future updates of the guidelines will recommend that websites give users the option to change contrast.</p>
<p>“The main issue is that the default contrast should [meet the WCAG standards] and users should be able to change it. It’s not hard, right?” Henry said. “It’s fine to have a default font, but you have to make it customizable. Even if it was the most readable font known, it would still be important to allow people to change it because of individual differences.”</p>
<p>When asked about adding ways for users to change typefaces and contrast levels, a Twitter spokesperson said that the company had “no concrete plans to share right now, but we&#8217;re always looking at ways to improve the experience and listening to feedback.”</p>
<p>&#8220;I think part of the disappointment here is that they&#8217;re framing this as an accessibility thing, but it&#8217;s also really clear that it was equally about building brand identity,&#8221; Haagaard said.</p>
<p>While some users will override website settings with USS (User Style Sheets), Henry’s research for the World Wide Web Consortium showed that user agents like web browsers and e-book readers should provide users the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2012/text-customization/r14">ability to customize</a> these settings more easily. Not all users are tech-savvy enough to write USS, and it’s easier for users to toggle among the accessibility settings specific to an app. This level of customization isn’t unprecedented &#8212; in June, Discord added <a href="https://twitter.com/discord/status/1405979713525272576?lang=en">a saturation slider</a> in its accessibility settings, for example.</p>
<p>“The beauty of the web is that it’s not paper, and we can change it,” Henry said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.carta.com/">Carta</a>, the nine-year-old, San Francisco-based cap table management and valuation software company, just raised $500 million in its eighth round of funding, at a $7.4 billion valuation. That&#8217;s more than double where the company was valued eight months ago when it closed its seventh round of funding at a valuation of $3.1 billion.</p>
<p>With so much money flooding into privately held companies, giant leaps in valuation are no longer all that notable. What&#8217;s different about this particular story is how Carta&#8217;s new valuation was established, which it says was to run an auction using its own trading platform to sell $100 million of its shares to secondary buyers, then use the valuation at which the shares sold &#8212; $6.9 billion &#8212; as evidence to primary investors of Carta&#8217;s true value.</p>
<p>For a company that&#8217;s trying to raise awareness of its trading platform &#8212; Carta wants to sell more of the secondary shares of other companies, too &#8212; it was a smart marketing play. It was Carta eating its own dog food, in the somewhat repellant parlance of the startup world. Still, it&#8217;s unclear whether we&#8217;re likely to see it replicated by other companies going forward.</p>
<p>First, what Carta did is &#8212; we think &#8212; unprecedented in establishing a price for secondary shares. Typically, a small group comes together and negotiates a price or, if it&#8217;s 20 or more sellers who are willing to offload shares to buyers, it&#8217;s considered a &#8220;tender offer&#8221; and out comes the prospectus-type document, including financial statements, risk factors and all that other jazz, which is sent to a set group of potential buyers.</p>
<p>In Carta&#8217;s case, as Carta CEO Henry Ward suggests in a <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/carta-series-g-3a3702f69b11">new Medium post</a>, by running an auction process, many more investors participated in the price discovery of its shares than might have been possible otherwise. (A <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/finally-a-private-stock-exchange-cartax-3c658f30ac97">prior post</a> by Ward pegs this number at 414 participants that participated in 1,484 executed orders.)</p>
<p>It makes a lot of sense, says longtime startup attorney Tim Harris of Morrison &amp; Foerster, who was not involved in the process but is a student of market efficiencies. &#8220;Ward is basically saying, &#8216;We&#8217;re using a broader market price-seeking process instead of what he describes as one-off. You see it in real estate listings all the time,&#8221; adds Harris. &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason companies can&#8217;t do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>The question that startup founders may be wondering right now is whether an auction process like Carta&#8217;s can truly help establish a price for primary shares. Naturally, Ward says it can. Indeed, in his Medium post, he says the auction very much strengthened the case that Carta could make to investors, including Silver Lake, the investment firm that ultimately led Carta&#8217;s newest $500 million round (a Series G).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While we don&#8217;t doubt it was a useful data point, Silver Lake is a sophisticated investment firm has been valuing companies for 21 years; likely, it would have arrived at the valuation it did without that earlier auction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are other reasons to think an auction like Carta&#8217;s will remain an outlier. For his part, attorney Anthony McCusker, who co-chairs the tech practice at Goodwin Proctor, questions whether &#8220;companies are going to outsource their valuation discovery to Carta.&#8221; Most founders and CEOs would prefer to talk directly with investors when it comes to establishing the valuation of their company rather than leave it to the wisdom of crowds, he suggests.</p>
<p>Markets can also &#8220;be gamed,&#8221; as notes Harris of MoFo, observing that the integrity of any platform &#8220;depends on oversight and the quality of bids on a platform,&#8221; (Harris half-kiddingly wonders what happened, for example, to the bidder who said he or she would pay <a href="https://people.com/human-interest/jeff-bezos-space-flight-auction-winning-bid-28-million-brother-mark/">$28 million</a> to join Jeff Bezos on his trip to space, then later cited &#8220;<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/16/blue_origins_flight/">scheduling conflicts</a>.&#8221;)</p>
<p>As for us, we wonder how many founding teams are willing to open up the secondary sale of their shares to a potentially much wider circle of backers when historically, they have not.</p>
<p>We also wonder whether, for some companies, that discovery process could backfire. After all, Carta is a hot commodity that likely didn&#8217;t need to set a floor for its auction offering. But we can imagine scenarios in which companies&#8217; secondary shares aren&#8217;t worth to outsiders what founders think that they are.</p>
<p>Of course, the industry is changing fast, so very little would surprise us at this point. Indeed, whatever happens, the auction is clearly part of a larger trend toward transparency that continues to play out in interesting new ways all the time.</p>
<p>As Harris notes, when he began practicing law 26 year ago, &#8220;venture was a completely closed ecosystem.&#8221; Now, he says, &#8220;There&#8217;s a wealth of data being shared and disseminated to maker smarter business decisions. You can just go to PitchBook or Crunchbase to learn a lot of what you need to know.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">After all the leaks and teases, Lamborghini has finally announced its new hybrid-engine Countach.</p>
<p>Thankfully, almost everything you need to know about the car is in its model designation: LPI 800-4.</p>
<p>The first part is short for Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido, referencing how the powertrain is mounted lengthwise toward the back of the supercar and the fact that it&#8217;s a hybrid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the two numbers point to the approximately 802 horsepower the Countach&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-lamborghini-sian-hybrid-technology-interview.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">V12 6.5-liter engine</a> and 48-volt electric motor can output together, as well as the fact that it has four-wheel drive.</p>
<figure>
<p><div style="width: 685px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-08%2Fe0dbabf0-fc53-11eb-bf3f-9ef15cf71548&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=1fcad3b1e2857e37b1ebad635516b1951f6e0703" alt="Countach LPI 800-4" width="675" height="506" data-uuid="5989dadc-a19b-37b8-9284-658f816c4ba7" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lamborghini</p></div></figure>
<p>All of that makes for one powerful car. The Countach can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in less than three seconds and zero to 124 miles per hour in just under nine seconds. As for a top speed, you can push it to 221 miles per hour, and it has a maximum torque of 531 lb-ft.  <span id="end-legacy-contents"></span></p>

<figure></figure>
<p>Powering the Countach&#8217;s electric motor is a supercapacitor Lamborghini claims delivers three times more power compared to a lithium-ion battery of the same weight. The automaker says it mounted the electric motor directly to the gearbox to preserve the feeling of power transfer you get from a V12 engine.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Carbon fiber makes up most of the chassis and exterior of the Countach LPI 800-4. &#8220;It imagines how the iconic Countach of the 70s and 80s might have evolved into an elite super sports model of this decade,&#8221; Lamborghini says of the design, which is more reminiscent of the Aventador than its original namesake. Inside, you&#8217;ll find an 8.4-inch touchscreen display that includes CarPlay integration and a button labeled &#8220;Stile.&#8221; Pressing it &#8220;explains the Countach design philosophy to its privileged audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Speaking of a privileged audience, Lamborghini will only make 112 units of the Countach LPI 800-4. The press release the automaker sent over doesn&#8217;t even mention a price tag. It seems Lamborghini is keen on looking forward, but the Countach was too important not to acknowledge with a limited run.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Five years ago, the playbook for launching a new company involved a tried-and-true list of to-dos. Once you built an awesome product with a catchy name, you’d try to get a feature article on TechCrunch, a front-page hit on Hacker News, hunted on ProductHunt and an AMA on Quora.</p>
<p>While all of these today remain impressive milestones, it’s never been harder to corral eyeballs and hit a breakout adoption trajectory.</p>
<p>In this new decade, it is possible to first out-market your competitor, and then raise lots of money, hire the best team and build, rather than the other way around (building first, then marketing).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like <a href="https://twitter.com/stripe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@stripe</a> redesigned their landing page.</p>
<p>How long until we see these colorful gradients on other startups&#39; landing pages?<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/c6DL5mEUm4">https://t.co/c6DL5mEUm4</a> <a href="https://t.co/cCh8NyXawy">pic.twitter.com/cCh8NyXawy</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Outbound marketing tools and company newsletters are useful, but they’re also a slow burn and offer low conversion in the new creator economy. So where does this leave us?</p>
<p>With audiences spread out over so many platforms, reaching cult status requires some level of hacking. Brand-building is no longer a one-hit game, but an exercise in repetition: It may take four or five times for a user to see your startup’s name or logo to recognize, remember or Google it.</p>
<p>Below are some growth tactics that I hope will help jump-start the effort to building an engaged user base.</p>
<h2>Laying the groundwork for user-generated content</h2>
<p>Before users are evangelists, they are observers. Consider creating a bot to alert you of any product mentions on Twitter, or surface subject-matter discussions on Reddit (“Best tools to manage AWS costs?” or “Which marketplace do you resell your old electronics on?&#8221;), which you can then respond to with thoughtful commentary.</p>
<p>Join relevant communities on Discord, infiltrate Slack groups of relevant conferences (including past iterations of a conference  —  chances are those groups are still alive with activity), follow forums on StackOverflow and engage in the discussions on all these channels.</p>
<p>The more often you post, the better your posts convert. The more your handle appears on newsfeeds, the more likely it will be included on widely quoted “listicles.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Most “user-generated content” in the early innings should be generated by you, from both personal accounts and company accounts.</p>
<h2>Build in public …</h2>
<p>Building in public is scary given the speed at which ideas can be copied, but competition will always exist, since new ideas are not born in vacuums. Companies like <a href="https://twitter.com/Railway/status/1411137508331585539">Railway</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Replit">Replit</a> post to Twitter every time they post a new changelog. <a href="https://twitter.com/josephpalbanese/status/1353791249912745984">Stir brands its feature releases as “drops,”</a> similar to streetwear drops.</p>
<p>Building in public can also lend opportunities for virality, which requires drama, comedy or both. Hey.com’s launch was buoyed by Basecamp’s public fight against Apple over existing App Store take rates.</p>
<p>Mmhmm, the virtual camera app that adds TV-presenter flair to video meetings, launched with a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8KhKBLoSMk&amp;t=1s"> viral video</a> that hit over 1.5 million views. The company continues to release entertaining<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mmhmm/videos"> YouTube demos</a> to showcase new use cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>… or build in private</h2>
<p>Like an artist teasing an upcoming album, some companies are able to drum up substantial anticipation ahead of exiting stealth mode. When two ex-Apple execs founded Humane, they crafted<a href="https://www.instagram.com/hu.ma.ne/?hl=en"> beautiful social media pages</a> full of sophisticated photography without revealing a single hint of what they set out to build.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

The firm&#8217;s portfolio includes Airbnb, 23andMe, Docker, Dropbox, Figma and GitHub &#8212; and that barely covers the first half of the alphabet. (The Sequoia website lists portfolio companies in alphabetical order.)</p>
<p>So it should go without saying that we are absolutely thrilled to have <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-sequoia-capital-and-rec-room?ref=cc6f33dc754d">Sequoia partner Stephanie Zhan and Rec Room founder Nick Fajt join us on Extra Crunch Live</a> in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Rec Room is a Seattle-based startup that allows users to not only play games, but to build them collaboratively with their friends. The gaming world has seen a huge boost in the wake of the pandemic, and Rec Room is thinking way out in the future about what gaming looks like not only as a user, but as a creator.</p>
<p>The company has raised nearly $150 million, and Sequoia led Rec Room&#8217;s seed and Series A financing rounds.</p>
<p>Stephanie Zhan has been with Sequoia as part of the early-stage and seed investment team, with a portfolio that includes Sunday (outdoor home subscription service), Linear (issues tracking tool for modern developers) and Middesk (background checks for businesses). She has also helped lead investments in Graphcore (microprocessors for machine intelligence), Evervault (dev tools for data privacy) and Doppler (secrets management for developers).</p>
<p>Before joining Sequoia, Zhan held product roles at Google and Nest.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hear from this founder/investor duo about how they met, what made them choose each other and how they&#8217;ve worked together and tackled obstacles moving forward. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-sequoia-capital-and-rec-room?ref=cc6f33dc754d">REGISTER HERE FOR FREE!</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Nearly three in 10 employees (29%) would quit their job if they were told they were no longer allowed to work remotely, according to a <a href="https://www.livecareer.com/resources/careers/planning/is-remote-work-here-to-stay">recent survey.</a> In addition, a recent Harvard Business Study found that “companies that let their workers decide where and when to do their jobs — whether in another city or in the middle of the night — increase employee productivity, reduce turnover and lower organizational costs.”</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months, while instituting a remote work model, our turnover rate at Insightly was the lowest in company history and an internal survey found happiness levels to be twice as high from the previous year. This in the midst of a major pandemic, social movement, forest fires and a disruptive election — all happening at the same time.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As long as your employees are available when your customers are in need and goals are consistently met, 9 to 5 no longer needs to be a thing.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>On a larger, global scale, employers from companies around the world are coming to the same realization: You don’t need an office to be productive and employees are happier working from home.</p>
<p>The next logical step is, at the same time, a majorly disruptive one and a 180-degree shift toward how companies have operated for over 100 years — the transition from in-person headquarters to a remote, work-from-anywhere model. In line with this shift, we’ve foregone our 40,000-square-foot Soma office space and employees are able to work from anywhere in the United States while keeping the same salary.</p>
<p>There will no doubt be challenges, and there already have been. But with these challenges also arises immense opportunity. Here are a few battle-tested tips on how to maintain productivity while delivering flexibility with this new work model:</p>
<h2>Reallocate overhead savings</h2>
<p>Let employees choose where they live. Allowing this option will better their lives and make for happy, engaged employees. Overhead costs, especially in large cities such as San Francisco, are the largest operating expense for most companies. Take this large sum of money and invest in employee happiness. You don’t need thousands of square feet in office space to be successful.</p>
<p>That massive overhead cost you just got rid of? Use this toward more meaningful employee experiences that will enhance their lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/salesforce-wants-salesforce-to-be-the-netflix-of-biz-content/">its new business video streaming service</a> called Salesforce+ this week, everyone had a reaction. While not all of it was positive, some company watchers also wondered if there was more to this announcement than meets the eye.</p>
<p>If you look closely, the new initiative suggests that Salesforce wants to take a bite out of LinkedIn and other SaaS content platforms and publishers. The video streaming service could be a launch point for a broader content platform, where its partners are producing their own content and using Salesforce+ infrastructure to help them advertise to and cultivate their own customers.</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company has, after all, done exactly this sort of thing with its online marketplaces and industry events to great success. Salesforce generated almost $6 billion in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Salesforce-Announces-Strong-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2022-Results/default.aspx">its most recent quarterly earnings report.</a> That mostly comes from selling its sales, marketing and service software, not any kind of content production, but it has lots of experience putting on Dreamforce, its massive annual customer event, as well as smaller events throughout the year around the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">On its face, Salesforce+ is a giant, ambitious and quite expensive content marketing play. </span>The company reportedly has hired a large professional staff to produce and manage the content, and built a broadcasting and production studio designed to produce quality shows in-house. It believes that by launching with content from Dreamforce, its highly successful customer conference, attended by tens of thousands people every year pre-pandemic, it can prime the viewing pump and build audience momentum that way, perhaps even using celebrities as it often does at its events to drive audience. It is less clear about the long-term business goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kiddom, a platform that offers a digital curriculum that fits the core standards required by states, announced today that it has raised a $35 million Series C round led by Altos Ventures, with participation from Owl Ventures, Khosla Ventures and Outcomes Collective. The financing came nearly three years after Kiddom’s Series B, <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2018/03/kiddom-raises-15m-in-series-b-funding.html">a $15 million round led by Owl.</a></p>
<p>The startup didn’t just raise money, it finally learned how to make some. Founded in 2012, Kiddom was able to raise millions without revenue or a clear business model. But Ahsan Rizvi, CEO and co-founder of Kiddom, and Abbas Manjee, chief academic officer and co-founder of Kiddom, think an early focus on adoption instead of monetization was necessary.</p>
<p>“At our Series B, we were definitely not making money,” Manjee said. “But we have a free product that teachers and students use, and the idea was to build an enterprise product on top of it.” It’s a common strategy with bottom up sales. For example, ClassDojo prioritized adoption for years before it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/">finally introduced a paying version of its classroom socialization product.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="blCidMHSe8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/">ClassDojo&#8217;s second act comes with first profits</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;ClassDojo&#8217;s second act comes with first profits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/classdojos-second-act-comes-with-first-profits/embed/#?secret=blCidMHSe8" data-secret="blCidMHSe8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Kiddom poured most of its capital into research and development into its enterprise product. It has two parts. First, it offers a platform that helps schools integrate all of their different platforms into an interface that tracks student utilization and achievement. Second, it offers that platform alongside the product it&#8217;s built up for years, a digital curriculum that fits in with Common Core, a set of math and English academic standards that students are required to learn on a grade by grade level. The latter is perhaps the hardest sell for Kiddom, but also the most lucrative.</p>
<p>Manjee explained vendor approval processes across the States can take a long time, and the stakes are high since decision-makers will only turn to a handful of vendors when it comes to meeting core standards.</p>
<p>A lot of Kiddom’s success depends on if traditional curriculum providers, like the Pearsons and McGraw-Hills of the world, don’t catch up to the digitization of education. Rizvi explained that older companies are “losing market share rapidly” right now. Last year, McGraw-Hill and Cengage <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-05-04-cengage-mcgraw-hill-terminate-proposed-merger-amid-regulatory-scrutiny">terminated a proposed merger</a> that would’ve added some fresh competition to the curriculum world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product has resonated with some users. While Kiddom declined to give specifics, it said that new ARR growth grew 2,525% its first year. In 2020 to 2021, ARR growth is on track to be 300%. It said that at least one teacher uses its product in 70% of schools in the United States, a metric <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-03-14-no-kidding-this-pre-revenue-edtech-startup-just-raised-15m-in-series-b-funding">that has remained consistent since 2018.</a></p>
<p>Kiddom’s fresh funding and revenue shows that its years of product development have kept it competitive in the eyes of investors, synergistic unicorns and the stingiest enterprise customer of them all, school districts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has extended the option of using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/end-to-end-encryption/">end-to-end encryption</a> for Messenger voice calls and video calls.</p>
<p>End-to-end encryption (E2EE) — a security feature that prevents third-parties from eavesdropping on calls and chats —<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/08/messenger-adds-end-to-end-encryption/"> has been available for text conversations on Facebook&#8217;s flagship messaging service since 2016</a>. Although the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/facebook-is-being-leant-on-by-us-uk-australia-to-ditch-its-end-to-end-encryption-expansion-plan/">has faced pressure from governments to roll back</a> its end-to-end encryption plans, Facebook is now extending this protection to both voice and video calls on Messenger, which means that &#8220;nobody else, including Facebook, can see or listen to what’s sent or said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;End-to-end encryption is already widely used by apps like WhatsApp to keep personal conversations safe from hackers and criminals,&#8221; Ruth Kricheli, director of product management for Messenger, said in a <a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/08/13/messenger-updates-end-to-end-encrypted-chats-with-new-features/">blog post</a> on Friday. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;It’s becoming the industry standard and works like a lock and key, where just you and the people in the chat or call have access to the conversation.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook has some other E2EE features in the works, too. It&#8217;s planning to start public tests of end-to-end encryption for group chats and calls in Messenger in the coming weeks and is also planning a limited test of E2EE for Instagram direct messages. Those involved in the trial will be able to opt-in to end-to-end encrypted messages and calls for one-on-one conversations carried out on the photo-sharing platform.</p>
<p>Beyond encryption, the social networking giant is also updating its expiring messages feature, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/whatsapp-now-lets-you-post-disappearing-messages-which-go-away-after-7-days/">which is similar to the ephemeral messages feature available on Facebook-owned WhatsApp</a>. It&#8217;s now offering more options for people in the chat to choose the amount of time before all new messages disappear, from as few as five seconds to as long as 24 hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;People expect their messaging apps to be secure and private, and with these new features, we’re giving them more control over how private they want their calls and chats to be,&#8221; Kricheli added.</p>
<p>News of Facebook ramping up its E2EE rollout plans comes just days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/oh-facebook-changed-its-privacy-settings-again/">the company changed its privacy settings</a> — again.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Do you remember the first time you received a personalized ad? Perhaps you discussed a product with a friend, and the next day, an advertisement for that product popped up on social media. It almost makes you think someone’s listening to your conversations, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Over time, consumers have become increasingly skeptical about ads like these — and for good reason. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-110/Accenture-See-People-Not-Patterns.pdf%23zoom%3D50&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1622651160731000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2VrjdFwMISWa9DFW-ubpvA">A 2019 Accenture study</a> found many customers felt brands communicated in a way they felt was too personal — and 71% of those customers worried how the brands had acquired personal information they hadn’t voluntarily shared.</p>
<p>First-, second- and third-party data make it possible to generate hyperpersonalized ads. But these data collection efforts fall short. Consumers find these methods invasive and a breach of trust — and the data collected is often inaccurate. Google’s third-party cookie is going away, and Apple has made recent changes to its Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), but no one has clarified the effect of these changes on advertisers’ or marketers’ abilities to reach and remarket consumers.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Many advertisers have begun leveraging AOOH as a more significant part of their brand and marketing strategy to improve reach, frequency and overall business outcomes.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It’s not so much that customers <em>don’t </em>appreciate ads targeting their interests — the concern lies in the methods marketers use to collect data and how consumers can maintain control over what personal data they choose to share. Interestingly, as consumer demands for personalization have increased, according to the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/postclick_prod/2021/04/The-2021-State-of-Ad-Personalization-Report-updated.pdf">2021 State of Ad Personalization report</a>, half of marketers have yet to invest in ad personalization.</p>
<p>Personalization and data play a vital role in the success of marketing and advertising campaigns today. Brands and their marketing departments must think outside the box and use a more targeted medium not predicated on invading privacy but designed, nevertheless, to provide a unique, personalized experience for in-store shoppers: audio out-of-home (AOOH) technology.</p>
<p>AOOH technology does not request the use of personal data to work effectively. Instead, it focuses on the in-store customer experience. AOOH broadcasts premium music and programmatic advertisements to enrich customer experiences and reach shoppers directly at the point of sale, influencing buying decisions and positively impacting sales.</p>
<h2>The current generation of personalization and data collection</h2>
<p>In the marketing world, personalization has many nuances. Ultimately, marketers see its goal as providing a unique experience to every individual based on personal preferences and data. The current generation of personalization in marketing is <em>not</em> about collecting cookies or third-party data, merchandising or guesswork.</p>
<p>Today’s personalization focuses instead on delivering the <em>right</em> content, the <em>right</em> offer, the <em>right</em> channel and, most importantly, the <em>right</em> sequence of events generating value exchange between the brand and the consumer.</p>
<p>Although consumers don&#8217;t trust superpersonalized ads, they still expect brands to offer a personalized experience. Ninety-one percent of consumers polled in another <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-77/accenture-pulse-survey.pdf">Accenture study</a> indicated a willingness to shop brands with some form of personalization.</p>
<p>On the other hand, personalization in audio advertising has seen significant growth over the past 15 years, as reflected by a willingness by brands to invest in this medium. A recent report predicts an astonishing <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1176/online-advertising/">84% growth in digital audio ad revenue for 2025 compared to 2019</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From Instagram’s Reels to Snapchat’s Spotlight, most social media platforms are looking toward the TikTok boom for inspiration. Now, even Reddit, a discussion-based forum, is making short-form video more pronounced on its iOS app.</p>
<p>According to Reddit, most iOS users should have a button on their app directly to the right of the search bar &#8212; when tapped, it will show a stream of videos in a TikTok-like configuration. When presented with a video, (which shows the poster who uploaded it and the subreddit it&#8217;s from), users can upvote or downvote, comment, gift an award or share it. Like TikTok, users can swipe up to see another video, feeding content from subreddits the user is subscribed to, as well as related ones. For instance, if you&#8217;re subscribed to r/printmaking, you might see content from r/pottery or r/bookbinding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reddit’s mission is to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world, and subsequently, Reddit’s video team’s mission is to bring community through video,” a Reddit spokesperson told TechCrunch, about the new addition. &#8220;Over the course of the last year, our goal was to build a unified video player, and re-envision the player interface to match what users (new and old) expect when it comes to an in-app video player &#8212; especially commenting, viewing, engaging and discovering new content and communities through video,&#8221; they noted.</p>
<p>Reddit doesn’t yet have a timeline for when the feature will roll out to everyone, but confirmed that this icon first appeared for some users in late July and has continued to roll out to almost all iOS users. But by placing a broader, yet still personalized video feed on the home screen, Reddit is signaling a growing curiosity in short form video. In December 2020, Reddit acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/reddit-acquires-dubsmash/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Dubsmash</a>, a Brooklyn-via-Berlin-based TikTok competitor. The terms of the deals were undisclosed, but Facebook and Snap also <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-snap-held-talks-to-buy-tiktok-rival-dubsmash">reportedly showed interest</a> in the platform, which hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/31/dubsmash-songs/">1 billion monthly views</a> in January 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reddit declined to comment on whether or not its new video player is using an algorithm to promote discovery of new subreddits based on user activity. However, a Reddit spokesperson confirmed that the company will use Dubsmash&#8217;s technology to develop other features down the road, though not for this particular product, they said.</p>
<p>Reddit first launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/17/reddit-rolls-out-its-own-video-platform/">native video platform</a> in 2017, which allows users to upload MP4 and MOV files to the site. Then, in August 2019, it launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20812887/reddit-live-streaming-test-public-access-network-rpan-subreddit-tool">RPAN</a> (Reddit Public Access Network), which lets people livestream to selected subreddits &#8212; the most popular livestreams are promoted across the platform. Reddit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/">currently attracts</a> 50 million daily active visitors and hosts 100,000 active subreddits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automation will displace 85 million jobs while simultaneously creating 97 million new jobs by 2025, according to the World Economic Forum. Although that sounds like good news, the hard reality is that millions of people will have to retrain in the jobs of the future.</p>
<p>A number of startups are addressing these problems of employee skills, and are looking at talent development, neuroscience-based assessments and prediction technologies for staffing. These include Pymetrics (raised $56.6 million), Eightfold (raised $396.8 million) and EmPath (raised $1 million). But this sector is by no means done yet.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Either the neoinsurance companies' long-term models will come to fruition thanks to large cash balances providing runway to prove their point, or Wall Street is correct -- they were always overvalued.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been an awful week for public neoinsurance companies. A subsector of the larger insurtech world, neoinsurance providers tackled a number of insurance categories using a blend of modern app design and machine learning in hopes of creating more user-friendly and profitable insurance products.</p>
<p>The idea proved attractive to venture capitalists, who invested in a host of companies working on the problem space. And it went so well that in the last year or so we saw a number of U.S. neoinsurance companies go public.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>That&#8217;s the extent of the good news. Since the IPOs and SPAC combinations that took MetroMile, Hippo, Lemonade and Root public, the group has seen their values either <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/24/should-we-be-worried-about-insurtech-valuations/">decline sharply</a> below their initial trading prices or far under their recent highs.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve covered some of these declines in recent weeks and wondered if we should be worried about neoinsurance valuations and how they may impact startups. This morning, we&#8217;re examining what happened to neoinsurance companies this week, why, and which startups could be impacted.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Grounding our work is an interview that The Exchange held with <a href="https://ir.joinroot.com/board-member/director-1">Root CEO Alex Timm</a> in the wake of his company&#8217;s earnings report. It&#8217;s a pretty illustrative example of where the sector finds itself today: Flush, busy and somewhat unloved.</p>
<h2>Recent declines</h2>
<p>Measuring from last Friday&#8217;s closing price to yesterday&#8217;s, here&#8217;s a digest of where the market is for public neoinsurance companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hippo: -20%.</li>
<li>MetroMile: -30%.</li>
<li>Root: -23%.</li>
<li>Lemonade: -6%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Declines from recent highs are more extreme for several of the now-public neoinsurance companies, something that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/a-lot-of-cash-and-little-love-an-insurtech-story/?tpcc=ECTW2020">discussed last Friday</a>. The point we made then has only become more acute. We could add names to this list, like Oscar Health, but health insurance feels sufficiently distinct from the above companies that I don&#8217;t want to muddy the waters.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new in all of this is that the value of some of these companies is getting close to their cash balance. Or more simply, they are trending toward basement-level enterprise values. Here&#8217;s the data:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Argentine personal finance management app Ualá announced it has raised $350 million in a Series D round at a post-money valuation of $2.45 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank Latin America Fund</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and affiliates of China-based Tencent co-led the round, which included participation from a slew of existing backers, including funds managed by Soros Fund Management LLC, funds managed by affiliates of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Ribbit Capital, Greyhound Capital, Monashees and Endeavor Catalyst. New funds, such as D1 Capital Partners and 166 2nd, also put money in the round in addition to angel investors such as Jacqueline Reses and Isaac Lee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round is believed to be the largest private raise ever by an Argentinian company and brings Ualá’s total raised to $544 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder and CEO Pierpaolo Barbieri, a Buenos Aires native and Harvard University graduate, has said his ambition was to create a platform that would bring all financial services into one app linked to one card.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="https://www.uala.com.ar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ualá</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says it has developed “a complete financial ecosystem,” including universal accounts, a global Mastercard card, bill payment options, investment products, personal loans, installments (BNPL) and insurance. It has also launched merchant acquiring, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ualá Bis,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a solution for entrepreneurs and merchants that allows selling through a payment link or mobile point-of-sales (mPOS). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has issued more than 3.5 million cards in its home country and in Mexico, where it launched operations last year. The company claims that more than 22% of 18 to 25-year-olds in Argentina have a Ualá card. At the time of its Series C raise in November 2019, it had issued 1.3 million cards.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2189559" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2189559" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2189559 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ualá-2-e1628867223791.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" /><p id="caption-attachment-2189559" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ualá</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 1 million users invest in the mutual fund available on the Ualá app, which the company claims is the second largest mutual fund in Argentina in number of participants. The company, which has aimed to provide more financial transparency and inclusion in the region, says that 65% of its users had no credit history prior to downloading the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ualá plans to use its new capital to continue expanding within Latin America, develop new business verticals and do some hiring, with the plan of having 1,500 employees by year’s end. It currently has more than 1,000 employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are most impressed by Ualá&#8217;s ambition and execution. Our investment will propel the next stage of their vision, furthering a regional ecosystem that can make financial services more accessible and transparent across LatAm,” said Marcelo Claure, CEO of SoftBank Group International and COO of SoftBank Group, in a written statement.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>Our beloved<a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton"> Danny</a> was back, joining <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> to chat through yet another incredibly busy week. As a window into our process, every week we tell one another that the <em>next</em> week we&#8217;ll cut the show down to size. Then the week is so interesting that we end up cutting a lot of news, but also keeping a lot of news. The chaotic process is a work in progress, but it means that the end result is always what we decided we can&#8217;t not talk about.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>A little URL to IRL update from Natasha, who just got back<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1425532382216527874"> from an edtech conference</a>.</li>
<li>How <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/atv-venture-capital-ransomware/">one VC got hit by ransomware,</a> and why stolen LP data could be a wake-up call for investors.</li>
<li>The crew chatted through some <a href="https://www.bvp.com/atlas/the-cloud-100-benchmarks-report?from=feature">Cloud 100 numbers</a>, and riffed for a minute on Figma, Gusto and Mailchimp, companies all reportedly worth around the $10 billion mark.</li>
<li>From the early-stage funding round side of things, we noodled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/surfside-a-marketing-technology-for-the-cannabis-space-inhales-4-million/">on Surfside&#8217;s $4 million raise</a>, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/pave-gets-y-combinator-to-back-better-startup-compensation-tools-again/">capital that Pave recently attracted</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/felt-raised-4-5-million-to-get-you-to-think-in-maps/">Felt also raised money</a> to make maps more mainstream, which had us thinking about use cases galore.</li>
<li>In unicorn-land, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/turkeys-first-decacorn-trendyol-raises-1-5b-at-a-16-5b-valuation/">Trendyol raised a mountain of cash</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/india-upgrad-enters-unicorn-club-with-185-million-fundraise/">UpGrad became India&#8217;s newest unicorn</a>.</li>
<li>Climate change is going to mean lots more companies need to handle disaster prep, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/following-the-ipccs-report-we-need-more-technology-to-respond-to-more-disasters/">Danny argues</a>. His recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/rapidsos-ec1/">EC-1 here about RapidSOS </a>got into the deep and complex world of three simple numbers: 911.</li>
<li>And we ended the show with a riff on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/salesforce-wants-salesforce-to-be-the-netflix-of-biz-content/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Salesforce+</a>, which we had fun with but also tried to take seriously because we are journalists after all.</li>
