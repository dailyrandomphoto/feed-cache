										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese space startup Astroscale has raised $109 million in a new Series F round of financing, brining the company&#8217;s total funding raised to date to $300 million. The company specializes in on-orbit servicing technology, designed to help reduce the amount of debris that exists in operating orbital altitudes, and also to extend the life of existing satellites as a means of making orbital businesses more sustainable.</p>
<p>This new funding, led by Japan&#8217;s THE FUND and including participation from investors including Seraphim Space, brings Astroscale&#8217;s total funding to $300 million. The startup&#8217;s CEO and founder Nobu Okada said in a press release that the new funds will help them scale and &#8220;dramatically accelerate [their] ability to make on-orbit servicing routine by 2030.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a big year for Astroscale (Okada will be joining us on stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL5fb8xAiw2k3zgvdb5qacvfitrBmeHyPiKqy0Z9UbQBUXt0MyqNULLcLzpjDwtf1p1b0gyhxOOtgnk0KF2bAFKh4XLjwhur7TRCL07FOJvQmEQ9nmFs41kYDrdHsYO_auHC1k6r1LyLym5ZwiSu_YfqDbbDHHLR6QEN3O5tf6ox">TC Sessions: Space 2021 this year</a>, by the way), with a successful tech demo of its end-of-life services product in August.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber will halt its ride-hailing service in most of Belgium tomorrow following a court ruling Wednesday that extends a 2015 order banning its p2p UberPop service to also cover professional drivers providing its ride-hailing service.</p>
<p>Uber told us that it is studying the detail of the ruling to decide whether to appeal the decision with the country&#8217;s Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The move also follows a temporary suspension of Uber&#8217;s service in Brussels<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uber-temporarily-suspends-brussels-service-first-europe-2021-09-30/"> in September</a> &#8212; an action the tech giant called &#8220;exceptional and unprecedented&#8221;, saying it was only taking the step to protest the lack of reform of rules which prohibit drivers from using smartphones.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239658" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Following the ruling by the Brussels Appeal Court this week, private hire vehicle drivers have also been <a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels-2/195102/uber-demonstration-closes-off-brussels-tunnels/">blocking a major tunnel</a> in the Belgian capital.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a statement on Friday&#8217;s looming shutdown, Uber&#8217;s country chief, Laurent Slits, once again attacked the Belgian government for not delivering a reform it&#8217;s been lobbying for, writing: “This decision was made based on outdated regulations written in a time before smartphones, which the government has promised and failed to reform for the last seven years.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-24/uber-in-brussels-faces-friday-partial-shutdown-after-ruling?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google">Bloomberg</a>, which reported on Uber&#8217;s shutdown earlier, it will not apply to a small number of drivers who are licensed in a Flemish region of the country &#8212; and who will therefore still be allowed to use the app.</p>
<p>Uber confirmed the Appeal Court ruling only affects drivers with Brussels licences.</p>
<p>In the statement, Slits added that the tech giant is &#8220;deeply concerned&#8221; about the 2,000 holders of LVC licenses (aka rental car with driver licences) who he said will &#8220;lose their ability to generate earnings [via Uber&#8217;s platform] from Friday&#8221;.</p>
<p>That phrasing &#8212; &#8220;generate earnings&#8221; &#8212; refers to the fact Uber does not employ drivers directly in Belgium; instead it classifies them as independent contractors. So it cannot claim that 2,000 &#8216;jobs&#8217; are about to be lost since it does not provide employment contracts to the LVC drivers in question in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We urge the government to move quickly to reform the taxi and LVC sector once and for all so that drivers can continue working to provide for their families,” Slits added.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-bans-uber-drivers-from-picking-up-rides-through-the-app/">March</a> the local government in Brussels banned Uber drivers from picking up rides via smartphones and geolocation.</p>
<p>Since then Uber drivers in the city have been operating in a legal grey zone &#8212; where they risk sanctions by continuing to drive using its app. However the company suggests drivers have been given mixed messages, claiming authorities are sometimes telling drivers &#8212; in private &#8212; that they can continue driving.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Uber called the government&#8217;s March order &#8220;mistaken&#8221; &#8212; pointing out that it had promised a reform of the law before the summer. Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uber-temporarily-suspends-brussels-service-first-europe-2021-09-30/">Reuters</a>, a draft law to reform the rules was set out by the Belgian government in September. But, according to Uber, the sector as a whole has yet to see the text.</p>
<p>Uber suggested there is widespread backing in Belgium for reforming the 1995 rules &#8212; not just from LVC drivers who serve customers via its platform but also from traditional taxi firms.</p>
<p>However local taxi firms in Brussels have their own reform ideas &#8212; and have also said they are keen to poach Uber drivers to plug a shortage of taxi drivers.</p>
<p>A sector spokesman recently told <a href="https://www.taxipro.be/ondernemen/2021/09/14/uber-chauffeurs-als-antwoord-op-tekort-taxichauffeurs-brussel/?gdpr=accept&amp;gdpr=accept">TaxiPro</a> there&#8217;s a shortfall of 600+ taxi drivers in the capital which could be filled by LVC holders that have been driving for Uber.</p>
<p>“The big advantage is that we offer a solution to these Uber drivers,” Sam Bouchal told the publication in September [translated to English via Google Translate], saying that the Uber drivers could be offered permanent contracts, and adding: &#8220;We&#8217;re getting them out of illegality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bouchal also told TaxiPro that the taxi sector wants to avoid what he couched as &#8220;a social massacre.&#8221;</p>
<p>Concern over gig working conditions has been a fiery topic across Europe for years, leading to scores of legal challenges &#8212; and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/blow-to-uber-in-europe-as-top-court-rules-its-a-transport-service/">2017 ruling by Europe&#8217;s top court</a> that Uber is a transport service and so cannot simply dodge local taxi regulations.</p>
<p>In the UK, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">Uber was also recently been forced to recognize drivers as workers</a> after losing the last of a long line of employment challenges at the country&#8217;s Supreme Court.</p>
<p>However, in Belgium &#8212; a core centre of power for the European Commission &#8212; the ride-hailing giant is continuing to lobby for favorably changes to the law to grease the engines of its platform business.</p>
<p>Uber is also lobbying the Commission to address ride-hailing regulations across the bloc&#8217;s single market in an upcoming <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12916-Sustainable-transport-new-urban-mobility-framework_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12916-Sustainable-transport-new-urban-mobility-framework_en&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637916941304000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2CuSdq_DOgkYbFhLrJViqg">urban mobility framework</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8212; which the EU exec has said it wants to support the development of urban transport systems that are &#8220;safe, accessible, inclusive, affordable, smart, resilient and emission-free&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>Uber&#8217;s hope here is that EU lawmakers will seek to apply rules that override city level regulations &#8212; setting a pan-EU enabling framework for ride-hailing services which would mean it could just ignore local authority demands.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How four European cities are embracing micromobility to drive out cars&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars/embed/#?secret=Au8JSMczWf" data-secret="Au8JSMczWf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However the Commission has also said it wants the urban mobility framework to tackle &#8220;transport pollution and congestion&#8221; &#8212; so it&#8217;s not clear how removing regulatory barriers to ride-hailing would be anything other than counterproductive on that front.</p>
<p>Cars remain the least efficient way to transport people around dense urban environments given how much space they require and how relatively few people can be moved around in the space occupied by a single car vs a train, bus, cycling, scooting, walking etc. The rise of micromobility has also fuelled the range of available car alternatives &#8212; so the arguments in favor of cars in cities are shrinking rapidly.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has also led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars/">a number of European cities</a> to dial up their focus on transforming street infrastructure to be more pedestrian and locally focused, also leveraging the rise of micromobility to enact policies that deliberately de-emphasize the car. Simply put, cleaner air and more vibrant local streets (and<a href="https://twitter.com/zachklein/status/1450113164775870468"> school bike trains</a>) are hard to argue against.</p>
<p>While Brussels has not been at the forefront of those developments the city has been <a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/57902/a-campaign-in-brussels-to-reduce-the-number-of-cars-entering-and-leaving-the-city/">seeking to reduce the number of cars</a> on its infamously congested, <a href="https://epha.org/brussels-inhabitants-testify-how-air-pollution-impacts-their-health/">pollution-smogged</a> roads in recent years. So Belgium&#8217;s government may well have reason to pause and consider the implications of any ride-hailing reforms.</p>
<p>In parallel, the European Commission has been working on another legislation initiative &#8212; which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">wants to improve conditions for platform workers</a> across the bloc, responding to high levels of concern over factors such as the lack of job security and precarious earnings.</p>
<p>On that front Uber has also been busy lobbying &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">stands accused</a> of pushing EU lawmakers to reduce standards for platform workers, with critics saying it&#8217;s seeking to replicate its success in overturning a California law that had sought to classify gig workers as employees.</p>
<p>So the street-level battle for Europe&#8217;s social contract is very real.</p>

<p>The Berlin-based foodtech company is poised to debut its chicken-less egg product in the first quarter of 2022 in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Today, the company announced it raised $2.8 million in its first funding round to aid the initial launch and then expand further in Europe later in 2022.</p>
<p>Backers in the round include EVIG Group, Stray Dog Capital, E2JDJ, Tet Ventures, Good Seed Ventures, Sustainable Food Ventures and Shio Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239291" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Perfeggt CEO Tanja Bogumil co-founded the company, which is part of Lovely Day Foods GmbH, earlier this year with Gary Lin, EVIG’s founder and CEO, and Bernd Becker, who was a long-time head of R&amp;D for Rügenwalder Mühle, a German vegetarian and vegan meat maker.</p>

<p>“I really believe we deserve better food,” Bogumil told TechCrunch. “My mother’s family is from an agriculture background in small-scale farming, so I have always been conscious of where the food we eat comes from. I turned vegetarian at 12 when my uncle brought me to a slaughterhouse to show me that the sausages I ate were not made the right way. I didn’t fully get what was happening there, but it didn’t feel right or humane.”</p>
<p>Unlike dairy, where there is already sustainability, she believes the egg is still largely untapped. Sure, there are companies making similar plant-based alternatives, like Simply Eggless and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/eat-just-the-alt-protein-company-formerly-known-as-hampton-creek-has-raised-another-200-million/">Just Eat, which raised $200 million</a> earlier in the summer, but worldwide, <a href="https://ew-nutrition.com/us/how-producers-keep-the-egg-supply-chain-going-amid-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1.3 trillion eggs are produced annually</a>, meaning there is room to grow, and applications are versatile, Bogumil said.</p>
<p>Perfeggt’s first plant-based egg product is a protein-rich liquid alternative made from fava beans. It can be prepared as a scrambled egg or omelet in the pan. The company will initially be launching its product with food service organizations.</p>
<p>As with all food, taste is king, and with this product, the co-founders worked to create similar mouth feel, sensory, flavors and textures — all elements that Bogumil says are needed to get people to switch to a plant-based equivalent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This is something we spent time on figuring out,” she added. “Our product is built around the fava bean, which is very suited to mimic functionality required for these applications.”</p>
<p>To do this, Perfeggt’s R&amp;D site in Emsland, Germany works closely with Wageningen University &amp; Research, known for its life sciences research, to test plant-based protein sources and their combinations that come closest to the nutritional and functional properties of animal products.</p>
<p>The new funding enables the company to build out its team at its headquarters and R&amp;D facility. The company is currently hiring for food scientists, marketing and R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bogumil believes that more companies coming into the egg alternative space will help Perfeggt’s mission to shift people to plant-based foods.</p>
<p>“This is not a one-winner-takes-all market,” she said. “We have never in history seen alternative proteins be so close to the mainstream market. Clearly that is reflected in the capital markets, and not just for developing niche markets, but for the future of food.”</p>
<p>“We are incredibly impressed by the team&#8217;s rapid technological progress in developing next-generation alternative proteins and finding solutions that improve human, planetary and animal health,” Stephanie Dorsey, founding partner at E2JDJ, added in a written statement. “The egg market is a massive opportunity and this is just the beginning.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria’s informal trade sector, worth over $244 billion, has more than 40 million micro, small and medium businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these businesses operated offline until a few years ago when startups brought about digitization by providing infrastructure and a gamut of e-commerce and financial services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One-year-old <a href="https://www.sabi.am/">Sabi</a> &#8212; a spinoff from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/nigerias-rensource-raises-20m-to-power-african-markets-by-solar/">Rensource</a>, an African energy company that offers power-as-a-service to customers &#8212; is the latest startup to raise funds to serve the informal sector. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised a $6 million bridge round led by pan-African VC firm CRE Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239606" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi’s bridge round is coming a year after closing a $2 million seed round from CRE Ventures, Janngo Capital, Atlantica Ventures and Waarde Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/aadesina">Ademola Adesina</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anu-adasolum-46754a19/">Anu Adasolum</a> have been at the helm of Rensource since the company started in 2015; Adesina as founder and CEO and Adasolum, COO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By providing these small and medium businesses with power, the team at Rensource began to look into other pain points these SMEs had and find ways to add value beyond energy provision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the pandemic halting Rensource’s business, the team had time to develop this concept which became Sabi in October 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adasolum leads Sabi’s efforts as founder and CEO following the company’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">branch out in March, while Adesina</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> holds a co-founder and director role. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigeria’s Rensource raises $20M to power African markets by solar&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/nigerias-rensource-raises-20m-to-power-african-markets-by-solar/embed/#?secret=lHWrgkoSul" data-secret="lHWrgkoSul" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi is an attempt at platforming the informal sector and African trade via various online and offline channels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This means that Sabi tries to complement the middlemen (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> distributors) in the B2B e-commerce retail chain rather than replace them, a model familiar with other prominent B2B e-commerce retail startups such as Sokowatch, MaxAB TradeDepot and Twiga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not trying to be, you know, a tech-enabled digital distributor. We’re not trying to disintermediate a market full of hyper-specialization where one of the defining characteristics of the informal sector is you have all these middlemen and agents performing a very narrow role,” Adesina said to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that specialization is important for the sector to work </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">properly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; whether it’s aggregation, making a sale, knowing the customer especially well, all these middlemen play a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">key role. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the way we deal with them is we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">give them a set of tools and an infrastructure they can run their business on to make it more optimized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi caters to the needs of manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers and classifies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them as merchants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company operates an asset-light model and doesn’t own vehicles, warehouses or goods. But it provides visibility into these assets across the entire value chain from the demand and supply side and controls on a single platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running this model exempts Sabi from the constraints a typical B2B e-commerce retail platform might face when acting as a distributor for manufacturers to retailers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, asset-heavy platforms can’t move goods from two different suppliers in the same truck or use the same salespeople when distributing goods from different suppliers to retailers. On</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other hand,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sabi doesn’t have such constraints, so whereas other platforms try to standardize operations around goods offtake, Sabi concentrates </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on offtake monitoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We focus our processes, policies and monitoring around understanding the different types of users and monitoring how the third parties we work with are serving them,” said CEO Adasolum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a result, the net experience of each off-taker is different and it works more for their particular business type</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I’m not going to go to a business that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to working a particular way and change it but instead offer several other channels that they’re more comfortable with through our platform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These channels include offline agents, call centres, merchant partners, supplier centres and mobile app. Each stakeholder can access tools around inventory management, sales, tracking, digital invoices, analytics on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re starting with what makes them comfortable, not what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is best,” the CEO added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merchants on Sabi deal with FMCG goods and products in other sectors such as agriculture, electronics and chemicals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The category-agnostic platform is home to more than 175,000 merchants who have made B2B transactions totalling over $200 million annualized GMV run rate. And more than 10,000 agents serve these merchants on Sabi’s network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi makes money by taking a transaction fee when any merchants perform any sale on the marketplace</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company also earns a margin for providing financing to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adesina said in Q1 2022, Sabi plans to roll out a subscription model where agents will pay a monthly fee to access a reseller model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in Sabi’s pipeline is providing manufacturers with visibility and data-backed insights and direct engagement down the value chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing an average of 40% month on month in Nigeria, Sabi intends to replicate its rapid growth in other African countries Kenya and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company opened shop in Kenya last month and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made a few hires in South Africa, intending to go live early next year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another round of funding, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Series A, might </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">close in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time to fuel the company’s expansion into both countries, Adesina said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pardon Makumbe, co-founder and managing partner of CRE Venture Capital, in a statement emphasizing why his firm doubled down on its investment under a year said, “Sabi’s online and offline approach to serving informal businesses, combined with the quality of its platform and service provider curation, has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taken root in Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is on track to be one of the fastest-growing African companies of 2021 and is showing no signs of slowing down</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi’s growth, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to market demand, comes from the background of its founders. Before Sabi and Rensource, CEO Adasolum worked at Jumia, where she was in charge of offline sales for some African countries: Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has also performed commercial operations and merchant acquisition roles for the African e-commerce giant. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adesina too has vast experience working with multinationals such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Capricorn Investment Group, the Rockefeller Foundation and JP Morgan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adesina is confident that the digitization of offline processes for B2B e-commerce retail will continue despite questions about why many players exist in the space. And he believes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as more startups come into the market, more venture capital will follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabi’s monthly GMV numbers is one reason the co-founder has this conviction.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, the company claims to be on the verge of processing about $12 million monthly GMV</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Jumia, Africa’s biggest e-commerce player, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/jumia-posts-revenue-and-order-gains-but-compounding-losses-drag-its-stock-lower/">records this volume </a>on average after five years in operation, it has taken Sabi less than a year to achieve this feat which can be attributed to the size of the country&#8217;s informal B2B e-commerce retail market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The kind of data we’re seeing now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like real-time visibility into whether people like this product or that product, that stuff is gonna </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accrue</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and grow </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the next a few years,” the co-founder said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the same way one saw in China in the late 90s the kind of hyper digitalization of what was a very informal economy, I see that happening faster in Africa than most people realize. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s something people don’t realize how </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s going to happen.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.pyxo.fr">Pyxo</a>, a French startup that has been thinking a lot about single-use plastic food packaging for the past three years. The company wants to offer a service that makes it as easy and as cost-efficient to use reusable food storage containers at scale.</p>
<p>The idea behind Pyxo comes from a fair at the Tuileries gardens in Paris. Right next to the food stands, waste bins were overflowing with soda cups, clamshell burger containers and various single-use food packaging.</p>
<p>At first, the company started working with French corporate catering service company <a href="https://www.sodexo.com">Sodexo</a>. They worked with them to replace plastic cups and make everything reusable. Due to the coronavirus pandemic and the switch to remote work, Pyxo started looking for other potential clients.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239326" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They have started working with <a href="https://www.foodles.co">Foodles</a>, <a href="https://popchef.com">Popchef</a> and other foodtech companies that offer connected fridges with packed lunches and snacks.</p>
<p>But Pyxo’s biggest market opportunity comes from a regulatory change. In July 2020, France’s parliament passed an anti-waste law with some drastic changes. Restaurants have to switch to reusable food containers by January 2023.</p>
<p>It means that fast food restaurant chains won’t be able to use paper-and-plastic cups, disposable clamshell boxes, etc. Pyxo is already working with an unnamed fast food chain in France to help them switch to reusable packaging.</p>
<p>The startup has created a sort of marketplace of reusable food containers that connect every company in the industry. When a fast food restaurant buy a batch of containers, they all come with a QR code or NFC chip to track them everywhere.</p>
<p>Restaurants can outsource cleaning to specialized companies who can give you a batch of clean containers when they come and pick up the containers of the day. These contracting companies also scan containers, cups and whatever they are cleaning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to that, customers could also order take-out food and bring it home in reusable containers. They could use an app to find the nearest collection point — it doesn’t necessarily have to be the restaurant where you originally ordered your food. Pyxo is thinking about gamification and small deposits to incentivize returns.</p>
<p>“Our vision is that it’s an infrastructure industry,” co-founder and CEO Benjamin Peri told me. Pyxo thinks it is building a network that works just like the electrical grid. Down the road, the startup believes there will be a dense network of restaurants, collection points and cleaning centers.</p>
<p>Fast food chains could help kickstart the industry because a single client has a ton of restaurants around the country. They could incentivize other actors to participate in the network with Pyxo acting as the network operator.</p>
<p>The company is just getting started as there are only a few restaurants actively using Pyxo right now. But the startup has raised a $7.9 million (€7 million) funding round from Eurazeo, FiveSeasons Ventures and others.</p>
<p>On January 1st, 2023, the startup expects to work with 2,000 points of sales in the restaurant industry alone. Pyxo still expects to work with foodtech companies and corporate catering services, but they would represent a smaller part of the business. With today’s funding round, the company expects to recruit 70 additional employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.camlist.com/">Camlist</a>, a video marketplace for pets, has raised $1.3 million in a pre-seed round, funding that the startup plans to use to develop its platform and grow its workforce &#8212; as it looks to expand its reach in the UK, its second market (after the U.A.E.), which it entered earlier this year.</p>
<p>Unlike other marketplaces, Camlist (derived from camera listing) allows sellers to list videos of the pets they wish to sell, and once contact is made, the buyer and seller can engage through both video and text-chat within the app.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/peek-raises-80m-as-its-travel-experiences-software-and-marketplace-business-passes-2b-in-bookings/">marketplace</a> currently only allows the listing of pets, but it is set to diversify to other items in the near future.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239588" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Classifieds, or peer to peer commerce in general, has been stuck in the same old way of operation since eBay showed up. There has not been real significant innovation ever since; it&#8217;s just listings, maybe some images and phone numbers,” said Camlist co-founder and chief executive officer, Moustafa Mahmoud.</p>
<p>“But at Camlist we are changing that. We are turning the marketplace into a video experience because every pre-owned item has a story.”</p>
<p>Mahmoud said that they are building the safest way for anyone to find a pet by also ensuring verified health checks and interest free financing, in partnership with third parties, for those unable to make one-off payments. Camlist has rehomed over 6,000 pets to date.</p>
<p>“Our in-app GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) has been growing 100% every two quarters, so we&#8217;re doubling every quarter, and our total GMV is around $2 million a month,” said Mahmoud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Y Combinator company was founded and launched in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/uae-b2b-e-commerce-site-dubuy-targets-africa-for-growth/">Dubai, U.A.E</a>, last year, just before Covid pandemic hit. The launch turned out to be timely and the site grew popular as people, forced to stay home, bought their own pets &#8212; partly to deal with boredom, but also because they had the time to nurture them.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re building the marketplace category by category, and we just feel that the pets listing is so huge, and also very underserved. We plan to expand into different items as we grow,” said Mahmoud, who is also a computer scientist.</p>
<p>Other co-founders include <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maharefai/?originalSubdomain=uk">Maha Refa</a>i, also the startup&#8217;s chief product officer, who has 16 years’ experience building and scaling digital products. She is also the creator of MBC&#8217;s (Middle East’s largest free-to-air broadcaster) premier video platform as well as other multiple video streaming products.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alsayedgamal/?originalSubdomain=eg">Alsayed Gamal</a>, who is Camlist chief technical officer, has 15 years software engineering experience. He has knowledge and experience in mobile platforms, data engineering, DevOps, API design, microservices and serverless architecture.</p>
<p>Mahmoud said the idea to start Camlist was inspired by the need to counter the bad experiences he went through while making purchases on classified sites in Dubai, U.A.E, where items were often misrepresented and scams high.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239630" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239630" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2239630 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/me3.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2239630" class="wp-caption-text">Moustafa Mahmoud; Camlist chief executive officer, he co-founded the video marketplace with Maha Refai; the startup&#8217;s chief product officer and Alsayed Gamal; chief technical officer.</p></div></p>
<p>Classifieds are popular in Dubai, an expat city, as people use them to dispose of their items, but they have also provided an opportunity for scammers to target unsuspecting people. To counter this, Camlist has an option for in-app payments &#8212; with funds released once the buyers confirm receipt of the pets. This feature ensures that buyers are not defrauded by deterring cons masquerading as vendors.</p>
<p>Mahmoud and his other co-founders provide a marketplace that allows buyers to first experience items of interest, through video, before making a purchase. This is besides ensuring that buyers were protected against fraud and guaranteeing high quality services.</p>
<p>The company also follows up with the sellers on its platform to ensure that they are breeding or keeping the pets in healthy environments, as well as vaccinating, deworming, and microchipping them.</p>
<p>“We also support our buyers and sellers by providing them with free vaccinations, microchipping, deworming, insurance, and pet food. We try to provide the best experience for our buyers and our sellers,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup raised the new funding from Y-Combinator; the technology startup accelerator, Act One Ventures; an early-stage venture fund and a number of angel investors from Houseparty, Mux and Facebook.</p>
<p>“We really looked forward to investors who believe in our vision of building the marketplace of the future. And we are really fortunate to get people who believe in this vision, and who actually work and build applications in the video industry,” said Mahmoud.</p>
<p>After achieving traction in the UK, Camlist is planning to enter the US market, which it believes is going to be a huge and important market for them.</p>
<p>“So, the current state for us is expansion within the UK because it&#8217;s a pretty big market. And we can see the impact of what we&#8217;re doing here. But as soon as we reach a certain stage where we have the majority of the market, then we will start to expand into the United States,” said Mahmoud, who was born in Egypt, with his family moving to Dubai when he was six years old.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In December 2020, Beijing laid out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">guideline</a> for Ant Group to &#8220;rectify&#8221; its business after calling off its IPO, which could have been the largest initial public offering in history. In the plan, regulators asked Ant to revamp its credit business, among other changes that would make it subject to the same set of regulations overseeing financial institutions. In other words, Ant can no longer get by with its freewheeling practices by calling itself a &#8220;tech&#8221; firm.</p>
<p>Nearly a year later, the Alibaba-affiliated fintech powerhouse showed that it has almost finished restructuring its popular consumer credit products.</p>
<p>Credit loan products contributed nearly 40% of Ant&#8217;s revenues in the six months ended June 2020, according to the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2020/1026/2020102600165.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prospectus</a> filed last year. The two main products are Huabei (Spend), which launched in 2014 for daily expenditures by consumers, working like a virtual credit card. A year later Jiebei (Borrow) was introduced as a credit product for larger consumption transactions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239625" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Under the old model, Ant originated loans that were then underwritten by third-party banks and other financial institutions. As of June 2020, about 98% of Ant&#8217;s credit balance originated through its platform was underwritten by its partner financial institutions or securitized, according to the firm&#8217;s prospectus.</p>
<p>Jiebei has split itself into two brands, users reported earlier this week. Credit lines extended by third-party banks are now called Xinyong Dai (Credit Loan) on Alipay, Ant&#8217;s flagship financial services app. Those provided by Ant&#8217;s consumer finance company, which was recently established at the behest of regulators, are staying under the Jiebei brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://weibo.com/u/5445230801?layerid=4707056739157128">Huabei has similarly started a restructuring</a>, which will show users which loans are extended independently by banks and which by Ant&#8217;s consumer finance firm. Huabei will focus on &#8220;small-ticket&#8221; everyday transactions, it <a href="https://weibo.com/5445230801/L2XzPCqbC?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in a Weibo post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Following the brand differentiation, users applying for credit loan services will have more information about their credit providers to avoid brand confusion.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Huabei also noted that it&#8217;s now submitting consumer credit information to a database overseen by China&#8217;s central bank. It <a href="https://weibo.com/5445230801/KzjHoddoe?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> the routine in September after it established its consumer credit company, which, just like banks, need to report their credit information to the central bank in China.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Whether you agree or not, it's hard to ignore the fact that the multipliers in Silicon Valley and the growth of software businesses have changed the way we think about a startup's timeline.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On a recently recorded (and soon-to-be published) episode of the <a href="https://pod.link/found">Found podcast</a>, an entrepreneur told my co-host and me that he sees a broad swath of the venture capitalists out there as money managers, more focused on short-term gains and returns than long-term revolutionary technology.</p>
<p>Whether you agree or not, it&#8217;s hard to ignore the fact that the multipliers in Silicon Valley and the growth of software businesses have changed the way we think about a startup&#8217;s timeline.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;The pressure from [Index] caused us to work a little harder and be a little bit more precise in our instrumentation to be able to prove that the long-term trajectory would achieve certain milestones that would work for everybody.&#8221;							<cite>Jessica McKellar</cite>
					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/pilot/">Pilot</a>, a bookkeeping software service that has raised more than $160 million since inception, is not necessarily a stranger to the shorter-term desires of investors. Index Ventures partner Mark Goldberg, who led the Series A and Series B rounds for the startup, would be the first to tell you that the board and the founders had some early disagreements about how the company should operate.</p>
<p>Obviously, it wasn&#8217;t enough to stop him or Index from doubling down on the business.</p>
<p>We talked about all this and more on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a>.</p>
<h2>Doubling down</h2>
<p>&#8220;It was pretty terrifying,&#8221; said Goldberg. &#8220;In my gut, I thought, &#8216;Wow, we better get this right.'&#8221;</p>
<p>A few things clicked into place for Goldberg to want to keep investing in Pilot. The first was that it was a real category-creation opportunity, in that bookkeeping was a $100 billion industry that was largely fragmented.</p>
<p>The second was the customer love for the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to hear customers proactively calling us from within the Index portfolio saying that they hated doing bookkeeping and back office functions, and now they don&#8217;t have to think about it. They said things like &#8216;Whoever this Pilot team is, they&#8217;re doing some wizardry so I can just shut my brain off to the part of the business I didn&#8217;t enjoy doing.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The third was the conviction and dedication of the team to empathizing with and understanding their customers.</p>
<p>He recalled a time early on when the team was no more than 10 people, most of them engineers, when he visited the office on a weekend. They were all wearing green visors, doing bookkeeping for their customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t doing it because they needed to for customer support, but because they really wanted to empathize with the customers for the product that they were building,&#8221; said Goldberg. &#8220;That&#8217;s the sort of sweat equity and market recognition that told me, if this continues to grow, there really is no ceiling on what this business could become.&#8221;</p>
<p>While that sort of dedication to understanding the user was attractive, it was not without its costs.</p>
<h2>Counterintuitive convictions</h2>
<p>&#8220;Pilot is a technology company wrapped in this lovely human layer of high-touch support for its customers, which is a bit counter-intuitive in Silicon Valley, where most companies don&#8217;t want humans in the loop,&#8221; said Goldberg. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I know and understand, and we had a view that this sort of tech-enabled service model could be very valuable, but we wanted to make sure that they could create a financial profile that had gross margins that reflected that of a software company.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its simplest form, Jessica McKellar and her co-founders felt very strongly that they wanted to focus on the customer fully and deliver great customer service from the very beginning. In a business where you are onboarding customers by ingesting the entirety of their financials, that can be costly.</p>

Consider this more evidence of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly global startup landscape</a>.</li>

A bunch of violations, it turns out. France is now asking search engines and app stores to delist the public U.S. company.</li>

Search is finally seeing a wave of competitors, for example. Attio, now flush with $7.7 million in capital, is taking on the old-school CRM market.</li>

Asilimia just raised $2 million — half debt, half equity — to keep money flowing in its home market. Per TechCrunch reporting, the company also offers “a lifeline to traders in Kenya by enabling them to make mobile money transactions that are devoid of transfer charges through its Leja app.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/nigerias-onepipe-raises-3-5m-to-double-down-on-its-embedded-finance-offering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OnePipe raises $3.5M for its fintech API business:</strong></a> Plaid is a big deal in its domestic market, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t related startups executing similar work around the world. OnePipe is one such company, bringing fintech infra APIs to Africa. And now it has a pile of new funds to continue its work.</li>

A chip shortage has made used cars more pricey than ever. And now Indian startup Spinny has shifted into unicorn territory with a new $280 million round. There are related companies in the U.S. market that have gone public, so Spinny is operating in a market that we understand. Let’s see how its economics bear out.</li>

Regardless, there’s a startup called Juicy Marbles out there hoping to create “plant-based whole meat cuts.” I am in favor of the product and the company’s goals. But Juicy Marbles?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Japan has been the birthplace of traditional arts and crafts since ancient times. Craftmanship, meticulous attention to detail and balance of design and functionality have contributed to creating unique Japanese products like pottery, traditional fabrics, washi (paper), woodwork, glasses, bento-boxes and more. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This craftsmanship continues to be passed along from generation to generation and live on in modern Japan. However, the craftsmen and women, who do not always have the skills or tools to be influential merchants, have often been left behind in the rapidly evolving business environment in the 21st century. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In recent years, a growing number of e-commerce entrepreneurs have started to develop their own products and brands in response to a shift in consumer demand from cheap, mass-produced goods to diversified products that meet one’s unique needs and lifestyle. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239178" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://www.forest-inc.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forest</a>, a Japanese e-commerce aggregator, seeks to identify sustainable, high-quality products and brands that embrace the spirit of Japan </span>and help them grow and enter the global market by using the power of technology.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Forest announced today it has raised approximately $8 million (900 million yen) of seed round led by <a href="https://www.ut-ec.co.jp/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners (UTEC)</a> and <a href="https://nordstar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nordstar Partners</a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup will use the new capital to acquire more than 300 Japanese e-commerce brands that have been carefully crafted and curated by entrepreneurs. Forest will apply digital marketing strategies at scale, optimize sales and enhance inventory planning through data analytics, as well as support cross-border e-commerce expansion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Forest is currently in the process of finalizing its first acquisition. It will continue to look for brands that generate sales between $1 million and $5 million and target to acquire companies with more than $10 million of sales next year, said CEO of Forest <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shingo-yuhara-74075060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shingo Yuhara</a> told TechCrunch. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It also plans to raise around $20 million to $30 million debt and equity capital of Series A, targeting the first half of 2022, Yuhara said.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Forest looks at marketplaces, including Amazon, Rakuten, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://zozo.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Zozotown</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Yahoo Japan sellers, Shopify and more. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“[The] investment into Forest is one of our largest seed round investments within the IT sector. In my previous life, I managed my family-owned apparel business and personally experienced the pains and limitations of a small business. I strongly believe that Forest can solve these problems and capitalize on the potential of these businesses through the power of technology,&#8221; said partner of UTEC Hiroyuki Sakamoto. &#8220;We look forward to working with the experienced Founders who seek to challenge this attractive market opportunity and we feel privileged to participate as co-lead investor.”   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We are excited to be investing in Forest that is well-positioned to take advantage of the large opportunity in acquiring and scaling niche brands in Japan,” said managing partner Ole Ruch of Nordstar. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As crypto proponents look to onboard a new generation of users, one of the major consumer onramps has been a host of consumer wallet apps with slick interfaces.</p>
<p>Today, Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1463589935085142020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it is bringing on the team from <a href="https://brd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRD</a> &#8212; a crypto wallet startup that first launched its mobile wallet back in 2014. While the team is transitioning over to Coinbase, BRD&#8217;s co-founders say nothing will be changing for BRD users for the time being, and that their wallets will continue to operate normally and that user &#8220;funds are safe and secure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wallet startup was an early player in the mobile crypto wallet space that started as a place for users to store bitcoin, but grew to support a wide network of tokens and the ability to buy, sell and swap cryptocurrencies thanks to partnerships with exchanges. The startup claims to have more than 10 million users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239511" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The team brings deep expertise in self-custody for crypto wallets, which will help Wallet enable more people to safely and securely access the decentralized world of crypto,&#8221; a <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1463589935085142020?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> from the Coinbase Wallet Twitter account reads.</p>
<p>BRD raised a hefty amount of venture capital funding, banking nearly $55 million in venture funding from firms like SBI Crypto Investment and East Ventures.</p>
<p>Coinbase and BRD did not reveal terms of the acqui-hire.</p>
<p>Co-founder Adam Traidman and Aaron Voisine note that they plan to build out a &#8220;migration path&#8221; for users to transfer their wallet contents to the Coinbase Wallet app but that it will be entirely optional for users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. We’re just starting to roll out this year’s gift guides, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/gift-guide-2021/">check back from now until the end of December for more</a>! </em></p>
<p>It is, somehow, that time again! Thanksgiving is hours away, which means it&#8217;s time to figure out what, if anything, you want to buy on Black Friday.</p>
<p><em>Should</em> you buy anything on Black Friday? It depends. Some people are able to make a game out of it and save a stack on things they were going to buy anyway. Others end up getting fleeced by sales that aren&#8217;t really sales or end-of-life TVs repackaged under new model numbers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239483" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There definitely <em>are</em> deals to be found, of course — you&#8217;ve just gotta be smart about it. Some of the things we like to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buying stuff you already wanted, at a discount? Good. Buying stuff you didn&#8217;t want, just because it&#8217;s maybe cheaper? Not so good.</li>
<li>Make sure that thing you&#8217;re buying is <em>actually on sale</em>, and that they didn&#8217;t just hike the price up temporarily yesterday for the sake of &#8220;discounts&#8221; today. Historical price trackers like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">camelcamelcamel</a> can help with that.</li>
<li>Check the model number on anything you&#8217;re buying. If you can&#8217;t find any trace of it older than a few weeks, something fishy might be going on.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all that said, here are some of the generally good deals we&#8217;ve found around the web — the stuff that&#8217;s solid, battle-tested and that we&#8217;d probably recommend at <em>full</em> price. We&#8217;ll be adding more throughout the week as we find them.</p>

<p>Not too long ago, discounts on Apple gear were a rare sight — nowadays, though, it&#8217;s not too tough to at least save a couple bucks.</p>
<p>For example: Amazon&#8217;s got the latest non-pro AirPods <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JQL3NWT/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B09JQL3NWT&amp;linkId=ae3965bc1d8487dd562f245dfd98c907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $155</a> (usually $179), the AirPod Pros <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JQMJHXY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B09JQMJHXY&amp;linkId=7eeebf9831bb39c5ac40ffb1a4ed099f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $159</a> (usually $190+) and the over ear AirPods Max <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PZHYWJS/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08PZHYWJS&amp;linkId=4ba59eabbaee9a54bebfed47a7ba0194" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $429</a> (from $549)</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s also got the best iPad Pro deal we&#8217;ve found so far, taking anywhere from $100 to $150 off the 2021 12.9&#8243; model — so <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0932D45W8/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0932D45W8&amp;linkId=aafcca709f116db06b542ef2b24f5547" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$999 for the 128 GB base model</a>, for example, instead of $1099.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2046659" style="width: 2890px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2046659" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2046659 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apple-watch-se.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2046659" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Best Buy has the generally more budget-friendly 40 mm Apple Watch SE <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-se-gps-40mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-space-gray/5706649.p?skuId=5706649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marked down to $219</a>, normally $279. If you&#8217;re looking for the latest and greatest Apple Watch, your best bet is probably Amazon again, where the Series 7 has been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HDXS1DM/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B09HDXS1DM&amp;linkId=04e8fb151f3a45d5a638b18359b1776a">cut down to $379</a> instead of $399 — but know that inventory seems limited and you might not get the color/band you want.</p>
<p>Big discounts on M1 Macs seem rare right now — which makes sense, as they&#8217;re still relatively new. When they do pop up, stock seems to be limited or shipping is delayed well into next year. Apple will be giving out $100 gift cards with the purchase of eligible Macs (which, sadly, appears to exclude the 14&#8243; and 16&#8243; M1 MacBook Pros) but that deal seemingly doesn&#8217;t start until the actual morning of Black Friday</p>

<p>Amazon usually does pretty deep discounts on its own gear for Black Friday, and that&#8217;s holding true this year.</p>
<p>The 4K Fire TV stick, for example, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XVYZ1Y5/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08XVYZ1Y5&amp;linkId=bb5170f404a23e8cf5d08594c0aa94c6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $25</a> (normally $50).</p>
<p>Their latest-gen Kindle, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FRJLSFL/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07FRJLSFL&amp;linkId=95218459756e8c8172572f663f504d31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $70</a> (normally $110) if you buy the version that doesn&#8217;t come with ads splashed around the interface. If you don&#8217;t mind the ads, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DPMXZZ7/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07DPMXZZ7&amp;linkId=d277e71c19ea0cd22aa916de08415e05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;s $50</a> (normally $90).</p>
<p>Got a smart house full of Echo devices and want to add some more? The latest (4th gen) model is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XKF5RM3/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07XKF5RM3&amp;linkId=82811add059421ae5c09b8a6ef294bb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $60</a> (usually $80-$100). The 2021 Echo Show, with its camera and 5.5&#8243; display, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J8FFJ8H/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08J8FFJ8H&amp;linkId=478e5a01c294d6f133ee50fc9c12ae08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $45</a> (usually around $80), and the itty-bitty (if probably at the end of its lifespan) Echo Dot puck is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FZ8S74R/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07FZ8S74R&amp;linkId=07214f0a4cf484ff6ab8908ee88f1a15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $20</a> (usually $30).</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, Google&#8217;s got a bunch of discounts on its own devices, as well.</p>
<p>Chromecast with Google TV (the Chromecast with the remote) is <a href="https://store.google.com/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $40</a> (usually $50).</p>

<p>Most of the company&#8217;s Nest stuff has been marked down — the Nest Audio smart speaker is down to $60 (usually $100), their Nest WiFi router mesh access points are <a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_wifi?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down $30 each</a> and the latest Nest Hub smart display has been <a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_hub_2nd_gen?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discounted to $50</a> (usually $100.) Even Nest&#8217;s relatively new outdoor camera is <a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_cam_battery?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $150</a> (normally $180).</p>
<h2>Roku</h2>

<p>Looking to stay out of the Apple/Google/Amazon ecosystems but still want a solid streaming device for your TV?

<h2>Oculus Quest 2</h2>
<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_1819803" style="width: 5130px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1819803" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1819803 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oculus-Quest-2.jpg" alt="" width="5120" height="2880" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oculus-Quest-2.jpg 5120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oculus-Quest-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oculus-Quest-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oculus-Quest-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oculus-Quest-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oculus-Quest-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oculus-Quest-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oculus-Quest-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5120px) 100vw, 5120px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1819803" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meta/Oculus</p></div></p>
<p>Oculus&#8217; Quest 2 virtual reality headset is about as good as entry-level VR gets right now. If you&#8217;re just looking to dabble or otherwise don&#8217;t want to spend a zillion dollars on a megapowerful VR rig, the Quest 2 is really a good place to start. I&#8217;ve happily recommended it to a bunch of people at the full price … so at a discount? Absolutely.</p>
<p>The best deal I&#8217;ve found so far is Target&#8217;s, where you&#8217;ll get a $50 Target gift card with either the <a href="https://www.target.com/p/oculus-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb/-/A-83984421" target="_blank" rel="noopener">128 GB</a> ($300) or <a href="https://www.target.com/p/oculus-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-256gb/-/A-84022117" target="_blank" rel="noopener">256 GB</a> ($400) model.</p>
<h2>Backbone</h2>

<p>If you often use your iPhone* for things like Apple Arcade or remotely playing games on an Xbox or PlayStation, the Backbone is a very, <em>very</em> good controller add-on. It snaps on quick, it&#8217;s solid as a rock, and it&#8217;s <em>way</em> more comfortable than trying to paw at the touchscreen.</p>
<p>I thought it was almost too cheap at $99, but now they&#8217;ve marked it <a href="https://playbackbone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $85 for Black Friday</a> — and they&#8217;ve thrown in three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for good measure. That&#8217;s a steal, honestly.</p>
<p><em>(* They recently added support for controlling other devices via wired USB, but that&#8217;s more of a neat bonus and less the main draw.)</em></p>
<h2>Apps and Services</h2>

<p>A few tried-and-true apps and services are offering deals, albeit often with caveats. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hulu will give you a year of <a href="https://www.hulu.com/gma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad-supported Hulu</a> for 99 cents a month, instead of $7 a month. The catch? It&#8217;s only for those who are new and &#8220;returning&#8221; subscribers, the latter defined as those who haven&#8217;t paid for Hulu in the last month.</li>
<li>If you don&#8217;t already have Disney+, Amazon is doing a kind of confusing deal as a tie-in with Amazon Music Unlimited. If you already have Amazon Music Unlimited, they&#8217;ll give you three months of Disney+ for free. If you don&#8217;t already have it and are willing to sign up for the $8 per month service, they&#8217;ll give you six months of Disney+.</li>
<li>Plex is selling its lifetime pass option, usually $120, <a href="https://www.plex.tv/black-friday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for $90</a>.</li>
<li>Adobe is selling its &#8220;All Apps&#8221; package — so access to Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, Audition and everything else Adobe makes under the Creative Cloud umbrella — for <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30 a month</a>, down from $52. Sadly, terms specify &#8220;first-time subscribers&#8221; only.</li>
<li>Popular password manager LastPass is <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/plans-and-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offering plans for 25% off</a> this week. USE A PASSWORD MANAGER.</li>
<li>Guided meditation app <a href="https://www.headspace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Headspace</a> is 50%-60% off right now, depending on if you&#8217;re paying monthly or annually. If monthly, it&#8217;s 60% off — $4.99 a month, instead of $12.99. If annually, it&#8217;s 50% off — which might sound like a smaller discount, but at $35 for a year (normally $70), you&#8217;re paying about $2.91 per month (usually around $6.) Both plans renew at their respective full price after the first year.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Architecture and construction have always been, rather quietly, at the bleeding edge of tech and materials trends. It&#8217;s no surprise, then, especially at a renowned technical university like ETH Zurich, to find a project utilizing AI and robotics in a new approach to these arts. The automated design and construction they are experimenting with show how homes and offices might be built a decade from now.</p>
<p>The project is a sort of huge sculptural planter, &#8220;hanging gardens&#8221; inspired by the legendary structures in the ancient city of Babylon. (Incidentally, it was my ancestor, Robert Koldewey, who excavated/looted the famous <a href="https://www.livescience.com/43036-ishtar-gate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ishtar Gate</a> to the place.)</p>
<p>Begun in 2019, Semiramis (named after the queen of Babylon back then) is a collaboration between human and AI designers. The general idea of course came from the creative minds of its creators, architecture professors <a href="https://gramaziokohler.arch.ethz.ch/web/d/projekte/409.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabio Gramazio and Matthias Kohler</a>. But the design was achieved by putting the basic requirements, such as size, the necessity of watering and the style of construction, through a set of computer models and machine learning algorithms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239484" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>During the design process, for example, the team might tweak the position of one of the large &#8220;pods&#8221; that make up the 70-foot structure, or change the layout of the panels that make up its surface. The software they created would then immediately adjust the geometry of the overall structure and the other panels to accommodate these changes, making sure it would still safely bear its own weight, and so on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2239519" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2239519" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2239519" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg" alt="Computer rendering of what the final Semiramis hanging garden structure will look like." width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=768,517 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=1536,1033 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=2048,1378 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/semiramis-render.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2239519" class="wp-caption-text">Computer rendering of what the final Semiramis hanging garden structure will look like. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gramazio Kohler Research</p></div></p>
<p>There are many automated processes in architecture, of course, but this project pushes the boundaries out in the level of final control seemingly given to them. The point, after all, is to make it a genuine collaboration, not just a sort of architectural spell-check that makes sure the whole thing won&#8217;t collapse.</p>
<p>&#8220;The computer model lets us reverse the conventional design process and explore the full design scope for a project. This leads to new, often surprising geometries,&#8221; <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2021/11/robots-build-new-hanging-gardens.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kohler said in an ETHZ news post</a>.</p>
<p>Having arrived at a final design, the construction is being accomplished by another human-automation team: a set of four robotic arms operating with one mind to hold multiple heavy pieces (each pod has dozens) in place while humans apply the resin used to keep them together. It&#8217;s a step above the technique <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/22/hold-this-beam-for-me-friend-robot-and-let-us-construct-a-house-together/">we saw used a few years ago</a> by the same team when they used robots as automated assistants.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qR92gbOxfU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/22/hold-this-beam-for-me-friend-robot-and-let-us-construct-a-house-together/">Hold this beam for me, friend robot, and let us construct a house together</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hold this beam for me, friend robot, and let us construct a house together&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/22/hold-this-beam-for-me-friend-robot-and-let-us-construct-a-house-together/embed/#?secret=qR92gbOxfU" data-secret="qR92gbOxfU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Semiramis is being constructed in the workshop then shipped piece by piece to its eventual home at Tech Cluster Zug. It should be fully assembled and ready to accept soil and seeds this coming spring, so stop by if you&#8217;re in the area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As many of the top cryptocurrencies seem to temporarily stabilize near all-time highs, users looking to speculate on tokens that are a bit more volatile are searching across exchanges to find deals.</p>
<p>Amsterdam-based startup <a href="https://tab-trader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TabTrader</a> has been capitalizing on this search with a platform that aggregates prices and token availability across dozens of exchanges. While other platforms allow users to look at token prices across exchanges, most are desktop-optimized while TabTrader has built up a substantial presence for its mobile app on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>As different exchanges take different approaches toward onboarding new tokens, crypto traders are increasingly signing up for accounts on multiple exchanges and tracking prices across multiple apps with multiple notification types set for each. Many users rely on TabTrader for its cross-exchange price alert feature, notifying users when a particular token has gone above or below a certain value. While plenty of exchanges offer this functionality inside their native apps, the reliability and customizability of these push notifications has often been inconsistent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239428" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Kirill Suslov tells TechCrunch that the TabTrader app has more than 400,000 active users, with particularly strong presences in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The startup has adopted a Kayak-like model, aggregating prices for tokens and picking up rebate fees from exchanges when users make a purchase through the app. While users plug their wallet info into the app to easily make purchases through connected exchanges, Suslov says that TabTrader never has access to user funds.</p>
<p>Alongside these rebates, TabTrader also makes money through a $12 monthly subscription for a paid version, as well as advertising. Suslov says his 20-person team has scaled to reach their current audience without any paid marketing.</p>
<p>While tens of millions of users have created accounts on centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, Suslov says that TabTrader&#8217;s biggest opportunity may be embracing so-called decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, which allow users to rapidly exchange tokens with other users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Suslov says that while the exchanges have built out great technology in the back-end, the front-end interfaces aren&#8217;t as easy for users to navigate, leaving room for an aggregator like TabTrader to streamline the user experience while allowing users to explore decentralized exchanges for the first time. The startup says they&#8217;re starting with a number of Solana-based exchanges including Serum, Raydium and Orca.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Decentralized exchanges] are the hottest topic of 2021,&#8221; Suslov says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> &#8220;</span>We raised to get onto this rocket ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suslov tells TechCrunch that TabTrader has banked $5.8 million in Series A funding from 100X Ventures, Hashkey Capital, Spartan Capital, SGH Capital, SOSV and Artesian Venture Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cannabis is quickly going to the nerds. As it gradually becomes legal around the world, startups have responded with innovative products from laser-powered water bongs to CNC machined vapes to AI-powered herb grinders. Got a friend who wants to get a bit fancy with it? Give&#8217;m the gift of high-tech consumption.</p>
<p>Please consume responsibility.</p>
<p>Throughout 2021, cannabis companies made major strides on the back of unprecedented consumer demand. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/in-new-round-dutchie-focused-on-smoother-cannabis-retail-sees-its-valuation-soar-by-eight-times/">Dutchie</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/cannabis-e-commerce-startup-jane-technologies-raises-100m-after-stellar-growth/">Jane Technologies</a> raised hundreds of millions in new venture financing, leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/cannabis-investment-jumps-82-the-second-half-of-2021-165-over-2020-levels/">industry investments climbing 82%</a> in the second half of 2021. Others companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/cannabis-giant-leafly-is-going-public-through-a-spac-merger/">Leafly</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/agrify-aims-to-be-the-fastest-growing-cannabis-company/">Agrify</a> turned to public markets to raise new capital. Amazon<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/amazon-to-stop-screening-employees-for-marijuana/"> stopped screening</a> employees for marijuana, and Apple started treating cannabis as it does with pharmaceuticals and started letting users order and pay for cannabis in apps (in places where that&#8217;s legal).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s high hopes for cannabis in 2022. Cannabis is now legal for use in 36 states, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/cannabis-banking-act-passes-u-s-house-with-bipartisan-support/">there&#8217;s traction in Washington</a> that could end its federal prohibition.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.puffco.com/products/budsy?variant=39699376799803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puffco Budsy</a> is a fantastic discrete water bong, and it&#8217;s nearly invisible thanks to the Nalgene-style bottle. Just throw some water in the bottle, pack flower in the hidden bowl and hit the trails. When you&#8217;re ready, flip up the lid, hit the bud with a lighter and inhale from the spout (which is thankfully not connected to the water). Rinse and repeat. Puffco released the Budsy on April 1, 2021 but it wasn&#8217;t a joke. This product is real, and it&#8217;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Roger Volodarsky founded the company in 2013 and has since led the company as CEO. Over the last several years, the company has kept pushing forward into innovative dabbing products. The Puffco Peak Pro (below) even features interchangeable ovens to allow owners to tailor their smoking experience without buying a new rig.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dynavap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynavaps</a> are my go-to smoking device. They&#8217;re pocketable, batteryless and produce a great cloud of vapor. Think of it as a one-hitter vape with a thermometer. First, heat the tip with a torch or induction heater. In about 3-5 seconds, the cap will click, notifying the user that the herb is at the right temperature and ready to hit. The cannabis lasts about 3-4 cycles. Best yet, since the cap protects the ground flower from the flame, there&#8217;s no combustion or smoke &#8212; just vapor &#8212; and there&#8217;s very little smell.</p>
<p>Dynavap vaporizers are CNC machined in the company&#8217;s De Forest, Wisconsin facility. George Breiwa started the company in 2015 and currently employs around 40 people. Dynvap sells several versions of the little metal vape, including this <a href="https://www.dynavap.com/dynashop/ocs/the-gentleman-pipe-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stately &#8220;gentleman&#8217;s pipe&#8221;</a> and the sleek, all-black Obsidium Omni for $250.</p>

The Blazy Susan is just a lovely weed station with little compartments to hold different toking accoutrements. There&#8217;s a dab station, a bowl cleaner and silicon inserts to make cleaning a bit easier. Prices start at around $90 and are available in different types of wood.</p>
<p>The company was started by Will Breakell and is based out of Colorado. The company also sells rolling papers, cones, grinders and a bunch of merch &#8212; everything is pink and I love it.</p>

<p><em>Surprise Guest! TC&#8217;s Amanda Silberling dropped by the gift guide to add this:</em></p>
<p>If you’re still using that cheap grinder you bought on Amazon, you’re probably wondering why anyone needs an AI-powered grinder. Here&#8217;s why: The <a href="https://bananabros.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OTTO</a> considers the density, moisture level, texture and consistency of your flower, then adjusts the speed, pressure and even the grind direction. Then, the OTTO deposits the perfect ground flower into a magnetically attached chamber and evenly distributes it into a pre-rolled cone. The result is luxurious &#8212; so long as you’re not an elitist who thinks cones are a cop-out (but if you are, you can just use the grinder on its own).</p>
<p>Banana Bros says the OTTO can grind perfect herbs, spices and incense, but even though the grinder is easy to clean, you’d probably end up with slightly sedative cinnamon or strangely flavorful cones if you’re not careful. At $150, this thing isn’t cheap, but it gets the job done. Banana Bros was founded in 2017 by CEO Dave Richmond and Director of Innovation Manny Montano, whose background is in industrial and 3D design. They’ve patented the AI technology that powers the OTTO, which is the company’s first and flagship product.</p>

<p>At its core, the <a href="https://hitoki.com/products/trident" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$499 Hitoki Trident V2</a> is a battery-powered water bong. The trick? It uses a laser and sealed chamber to heat the flower. When the device works, it hits like a truck. I tested the Hitoki, and it&#8217;s finicky and requires a lot of cleaning. The hose attachment is low quality, and the laser blasts the herb into a smoldering mess. So why is it on this list? Because despite its drawbacks, the Hitoki is a fun device and can produce an impressive cloud without butane. Plus lasers. You get to watch the laser light the pot and make a miniature mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>Joe and Jack Tran started Hitoki in 2019. The Trident V2 is the company&#8217;s second version of the product. The V2 version includes a carb button, a larger laser burn radius and an improved airflow path.</p>

The $599 device is made of high-end materials and works very well. Trust me. I&#8217;ve used it, and it&#8217;s smooth, rich and impressive. The device isn&#8217;t just for cannabis. It&#8217;s also a fantastic hookah, and with the right attachments, it can be used to infuse food and drinks with a burst of smokey flavor. Want a bigger hit?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri will testify before the Senate for the first time as part of a series of hearings about online safety for children and teens. Per The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/24/technology/adam-mosseri-instagram-testify-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a>, Mosseri&#8217;s hearing will take place on December 6.</p>
<p>Mosseri&#8217;s upcoming testimony comes after Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.10.20%20-%20Facebook%20and%20Instagram%20-%20Consumer%20Protection%20Invitation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a letter</a> to Facebook (now Meta) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, asking that either he or Mosseri participate in a Senate hearing.</p>
<p>Mosseri posted a video responding to the news of his forthcoming appearance on Capitol Hill. He discussed growing concerns about teen safety online, then outlined past actions Instagram has taken to protect young users, like making young teens&#8217; accounts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">private by default</a> and restricting the kinds of ads they see.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be talking about these issues with Congress relatively soon,&#8221; Mosseri <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>. &#8220;These are important issues, but we all have shared goals. We all want young people to be safe when they&#8217;re online.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>When reports leaked in September about Instagram&#8217;s knowledge of its <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=instagram+bad+teen+girls+wsj&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS954US954&amp;oq=instagram+bad+teen+girls+wsj&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2245j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dangerous affects</a> on teen girls, the Senate <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Committee on Commerce, Science, &amp; Transportation</a> didn&#8217;t take it lightly. The committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">first questioned</a> Facebook Global Head of Security Antigone Davis, who was reticent to answer direct questions from the Senate. Then weeks later, the committee heard testimony from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>, a former civic integrity product manager who leaked thousands of internal documents known as the &#8220;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1049015366/the-facebook-papers-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Papers</a>.&#8221; In her hearing, Haugen told the Senate that Facebook cares more about profits than user safety.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I am disappointed that Facebook has been unwilling to be fully transparent with me, other members of Congress, and the public, and appears to have concealed vital information from us about teen mental health and addiction,&#8221; <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.10.20%20-%20Facebook%20and%20Instagram%20-%20Consumer%20Protection%20Invitation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> Senator Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate committee hosting these hearings. &#8220;When I sought specific information about Instagram and teens in an August letter, Facebook provided clearly evasive and misleading answers that have now been directly disputed by Ms. Haugen.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Now, after hearing from executives at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">Snap, TikTok and YouTube</a> last month, the committee will convene again to hear from the head of Instagram himself. Given the committee&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/lawmakers-confront-tiktok-snapchat-and-youtube-about-eating-disorder-content/">demonstrated concern</a> about Instagram&#8217;s connection to the onset of adolescent eating disorders, it&#8217;s expected that Mosseri will be questioned about leaked internal studies that Meta conducted about Instagram&#8217;s impact on teen girls.</p>
<p>The internal study, obtained by The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">published by Meta</a> itself, found that Instagram makes body image issues worse for one in three teen girls, and that teens blame Instagram for increases in anxiety and depression. Among teens with suicidal thoughts, the study says that 6% of users traced their desire to die by suicide to Instagram. Plus, 32% of surveyed teen girls reported that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made those feelings worse.</p>
<p>Shortly after these documents were leaked, Mosseri announced that Instagram would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">pause building</a> <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Kids</a>. Meta already has products like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/facebook-messenger-kids/">Messenger Kids</a>, which lets users under 13 chat with people approved by their parents.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m9fpN1GWiX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies before the Senate</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies before the Senate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/embed/#?secret=m9fpN1GWiX" data-secret="m9fpN1GWiX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we’ve decided to pause this project,&#8221; Mosseri <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. &#8220;This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.&#8221;</p>
<p>But critics are skeptical of Meta&#8217;s ability to build an Instagram Kids product responsibly. Per research published this month, Facebook allegedly continues to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/facebook-accused-of-still-targeting-teens-with-ads/">surveil teens</a> for ad targeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is urgent and necessary for you or Mr. Adam Mosseri to testify to set the record straight and provide members of Congress and parents with a plan on how you are going to protect our kids,&#8221; Senator Blumenthal wrote to Zuckerberg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ionity, an electric vehicle fast-charging charging network provider whose owners include Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group, has scored a €700 million ($783 million) investment from BlackRock Global and existing shareholders to expand its footprint across Europe.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2017, installs ultra-high-speed EV charging stations. It was launched as a joint venture between a coalition of major automakers that includes Hyundai Motor Group, Ford and BMW. The investment will allow Ionity to increase the number of charging points to 7,000 by 2025 &#8212; a more than four-fold increase from the 1,500 that are installed today.</p>
<p>The new charging stations will be situated on highways and other major roads as well as near major cities. Six to 12 charging points will be at each location, Ionity said in a statement. The firm is also planning on adding more charging points to existing sites with high demand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239397" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ionity&#8217;s planned expansion includes owning and operating full service stations for drivers to &#8220;recharge&#8221; while charging their vehicles. These stations, a concept it&#8217;s calling “Oasis,” are similar to roadside rest stops today.</p>
<p>BlackRock is the first non-automotive company to invest in Ionity, through its Global Renewable Power equity investment vehicle. The investment management company raised $4.8 billion for the fund in April, a sign that institutional investors are increasingly interested in decarbonization technologies.</p>
<p>Its investment also speaks to the growing surety amongst powerful investment players in the forthcoming electric revolution in transportation. Thus far, BlackRock has mostly invested in onshore and offshore wind, and solar-powered projects, so its interest in EV charging is notable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has seen its short-form video feed copied by a host of competitors, from Instagram to Snap to YouTube and even Netflix. Now it looks like you can add Spotify to that list. The company has confirmed it&#8217;s currently testing a new feature in its app, Discover, which presents a vertical feed of music videos that users can scroll through and optionally like or skip. For those who have access to the feature, it appears as a fourth tab in the navigation bar at the bottom of the Spotify app, in between Home and Search.</p>
<p>The new addition was first spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1463542273216446472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Messina</a>, who tweeted out a video of the Discover feature in action. He described it as a &#8220;pared-down version&#8221; of a TikTok-style feed of music videos.</p>
<p>Messina told us he found the feature in Spotify&#8217;s TestFlight build (a beta version for iOS), where a new icon in the navigation toolbar brings you immediately to the video feed when tapped. You can then swipe up and down to move through the feed, much like you would on TikTok. In addition to tapping the heart to like songs, you also can tap the three-dot menu to bring up the standard song information sheet, he notes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239363" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Messina also speculated the feature may be taking advantage of Spotify&#8217;s existing Canvas format.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not only that, <a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Spotify</a> Discover is basically a pared down version of a TikTok-style feed of vertical music videos (likely using their canvas format) that you can like or skip.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewSpotify?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NewSpotify</a> <a href="https://t.co/hpOEZ8v9bl">pic.twitter.com/hpOEZ8v9bl</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/get-ready-to-see-more-looping-videos-on-spotify-as-canvas-launches-into-beta/">broadly in 2019</a>, Canvas allows artists to create videos that accompany their music on the Spotify app. The feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/get-ready-to-see-more-looping-videos-on-spotify-as-canvas-launches-into-beta/">had mixed reviews</a> from users, as some reported they preferred to see just the static album art when listening to music and found the video and its looping imagery distracting. But others said they liked it. Canvas, however, appears to drive the engagement metrics that Spotify wants &#8212; the company <a href="https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that users are more likely to keep streaming, share tracks or save tracks when they see a Canvas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From the video Messina shared and others we viewed, we can confirm that the videos playing in the vertical feed are the artists&#8217; existing Canvas videos. But Spotify would not confirm this to us directly.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Spotify for further information on the feature, including whether it had plans to roll this out further, whether it was available on both iOS and Android, which markets had access to the feature and more. The company declined to share any details about the feature but did confirm, via a statement, it was exploring the idea of a vertical video feed.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Some of those tests end up paving the way for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning. We don’t have any further news to share at this time,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>In other words, the test is still very early and may not make its way to the public. But if it did, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprising move on Spotify&#8217;s part. The company has before looked to popular social media formats to engage its users. In the past, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/spotify-test-lets-influencers-post-stories-to-introduce-their-own-playlists/">Spotify tested a Stories feature</a> that allowed influencers to post Stories to introduce their own, curated playlists. But that option never became available to all Spotify users.</p>
<p>While the TikTok format has been adopted by top social platforms, including Instagram (Reels), Snapchat (Spotlight), YouTube (Shorts) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/">Pinterest</a> (Idea Pins), it&#8217;s also proving to be an ideal format for content discovery. Netflix, for instance, recently adopted the short-form vertical video feed in its own app with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">the launch of its &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature</a>, which offers clips from its content library and tools to save the programs to a watch list or just start streaming them. Similarly, Spotify&#8217;s video-based Discover feature could help introduce users to new music and offer a way to signal their interests to Spotify in a familiar format.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/gen-z-and-millennial-workers-are-leading-the-latest-quitting-spree-.html">Great Resignation</a> is among the most significant events in recent U.S. history. We are seeing a post-COVID-19 generation refusing to work under the same conditions as they did before. The U.S. is facing the most prominent<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/09/07/labor-day-2021-when-worker-shortage-end/5674223001/"> labor shortage</a> of the decade, and positions that require high-demand skills are harder than ever to fill.</p>
<p>Midsized companies are finding it particularly hard to retain qualified personnel. Confronted by notable resource constraints, smaller budgets and workers’ demand for flexible solutions, the problems for SMBs are as great or even more significant than for larger organizations.</p>
<p>One way to make your company attractive is by developing attractive compensation strategies and increasing pay transparency and equity. Employees don&#8217;t always leave or stay because of their pay, but an opaque model for allocating compensation exacerbates feelings of disconnection and lowers engagement.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into how startups can benefit from compensation analysis, and how they can utilize available data to develop a comprehensive compensation strategy.</p>
<h2>Understanding the complexity of compensation</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Pay equity is one of the most pressing social issues today, and any discrepancies can have adverse spillover effects on reputation and company relationships.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The amount that lands in an employees’ bank account is just one fragment of today’s compensation packages. Compensation can consist of a base salary, annual cash bonuses and long-term incentives.</p>
<p>When stirring a compensation mix together, there are different trade-offs to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed versus variable compensation:</strong> Base salary compared with bonuses.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term incentives versus short-term incentives:</strong> Short-term incentives can be in the form of annual bonus structures. Long-term incentives are usually stock or other forms of compensation that vest over the years.</li>
<li><strong>Cash versus equity:</strong> Equity can include stock options, restricted stock and performance shares.</li>
<li><strong>Group incentives versus individual incentives</strong>: You could implement a percentage-based salary increase for all positions or give bonuses to select employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>It isn&#8217;t ideal to have a uniform policy for all positions and departments. Managers should explain their reward decisions on an individual level, and compensation decisions should reflect the skills and contributions of every employee. In addition, companies are bound to have varying budgets (e.g., higher revenue during the holiday seasons) and philosophies on allocating them.</p>
<p>Many make the mistake of sticking to an approach that doesn’t pan out from a strategic standpoint or doesn’t motivate the team enough. Instead, managers should gather data, work through various analyses and scenarios and design a compensation strategy tailored to the company. This is where compensation management software comes into play.</p>
<h2>The devil is in the data</h2>
<p>Data will help you understand where the talent market is headed and where your company stands.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My co-founders and I think we might qualify for International Entrepreneur Parole. </strong></p>
<p><strong>How long does it take to get IEP approved? How does that compare to other options that are available to startup founders, and can my spouse work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Committed COO</strong></p>
<p>Dear Committed,</p>
<p>Great questions! With Thanksgiving in the United States tomorrow, I’m reflecting on how appreciative I am of you and everyone who submits questions to this column, wherever you are in the world!</p>
<p>My law partner Anita Koumriqian and I recently chatted on our <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/098-it-takes-a-village-happy-thanksgiving/">Thanksgiving gratitude podcast episode</a> about all the things we appreciate about U.S. immigration in 2021, including how grateful we are that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced this year that it would continue the International Entrepreneur Parole (IEP) program. (In May, USCIS under the Biden administration announced it was rescinding a proposal created by the previous administration that would have ended the IEP program.)</p>
<p>I recommend that you consult an immigration attorney who has experience filing <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-process-for-getting-international-entrepreneur-parole/">IEP applications</a>. Remember, only up to three individuals from the same startup can get IEP. Take a look at these previous Dear Sophie columns in which I discuss the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-difference-between-iep-and-the-latest-proposed-startup-visa/">qualifications for IEP</a> and the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-process-for-getting-international-entrepreneur-parole/">IEP process</a>. An immigration attorney will also be able to offer alternative options and steps to take based on the unique needs and situations of you and your leadership team.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Timing is still an unknown</h2>
<p>The time it takes USCIS to process IEP applications remains uncertain for now, but we are still fervently advocating for anyone who may be eligible to take this path.</p>
<p>USCIS began processing IEP cases just this year, and it does not offer an estimate on processing times for <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/international-entrepreneur-parole">Form I-941</a>, the application for IEP, on its <a href="https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/">Case Processing Times</a> webpage.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
