										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rebel Foods, which operates a large network of dark kitchens in nearly a dozen markets, is the latest Indian startup to attain the unicorn status.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old Indian startup said on Thursday it has raised $175 million in its Series F financing round that valued it at $1.4 billion, up from about $800 million last year. Qatar Investment Authority, sovereign wealth fund of the State of Qatar, led the financing round with participation from existing investors Coatue and Evolvence. Rebel Foods also counts Sequoia Capital India and Goldman Sachs among its investors.</p>
<p>Rebel Foods is the third Indian startup to become a unicorn this week, and 31st to become a unicorn this year as scores of high-profile investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, Sequoia, Temasek aggressively double down on their bets to back young firms in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market. (And many more are beginning to explore India. A16z made its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/">first investment in an Indian startup</a> this week.)</p>
<p><a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/10/cloud-kitchen-roll-ups-rebels-unicorn-round/">Rebel Foods</a> operates the world&#8217;s largest number of what it calls “internet restaurants” in 10 countries including the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Over 45 brands, many of which Rebel Foods owns and also several from partner firms such as Wendy’s and Mad Over Donuts, prepare food exclusively for delivery rather than serving dine-in or takeaway customers. The startup says it operates over 4,000 of these internet restaurants.</p>
<p>The idea behind dark kitchens &#8212; also known as ghost and cloud kitchens &#8212; is to make food serving operations more economical. Setting up and operating a restaurant is expensive as they are also, after all, pieces of real estate. Setting up cloud kitchens allows partner restaurants and brands to move away from pricey retail locations and also streamlines the business by focusing on just producing food.</p>
<p>“The big disruption that the cloud kitchen model brought about is that you don’t have to put up five real estates to run five different restaurants,” said Jaydeep Barman, founder and chief executive of Rebel Foods, in a virtual conference earlier this year. As carmakers produce dozens of models from one factory, “using technology, supply chain and workflows, you can actually have one kitchen for five restaurants,” he explained.</p>
<p>Many investors say that the cloud kitchen model is also crucial for food delivery firms, restaurants, and brands to reach the larger market. In many developing markets including India, the ticket size for a lunch or dinner order is $3 to $5, which makes the existing business models unviable for firms to turn a profit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This would explain why both Swiggy and Zomato &#8212; the two top food delivery firms in India &#8212; have made several efforts to explore setting up their own cloud kitchens.</p>
<p>Swiggy, for instance, announced in late 2019 that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/swiggy-cloud-kitchen-india/">invested in more than a million square feet of real estate space</a> across 14 cities in the country to help restaurant partners of all sizes expand to more locations both within their city and across new cities through cloud kitchens. The firm, which invested over $25 million into its cloud kitchen business, significantly scaled it down last year after the pandemic hit. Like Swiggy, Zomato has also struggled to make inroads with its cloud kitchen efforts.</p>
<p>But the model is here to stay &#8212; and investors are buying. “Working in Rebel’s favor is the loss of investor interest in single-brand entities given that these brands don’t have the ability to drive profitable unit economics from just operating one brand. Scaling a single brand across cities requires capital investments far higher than for brands that are part of a larger portfolio, where fixed costs are controlled,” <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/10/cloud-kitchen-roll-ups-rebels-unicorn-round/">reported</a> Indian news and analysis publication CapTable, which also scooped the fundraise talks last week.</p>
<p>Why have big firms struggled to make inroads with cloud kitchen? TechCrunch spoke with Ravi Golani, the chief strategy officer at Rebel Foods, who said, a challenge that he sees with cloud kitchen model is that there are several different strategies at play and they are yielding different results.</p>
<p>“We are combining the best of both worlds &#8212; digital and physical &#8212; to understand how to expand a particular brand, to make unit economics work, and to ensure adequate supply chain and leveraging technology. It’s a different ballgame altogether,” he said, adding that some of the other firms have only succeeded to achieve some of these. Rebel Foods works with food delivery firms as its delivery distributing partners.</p>
<p>“If you think about cloud kitchens generally, you would imagine five or more different booths in a kitchen. They have their own staff, production material and delivery tie-ups. In our kitchens, what we have done is organize the entire layout by workflows rather than restaurants,” he said.</p>
<p>The startup said it plans to deploy the fresh funds to expand its international footprint and also explore acquisition opportunities. It’s also eyeing to become a public company within two years, said Piyush Kakkad, the startup’s chief financial officer. Rebel Foods&#8217; current annual run-rate is $150 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making sure mental wellness is part of your routine can be difficult, especially if you are already busy and stressed. <a href="https://wearemindlabs.com/">MindLabs</a> wants to make it easier with a combination of on-demand or live video classes and community features. The company announced today it has raised a $3.5 million seed round, almost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/mindlabs-raises-1-4-million-for-its-new-platform-a-peloton-for-mental-health/">eleven months after its pre-seed funding</a>.</p>
<p>The seed round was led by PROFounders Capital, with participation from Slack Fund; Sky executive chairman and former chief executive officer Jeremy Darroch; and returning investors Passion Capital and Seedcamp. The timing of the announcement comes three days before<a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-mental-health-day"> World Mental Health Day on October 10</a>, to raise awareness of mental health issues and increase access to care.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to hire for MindLabs’ product and engineering, content and market as it prepares for its public launch next year.</p>
<p>MindLabs was founded last year by Adnan Ebrahim and Gabor Szedlak, who previously launched and ran CarThrottle, an automotive site and community that was <a href="https://digiday.com/media/track-make-120m-car-sales-dennis-taps-younger-car-buyers-car-throttle-purchase/">acquired by Dennis Publishing in 2019</a>. When TechCrunch first talked to the founders last year, they said they decided to focus on mental health for their next startup because of the rapid increase in depression, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Over the past year, MindLabs has hired leaders for its engineering, production and marketing teams, and built out its beta app, which now has 16 instructors. The startup’s platform is slated for a public launch in the first quarter of 2022. Ebrahim told TechCrunch that MindLabs currently has thousands of users on its waitlist, thanks in part to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wearemindlabs/">growth of its Instagram account</a>, which has almost 60,000 followers.</p>
<p>MindLabs will be available first in the United Kingdom, before launching in the United States. Ebrahim says it plans to expand into non-English speaking countries, since the team believes the platform is easily translatable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its app now has over 100 on-demand videos created by mental wellness, psychology and neuroscience professionals, and will also host daily live videos classes from its studio in West London. One of its instructors is <a href="https://www.thebreathguy.com/">Richie Bostock</a>, AKA The Breath Guy, who is a meditation and breathwork expert. Community features were built in, partially in response to the isolation people have experienced during the pandemic.</p>
<p>MindLabs also eventually plans to release hardware, like an EEG headband, to track health indicators. Ebrahim said MindLabs is launching with an app-first strategy before moving into wearables, with affordable subscription plans for classes so they can reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>“We’re still extremely excited about tracking biomarkers of the mind, such as EEG, heart rate and breathing patterns, through existing and our own wearables,” he said. “We believe this will help us build a more accurate, real-time picture of how our users feel, and therefore be able to serve them with the most relevant video classes to help improve their mood.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts say the value of e-commerce in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach $29 billion next year, yet Africans still find it difficult to make international payments for products online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cards, M-Pesa, bank transfer and mobile money, are the most common methods Africans use to make payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while various payment gateways have provided better experiences than how things were, say, a decade ago, there&#8217;s more work to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.klasha.com/">Klasha</a>, a Lagos and San Francisco-based startup, sees a niche in cross-border commerce and provides multiple integrations and APIs to facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions in that space. Today, it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has raised $2.4 million in seed to scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/jessicaanuna">Jessica Anuna</a> founded Klasha in 2018. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, the company&#8217;s focus was to make it easier for African consumers to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from global fashion retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Klasha is more than that now, she tells me. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has several features and a new business model </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">centred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around helping Africans make payments and get the goods they want (as long as they aren&#8217;t perishable), regardless of their location</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Klasha Checkout, which works a lot like </span><a style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">Checkout</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">, allows international merchants to collect payments from Africa in local currencies. And unlike Checkout or Fast that only works with international payments methods, Klasha uses what Africans are accustomed to &#8212; bank account, card, USSD, M-Pesa and mobile money. </span><br />
</span></p>
<p>The checkout solution can be integrated into any e-commerce platform, the company said. It has plugins for big-name e-commerce sites WooCommerce, OpenCart and BigCommerce and is set to sign an official partnership with BigCommerce, extending its reach to more merchants globally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With KlashaWire, consumers can pay with African currencies: naira, cedis, shillings &#8212; via </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payments methods, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Klasha then remits to merchants in dominant currencies like the U.S. dollar or euros in two business days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its payment links feature supports merchants that don&#8217;t have storefronts to accept payments by sharing links with customers via email or social media</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next is its mobile application which lets users in Nigeria, Ghana or Kenya send and receive money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can also create virtual cards and fund them with their </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respective currencies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to its payments play, Klasha is into logistics too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anuna asserts that as Klasha combines both worlds of payments and logistics, it is opening up the global e-commerce economy to consumers in Africa and merchants looking to scale into Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of our merchants have said to us, if we&#8217;re going to be able to accept payments from Africa, we need a way to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">seamlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ship to Africa in a short amount of time and provide the best end to end logistics experience for our consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done,&#8221; remarked the CEO.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to her, the logistics service helps African customers get their products from Europe or the U.S. in five to nine days, handled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via partnerships with third-party logistics providers. On a lighter note, Klasha&#8217;s time frame is quite laudable compared to industry numbers of up to two weeks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Klasha relaunched in May following some iterations, it has processed more than 20,000 transactions and claims to be growing 366% month-on-month. Klasha makes revenue via sales commissions and subscriptions r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">etailers pay to use the platform for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">analytics to gauge how their products are faring in different markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For a lot of these retailers, this is the first time they&#8217;ve ever sold into Africa before. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we offer a complete end to end e-commerce suite for them as opposed to having to use disjointed services that aren&#8217;t interconnected with technology,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klasha’s technology allows for seamless cross-border transactions at a time when Africa is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growing and needs both payment and logistics solutions for online commerce, Alison Lange Engel, a partner at Greycroft, said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the third significant investment the venture capital firm has made in Africa after placing bets on unicorn company Flutterwave and AZA Group &#8212; a fintech company founded and led by Elizabeth Rossiello. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Rossiello, Anuna, 29, had industry experience before starting the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Techstars-backed Klasha. The chief executive worked at Amazon and Shopify in London and subsequently started a logistics company in China. It was t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here, while running FMCG exports to the U.K. and U.S. for large wholesalers and suppliers, she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">figured that merchants in China (Africa&#8217;s biggest trading partner) needed more efficient ways to receive payments from Nigerian merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened Anuna&#8217;s eyes to the world of cross-border trade and payments and this has proved vital in how she has been able to raise venture capital as a solo female founder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black female founders get 0.6% of global venture funding. There&#8217;s no data to depict the situation with African female founders, but if you could paint a picture, it wouldn’t be a pretty one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Anuna believes investors are starting to back more female founders, particularly in fintech where recent startup and VC activity have been eye-popping</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asides from Greycroft, other investors include Seedcamp, Practical VC, Plug and Play, First Round VC, 2.12 Angels, MiLA Capital, Berrywood Capital, AVG Basecamp Fund, and Expert Dojo.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Webrazzi.com">Webrazzi</a>, the main tech startup media title in Turkey, has acquired <a href="http://Tech.eu">Tech.eu</a>, the long-time tech startup site in Europe. The pooled entity of Webrazzi and Tech.eu will now offer combined editorial, data, and research platforms offering news and market intelligence. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Launched in 2006 by <a href="https://twitter.com/ardakutsal?lang=en">Arda Kutsal</a>, Webrazzi reaches 1.25 million readers a month (15 million a year) and will now expand its European and English language reach with the Tech.eu acquisition.</p>
<p>Tech.eu was launched in 2013 by former TechCrunch writer <a href="https://twitter.com/robinwauters">Robin Wauters</a>, and has since become one of, now several, destinations for European tech startup and innovation news. It has, however, faced increasing competition from a number of other European-oriented outlets such as <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/">EU Startups</a>, <a href="https://siliconcanals.com/">Silicon Canals</a>, and the Financial Times-backed <a href="http://Sifted.eu">Sifted.eu</a>. (TechCrunch&#8217;s European bureau started its coverage in 2006).</p>
<p>Tech.eu&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/23/tech-eu/">investors included</a> 500 Startups, Adeo Ressi (The Founder Institute), Roxanne Varza (Station F), Daniel Waterhouse (Balderton) and Carlos Eduardo Espinal (Seedcamp).</p>
<p>Wauters explained that part of the motivation for the sale came from a desire to have its own tech stack, custom CMS, bespoke software for managing native advertising campaigns, and an events platform, which Webrazzi has.</p>
<p>Arda Kutsal, founder and CEO of Webrazzi, said: “We are excited to expand further into Europe by acquiring Tech.eu, which we have considered the best source of technology news and market data for many years. We are impressed with the team’s accomplishments to date, as well as its solid plans for the future, and can’t wait to work together with them to turn those into reality.”</p>
<p>Robin Wauters, founding editor and managing director of Tech.eu, said: “I have long admired what Arda and his team have built, and I’m excited to bring the knowledge and experience we’ve gained from building Tech.eu as a team to the Webrazzi family and see how far and wide we can take our combined editorial platforms next. The European technology ecosystems are evolving at an incredible pace, and we can’t wait to continue covering and analysing their future ins and outs under the Webrazzi umbrella. I fully expect it to be more hard work and good fun!&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On a call with me, he added: “We weren&#8217;t really looking for anyone to sell to, but Arda was in touch with us from 2014 when he wanted to invest in our Seed round. That didn’t happen, but we stayed in touch, chatting about each other&#8217;s business, and one thing led to another, as they say.”</p>
<p>“We didn&#8217;t have a big sales team so it&#8217;s always very difficult for us to compete. What they bring to the table is, of course, a team of 25 people that we can immediately tap into, so that was music to my ears because it&#8217;s very, very heavy competition not just on the media side but also on data and events side. This acquisition means more ability to accelerate what we want to do,” he added.</p>
<p>Had he found the European media landscape increasingly competitive?</p>
<p>“I think the competition is just normal. If you look at the way that the European tech ecosystem itself has grown and matured, then there are going to be multiple publications. I think we were early, maybe even a bit too early. But we did make it in the first few years when it was still relatively small. But it’s matured to a point now where a single publication I think cannot do it justice anymore, so it&#8217;s normal that there are multiple ones,” he said.</p>
<p>I asked if his investors pushed for an exit: “We raised around seven years ago, right, so it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re in constant touch with our investors in the same way that a VC would be with their portfolio companies. It was more like a group of angels that supported us in the beginning. Nobody was really pushing for a sale because it&#8217;s not like we were looking to sell. Not even myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>On a call, Kutsal told me: “It’s exciting. We&#8217;ve been working on this for the last eight or nine months and the pandemic made this hard, but we managed to sign everything. I always wanted to expand to different regions into Europe and at the end of 2020 I called Robin.”</p>
<p>He said Webrazzi&#8217;s technology stack was a major factor in the deal: “We have so many technologies. We have our own CMS content management system, online event platform, our own native advertising solutions, and everything. At one point I realized Robin had a great team but no technology of his own, so this was a major factor in the deal.”</p>
<p>He said the merged entity now plans to expand further in Europe, possibly Russia, and the MENA region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hellogetsafe.com">Getsafe</a> has extended its Series B round that it previously announced in December 2020. In addition to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/getsafe-b/">original Series B round of $30 million</a>, the company is adding another $63 million in fresh capital. Overall, Getsafe has raised a $93 million Series B round.</p>
<p>Investors in today’s funding round include unnamed family offices as well as Earlybird and Abacon Capital. Some of the company’s existing investors, such as CommerzVentures and Swiss Re, are also investing in the company once again.</p>
<p>The German company originally started with a digital-first home contents insurance product. It sells its products directly to end customers through its website and app. Over time, Getsafe expanded to new products, such as personal liability, dog liability, drone liability, bike theft protection and car insurance.</p>
<p>The service is now active in two markets — Germany as well as the U.K. While Getsafe still has more customers in its home market, the company’s metrics are going up. Getsafe currently has around 225,000 customers in Germany and 25,000 customers in the U.K. In December 2020, TechCrunch’s Steve O’Hear <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/getsafe-b/">reported</a> that Getsafe only had 150,000 customers overall.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that Getsafe truly believes the best way to sell insurance products is through a direct relationship with its end customers. The mobile app acts as a key part of the company’s product offering as you can buy new insurance products, manage your existing contracts and file claims directly through the app.</p>
<p>This is a completely different strategy when you compare it to <a href="https://www.wefox.com/en-de">Wefox</a>, another big German insurtech company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/european-insurtech-startup-wefox-grabs-650-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">raised $650 million</a> earlier this year. Wefox partners with 700 agents and 5,000 associate brokers — they distribute Wefox products to their own customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Getsafe’s direct-to-consumer approach, the startup manages to sell its products to a lot first-time insurance buyers. And Getsafe has a lot of engagement with its app. 30% of the company’s customers open the app at least once per month, which leads to a lot of upselling opportunities.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, Getsafe plans to finally get its own insurance license. It has been working on this process for a while as it doesn’t want to act as a broker going forward. Getsafe’s fully licensed insurer should go live soon, at some point in 2021.</p>
<p>The company is also going to invest in its product, expand to new categories and new markets. Up next, Getsafe is thinking about expanding to France, Spain, Italy and Austria.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The adoption of telehealth services has boomed in the pandemic &#8212; with usage up 38-fold since January 2020, according to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/telehealth-a-quarter-trillion-dollar-post-covid-19-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">a report by McKinsey</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. While a lot of the attention has been on companies that are building the communications layer between consumers and clinicians, there are also a wave of companies building <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/cta-8-signs-growth-connected-health-device-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">devices</a> to expand what can be monitored and addressed in a telehealth environment. </span></p>
<p>In one of the latest developments, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.bisu.bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu</span></a> &#8212;<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a Tokyo-headquartered healthcare startup that has built a lab-grade testing device that can be used at home for diagnostics that translate into actionable health data &#8212; has</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> raised $3.2 million. The seed round will be used to launch a portable home health lab, Bisu Body Coach, which provides personalized nutrition and lifestyle advice through easy, accurate urine and saliva testing. The seed funding brings its total raised to $4.3 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The latest funding was led by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="http://www.quad-im.com/index.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">QUAD</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, with participation from </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://corp.asics.com/en/ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ASICS Ventures Corporation</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, 15th Rock Ventures, Pacifico Investments and SOSV. Athletic shoe giant ASICS is a strategic backer, and it plans to collaborate with Bisu on health and fitness service initiatives. Bisu is in discussions with other companies in the fitness, pet care and bathroom sectors for additional partnerships, co-founder and CEO Daniel Maggs told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu was founded in 2015 and started business in 2017 when it entered the </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://hax.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">HAX accelerator program</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu Body Coach works around disposable test sticks and a reader that syncs with a smartphone application. The disposable test sticks enable users to measure a range of biomarkers in just two minutes, using microfluidic “lab-on-a-chip” technology.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The microfluidic “lab-on-a-chip” technology uses spectrometry and real-time end-to-end measurement to eliminate the measurement timing issue of conventional test strips. It also manipulates a sample such as blood, urine, saliva or sweat inside a tiny channel to perform a chemical or biological process.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When asked about its differentiation from other competitors that use the lab-on-a-chip technology, Bisu said it focuses on simultaneous testing of multiple biomarkers that enable the user to understand and make a positive change to their diet and lifestyle without seeing a doctor. Others typically detect individual biomarkers of high significance such as COVID-19 and influenza that may guide the user to seek help from a physician.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu&#8217;s app provides feedback on key nutrition indicators such as hydration, minerals, vitamins, pH, uric acid and ketones. Based on users’ goals, preferences, activity, sleep and weight, Bisu Body Coach provides personalized recommendations. Bisu plans to add zinc and Vitamin B measurements in the future and expects to release a pet health test kit for cats and dogs.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bisu Body Coach is currently in beta testing in the U.S. and European Union. The company aims to commercialize it in these markets in 2022, Maggs said, adding that it is also laying the groundwork to enter Asian markets such as Japan and Korea in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its core R&amp;D and production team are based in Tokyo, and Bisu’s software and marketing team is based in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Maggs said that the conventional at-home diagnostics market, dominated mainly by patients, is estimated at </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://askwonder.com/research/at-home-wellness-testing-r4bqjry68" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">approximately $5 billion and growing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But Bisu’s at-home test has a potential market also with non-patients &#8212; people who are not under the care of physicians or others for anything specific, but are interested in knowing more about what is going on inside their bodies. The market for non-patient, at-home diagnostics is currently estimated to be around $10 billion, Maggs said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2019, Singapore-based <a href="https://grey-wing.com/">Greywing</a> was created to help ship operators and other members of the maritime industry make critical decisions. It includes tools for crew change management, predictive reporting of potential risks like piracy and pandemic-related travel restriction updates. Today Greywing announced the launch of a new solution that will help vessel operators track carbon emissions created by crew changes, along with $2.5 million in seed funding. Investors include Flexport, Transmedia Capital, Signal Ventures, Motion Ventures, Rebel Ventures, Y Combinator (Greywing was part of its winter 2021 batch) and Entrepreneur First.</p>
<p>Greywing now enables vessel operators to estimate the potential carbon impact of a crew change before it happens.</p>
<p>The carbon emissions tool takes in data like the current locations of individual crew members, their home ports and potential routing changes. When waypoints are entered, the platform scans for flights that crew members can take. The amount of carbon emissions a flight will create is listed along with its price, so ship operators can book flights that will lower total emissions created without significantly impacting an operation’s costs.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Nick Clarke explained in an email that 3% of global emissions come from shipping, and about a third of that comes from “scope 3” emissions, or the carbon footprint of factors outside the vessel’s fuel outputs, including crew changes. Many vessel operators are committed to bringing down carbon emissions for ethical reasons; they also need to comply with the International Maritime Organization 2030 and 2050 Decarbonization Targets.</p>
<p>The release of the carbon emissions tool comes three months after Greywing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/greywing-launches-crew-change-to-help-shipping-companies-navigate-covid-19-regulations/">launched Crew Change</a> to help shipping companies manage testing, quarantine and other COVID-19 regulations for their crew members.</p>

<p>Greywing was created in 2019 after founders Clarke and chief technology officer Hrishi Olickel met at Entrepreneurs First in Singapore. Olickel told TechCrunch in an email that before joining the program, which matches potential co-founders, he “knew almost nothing about the maritime industry” because his background was in parametric insurance and robotics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>“What drew me to Greywing’s mission was Nick and the realization that maritime was an essential industry on the verge of digitalization where we could make a difference,” he said.</p>
<p>Greywing was created to reduce the amount of work vessel operators need to do while preparing for a voyage. It draws in data from private and public sources, and turns it into user-friendly and navigable reports (the platform was designed to be mobile first). “Until our operating system came around, decision makers were being fed all of these critical details from separate channels and managing them on different platforms—emails, rudimentary vessel tracking systems, HR ERP, phone calls or even Excel spreadsheets,” Clarke said. “As you can imagine, it can be difficult to digest all these data points and turn them into actionable intelligence,” especially when one wrong decision can be costly, damaging to the environment or dangerous for crew members.</p>
<p>Olickel added that Greywing’s aim is to “move from idle information reporting, which is where the industry currently sits, to real-time decision making and on to predictive alerts,” which is why the startup built its carbon emissions and Crew Change tools.</p>
<p>The new round of funding will enable Greywing to tap into more maritime data sources and develop intelligent vessel management systems that will become more autonomous as the platform’s algorithms increase in complexity.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, this round of funding will help us to use Greywing’s solution to spark a movement within the shipping industry so we can tackle 1% of global carbon emissions that would otherwise go untouched,” said Clarke. “We are already working to have our solution deployed on over 2,000 vessels, which adds up to 3.5% of the world’s commercial fleet. This will remove over 230,000 tonnes of carbon from the earth’s atmosphere; the equivalent of taking seven vessels off our oceans.”</p>

<p>Twitter paid around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/09/twitter-said-to-acquire-mopub/">$350 million for MoPub back in 2013</a> and will sell the company for $1.05 billion in cash. MoPub helped Twitter bring in around $188 million in revenue last year, according to the company. Twitter previously set a goal of doubling its annual revenue by 2023.</p>
<p>&#8220;This transaction increases our focus and demonstrates confidence in our revenue product roadmap, accelerating our ability to invest in the core products that position Twitter for long-term growth and best serve the public conversation,&#8221; Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said in a press release.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter CFO Ned Segal characterized the deal as a way for the company to refocus around what he describes as a &#8220;massive&#8221; advertising opportunity in the midst of Twitter&#8217;s recent flurry of new product development. Segal said that Twitter will emphasize developing its own owned and operated products instead, though it does seem to be investing broadly in acquisitions that mesh with that vision in recent months.</p>
<p>For a company that was mostly on cruise control previously, Twitter has made a number of major moves to shake up its business this year. In a series of rapid-fire product launches, Twitter is exploring new revenue streams that tap into explosive growth in the creator economy with features like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">Super Follows</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/twitter-starts-to-roll-out-paid-ticketed-spaces-on-ios/">Ticketed Spaces</a>, though those products have<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/"> limited adoption for now</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/">Google boosts African investment:</a> </strong>U.S. technology giant Google is investing $1 billion into the African continent to help hasten its digital transformation, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-sets-up-50m-fund-to-invest-in-african-startups/">$50 million into local startups</a>. African startup investment has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">scaling in recent quarters</a>, making Google’s news unsurprising, if welcome when we consider the uneven reality of global venture funding.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/vcs-say-there-are-more-startup-opportunities-to-chase-in-latin-america/"><strong>Opportunities abound in Latin America’s burgeoning startup market:</strong></a> TechCrunch dug into where investors see gaps in the funding market for startups in Latin America today, discovering that while more upstart tech companies in the region are raising funds, there are still ample blind spots where intrepid investors can find deals.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/hacker-leaks-twitch-source-code-and-creator-payout-data/">Twitch hacked:</a></strong> Amazon’s Twitch video streaming service was hacked, it confirmed today. Payout details, source code &#8212; the hack was more than a simple release of user data. It’s a pretty terrible moment for Twitch, its parent company and its vast user base. Change your passwords everyone, and then get a password manager.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>There is a veritable flood of startup stories on the blog today, so we’re ditching our usual format and proceeding in a few discrete blocks of news. Enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/the-athletics-numbers-look-fine-actually/">What do people think startups do with money that they raise?</a> </strong>They spend it, in case you were curious, which leads to incredibly negative cash flow results at growing companies. That’s the goal — to invest raised funds in the name of revenue expansion. Which is what The Athletic has been doing with its venture funds.</li>
<li><strong>Here’s a host of early-stage rounds from startups we think are neat:</strong> BeeHero has raised $19 million in new capital to “find more uses for its one-of-a-kind collection of data collected from thousands of active honeybee hives.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/y-combinator-backed-costcertified-lands-8-45m-to-build-the-amazon-for-construction/">Calgary-based CostCertified raised $8.4 million</a> to help “contractors send a shoppable interactive estimate to homeowners so that they can choose their selections during a project.” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/copper-banking-adds-9m-in-funding-as-digital-bans-clamor-for-teen-customers/">Teen-focused neobank Copper Banking has closed $13.3 million</a> across several rounds, TechCrunch reports. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/matter-raises-7-million-series-a-to-build-a-better-reading-app/">Matter put together $7 million in new funding</a> to build a better reading application, which we are very curious about. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/tracking-co2-emissions-for-supply-chains-leads-normative-to-a-e10m-fund-raise/">Normative’s emissions accounting service raised €10 million</a> from U.S. and European climate funds. Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase Ventures <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/">put $260 million into Indian cryptocurrency trading house CoinSwitch Kuber</a>, which is now worth $1.9 billion.</li>
<li>Cloud migration and management tool <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/as-logicworks-approaches-100m-in-revenue-it-announces-new-cloud-migration-platform/"><strong>Logicworks is homing in on $100 million in revenue</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Our own Frederic Lardinois reports that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/databricks-acquires-8080-labs-to-extend-its-low-code-no-code-capabilities/"><strong>Databricks has purchased German startup 8080 Labs</strong></a>. If you are not clear on why this matters, Lardinois writes that the startup in question is “behind bamboolib, a popular GUI for the Python-based Pandas data analysis and manipulation tool.” (Go public Databricks; stop putting off the inevitable!)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting the details right in your pitch deck</h2>
<p>For the Pitch Deck Teardown at TechCrunch Disrupt, Managing Editor Danny Crichton reviewed two decks, &#8220;one consumer and one enterprise,&#8221; with three VCs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maren Bannon, co-founder and managing partner, January Ventures</li>
<li>Vanessa Larco, partner, NEA</li>
<li>Ben Ling, founder and general partner, Bling Capital</li>
</ul>
<p>Only the most exceptional pitch decks will receive more than a few minutes of attention, so Danny selected four slides &#8220;that provoked our panelists to show how VCs can have radically different views on the same material.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today in our big technology section we’re starting with an automotive competition and then digging into a raft of policy-focused stories that are shaping the global technology market.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-says-it-will-double-revenue-by-2030-take-ev-market-share-from-tesla/">GM intends to double revenue, take Tesla market share:</a> </strong>By 2030, U.S. automotive company General Motors wants to double its revenues and “and take over the market share of EVs,” TechCrunch reports. Naturally, Tesla will have something to say about the latter goal, but it’s nice to see the North American EV market get more competitive.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-takes-aim-at-teslas-market-share-with-growing-portfolio-of-evs/"><strong>To do that, the company plans electric trucks, crossovers:</strong></a> Popular ICE vehicles from GM will make an electric transition, with the company planning electric trucks and crossovers, it said during an event that detailed its future EV plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, PolicyCrunch:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/uk-publishes-safety-focused-rules-for-video-sharing-platforms/"><strong>The U.K. rolls out new regulations for protecting youths on video apps:</strong></a> U.K. regulator Ofcom has new rules out “intended to protect users under 18 from harmful content such as hate speech and videos/ads likely to incite violence against protected groups.” The new guidelines will impact services like TikTok, Twitch and Snapchat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a-new-us-bill-would-force-companies-to-disclose-ransomware-payments/"><strong>U.S.-based companies may have to disclose ransomware payments in future:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It’s always risky to cover newly <em>proposed</em> laws, but they provide direction regarding future regulation. In this case, a newly <em>proposed</em> law would “compel businesses in the U.S. to disclose any ransomware payments within 48 hours of the transaction.” Which makes sense? Frankly? Now we just need something similar for data breaches.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/european-parliament-backs-ban-on-remote-biometric-surveillance/"><strong>European Parliament backs ban on biometric mass surveillance:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Worried that facial recognition is going to take over the world and that you will never be able to travel without being under scrutiny? Well, good news if you live in Europe, where there is a new call for lawmakers to “pass a permanent ban on the automated recognition of individuals in public spaces,” except in the case of those suspected of crimes.</li>

<p>Read one of the testimonials we’ve received below!</p>
<p><strong>Consultant: </strong><a href="http://www.appetiser.com.au">Appetiser Apps </a></p>
<p><strong>Recommended by: </strong>Andre Eikmeier, founder of <a href="https://goodempire.org/">Good Empire</a></p>
<p><strong>Testimonial: </strong>“They had a good reputation globally and had produced some good products. We also liked their flexible model &#8212; we were able to use our CTO to lead a team of six devs from the Appetiser team, with occasional UX/UI, product management and project management as needed; it was properly collaborative, not a blackbox agency arrangement. So we were able to build capability in-house at the same time, rather than dependency. [Working with them] allowed us to get a first iteration of product to market from scratch in three months.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Artificial intelligence is often thought of as disembodied: a mind like a program, floating in a digital void. But human minds are deeply intertwined with our bodies — and <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-bodies-get-smarts-simulating-evolution-embodied-intelligence">an experiment with virtual creatures</a> performing tasks in simulated environments suggests that AI may benefit from having a mind-body setup.</p>
<p>Stanford scientists were curious about the physical-mental interplay in our own evolution from blobs to tool-using apes. Could it be that the brain is influenced by the capabilities of the body and vice versa? It has been suggested before — over a century ago, in fact — and certainly it&#8217;s obvious that with a grasping hand one learns more quickly to manipulate objects than with a less differentiated appendage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to know whether the same could be said for an AI, since their development is more structured. Yet the questions such a concept brings up are compelling: Could an AI better learn and adapt to the world if it has evolved to do so from the start?</p>
<p>The experiment they designed is similar in some ways to simulated environments that have been used for decades to test evolutionary algorithms. You set up a virtual space and drop simple simulated creatures into it, just a few connected geometric shapes that move in random ways. Out of a thousand such writhing shapes, you pick the 10 that writhed the farthest and make a thousand variations on those, and repeat over and over. Pretty soon you have a handful of polygons doing a pretty passable walk across the virtual surface.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all old hat, though: As the researchers explain, they needed to make their simulation more robust and variable. They weren&#8217;t simply trying to make virtual creatures that walk around, but to investigate how those creatures learned to do what they do, and whether some learn better or faster than others.</p>
<p>To find out, the team created a similar simulation to the old ones, dropping their sims, which they called &#8220;unimals&#8221; (for &#8220;universal animals&#8221; … we&#8217;ll see if this terminology takes off), into it at first just to learn to walk. The simple shapes had a spherical &#8220;head&#8221; and a few branchlike jointed limbs, with which they developed a number of interesting walks. Some stumbled forward, some developed a lizard-like articulated walk and others a flailing but effective style reminiscent of an octopus on land.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213833" style="width: 812px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unimals1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213833" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2213833" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unimals1.gif" alt="Animated image of CG 'unimals' walking in different ways." width="802" height="187" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213833" class="wp-caption-text">Look at them go!. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stanford</p></div></p>
<p>So far, so similar to older experiments, but there the similarities more or less end.</p>
<p>Some of these unimals grew up on different home planets, as it were, with undulating hills or low barriers for them to clamber over. And in the next phase unimals from these different terrains competed on more complex tasks to see whether, as is often held, adversity is the mother of adaptability.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Almost all the prior work in this field has evolved agents on a simple flat terrain. Moreover, there is no learning in the sense that the controller and/or behavior of the agent is not learnt via direct sensorimotor interactions with the environment,&#8221; explained co-author Agrim Gupta to TechCrunch — in other words, they evolved by surviving but didn&#8217;t really learn by doing. &#8220;This work for the first time does simultaneous evolution and learning in complex environments like terrains with steps, hills, ridges and moves beyond to do manipulation in these complex environments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The top 10 unimals from each environment were set loose on tasks ranging from new obstacles to moving a ball to a goal, pushing a box up a hill or patrolling between two points. Here it was where these &#8220;gladiators&#8221; really showed their virtual mettle. Unimals that had learned to walk on variable terrain learned their new tasks faster and performed them better than their flatlander cousins.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213832" style="width: 909px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unimals-mix.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213832" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2213832" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unimals-mix.gif" alt="CG 'unimals' walk on different terrain and attempt various tasks." width="899" height="505" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213832" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Stanford</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;In essence, we find that evolution rapidly selects morphologies that learn faster, thereby enabling behaviors learned late in the lifetime of early ancestors to be expressed early in the lifetime of their descendants,&#8221; write the authors in the paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25874-z">published today in the journal Nature</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just that they learned to learn faster; the evolutionary process selected body types that would allow them to adapt faster and apply lessons quicker. On flat terrain, an octopus flop might get you to the finish line just as fast, but hills and ridges selected for a body configuration that was fast, stable and adaptable. Bringing this body into the gladiatorial arena gave those unimals coming from the school of hard knocks a leg up on the competition. Their versatile bodies were better able to apply the lessons their minds were putting to the test — and soon they left their floppier competition in the dust.</p>
<p>What does this all signify, besides providing a few entertaining GIFs of 3D stick figures galloping over virtual terrain? As the paper puts it, the experiment &#8220;opens the door to performing large-scale in silico experiments to yield scientific insights into how learning and evolution cooperatively create sophisticated relationships between environmental complexity, morphological intelligence, and the learnability of control tasks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Say you have a relatively complicated task you&#8217;d like to automate — climbing stairs with a four-legged robot, for instance. You could design the movements manually, or combine custom ones with AI-generated ones, but perhaps the best solution would be to have an agent evolve its own movement from scratch. The experiment shows that there is potentially a real benefit to having the body and the mind controlling it evolve in tandem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors will be upping its investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure by nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars, in a bid to lure drivers who may otherwise be leery of charging availability to EVs.</p>
<p>The automaker said it would spend nearly $750,000,000 through 2025 in order to create more access to public, home and work chargers. The investment also has significant implications for GM’s Ultium Charge 360 project.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time GM has invested in charging. The automaker last year announced a partnership with EVgo, a popular charging network company, for the installation of more than 2,700 DC fast chargers over five years.</p>
<p>Charging availability is consistently cited in surveys as one of the primary reasons why people are hesitant to transition to an electric vehicle. <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CR-National-EV-Survey-December-2020-2.pdf">A recent survey</a> from Consumer Reports found that around half of the respondents said “not enough public charging stations” was holding them back from purchasing an EV.</p>
<p>What’s unclear is whether this will go toward a proprietary charging network &#8212; like Tesla’s Supercharging network, which boasts over 25,000 chargers in nearly 3,000 stations around the world &#8212; or whether this money will go toward another partnership. There was a lot of talk throughout the investor day of GM becoming a “vertically integrated” OEM with revenues from subscriptions and services &#8212; and GM also teased that this investment would help support a new initiative it&#8217;s calling “Ultium Charge 360,” which sounds to us a lot like a subscription. But we’ll have to wait and see.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google launched a <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/travel/find-flights-with-lower-carbon-emissions/">new feature</a> on Wednesday that shows users the environmental impact of flights. Starting today, users will see carbon emissions estimates for nearly all flights in the search results. The estimate is visible next to the price and duration of the flight. Google notes that the new feature will allow users to factor carbon emissions into their decision alongside cost or timing when it comes to booking travel.</p>
<p>The estimates are flight-specific and seat-specific. For instance, the emissions estimates will vary when looking at economy or first-class seats, as seats that take up more space account for a larger share of total emissions. Additionally, newer airplanes are generally less polluting than older ones.</p>
<p>Flights with lower emissions will be labelled with a green badge. Those who want to prioritize carbon impact when searching for a flight can sort through results so that the flights with the lowest emissions are at the top of the list. Flights are labelled as higher, typical, lower or unknown emissions.</p>
<p>Google calculates the estimates by combining data from the European Environmental Agency with flight-specific information provided by airlines regarding details such as aircraft type and the total number of seats. The search giant notes that actual carbon emission may vary and depend on factors such as aircraft model and configuration, speed and attitude of the aircraft along with the distance between the origin and destination. The company plans to continue revising carbon emissions over time to improve accuracy.</p>
<p>“This update to Google Flights is just one of the many ways we’re helping people make sustainable choices in their everyday lives,” Google’s vice-president of travel products, Richard Holden, said in a <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/travel/find-flights-with-lower-carbon-emissions/">blog post.</a></p>
<p>This latest update to Google Flights comes as the company just launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-maps-launches-eco-friendly-routing-in-the-u-s/">eco-friendly routing in the U.S.</a> for iOS and Android users. Eco-friendly routing gives drivers the choice between the fastest and most fuel-efficient route. Google believes the new feature could allow Maps users to avoid over 1 million tons of carbon emissions per year. Eco-friendly routing is expected to launch in Europe next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever tweeted something innocuous that went on to kick off a firestorm of unwanted attention, you know full well that people on Twitter will fight about anything and everything — it&#8217;s the internet&#8217;s premier destination for high-speed, low-information opinion slinging, after all.</p>
<p>Twitter has been working on ways to tone down the toxicity that the platform is known for, and the latest experiment primes people with a few pointers before they wade into messy tweet fights. Users may see the test prompts appear on Twitter&#8217;s iOS and Android apps.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ever want to know the vibe of a conversation before you join in? We’re testing prompts on Android and iOS that give you a heads up if the convo you’re about to enter could get heated or intense.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress as we learn how to better support healthy conversation. <a href="https://t.co/x6Nsn3HPu1">pic.twitter.com/x6Nsn3HPu1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445824131040120835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company says the idea is to give people a heads-up if they&#8217;re about to join a conversation that&#8217;s &#8220;heated or intense,&#8221; which on Twitter could be anything from life-threatening health misinformation to guacamole recipes. Twitter says the goal, as it has stated before, is to foster &#8220;healthy conversation&#8221; on the platform.</p>
<p>The test labels appear under a tweet and display a little warning that &#8220;conversations like this can be intense.&#8221; To participate, it looks like you&#8217;ll need to click through a prompt encouraging users to be factual, open to diverse perspectives and reminding them of their shared humanity. The company <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1445845741440753666">says</a> that it may evaluate tweet topic and the &#8220;relationship between the Tweet author and replier&#8221; in displaying the prompt.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/twitter-harmful-replies-prompt-harassment-test-feature/"> tested other behavior-shaping prompts</a> previously, including pop-ups that discouraged users from sending hate and harassment in replies. Targeted pop-ups are clearly a tool that shows promise for slowing some rapid-fire toxic social media patterns, though given the scope of people being monstrous assholes online, we&#8217;re going to need <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-safety-mode-harassment/">a lot of different solutions</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Still can&#8217;t wrap your head around people wanting to watch others play video games on the internet? Here&#8217;s another one that might bend your brain a bit: people are watching other people <em>study</em> on the internet.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to miss if you&#8217;re a few years out of school, there&#8217;s a whole internet community built around studying and how to (hopefully) study better — one filled with Discords, subreddits and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A">ridiculously chill music</a>.</p>
<p>One part of all this is the &#8220;Study With Me&#8221; stream — which, as the name suggests, is a livestream of someone studying, meant to be kinda-sorta-watched while the viewer studies too. There might be a bit of music, maybe some rain sounds … but, for the most part, the host won&#8217;t be talking much or trying to entertain. That&#8217;d kind of defeat the purpose, after all. Don&#8217;t think anyone would tune in to that? There are dedicated YouTube channels with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSQkQjPhnZw12Hj-SfsbX8w">hundreds of thousands of subscribers</a>, and pre-recorded, hours-long study streams with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ex_bNIFR1A">millions of views.</a></p>
<p>While the livestream studying concept has been around for a few years, much of its uptick in popularity came with the pandemic. How do you do study group when the library is closed and we&#8217;re not supposed to be sitting around each other in stuffy rooms?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studystream.live/home">StudyStream</a>, a team out of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 class, is bringing all of these ideas together and building it into a platform — a dedicated place online where students can study with others, share study tips and more. They offer 24/7 &#8220;focus rooms&#8221; on Zoom, where students are meant to turn on their camera, pop on some headphones and crack open their books with up to 1,000 other students — plus a Discord community for students who want to connect after the fact, or want to live study in smaller groups.</p>
<p>Launched late last year, the team is already seeing solid traction. Co-founder Sarujan Ranjan tells me they&#8217;ve seen upward of four million users come onto the platform, and their Discord community recently passed 400,000 users. Any time I&#8217;ve checked in the past few weeks, their study streams (of which six run in parallel) have collectively had thousands of users online. They also host onboarding streams bright and early each weekday, where they breakdown how the focus rooms work and introduce people to the etiquette … like why no one is talking.</p>
<p>Just as talking in a library would probably get you shushed, the 1,000-person streams aren&#8217;t meant for chatting — again, chatter would sort of defeat the purpose. Everyone&#8217;s microphone is blocked and the in-Zoom chat is disabled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, people find ways to express themselves. Some users change their Zoom display names to their social media handles; others hold up handwritten notes to say hello. One cute trick people seem to use is &#8220;waving&#8221; with Zoom&#8217;s built-in hand raise feature — it&#8217;s a way to say hello but also a way to get yourself bumped into the first few pages of on-screen streamers, if that&#8217;s something you want.</p>
<p>(And, of course, people will find ways to troll — give people a webcam, an audience and some degree of anonymity, and, well, it happens. As such, StudyStream has live moderators in each of the streams, with multiple ways to report anyone being nasty.)</p>
<p>Ranjan and his co-founders, Erfan Soliman and Tianyou Xu, didn&#8217;t initially set out to build a study streaming platform. In 2018, they founded the Knowledge Collective, an education platform where they&#8217;d host leadership training programs. In talking to more students, though, they found that most of them weren&#8217;t looking for another place to find stuff to watch or read.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t have a problem with content. The thing that was really bothering them was … feeling unmotivated. Or unproductive, or isolated. [They&#8217;d say] &#8216;I can get the content, I just can&#8217;t get myself to actually read it.'&#8221;</p>
<p>So they started experimenting with study focus rooms, quickly finding an audience after a few popular study TikTokers and study influencers (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/study-influencers-earning-thousands-dollars-youtube-productivity-hacks-exam-tips-2021-3">they exist!</a>) joined the platform and hyped it up. As more and more users stuck around and turned to StudyStream as a way to find community in a deeply isolating time, they knew it was time to make it their focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t want any student to have to study alone ever again,&#8221; says Ranjan, &#8220;regardless of where in the world they may be.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of StudyStream&#8217;s focus rooms are currently free to join, so how will they make money? That&#8217;s still in the works. Ranjan tells me they&#8217;ve experimented with premium rooms and have plenty of other concepts in the works — but for now, they&#8217;re focused on building out the platform and keeping users happy. One aspect of this is building out the experience <em>outside</em> of the focus rooms; they&#8217;re currently in a closed beta of their expanded web app, which will offer up things like shared task lists, an overview of how long/often you&#8217;ve studied, and more ways to connect with other students on the platform.</p>

<p>While StudyStream was part of YC&#8217;s most recent class, they didn&#8217;t take part in Demo Day — because, well, they&#8217;d already raised the money they needed for now. Ranjan tells me that the team closed a $2.1 million SAFE round prior to Demo Day, backed by YC, Brighteye Ventures, Emerge Education, Dunce Capital, Ali Abdaal (a well-known YouTuber that focuses on productivity and studying techniques), Manchester City footballer Ilkay Gündoğan and other unnamed angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors said it expects its in-car subscription services to generate nearly $2 billion in revenue this year and will reach as high as $25 billion by the end of the decade, an amount the company said Wednesday will put it in the same <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FINAL-Q420-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">league as Netflix</a>, Peloton and Spotify.</p>
<p>The automaker has 16 million vehicles on the road in the U.S. and Canada. About a quarter of those vehicles — 4.2 million — have owners that pay for subscriptions services today, <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Alan Wexler, SVP of innovation and growth at GM, said during a presentation at the company&#8217;s investor event Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>GM expects that number to grow, especially as it gears up to launch its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/general-motors-new-software-platform-ultifi-is-coming-to-vehicles-starting-in-2023/">Ultifi end-to-end software platform</a> in 2023 that will enable an enhanced subscriptions platform and over-the-air software updates.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s current subscription platform supports services like OnStar, a subsidiary of the company that provides in-vehicle security, emergency services and navigation.</p>
<p>The company said its customers&#8217; average willingness to select multiple services is high. GM conducted a study with several thousand customers, offering them 45 different feature and service options. On average, customers chose a bundle of 25 different products and services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research indicates that with the right mix of compelling offerings, customers are willing to spend $135 per month on average for products and services,&#8221; said Wexler.</p>
<p>By 2030, GM predicts 30 million of its vehicles in the U.S. will have connected car technology, leaving it with a serviceable addressable market of $80 billion. Wexler said GM aims to generate additional incremental revenue of $20 billion to $25 billion, $6 billion of which will be from insurance and the rest from one-time purchases and subscriptions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The meme-ification of ownership and the wild acceleration of private startup valuations have led us to this moment where a former VC firm associate has built a crypto marketplace designed for &#8220;fantasy startup investing,&#8221; where users spend real money buying fake shares &#8212; in NFT form, of course &#8212; of real startups.</p>
<p>The game, which launches out of closed beta today, is called <a href="https://www.visionrare.com/">Visionrare</a> and founders Jacob Claerhout and Boris Gordts see a way to take the gamification of investing to its furthest end, mimicking the appeal of fantasy sports leagues and giving users a way to compete with friends by betting on startups they think will be successful. Users can bid on NFT shares of hundreds of different startups at auction and compete to build the best-performing fake portfolio.</p>
<p>At launch, Visionrare&#8217;s database of companies is confined to a smattering of Y Combinator startups from some of the more recent classes. Before you ask, no, they mostly do not have the permission of the startups they&#8217;re selling fake shares in to use their names and logos, but the founders hope that the game-like nature of the platform will discourage those companies from sending out the cease and desist letters. Startups can verify their profiles and receive a healthy percentage of their NFT shares to distribute as they see fit, or they can contact Visionrare to take their startup&#8217;s profile down. Or they can, of course, just ignore it.</p>

<p>The game aims to simplify the complexity of venture capital in an auction format that&#8217;s tied to the actual fundraising cycles of the startups and their real-world performance. Visionrare auctions off 100 serialized &#8220;VisionShares&#8221; per funding round, one at a time for each startup, with bids starting at $5. Once a user accumulates a certain number of shares (at least five) they can join a league and compete with other users through a fantasy-like experience, moving up and down a leaderboard while competing for a share of the collective value of the VisionShares based on the performance of their own portfolio.</p>

<p>As the platform crosses into open beta, there are still some substantial to-do list items for the company, namely building out its secondary market and support to sell VisionShares on outside platforms like OpenSea. Users currently purchase VisionShares with credit cards, but the team is also looking to roll out crypto payments soon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The game&#8217;s subject matter lacks a few correlations with something like Monday Night Football that may prove difficult to scale a fantasy league with, namely the lack of publicly available performance information. If these were public companies, the game could be organized around something concrete like share price or consistent metrics from their quarterly earnings, but startups are much more careful in the information they release publicly.</p>
<p>Visionrare gets startup performance data from Tracxn, which they use to analyze their own valuation-like &#8220;Visionrare score&#8221; for the companies each week. This score is the fundamental basis for tracking progress and winners in the leagues, but in a market where intangibles can often push valuations, treating the market with this kind of cross-industry consistency overindexed on data like press mentions, social media followers and app downloads will clearly lead to some substantial disconnect at times between private valuations and the scores. Claerhout, who previously worked in early-stage investing at Paris-based investment firm Partech, notes that &#8220;this is not an exact science,&#8221; but hopes they can get access to more data streams over time that improve the performance of their scoring algorithm.</p>
<p>A bigger challenge may be ensuring that the most deep-pocketed users aren&#8217;t consistently winning league competitions &#8212; just like they do in the real world. League winners are determined by which portfolios pick up the most Visionrare score points over a given playing period, but given the long timelines of venture success stories, there may be some misalignments when it comes to making long-term bets on an early team versus hitching your wagon to a trending SaaS startup. The founders say they are still playing with some of the league mechanics and note they will make adjustments as Visionrare scales to keep things fun and fair.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s an early project made by a couple of young entrepreneurs with zero funding that captures some of the ridiculousness of both the crypto space and today&#8217;s startup investment ecosystem. Nevertheless, Visionrare&#8217;s founders hope their fake NFT shares market offers an opportunity for people interested in startups to showcase their conviction for picking winners, something that they hope could one day serve as a signal for VCs looking for their next hires.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a really hard industry to build credentials in and t<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">here are a lot of people who have neither the access nor the capital,&#8221; Claerhout tells TechCrunch. &#8220;</span>If you believe in a company, buy a VisionShare.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is rolling out <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/blog/new-pinterest-shopping-features-to-help-people-find-what-they-love/">new features</a> for advertisers and brands to promote their products to users on its site. The launch marks the company’s latest initiative to grow online shopping and advertising on its platform.</p>
<p>A new &#8220;slideshow for collections&#8221; feature pulls products from brands’ catalogues and automatically turns them into a &#8220;collections ad.&#8221; Pinterest notes that this new feature will help advertisers easily produce video-like content tailored to individual users. The aim is to encourage shoppers to purchase more items at once, as the company notes that shoppers on Pinterest have 85% bigger baskets than shoppers on other platforms and spend twice as much per month. Since shoppers will be browsing more than one product at a time through the slideshow feature, they’re more likely to purchase additional items.</p>
<p>Pinterest is launching another new feature called &#8220;merchant details&#8221; to allow brands to showcase their values on their profile. Brands can showcase values such as “responsibly sourced” and “inclusive.” Further, companies can also highlight communities that they are a part of, such as “Women-owned” and “Black-owned.”</p>
<p>The company is also expanding its Verified Merchant Program, which helps users find vetted brands, to Austria, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. Brands who have been vetted get enhanced distribution and a “verified” badge on their profiles.</p>
<p>Pinterest is also testing a new &#8220;Idea Ads with paid partnership&#8221; feature that is a joint partnership between creators and advertisers. As part of the feature, the creator makes an Idea Pin and tags a brand partner. The advertiser can then promote the Idea Pin as an Idea Ad. The company notes that this kind of partnership helps businesses and creators reach more users on the platform. Idea Ads are currently being tested with select creators and brands in 15 countries.</p>
<p>“People who use Pinterest weekly are 7x more likely to say it’s the most influential platform in their purchase journey, compared to social media platforms. That’s why, as of today, we’re dramatically expanding our suite of shopping solutions for advertisers,” the company said in a <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/blog/new-pinterest-shopping-features-to-help-people-find-what-they-love/">blog post.</a></p>
<p>These new features come as no surprise, as Pinterest has long positioned itself as a source for inspiration that could ultimately lead to online purchases. Earlier this year, the company rolled out a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/pinterest-adds-a-shopping-list-feature-to-round-up-your-saved-products/">&#8220;Shopping List&#8221; feature</a> aimed at turning users’ saved Pins into purchases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting Pinterest is among several other platforms competing within the e-commerce market with a push toward online shopping, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/">Snap</a> have all launched shopping features over the past few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>, the open-source project that gives large enterprises and public cloud providers the tools to run their own AWS-like private clouds in their data centers, today announced the release of OpenStack 24. Codenamed Xena, the release focuses on polishing many of the system&#8217;s sharper edges.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the OpenStack project, which now falls under the umbrella of the <a href="https://openinfra.dev/">OpenInfra Foundation</a>, has had its ups and downs. So it maybe comes as a surprise to many that it is actually seeing quite a bit of growth in usage lately. As the Foundation shared today, the number of total cores managed by OpenStack grew 66% over the last year.</p>
<p>OpenStack remains the backbone for many telco companies and indeed, nine of the 10 largest telcos run OpenStack. If you&#8217;ve made a 5G call on the Verizon network lately, OpenStack played a major role in making that happen (Disclosure: Verizon, through Verizon Media, used to own TechCrunch. They don&#8217;t anymore, which is obviously their loss). But companies like Workday and Walmart, too, now run OpenStack deployments, with over 1 million cores. But still, China Mobile, for example, is in its own league with over 6 million cores.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the biggest jump I think we&#8217;ve ever seen year over year,&#8221; OpenInfra Foundation COO Mark Collier told me. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot written about the massive growth in demand for infrastructure because of the pandemic. And there&#8217;s been lots of articles written about the hyperscale public clouds and all of a sudden, they&#8217;re needing to grow much faster &#8212; but I think that that&#8217;s absolutely driving OpenStack demand. We added 10 million cores in a year. It&#8217;s just awesome. One hundred new clouds were built just in the past year. We have seven organizations now running over a million cores.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213545" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213545" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2213545" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg 1105w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213545" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OpenInfra Foundation</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that Microsoft joined the OpenInfra Foundation as a top-tier $350,000/year Platinum member a few weeks ago, joining <a href="https://openinfra.dev/members/">the likes of</a> Ant Group, AT&amp;T, Ericsson, Facebook, FiberHome, Huawei, Red Hat, Tencent Cloud and Wind River.</p>
<p>After 24 releases, after all, the core tools it takes to run a private cloud (compute, storage, networking, etc.) are now well established. But there are still some features like support for virtually any PCI device, something enterprises were looking for to attach <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2019/03/04/an-introduction-to-smartnics/">SmartNICs</a> (basically programmable networking devices) to OpenStack&#8217;s Nova compute and Neuton networking service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As far as specific themes that we saw with this release, one of them is the integration of projects. So OpenStack Cyborg [which provides support for hardware accelerator], Nova, Neutron, did a lot of work on this peripheral component interconnect device flexibility, the PCI devices, proving that our projects are better together sometimes,&#8221; Kendall Nelson, OpenStack&#8217;s Upstream Developer Advocate, explained.</p>
<p>This also includes adding support for more functions from more components to the unified OpenStack command-line tool.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FbfksWzIK1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/the-openstack-foundation-becomes-the-open-infrastructure-foundation/">The OpenStack Foundation becomes the Open Infrastructure Foundation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The OpenStack Foundation becomes the Open Infrastructure Foundation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/the-openstack-foundation-becomes-the-open-infrastructure-foundation/embed/#?secret=FbfksWzIK1" data-secret="FbfksWzIK1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Historically, we&#8217;ve had the individual clients for each one of the services,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;They&#8217;re closer to the API and more maintained by the individual projects. We&#8217;ve been focusing on this OpenStack client and the OpenStack SDK that lives underneath it over the last couple of releases, so that we can remove a bunch of the project-specific clients so that users only have one command line they need to interact with and they can do everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as many of the other updates, the OpenInfra Foundation&#8217;s VP of Engineering Thierry Carrez noted that they were often driven by new hardware requirements, as well as the scale at which many OpenStack users now operate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting to see how the development priorities shift,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At this point of OpenStack, the core features are pretty stable, but it&#8217;s actually hardware enablement that drives most of this new development.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, though, the team also used the last development cycle to address some technical debt that had amassed over the last decade, including removing support for long deprecated APIs, for example.</p>
<p>The OpenInfra Foundation, which also now supports projects like Kata Containers, CI/CD platform Zuul, the edge computing platform StarlingX and the lifecycle management tool Airship, also today announced a return to in-person conferences, starting in Berlin <a href="https://openinfra.dev/summit/">from June 7 to 9</a>, with registration opening next month. Ahead of that, it&#8217;ll host a virtual event, <a href="https://openinfra.dev/live/keynotes">OpenInfra Live: Keynotes</a>, this November.</p>

		Will Uppington is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.truera.com">TruEra</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The European Commission announced <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_1682">first-of-its-kind legislation regulating the use of artificial intelligence</a> in April. This unleashed criticism that the regulations could slow AI innovation, hamstringing Europe in its competition with the U.S. and China for leadership in AI.</p>
<p>For example, Andrew McAfee wrote an article titled “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5970b6c-e731-45a7-b75b-721e90e32e1c">EU proposals to regulate AI are only going to hinder innovation</a>.”</p>
<p>Anticipating this criticism and mindful of the example of GDPR, where Europe’s thought-leadership position didn’t necessarily translate into data-related innovation, the EC has tried to address AI innovation directly by publishing a new <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/new-coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence">Coordinated Plan on AI</a>.</p>
<p>Released in conjunction with the proposed regulations, the plan is full of initiatives intended to help the EU become a leader in AI technology. So will the combination of regulation and pro-innovation policies be enough to spur accelerating AI leadership?</p>
<h2>AI innovation can be accelerated with the right laws</h2>
<p>While the combination is well considered and targets improvements in both regulation and innovation, there is a problem: The pro-innovation initiatives are R&amp;D-focused and not targeted at increasing adoption in the “high-risk” AI use cases to be regulated.</p>
<p>Spurring adoption is a key missing element. <a href="https://itif.org/files/2011-impact-regulation-innovation.pdf">Many research studies</a> have shown that well-designed “hard law” regulations can actually <em>increase </em>innovation, especially when employed with incentives that accelerate adoption. If the EC were to follow such a strategy, the EU could become a hotbed of AI innovation.</p>
<h2>High-risk AI regulation and investment in innovation</h2>
<p>The main thrust of the EC regulations is to place new requirements on “high-risk” AI systems. These include AI systems used for remote biometric identification, public infrastructure management, hiring and employment, creditworthiness assessment, and education, as well as for various public-sector use cases, such as dispatching first responders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The legislation requires developers of these systems to deploy an AI quality management system that addresses requirements around high-quality data sets, record keeping, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, robustness and security. Providers of AI systems not yet designated as high risk are encouraged to create voluntary codes of conduct to achieve similar goals.</p>
<p>It’s clear that the crafters of the proposal were cognizant of the balance between regulation and innovation.</p>
<p>First, the legislation limits the number of AI systems deemed to be high risk, excluding systems that could plausibly have been included, such as insurance, and mostly including AI systems that already have some amount of regulatory oversight, such as employment and lending.</p>
<p>Second, the legislation defines high-level requirements without dictating how they are achieved. It also creates a compliance system based on self-reporting instead of something more onerous.</p>
<p>Finally, the Coordinated Plan is chock-full of R&amp;D-supporting initiatives, including spaces for data-sharing, testing and experimentation facilities, investment in research and AI excellence centers, digital innovation hubs, funding for education, and targeted, programmatic investments in AI for climate change, health, robotics, the public sector, law enforcement and sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>However, the proposal lacks adoption-driving policies that have led to faster innovation in combination with regulation in other sectors.</p>
<h2>A motivating precedent: EV incentives in the U.S.</h2>
<p>So how could the EC promote much faster AI innovation while enacting regulatory guardrails? The example of electric vehicles in the United States provides a guide.</p>
<p>The U.S. has become a leader in electric car production because of a combination of entrepreneurship, regulations and smart market creation incentives.</p>
<p>Tesla invigorated the electric car industry with the insight that the new vanguard of electric cars should be desirable, high-performance sports cars.</p>
<p>The Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) regulations created a stick that required the development of more efficient vehicles. Generous tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles helped directly accelerate vehicle sales without interfering with the natural, competitive market dynamics. The combination of CAFE regulations, tax credits and entrepreneurial companies like Tesla has created such a massive boost to innovation that electric vehicle engines are poised to become less expensive than internal combustion ones.</p>
<h2>Getting AI incentives right: Three additional initiatives to pursue</h2>
<p>The EC has an opportunity to achieve something similar with AI. Specifically, the EC should consider combining these current regulations with three additional initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Create tax incentives for companies to build or buy high-risk AI systems that adhere to these regulations. </strong>The EC should seek to proactively use AI to help meet economic and societal goals.</p>
<p>For example, some banks are using AI to better assess the creditworthiness of individuals with limited credit histories, while simultaneously working to ensure that banking activities are free from bias. This increases financial inclusion, a goal shared by governments, and represents a win-win AI innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Further reduce uncertainty around EC legislative implementation. </strong>Part of this can be done directly by the EC &#8212; through the development of more specific standards around AI quality management and fairness. However, there may be even greater value in bringing together a coalition of AI technology providers and user organizations to translate these standards into practical steps for compliance.</p>
<p>For example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has orchestrated an industry consortium for banks, insurers and AI technology providers called <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2021/veritas-initiative-addresses-implementation-challenges">Veritas</a> to achieve similar goals for its Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency (FEAT) guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Consider accelerating the adoption of the AI quality management systems that the legislation requires by funding companies to build or buy these systems.</strong> There is significant academic and commercial activity already in this space, in areas such as explainability of black box models, assessment of potential discrimination due to data or algorithmic bias, and testing and monitoring of AI systems for their ability to survive significant changes in data.</p>
<p>By creating the conditions to encourage widespread adoption of such technologies, the EC should be able to meet the dual objectives of encouraging innovation <em>and</em> enabling compliance with the new legislation in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p>If the EC assertively reduces uncertainty, promotes the use of regulated, “high-risk” AI and encourages the use of AI quality management techniques, then it has the chance to become the global leader in AI innovation while providing critical protection to its citizens. We should all be pulling for them to be successful, as it would set an example for the world to follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is making a change to its App Store <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j5uyprul">by returning the &#8220;Report a Problem&#8221; link</a> to App Store product pages across iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey devices. The link offers an easy way for users to report issues they&#8217;re having with an app, including whether it contains offensive or illegal content, or whether it was attempting to scam consumers out of their money. Apple had removed the consumer-friendly &#8220;Report a Problem&#8221; button from the App Store years ago, possibly to its detriment. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/06/apple-app-store-scams-fraud/">New reports have suggested</a> that many of the top apps are scams costing consumers millions and Apple has even been questioned by Congress over the situation.</p>
<p>The button&#8217;s return <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/apple-makes-it-easier-to-report-bad-apps-and-scams/">was spotted earlier this week</a>, but Apple didn&#8217;t officially announce it until today.</p>
<p>The company says the new feature is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and will make its way to other markets over time. (Technically, however, the feature isn&#8217;t new &#8212; a button like this used to be a key feature in the App Store&#8217;s early days.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213681" style="width: 277px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213681" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2213681" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/117773.image0_.jpg?w=267" alt="" width="267" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/117773.image0_.jpg 267w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/117773.image0_.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/117773.image0_.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/117773.image0_.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213681" class="wp-caption-text">Example of old App Store with Report a Problem button.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.dummies.com/consumer-electronics/smartphones/iphone/how-to-report-an-app-problem-from-your-iphone/">Dummies.com</a> <span class="screen-reader-text">opens in a new window)</span></p></div></p>
<p>The button appears only on apps consumers have installed.</p>
<p>When clicked, consumers will be able to select from options like &#8220;Report a scam or fraud” and “Report offensive, abusive, or illegal content&#8221; at <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>. They will also be able to report issues with free apps that don&#8217;t include in-app purchases.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213693" style="width: 481px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213693" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2213693" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?w=471" alt="" width="471" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=104,150 104w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=208,300 208w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=768,1109 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=471,680 471w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=1064,1536 1064w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Store screenshot, Oct. 2021</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s App Review, Discovery Fraud and Live Moderation, and Financial Fraud teams will investigate these reported problems for signs of fraud, manipulation, abuse and other violations of the App Store Review Guidelines, Apple says. They will then reach out to developers to resolve the issues they uncover. There is no mention of any sort of immediate financial relief offered to consumers, however. Consumers still have to request refunds from this page as a separate process.</p>
<p>App Store scams have become more obvious, egregious, and, in many cases, more profitable since Apple shifted to the subscription model years ago. Almost immediately, bad actors took advantage of built-in tools to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/sneaky-subscriptions-are-plaguing-the-app-store/">trick consumers into subscriptions,</a> leading Apple to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/apples-new-developer-guidelines-signal-that-scammy-subscription-apps-time-is-up/">release new guidelines</a> aimed at catching developers attempting to use &#8220;dark patterns&#8221; or other deceptive measures in their subscription apps.</p>
<p>One developer, in particular, Kosta Eleftheriou &#8212; who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">filed a lawsuit against</a> Apple over revenue lost to scammers &#8212; has been making it his mission to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou">highlight</a> some of the worst scams on the App Store.</p>
<p>In addition to the scams that impacted his own business, where a rip-off of his Apple Watch app reportedly scammed consumers out of millions, he&#8217;s also uncovered scams that ended up making headlines because of how bold or disastrous they were for the end users. This included a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/30/trezor-scam-bitcoin-1-million/">crypto wallet app that scammed</a> the user out of his life savings (~$600,000) in bitcoin; a kids&#8217; game that actually <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/15/app-store-scam-is-a-kids-game-with-a-hidden-online-casino/">contained a hidden online casino</a>; and a VPN app <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/another-ios-vpn-app-scam-is-uncovered_id131487">that was scamming users out of $5 million</a> per year.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou tells us he&#8217;s now looking into another case of App Store fraud, which he expects to publish soon, where a developer with millions of app downloads has been raking in tens of millions in revenue.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou&#8217;s work has raised questions about how much Apple has invested in fighting App Store fraud. After all, if a single developer can uncover scam after scam in his free time, why can&#8217;t the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/apple/marketcap/">world&#8217;s most valuable</a> company?</p>
<p>In fact, Eleftheriou <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1398726525504036865">even built a system</a> to help him dig up the scams more easily. Called &#8220;Bunco Squad,&#8221; his tool offers a dashboard that displays an app&#8217;s metrics &#8212; like ratings, reviews, downloads and revenue, among other things, and assigns the app a trust score. As many scammers buy fake ratings, it&#8217;s fairly straightforward to locate potential scams by comparing an app&#8217;s overall star rating to a rating calculated only from written reviews.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Eleftheriou tried to publish &#8220;Bunco Squad&#8221; to the App Store, where it was &#8212; not surprisingly &#8212; rejected. Apple told him some of the information the app offered may be inaccurate, he says.</p>
<p>Issues around App Store fraud have even made their way to Congress this year.</p>
<p>Apple had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/apple-downplays-complaints-about-app-store-scams-in-antitrust-hearing/">questioned</a> about its seeming inability to rein in App Store scammers during a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">Senate antitrust hearing</a> in April. The company, in part, has justified the commissions it charges developers because of the work it does to maintain a safe and trusted app marketplace &#8212; which includes fighting fraud on developers&#8217; behalf. The Senators wanted to know why, then, we had to rely on journalists and other &#8220;open source reporting&#8221; (a comment likely referring to public efforts, like those from Eleftheriou), to uncover such App Store scams.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s response at the time was that fighting security and fraud was a &#8220;cat-and-mouse&#8221; game and that it was working to improve.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s announcement, Apple appears to acknowledge that fighting fraud effectively may require public input.</p>
<p>The company also issued a statement, of sorts, in its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j5uyprul">announcement</a> about the App Store change which is likely meant to squash the rumblings that it isn&#8217;t working hard enough on fighting fraud because scam app revenue contributes to App Store profits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Problematic apps diminish the App Store experience for users and developers, and we’re constantly expanding techniques to identify even more types of problematic content for removal. If we suspect that a developer has engaged in purposeful manipulation, fraud or abuse, we will notify them and take action,&#8221; the company said, adding that problematic apps may be removed and their developers may lose their membership in the Apple Developer Program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are deeply committed to protecting users from problematic apps so that the App Store continues to provide an incredible opportunity for all developers,&#8221; Apple added.</p>
