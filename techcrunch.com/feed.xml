					<description><![CDATA[After a decade of a handful of social media companies trading what are essentially publishing tools in exchange for serving us all an endless deluge of ads, the winds of change are finally blowing.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a decade of a handful of dominant social media companies trading what are essentially publishing tools in exchange for serving us all an endless deluge of ads, the winds of change are finally blowing — in a few different directions at once.</p>
<p>Content creators (arguably either a special echelon of influencers or anyone who posts online) are slowly siphoning off some of the power that social media companies have wielded for years. Meanwhile, decentralization is sweeping worlds like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/defi/">finance</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nfts/">art</a>, threatening existing orders and pointing toward a future defined by alternative currencies and digital collectibles. Those trends are bound to converge sooner rather than later, and in some corners of the social internet, it’s already beginning to show.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/houseparty/">Houseparty founder Ben Rubin</a>, now working on a new company called <a href="https://slashtalk.com/">Slashtalk</a>, delved into some of those intersections. Rubin created Meerkat, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/27/the-livestream-goes-mainstream/">the darling social app of SXSW 2015</a>, which later evolved into a spontaneous video chat app known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/the-internet-third-place/">Houseparty</a>. Epic Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty/">bought Houseparty</a> in 2019, but Rubin’s prescience for emerging social trends didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>These days, everyone seems to be abuzz about decentralization. As with any nascent tech trend on the horizon, a lot of jargon gets thrown around. Within the DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFT (non-fungible token) communities, Web3 is the term du jour that captures the revolutionary potential that decentralized networks hold for the future of the internet.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 29, 2021. Welcome to what feels like fall on the East Coast of the United States. Yes, the seasons are changing, but the technology and startup worlds are refusing to shift from the high-velocity pace that they’ve held for what feels like years at this point. Someone should tell them to drink hot tea by a window looking out at trees for a few days instead of doing, well, all that follows in this letter. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google announces slew of search updates: </strong>Alphabet company Google is the world leader on search, but with competition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/can-you-beat-google-with-googles-brains/">starting to nip at its heels</a>, the company is busy rolling out upgrades to its tech. Today the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/google-is-redesigning-search-using-a-i-technologies-and-new-features/">announced some redesign work</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/google-beefs-up-wildfire-tracking-tree-cover-and-plus-codes-in-maps/">better wildfire tracking</a> and an effort to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/google-search-update-will-provide-more-context-about-websites-including-descriptions-and-what-others-say/">bake more context into results</a>. All of that is welcome, but doesn’t cut at the core issue of rising ad loads on prime search real estate.</li>
<li><strong>Direct listings are hot:</strong> Recent public-market debuts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/what-amplitudes-direct-listing-says-about-ipo-pops-and-how-startups-can-avoid-them/">from Amplitude</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/warby-parker-makes-it-clear-that-direct-listings-are-unicorn-friendly/">Warby Parker</a> indicate that the direct-listing route to public-market liquidity is more than open today. For unicorns perhaps uncomfortable with the traditional IPO, it’s more than good news.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/softbank-sinks-200m-into-andela-propels-company-into-unicorn-territory/"><strong>SoftBank pours $200M into Andela:</strong></a> While Tiger is making the largest media waves these days, SoftBank is still busy doing deals. Today the Japanese telco and investing powerhouse announced a deal to put several hundred million dollars into Andela, a startup that connects tech talent from Africa with companies elsewhere in the world. The round fits neatly in the talent crunch narrative we’ve heard so much about from companies in recent quarters and greater global respect for Africa’s tech scene <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">that we’re seeing in venture capital results as well</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into our general startup news roundup, let’s talk climate. Earlier this week TechCrunch put together a deep dive into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech/">the huge opportunities for startups working on climate-related issues</a>, efforts that could improve the world<em> and</em> make piles of money. Today’s news really underscores the point.</p>
<p>Today on TechCrunch we learned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/droneseeds-36m-a-round-makes-it-a-one-stop-shop-for-post-wildfire-reforestation/">about DroneSeed’s $36 million round</a> that could help with habitat restoration post-wildfire; how climate volatility <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/climate-volatility-helps-agtech-platform-semios-raise-100m-round-led-by-morningside/">helped agtech startup Semios land $100 million</a>; and that two new funds (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/investible-launches-100m-aud-fund-for-early-stage-climate-tech-startups/">Investible with AUD$100 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/energize-ventures-raises-330m-to-fund-energy-mobility-and-climate-resiliency-technology/">Energize Ventures with $330 million</a>) are also looking at the climate-tech space.</p>
<p>That’s quite the thematic bundle. Now, the rest of it:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/read-ai-raises-10m-creates-virtual-meeting-dashboard-to-show-you-when-you-talk-too-much/"><strong>Read AI wants to help you shut up:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Are you in lots of video meetings? Do you talk too much? It can’t just be me. Folks dominating conversations is enough of a problem that Read AI is building tech to help meeting attendees track their speaking time and get it under control. The company just raised $10 million to fuel its efforts.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/starfish-space-raises-7m-for-in-orbit-servicing-space-tug/"><strong>Starfish Space is building space tugs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The current space race is not just SpaceX versus whatever else billionaires can cook up. There are a host of startups building for a space-friendly future in which in-space servicing is going to really matter. Starfish just raised $7 million for its work on building space tugs. Which are like tug boats, but smaller, and in orbit. Space tugs! That rules!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tonic-ai-raises-35m-series-b-to-help-engineers-create-synthetic-data-sets/"><strong>Tonic.ai raises $35M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today from the enterprise beat, Tonic just raised a huge grip of cash to grow its service that helps provide engineers with synthetic data sets. What are those? Per TechCrunch, it’s “production-like data” that they can use for testing without annoying regulators both inside and outside their companies. So it’s like lorem ipsum, but for even bigger nerds than lorem ipsum is for, I suppose.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/employee-leave-startup-cocoon-launches-after-raising-20m-in-new-funding/"><strong>Cocoon raises $20M, wins prize in our hearts for having a good name:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Cocoon is building a platform to help employees and employers alike better understand and manage leave. Hence <em>cocoon</em>, aka the thing you spin yourself into when you are not at work. The name is good, the product is neat &#8212; admit it, you don’t really understand your corporate leave policy! &#8212; now let’s see what market appetite is for the startup.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/equitybee-snaps-up-55m-for-a-marketplace-that-connects-employees-with-capital-to-help-them-exercise-their-stock-options/"><strong>VCs want to buy shares in startups working to help workers at venture-backed startups buy shares of their own:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today TechCrunch wrote about EquityBee and its new $55 million investment. The company helps workers at venture-backed companies exercise their options, a process that can be fraught with both tax implications <em>and</em> high cash costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3 questions startups must answer before taking on their largest competitors</h2>
<p>There is no level playing field in capitalism, but it is easier than ever for a scrappy startup to go head-to-head with industry leaders.</p>
<p>Warby Parker is reshaping consumer expectations about eyewear, just as Poshmark and thredUP made a direct run at eBay and the luxury resale market.</p>
<p>In a world where customers are more loyal to value than branding and 18-month roadmaps are the norm, startups that develop solid competitive plans have an advantage, says Sudheesh Nair, CEO of business intelligence company ThoughtSpot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Successful startups will inevitably draw the attention of powerful incumbents in their industry,&#8221; he writes for TechCrunch+. &#8220;They will fight you, but if you are positioned well for the challenge there has never been a better time to prevail.&#8221;</p>

Now it’s taking on videos casting bullshit doubt on <em>any</em> vaccines. Good. This is going to save lives.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/general-motors-new-software-platform-ultifi-is-coming-to-vehicles-starting-in-2023/"><strong>Everyone’s favorite software company General Motors has a new platform dropping in 2023:</strong></a> It’s called Ultifi &#8212; Ult-iffy? Ulti-ee-fee? Ult-ih-fy? &#8212; and TechCrunch reports that the company expects the platform to “usher in a sweeping set of capabilities including giving drivers access to in-car subscriptions and using over-the-air updates to offer new apps and services.” Let’s hope.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/twitch-adds-phone-verified-chat-expands-email-authentication-settings-as-users-face-hate-raids/">Twitch bolsters channel control after hate-raids poison its service:</a></strong> After nasty hate brigading hit a number of Twitch streamers, the Amazon-owned video service announced “new channel-level security features to help curb harassment on the platform.” Good!</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Federal Aviation Administration has closed its &#8220;mishap investigation&#8221; into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">July 11 flight</a> of Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson and three others, the space tourism company&#8217;s first dedicated passenger trip. Future flights will reserve a greater volume of airspace and the company promises better communication, but other than that the company is clear to fly again.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/faa-opens-probe-into-anomaly-on-richard-bransons-virgin-galactic-spaceflight/">The flight anomaly the FAA was looking into</a> was brought to public awareness by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight">a New Yorker article</a> claiming that VSS Unity, the rocket-powered spacecraft that took the passengers to the edge of space, not only left its protected airspace but descended by a more dangerous method than originally planned. This &#8220;red-light entry glide-cone warning&#8221; supposedly resulted from the pilots not ascending fast enough and needing to resort to this alternate method to return — though it was reported that aborting the mission is the preferred move.</p>
<p>Though Virgin Galactic acknowledged at the time that &#8220;high altitude winds&#8221; resulted in a trajectory that &#8220;deviated from our initial plan,&#8221; there was no danger to the occupants. It called the red-light description of the flight &#8220;misleading.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HesgTt60GL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/faa-opens-probe-into-anomaly-on-richard-bransons-virgin-galactic-spaceflight/">FAA opens probe into anomaly on Richard Branson&#8217;s Virgin Galactic spaceflight</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FAA opens probe into anomaly on Richard Branson&#8217;s Virgin Galactic spaceflight&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/faa-opens-probe-into-anomaly-on-richard-bransons-virgin-galactic-spaceflight/embed/#?secret=HesgTt60GL" data-secret="HesgTt60GL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In any event the FAA does not seem to have made an issue of it, though it did not take kindly to the craft leaving its officially designated flight zone, grounding the company&#8217;s aircraft while it looked into the issue. These protected areas are set aside to, among other things, minimize the possibility of damage on the ground, and while Spaceport America is quite far from civilization it&#8217;s not something to play fast and loose with. (Incidentally, as someone who was on the ground there during the flight, I can&#8217;t help but feel a little alarmed in retrospect.)</p>
<p>For future flights, Virgin Galactic will reserve more airspace to accommodate the potential for anomalous trajectories like this one. The FAA was also cross with the company for failing to communicate said anomalous trajectory to it in real time, so new procedures have been added to ensure this takes place next time … and every time.</p>
<p>Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier said in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210929005972/en/Virgin-Galactic-Cleared-to-Fly-Following-Conclusion-of-FAA-Inquiry">statement</a>: &#8220;We appreciate the FAA’s thorough review of this inquiry. Our test flight program is specifically designed to continually improve our processes and procedures.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">“Know your customer” is one of the foundational concepts of business. In the digital age, companies have learned much about their customers by forming individual profiles from third-party cookies, social content, purchased demographics and more. But in the face of growing demands for privacy, businesses have the opportunity to overhaul their relationship with customer data to focus solely on first-party data and patterns of behavior.</p>
<p>Companies have employed digital analytics, advertising and marketing solutions to track customers and connect their behaviors across touch points. This enabled the creation of data profiles, which have been leveraged to deliver personalized experiences that resonate through relevance and context.</p>
<p>Now, however, this practice of profiling and identifying customers is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Regulators are adopting new data and consumer privacy legislation, most recently seen with the <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/2021-colorado-privacy-act-passes-and-4993635/">Colorado Privacy Act</a>. Moreover, Apple’s privacy implementations in iOS 14.8 and iOS 15 have been adopted by <a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-14-5-users-opt-out-of-ad-tracking/">an estimated 96% of users</a>, who have opted to stop apps from tracking their activity for ad targeting. And Google has announced it will no longer support third-party cookies and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-will-stop-selling-ads-based-on-tracked-individual-browsing-history/">will stop tracking on an individual basis altogether through its Chrome browser</a>.</p>
<p>While these developments threaten to upend how digital marketing is performed today, they signal a necessary, and effective, shift in the ways brands will understand their customers in the future. Prioritizing individual profiles is far from the fastest or most effective way to understand and address customers’ intentions, needs and struggles. Brands don’t need to know who; they need to know what and why.</p>
<p>Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), companies can process and interpret first-party data in real time and develop actionable behavioral intelligence.</p>
<h2>Pattern analysis as a way forward</h2>
<p>The security industry, which I’ve been involved in for 35 years, provides a template for the path forward. Historically, security professionals have sought to pinpoint individuals’ signatures in order to identify, thwart or at least prosecute bad actors. However, the last few years have marked the rise of some incredibly promising companies and approaches that leverage patterns of signals to proactively surface and stop threats before they happen.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Warby Parker not only listed, but did so at a price point that was above its final private-market valuation, and its shares appreciated rapidly during its first day of trading.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another day, another direct listing. The once-exotic method of going public is increasingly popular with venture-backed companies as they look to list without running <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/can-direct-listings-really-fix-the-ipo-pricing-problem/">headfirst into the IPO pricing issues</a> that have bedeviled a number of high-profile public offerings in the last year.</p>
<p>Precisely who is underpricing whom in those situations is a fun, if slightly academic, question.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s direct listing was Warby Parker, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/warby-parker-valued-at-3-billion-raises-245-million-in-funding/">heavily venture-backed DTC company</a> in the eyewear space. Warby has long had a strong e-commerce component, though it has a growing retail footprint to support its digital sales efforts.</p>
<p>Warby&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">direct listing</a> has proved a success. The company not only listed, but did so at a price point that was above its final private-market valuation, and its shares appreciated rapidly during its first day of trading. For the DTC market, the results partially combat the odor that <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/casper-stock-falls-below-ipo-price-on-second-day-of-trading/">2020&#8217;s ill-fated Casper IPO</a> left lingering around the startup business model category.</p>
<p>Before we close the books on direct-listing week, a few quick thoughts on the Warby listing. I found a few healthy things in the debut, and one that&#8217;s ever so slightly less sanative. Let&#8217;s have some fun!</p>
<h2>Good news for DTC startups</h2>
<p>In the wake of Casper&#8217;s underpowered and rapidly descending public offering, DTC startups got a bit of a bad rap. Rising channel advertising costs biting more deeply into customer acquisition costs while software revenue multiples scaled to new heights thanks to the pandemic and an accelerating digital transformation made the model of actually making physical goods and selling them to consumers seem a bit old hat.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is expanding its investment in e-commerce. Earlier this year, the video platform began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">piloting TikTok Shopping</a> in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, in partnership with Shopify. The deal allowed Shopify merchants with a TikTok For Business account to add a Shopping tab to their TikTok profiles and sync their product catalogs to the app to create mini-storefronts. Now, TikTok is announcing a slate of new brand partners for TikTok Shopping, including Square, Ecwid and PrestaShop, with Wix, SHOPLINE, OpenCart and BASE coming soon. It also introduced a fuller slate of solutions for TikTok commerce, including ad products and later this year, a TikTok Shopping API.</p>
<p>The company detailed its further plans for TikTok Shopping at an online event called TikTok World on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Here, TikTok shared how popular commerce had become on its platform. For example, it noted that the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag &#8212; which users post when sharing products they had discovered through TikTok videos &#8212; has grown to include 4.6 billion views and is still climbing. The company also touted how well its video could push users from product awareness to action, claiming that, compared with competitors, TikTok users are 1.7 times more likely to have purchased products through the app, citing a survey conducted by <a href="https://www.materialplus.io/">Material</a> in August 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210143" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210143" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210143" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="379" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg 3326w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=1536,856 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=2048,1142 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210143" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok Shopping</p></div></p>
<p>The company said it&#8217;s able to work with online merchants in a couple of different ways. One is a direct integration and full-service shopping solution where TikTok manages everything from shipping to fulfillment and point-of-purchase. This is a system <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/20/this-week-in-apps-sneak-peek-at-tiktok-shopping-new-ios-and-android-betas-kids-app-prodigy-hit-with-ftc-complaint/">TikTok has been testing in Indonesia</a>, as TechCrunch previously reported. It&#8217;s also now available in the U.K.</p>
<p>The second way involves working with third-party commerce partners, like Shopify, who can provide sellers with essential backend tools and support.</p>
<p>Later this year, TikTok said it would also launch a TikTok Shopping API, which will allow businesses to integrate their product catalogs directly into TikTok, and eventually include those products in their organic content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2210145" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210145" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210145" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lipstick-on-tiktok-shopping.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lipstick-on-tiktok-shopping.jpg 3302w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lipstick-on-tiktok-shopping.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lipstick-on-tiktok-shopping.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lipstick-on-tiktok-shopping.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lipstick-on-tiktok-shopping.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lipstick-on-tiktok-shopping.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lipstick-on-tiktok-shopping.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lipstick-on-tiktok-shopping.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210145" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok Shopping</p></div></p>
<p>In the meantime, TikTok will offer businesses a handful of other tools to get their products in front of consumers.</p>
<p>With Product Links, first introduced alongside the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">TikTok Shopping pilot,</a> brands can highlight one or more products directly from an organic TikTok video, which then points users to product detail pages on their own website. This is essentially TikTok&#8217;s version of something like Instagram&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/goals/increase-product-discovery-with-shoppable-photos-and-videos">product tags and stickers.</a></p>
<p>With the new LIVE shopping feature, brands on TikTok can connect with users in the community in real time, and share dynamic links to products and services while the content is streaming live. In the past, Walmart hosted a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">couple</a> of LIVE shopping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">events</a> as a pilot partner on the feature.</p>
<p>The company also now offers a trio of in-feed ad products for online shopping: Collection Ads, Dynamic Showcase Ads (DSAs), and Lead Generation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210152" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210152" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210152" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tiktok-collection-ads.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="381" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tiktok-collection-ads.jpg 3338w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tiktok-collection-ads.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tiktok-collection-ads.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tiktok-collection-ads.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tiktok-collection-ads.jpg?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tiktok-collection-ads.jpg?resize=1536,860 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tiktok-collection-ads.jpg?resize=2048,1146 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Tiktok-collection-ads.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210152" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (Collection Ad)</p></div></p>
<p>Collection Ads are a new ad product that allows brands to include custom, swipeable product cards in their in-feed videos. Each card can feature a different product for sale and, when tapped, brings users to a fast-loading instant gallery page where TikTok users can browse items and make a purchase. This type of ad can be used to drive traffic to a merchant&#8217;s website, and can be particularly useful for things like limited-time deals, seasonal sales and recent launches. TikTok cited one case study with a brand called Princess Polly which saw a 6x return on ad spend and an over 50% increase on overall product page visits with the ad.</p>
<p>Dynamic Showcase Ads are another new product, and allow brands to promote thousands (or even millions) of product SKUs via personalized video ads. DSA will generate video ads that target specific audiences based on their interests and commerce activities, such as adding items to a cart or viewing a product. TikTok has created a suite of DSA templates that follow the platform&#8217;s creative principles of offering creative clips with music and text overlays. TikTok claims early DSA tests indicate the templates are driving higher click-through rates and conversion rates for advertisers but didn&#8217;t share metrics. On this effort, it&#8217;s partnered with video marketing company SHAKR, plus Productsup and feedonomics which can help integrate product catalogs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210161" style="width: 581px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210161" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210161" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TikTok-DSA.jpg?w=571" alt="" width="571" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TikTok-DSA.jpg 1578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=126,150 126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=252,300 252w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=768,914 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=571,680 571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=1291,1536 1291w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210161" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (DSA)</p></div></p>
<p>Lead Generation, meanwhile, continues to be available within in-feed video ads offering brands an easy way to collect information from TikTok users through online forms. These ads are best for businesses that have longer sales cycles, like audio and education. It has also partnered with Zapier and LeadsBridge to automatically connect a brand&#8217;s CRM to TikTok for a lead-generation campaign. In a test with Southeast Asian marketplace Lazada, nearly half of the users who signed up on a form during the first week of a lead-gen campaign ended up selling on the marketplace, TikTok says.</p>

<p>Combined, this suite of solutions is what makes up TikTok Shopping.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future of commerce on TikTok is a shopping experience that allows brands of all sizes to tap into the enthusiasm of our user base,&#8221; said TikTok Shopping Head of Product Javier Irigoyen. &#8220;The magic of TikTok happens in the For You page, where e-commerce content is recommended to our users in the same way as short videos and live streams. TikTok is a place where users and brands can connect directly, and where an end-to-end shopping experience can happen organically. That&#8217;s the basis on which we&#8217;re building a long-term commerce division,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is rolling out Ultifi, a new end-to-end software platform in vehicles starting in 2023 that executives say will usher in a sweeping set of capabilities, including giving drivers access to in-car subscription and using over-the-air updates to offer new apps and services.</p>
<p>The software platform can be used to give owners greater access to all the functions of a vehicle right down to the sensors. For instance, a driver would be able to automatically set child locks if the car cameras detect children in the backseat. Ultifi will also give drivers access to subscription services, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/">Super Cruise</a>, the company’s hands-free advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="30BxOsnDIf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/">GM is bringing its upgraded hands-free Super Cruise driving system to 6 vehicles in 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM is bringing its upgraded hands-free Super Cruise driving system to 6 vehicles in 2022&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/embed/#?secret=30BxOsnDIf" data-secret="30BxOsnDIf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“It’s a big next step in our software strategy,” Scott Miller, GM’s VP of software-defined vehicles said in a press briefing. “Today cars are enabled by software. With Ultifi, they&#8217;re going to be defined by it.”</p>
<p>The platform will be built on top of the company’s vehicle intelligence platform, or VIP, which is the underlying hardware architecture that provides greater data processing power. While vehicles equipped with VIP are already capable of over-the-air software updates, GM says Utlifi will enable faster updates by centralizing all the vehicle&#8217;s modules on a single platform.</p>
<p>Ultifi will be integrated alongside Android Automotive, the OS embedded in some GM infotainment systems. (Android Automotive OS is separate from Android Auto, which is a secondary interface that lies on top of the operating system.) The difference between the two comes down to capability and availability: “Android Automotive is a certain subset of functionality in the car,” Miller explained. “Ultifi is more of an umbrella overall strategy.”</p>
<p>Like Android, Ultifi will be Linux-based, a widely used developer platform. Miller said GM chose Linux because “at some point we really want to open this up” to authorize third-party developers to launch in-car apps, Miller said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ultifi, which is still in development, will start rolling out in 2023 and will be available exclusively to those vehicles and beyond, due to the computing demands of the system. Customers can either purchase the vehicle or purchase different access plans, like how consumers purchase different plans for their smartphone, Miller said. That means varying prices and varying plans, though GM didn’t go into any specifics. Nor did it disclose how much revenue it expects the new platform to generate.</p>
<p>This is just the latest move by major automakers to make new vehicles more connected than ever before. Both General Motors and Ford have discussed the revenue-generating opportunities in software and subscription services, and Ultifi is another step toward building out those businesses.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re not transitioning away from vehicles,” Miller said. “We&#8217;re expanding our business. Opportunities to generate new lines of business to expand and leverage technology for other applications isn&#8217;t in lieu of our core, it&#8217;s in addition to [it].”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://investible.com/">Investible</a>, the Sydney-based early-stage venture firm known for investments in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/">Canva</a> and other top Australian startups, announced today it is raising a $100 million AUD (about $72.3 million USD) Climate Tech Fund. This is the first time Investible has launched a sector-focused fund. Its first two funds, <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/early-stage-tech-start-ups-get-new-50m-fund-20210610-p5802">including a $50 million AUD one</a> closed earlier this year, were both sector-agnostic.</p>
<p>Last month, Investible also said it will launch <a href="https://investible.com/greenhouse/">Greenhouse</a>, a growth and innovation hub for climate tech startups, in partnership with the City of Sydney. Once it opens next year, Greenhouse will bring together startups, researchers, academics and corporations, including climate tech companies outside of Investible’s portfolio.</p>
<p>“It’s about helping them go from startup to scale, and so some of that will be additional research to improve their technology or engaging corporates to understand what exactly they are looking for and also finding their next customers,” said Tom Kline, one of the heads of the Climate Tech Fund.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="d7vPgjrKEq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/">Canva raises $200 million at a $40 billion valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canva raises $200 million at a $40 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/embed/#?secret=d7vPgjrKEq" data-secret="d7vPgjrKEq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The fund will invest in seed rounds, but reserve half of its capital for follow-on funding. It will primarily back Australian companies, but also plans to devote up to 30% of the fund to international companies. It is focused on the six sectors <a href="https://www.unep.org/interactive/six-sector-solution-climate-change/">identified by the United Nations Environment Programme</a> as the most important for reducing climate change and global warming: energy, transport, industry, buildings and cities, food and agriculture, and forests and land use.</p>
<p>The fund will be led by Kline, former chief executive officer of renewable energy manager <a href="https://www.newenergysolar.com.au/">New Energy Solar</a>, and Patrick Sieb, who has invested in tech companies since 2014 and focused specifically on climate tech startups since 2019.</p>
<p>“With each passing year, we’re noticing that we need to do more in the space, and coming from the other end, Investible sees deal flow of between 1,500 to 2,000 a year, and an increasing amount of those have been climate focused,” Kline told TechCrunch about the firm’s decision to launch a climate-focused fund after being sector-agnostic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added that more people are paying attention to climate change and it’s driving consumer choices and prompting corporations to become more transparent. More governments are also setting targets that will require significant technology — and capital — to achieve.</p>
<p>Investible’s climate fund will typically participate in seed rounds starting from about $1.5 million AUD, contributing up to 30%, so about $500,000 AUD. Follow-on checks could be up to several million dollars.</p>
<p>The fund will use the same investment process as Investible’s sector-agnostic funds, but with climate-focused criteria. For example, it may look at how much emissions it can reduce, the founding team, opportunity size and how long it will take to develop and monetize its tech.</p>
<p>“Scientists have been talking about climate change for decades and there’s been a lot of debate, but I think we’re finally at the stage where the debate is over and people are acknowledging that this is human-caused and we really must take action this decade,” said Kline.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m an entrepreneur working on building up my qualifications for the EB-1A green card (or maybe an O-1A). </strong></p>
<p><strong>Toward that goal, I’ve been trying to get media coverage about my startup, but it’s competitive out there! Any advice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Craving Coverage</strong></p>
<p>Dear Craving,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out! Yesterday was the <a href="https://twitter.com/Sophie_Alcorn/status/1442942339903672321">six-year anniversary</a> of my law firm, and shortly after I founded it, I set a personal challenge: to achieve the level of success that would qualify me (if I needed a U.S. green card) to meet the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A</a> criteria as a person of “extraordinary ability.” What right did I have to expect this of my clients if I couldn’t achieve it myself?</p>
<p>Starting from scratch (my kids were young, I had taken a multiyear career break, and I didn’t have a network in Silicon Valley), it took me about two years to reach this level of success (and it was also a great marketing plan for my firm).</p>
<p>So, I know this from experience: Achieving the level of success required for an EB-1A or <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/o-1a-extraordinary-ability/">O-1A</a> is totally possible. And remember, you only need to meet at least three of the criteria to qualify!</p>

<h2>Offer your expertise</h2>
<p>The key is to be strategic about getting media coverage. Know the audience of the trade publication or major media outlet where you’re seeking coverage and figure out the type of stories that get their interest.</p>
<p>Generally, reporters like to be the first to break news or to get an exclusive story, so consider offering a scoop about a significant multimillion-dollar deal involving your company or a story idea, such as an emerging trend in your field or a unique perspective on a big issue, to one reporter to start. If that reporter isn’t interested, move on to another.</p>
<p>One service that can help technology entrepreneurs is <a href="https://www.ellisx.com/">EllisX</a>, which helps founders get coverage for their startups in articles and podcasts and secure speaking engagements. Or you can try to cultivate a relationship on your own with a journalist who writes about your field. Offer yourself as a resource to explain new developments or challenging issues in your field. I took this approach when I began working on meeting the EB-1A criteria, and I soon found myself being quoted as an expert on immigration in publications around the globe — and that led to me writing this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/sophie-alcorn/">weekly column</a>!</p>
<p>Remember, for O-1A and EB-1A immigration purposes, newsletters and press releases that were never published in a major publication, as well as articles in student-run or university publications, usually don’t count.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitch announced today that it will add new channel-level security features to help curb harassment on the platform. Now, creators and moderators can enable verified chat, requiring chatters to validate their phone and/or email before they can send messages. These settings can be toggled to enable verified chat for all accounts, first-time chatters, those under a certain account age or ones that haven&#8217;t been following the streamer for a chosen amount of time. These settings will be turned off by default until the channel opts in, and there are also settings to ensure that VIPs, subscribers and moderators can bypass verification. Unlike two-factor authentication, a user only needs to verify their phone or email once before they&#8217;re considered verified across all channels.</p>
<p>Twitch users can link up to five accounts to the same phone number, but if one is banned from a channel, all accounts verified with that phone number or email address will be banned too. The intention is to prevent people from creating multiple hate accounts under one phone number or email, so the streamer just has to block someone once, rather than five times. On a sitewide level, if a phone-verified account is suspended, linked accounts will also be suspended. While it&#8217;s possible to simply use another phone number, like a Google Voice account, this adds an extra layer of difficulty for bad actors.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Tensions are high in the Twitch community as underrepresented creators, particularly those who are Black or LGTBQ+, are facing targeted harassment through Twitch&#8217;s raid system. Sometimes, when a streamer goes offline, they&#8217;ll surprise another streamer by sending their fans over to check out their channel in a &#8220;raid.&#8221; This feature is designed to help established streamers support up-and-comers. But over the past several months, bad actors have used the raid feature to send bots that spew targeted harassment at creators during their streams. </span></p>
<p>In May, Twitch launched 350 new channel tags related to gender, sexual orientation, race and ability, which users <a href="https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/310210-discover/suggestions/37011022-trans-tag-request">requested</a> to discover more representative creators. But some people weaponized tags to target marginalized streamers, and Twitch didn&#8217;t have comprehensive enough tools to curb this harassment &#8212; some creators even developed their own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools">home-brewed safety tools</a>, like a &#8220;panic button&#8221; that launches a series of chat commands. These streamers prompted Twitch to take action with the hashtag #TwitchDoBetter. Then, earlier this month, streamers like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciaeverblack">LuciaEverblack</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/shineypen">ShineyPen</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rekitraven">RekItRaven</a> (who started the tag), launched #ADayOffTwitch, a day-long boycott of the site.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids/">#ADayOffTwitch action</a> came with demands.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The #ADayOffTwitch action came with demands. Participating streamers wanted the ability to control incoming raids and asked Twitch to implement age restrictions, email signup limits and share a time frame for when comprehensive anti-harassment tools will be implemented. </span>Soon after, the platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/twitch-hate-raids-lawsuits/">pursued legal action</a> against two users linked to thousands of bot accounts used for hate raids.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement helps address one of these demands, but in an email to TechCrunch, Twitch said that it has been developing, testing and refining phone-verified chat long before the hate raids became so frequent. Still, community feedback from <a href="https://twitch.uservoice.com/forums/933812-safety">UserVoice</a> and its Ambassadors Discord also helped inspire these additions, and Twitch said in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/09/29/securing-your-chat-with-phone-and-email-verification/">blog post</a> that it will roll out other channel-level ban-evasion tools soon. It also noted that streamers already have <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Combating-Targeted-Attacks?language=en_US">the option</a> to only accept raids from friends, teammates and followed channels. The service hasn&#8217;t made public its timelines for rolling out safety features, possibly because it can give bad actors more information about what Twitch is planning and how to evade it.</p>
<p>Creators can access these new settings by navigating to <a href="https://dashboard.twitch.tv/settings/moderation" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dashboard.twitch.tv/settings/moderation&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632943811939000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHyqqgC_Nh7AxsetNNuHCNnkRp3hg">Dashboard → Settings → Moderation</a>. Moderators can do so via &#8220;Manage Moderation Settings&#8221; in Chat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/search-on-2021/">introduced</a> new ways to shop through its platform, including both online and via its Google Search mobile app. In an update coming soon to the Google Search app for iPhone, the company will begin to leverage a new machine learning model using on-device processing to recognize the products found in images on a website to make them instantly &#8220;shoppable.&#8221; It will also make it easier for online shoppers to browse for clothing and accessories from the search results and check for in-stock items at local stores.</p>
<p>On the Google mobile app for iOS, users will soon see a new button that turns the images on a website into shoppable products through Google Lens. That means, if you&#8217;re browsing a website and something catches your eye in a photograph, you can click to see where to buy the item in question. This sort of feature is an expansion of the existing Google Lens technology, which can already identify products in images. It&#8217;s just adding it to a new context.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210082" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210082" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search_On_Lens_Mode.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210082" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google Lens will also come to Chrome on the desktop, Google says, allowing users to select the images, video and text content on a website with Lens to see the search results in the same tab.</p>
<p>In another update, when you&#8217;re browsing for clothing, shoes and accessories on mobile, Google will make it easier to shop from its Search results.</p>
<p>Here, it will display a visual feed of products matching your query &#8212; like &#8220;cropped jackets,&#8221; for example &#8212; in multiple colors and styles. And it will show you style guides, videos and details on where you can buy the items locally. You can also filter the results by style, department, brand and more, plus check ratings and reviews and compare prices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210092" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210092" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2210092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/E918_Search_On_storyboards_Browsy_Shopping_nl_1.gif?w=680" alt="" width="544" height="544" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210092" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google notes this experience is powered by its &#8220;Shopping Graph,&#8221; a real-time data set of product inventory that today consists of more than 24 billion listings.</p>
<p>This will also help shoppers when they&#8217;re looking to buy in-person, as you can select an &#8220;in stock&#8221; filter to see which nearby stores have your item available right now. This could be particularly useful ahead of the busy holiday shopping season to help people shop for gifts and children&#8217;s toys.</p>
<p>The updates were announced today at Google&#8217;s <a href="https://searchon.withgoogle.com/live/">Search On</a> event, where the company also detailed other product updates to Maps, Lens and Search, including those that leverage new AI enhancements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is making a change to its search results with the goal of improving the media literacy of online users. The company is expanding the capabilities of its &#8220;About this Result&#8221; feature, launched earlier this year, to also now include information about the source itself, including its description from Wikipedia and what the site says about itself, as well as news, reviews and other context that can help people better evaluate unfamiliar or new sources. It will also point users to other information about the same topic, to point users to other sources of information that may be related to the user&#8217;s original query.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/google-now-gives-you-more-information-about-the-sites-in-your-search-results/">introduced</a> &#8220;About this Result&#8221; in February to its search results in English in the U.S., with a short description pulled from Wikipedia, if available, when the site first came online, and if your connection to the website was secure, among other things.</p>
<p>It will soon update this panel with more details. Instead of just a description of the site from Wikipedia, it will now also include what a website says about itself, in its own words. This information is pulled directly from the website, when available. Often, a site includes details about its authors, publishers or its purpose in an &#8220;about section&#8221; that introduces the website to new visitors. This information will now be extracted to enhance the &#8220;About the Source&#8221; panel with more details.</p>
<p>Below this, Google will display when the site first came online &#8212; a piece of information that could help users identify websites that have sustained themselves over a longer period of time, versus newcomers that may have popped up more recently as part of recent misinformation or propaganda campaign.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210071" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2210071 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="372" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg 2822w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=1536,840 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1121 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210071" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google will also connect users to more information about the source itself, as indexed across the web. Here, people can analyze what others are saying about the site in question, whether that&#8217;s news outlets, reviews, trusted organizations like the Better Business Bureau and more. This could help people learn what sort of reputation the website has online, as documented by other sources.</p>
<p>The company clarifies this section of &#8220;others&#8221; will be based on Google Results from the open web, which identify pages that may give you context about the website. Google also attempts to prioritize the helpful results which are not created or controlled by the source website in order to provide independent perspectives, it says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition, Google will add an &#8220;About the Topic&#8221; feature that will point web searchers to more information about their original query, including top news coverage or other search results about that same subject. This could help people learn more about something they&#8217;re interested in. But it could also potentially prevent people from isolating themselves inside a so-called &#8220;filter bubble&#8221; &#8212; something that has become a significant complication of the social media era, where people aren&#8217;t exposed to other sources of information as their preferred social platforms learn their preferences, then feeds them more of the same to boost engagement.</p>
<p>The updates were announced today by Danielle Romain, Google&#8217;s VP of Trust, who was speaking at Google&#8217;s <a href="https://searchon.withgoogle.com/live/">Search On</a> live event.</p>
<p>The feature is not immediately available but will roll out in the &#8220;coming weeks&#8221; in English in the United States. Google says it working to bring &#8220;About this Result&#8221; to more countries in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has updates for a handful of tools aimed at helping people use Maps for more, or get on them in the first place. The company is improving wildfire tracking, expanding a tool for calculating tree canopy cover in cities and further automating virtual address creation with Plus Codes.</p>
<p>The wildfires will be of the most immediate use to most users, since the once rare disaster has evolved into its own recurring season. Google put out <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/mapping-wildfires-with-satellite-data/">a wildfire tracking tool last year</a> for people searching for those fires — so when you looked for &#8220;camp fire&#8221; or the like, it wouldn&#8217;t just serve news but a frequently updated info center complete with fire authorities&#8217; best guess at a live outline.</p>
<p>Now that information is coming to the Maps app as a layer like traffic or bike paths. When you turn it on, any nearby fires will be marked on the map, and tapping one will bring up its live outline as of an hour or so ago. Areas at risk are also marked, so you know if somewhere is safe to drive through or stay in. Helpful stuff, considering wildfires are so numerous and dangerous that it&#8217;s hard to keep track of them now.</p>

<p>In cities, Google has provided its &#8220;<a href="https://insights.sustainability.google/labs/treecanopy">Environmental Insights Explorer Tree Canopy tool</a>&#8221; to 15 U.S. cities, using aerial imagery to identify heat islands and other risk areas. Municipalities can use this to plan where to plant new trees or otherwise dedicate resources. First tested in LA, the tool will now expand to 100 cities around the globe, including Guadalajara, London, Sydney, Toronto and Tokyo.</p>
<p>Another kind of data municipal authorities sometimes don&#8217;t have, especially in sparsely populated rural or fast-changing urban environments, is addresses. It sounds odd that a place might just not have an address, but streets and numbers do after all have to be assigned, registered, tracked and used in order for things like mail and deliveries to arrive. Poorer and rural areas are often at risk of having to just use a nearby official address and rely on extra instructions or a knowledgeable delivery person to get mail reliably.</p>
<p>Several years back Google introduced &#8220;Plus Codes,&#8221; which are basically GPS coordinates tied to a short series of letters and numbers that can be entered into lots of online address services, including of course Google Maps. Even if you don&#8217;t have an actual street address, you can have a Plus Code and it ought to be enough to get someone to your door.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209689" style="width: 897px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209689" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2209689" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg" alt="A remote cabin with a popup above it showing a Google &quot;plus code&quot; that acts as an address." width="887" height="612" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg 887w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg?resize=768,530 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg?resize=680,469 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pluscode.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 887px) 100vw, 887px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2209689" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now they&#8217;ve partnered with several local governments struggling to assign addresses in a regular way, integrating Plus Codes with the official machinery of governance. In The Gambia and Kenya, for instance, the Plus Codes will work for national ID cards and other purposes that would normally require a government-verified address. To be clear, the information is owned and administrated by the government, not Google, which just helps generate the codes and integrate them with existing online infrastructure. (There&#8217;s a new <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/addressmaker/">bulk creation tool</a> that helps generate street directions as well.)</p>
<p>All these tools emphasize Google&#8217;s interest in public-private partnerships — a cynic may think that they simply want to get their hooks in every aspect of life, but really the company, despite its advertising and surveillance business model, has always pushed projects like this. It genuinely hopes to transform industries and governments, and occasionally has some success doing it. At the very least these projects seem to lack much in the way of self-interest and could be quite useful to people around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google announced today it will be applying AI advancements, including a new technology called <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/introducing-MUM/">Multitask Unified Model (MUM)</a> to improve Google Search. At the company&#8217;s <a href="https://searchon.withgoogle.com/live/">Search On</a> event, the company demonstrated new features, including those that leverage MUM, to better connect web searchers to the content they&#8217;re looking for, while also making web search feel more natural and intuitive.</p>
<p>One of the features being launched is called &#8220;Things to know,&#8221; which will focus on making it easier for people to understand new topics they&#8217;re searching for. This feature understands how people typically explore various topics and then shows web searchers the aspects of the topic people are most likely to look at first.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209223" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209223" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search-On-Things-to-Know.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>For example, Google explained, if you were searching for &#8220;acrylic painting,&#8221; it may suggest &#8220;Things to know&#8221; like how to get started with painting, step-by-step, or the different styles of acrylic painting, tips about acrylic painting, how to clean acrylic paint, and more. In this example, Google is able to identify over 350 different topics related to acrylic painting, it notes.</p>
<p>This feature will launch in the coming months, but Google notes it will also be expanded in the future by using MUM to help web users unlock even deeper insights into the topic beyond what they may have thought to look for &#8212; like &#8220;how to make acrylic paintings with household items.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209221" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209221" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209221" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search-On-Visual-Ideas.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209221" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The company is also developing new ways to help web users both refine and broaden their searches without having to start over with a new query.</p>
<p>To continue the acrylic painting example, Google may offer to connect you to information about specific painting techniques, like puddle pouring, or art classes you could take. You could then zoom into one of those other topics in order to see a visually rich page of search results and ideas from across the web, including articles, images, videos and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210054" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210054" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2210054 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="388" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg 2806w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=768,438 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=680,388 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=1536,876 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1168 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210054" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>These pages are meant to better compete with Pinterest, it seems, as they&#8217;re also able to help people become inspired by searches &#8212; similar to how Pinterest&#8217;s image-heavy pinboard aims to turn people&#8217;s visual inspiration into action &#8212; like visiting a website or making an online purchase.</p>
<p>Google says the pages will be useful for searches where users are &#8220;looking for inspiration,&#8221; like &#8220;Halloween decorating ideas&#8221; or &#8220;indoor vertical garden ideas&#8221; or other ideas to try. This feature can be tried out today on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Google is also upgrading video search. Already, the company uses AI to identify key moments inside a video. Now, it will take things further with the launch of a feature that will identify the topics in a video &#8212; even if the topic isn&#8217;t explicitly mentioned in the video &#8212; then provide links that allow users to dig deeper and learn more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209224" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209224" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209224" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search-On-Related-Topics-in-Videos.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209224" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>That means when you&#8217;re watching a YouTube video, MUM will be used to understand what the video is about and make suggestions. In an example, a video about Macaroni penguins may point users to a range of related videos, like those that talk about how Macaroni penguins find their family members and navigate predators. MUM can identify these terms to search for, even if they&#8217;re not explicitly said in the video.</p>
<p>This feature will roll out in an initial version on YouTube Search in the weeks ahead, and will be updated to include more visual enhancements in the coming months, says Google.</p>
<p>This change could also help to drive increased search traffic to Google, by leveraging YouTube&#8217;s sizable reach. Many Gen Z users already search for online content differently than older generations, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-gen-z-searches-for-content">studies have found</a>. They tend to use multiple social media channels, have a mobile-first mindset and are engaged with video content. <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/gen-z-and-youtube/">A &#8220;Think with Google&#8221; study,</a> for instance, found that 85% of Gen Z teenagers would use YouTube regularly to find content, while 80% said YouTube videos had successfully taught them something. Other data had <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/gen-z-stats">demonstrated</a> that Gen Z prefers to learn about new ideas and products through video as well, not text, native ads or other content formats.</p>
<p>For Google, this sort of addition may be necessary because the shift to mobile is impacting its search dominance. Today, many mobile shopping searches today <a href="https://britewire.com/amazon-beats-google-in-product-searches/">now start directly</a> on Amazon. Plus, when iPhone users need to do something specific on their phone, they often turn to Siri, Spotlight, the App Store, or a native app to get help.</p>
<p>Google also today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/google-introduces-a-new-way-to-search-that-combines-images-and-text-into-one-query">unveiled</a> how it&#8217;s using MUM technology to improve visual searches using Google Lens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, at Google&#8217;s I/O annual developer conference, the company <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/introducing-MUM/">introduced</a> a new AI milestone called Multitask Unified Model, or MUM. This technology can simultaneously understand information across a wide range of formats, including text, images and videos, and draw insights and connections between topics, concepts and ideas. Today, Google announced one of the ways it&#8217;s planning to put MUM to work in its own products with an update to its Google Lens visual search.</p>
<p><a href="https://lens.google/">Google Lens</a> is the company&#8217;s image recognition technology which lets you use the phone&#8217;s camera to perform a variety of tasks, like real-time translation, identifying plants and animals, copying and pasting from photos, finding items similar items to what&#8217;s in the camera&#8217;s viewfinder, getting help with math problems and much more.</p>
<p>Soon, Google says it will leverage MUM&#8217;s capabilities to upgrade Google Lens with the ability to add text to visual searches in order to allow users to ask questions about what they see.</p>
<p>In practice, this is how such a feature could work. You could pull up a photo of a shirt you like in Google Search, then tap on the Lens icon and ask Google to find you the same pattern &#8212; but on a pair of socks. By typing in something like &#8220;socks with this pattern,&#8221; you could direct Google to find relevant queries in a way that may have been more difficult to do if you had only used text input alone.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209102" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209102" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209102" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search-On-MUM-x-Lens-Shirt-Example.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209102" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>This could be particularly useful for the type of queries that Google today struggles with &#8212; where there&#8217;s a visual component to what you&#8217;re looking for that is either hard to describe using words alone or that could be described in different ways. By combining the image and the words into one query, Google may have a better shot at delivering relevant search results.</p>
<p>In another example, a part of your bike has been broken and you need to search on Google for repair tips. However, you don&#8217;t know what the piece is called. Instead of delving into repair manuals, you could point Google Lens at the broken part of your bike, then type in &#8220;how to fix.&#8221; This could connect you directly with the exact moment in a video that could help.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209100" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209100" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209100" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Search-On-MUM-x-Lens-Bike-Example.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209100" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>The company sees these AI-driven initiatives as ways to make its products &#8220;more helpful&#8221; to end-users by enabling new ways to search. By making use of the phone&#8217;s camera as part of Search, Google is aiming to stay relevant in a market where many of its core use cases are starting to shift to other properties. For instance, many shopping searches today <a href="https://britewire.com/amazon-beats-google-in-product-searches/">now start directly</a> on Amazon. And when iPhone users need to do something specific on their phone, they often just turn to Siri, Spotlight, the App Store or a native app to get help. And Apple is<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/28/apple-steps-up-effort-to-build-google-search-alternative.html"> developing</a> its own alternative to Google Search as well. You could see the beginnings of this work in the iOS 15 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-spotlight/">update to Spotlight search</a>, which now directly connects users to the information they need without the need for a Google query.</p>
<p>Google says it&#8217;s also putting MUM to work in other ways across Google Search and video searches, the company announced at its <a href="https://searchon.withgoogle.com/live/">Search On</a> live event today.</p>
<p>The Google Lens update will roll out in the months ahead, noting that it still needs to go through &#8220;rigorous testing and evaluation,&#8221; which is a part of every new AI model that its deploys.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Successful startups will inevitably draw the attention of powerful incumbents in their industry. They will fight you, but if you are positioned well for the challenge there has never been a better time to prevail.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Your advantage is that you can add value to your core technology and get it into the hands of customers faster than an existing large corporation usually can.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In recent years, we’ve seen startups overcome seemingly insurmountable odds to redefine industries that had been stagnant for decades. Three key factors are tilting the balance in favor of emerging players:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cycle of creative destruction is shorter than ever. Gone are the days of five-year plans; they’ve been replaced by 12-18-month roadmaps that favor the agile.</li>
<li>Customer loyalty has waned. Even the most entrenched businesses and industries are willing to try something new to stay competitive.</li>
<li>Portability and the cloud have permanently altered user expectations of their technology providers. Vendor lock-in is no longer an option.</li>
</ul>
<p>What separates the successful from the rest is understanding how to compete with established companies that seem to have major advantages at every turn. The success of startups in recent years, particularly during the uncertainty of the pandemic, is testimony to this. We can learn a lot from companies like Twilio, Snowflake and Zoom about how asking the right questions and developing a competitive plan can lead to success.</p>
<h2>Are you an improver or a disrupter?</h2>
<p>Most startups follow one of two paths, and the first step is to determine which one you’re on. The first path is traveled by improvers — those who see an opportunity to make an existing dynamic better. The other is traveled by disruptors, startups that believe the current way of doing things should fundamentally change. Established companies have playbooks for battling both, but knowing who you are and what you’re about will allow you to stay on the offensive in the right way.</p>
<p>The immediate challenge for improvers is to find relevance in an established market. Not only do you have to be exponentially better than the competition, you have to find a way to prove it. For disruptors, it’s about convincing prospects that they’re going about things the wrong way — and doing so without being confrontational. Beyond that, the playbook for taking on your industry&#8217;s giants is similar.</p>
<p>Here’s how it will play out:</p>
<p><strong>What to expect:</strong> At the outset, the big vendors will ignore you. They will tell their customers that you provide an unnecessary service — if they recognize you at all. Getting a foot in the door here is the first major obstacle. Your challenge is to find someone within the organization willing to take a chance on what you have to offer and to demonstrate an improvement they can’t ignore.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the greatest challenges for farmers today is the increasing volatility in the climate, leading to unpredictable weather patterns, making growing conditions challenging. If farmers can’t grow crops, then our food security is as risk. Gradually, the field of agtech is attempting to address this issue.</p>
<p>There are increasing numbers of FaaS (farming as a service) startups that are looking to help farmers manage crop yields and plug into IoT sensors or data such as weather platforms. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/sencrop-is-a-data-platform-to-help-farmers-manage-their-lands/">Sencrop</a> from France has raised $12 million, Augmenta (Greece) is a yield boosting platform that has raised $11.2 million and Ekylibre (France) is an open source ERP for farmers which has raised an undisclosed Series A.</p>
<p>Coming out of Vancouver, Canada is <a href="https://semios.com/">Semios</a>, a “precision-farming” startup and one of the world’s largest independent agtech platforms. It has now raised $100 million in funding led by Morningside Group, a Boston-based private equity and impact VC firm.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gilbert, CEO of Semios, said: “Semios is on a mission to simplify the grower’s experience, leveraging big data analytics and machine learning to help them mitigate crop risk so they can focus on growing more food, more sustainably. We have seen first hand the challenges our customers are facing in the field &#8212; from severe drought and devastating fires, to frost, reduced profitability and an increasing regulatory burden.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if he thought there were competitors to his platform, Gilbert said: &#8220;There are numerous companies that provide elements of our comprehensive solution but we&#8217;re unaware of anyone who&#8217;s currently offering an integrated end-to-end solution that addresses the gamut of farmers&#8217; crop production requirements including annual planning, insect and disease control, water management through to regulatory reporting and compliance tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Semios has now raised a total of over $225 million in external capital to date, after a $100 million round, also led by Morningside Group, back in February 2020. This allowed it to go on an acquisition spree, rolling-up other third-party agricultural solutions into its crop management platform, including Altrac, Centricity and Agworld in 2021.</p>
<p>Mick Sawka, Morningside Investment Manager, commented: &#8220;Morningside invests in companies committed to tackling pressing global challenges head on. The ability to not only maintain but also enhance the sustainability of our food systems amid the complex dynamics of a changing climate is one of the world’s most pressing needs of our time.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Semios now has customers in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe and South Africa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of…no, hold on, hold on. It’s not time to watch your favorite soap opera. It’s time to stop procrastinating and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy your pass</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> before the early-bird price expires promptly on <strong>October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>. That’s in just three days, people.</p>
<p>Action earns rewards, and if you beat the deadline, guess what? You get to keep $100 in your wallet. Save money <em>and</em> learn ways to build a better startup. Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Take advantage of the early-bird group discount. Buy four or more passes before the deadline expires and pay just $45 each. We also have student passes available for $35 right up to the day of the event.</p>
<p>SaaS savants from around the world will hold forth on the latest tech and investment trends, demo innovative, boundary-breaking SaaS tech and connect with founders, investors, engineers and entrepreneurs. Oh, and don’t forget the tech journalists who will be searching for great stories to tell. Will yours be one of them?</p>
<p>TC Sessions are famous for outstanding programming with industry leaders, movers and shakers, and you can expect the same with our first SaaS Session. Here are just three of the presentations we have teed up. Check <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#7a03cea7-ab64-4f3a-8846-1ec1e65647f6">the event agenda</a> and start planning your day. We’ll be adding more content in the run-up to game day.</p>
<p><strong>Survival of the Fittest — Investing in Today’s SaaS Market:</strong> The venture capital world is faster and more competitive than ever. Things are even crazier for investors hoping to get into the hottest SaaS deal. With non-traditional money pouring into the sector, remote dealmaking now the norm and an increasingly global market for software startups, venture capitalists have been forced to shake up their own operations and expectations. TechCrunch sits down with three leading investors — Casey Aylward (Costanoa Ventures), Kobie Fuller (Upfront Ventures) and Sarah Guo (Greylock) — to discuss how they’re fighting for allocation in hot deals, what they’ve changed in their own processes and what today’s best founders demand.</p>
<p><strong>Automation&#8217;s Moment Is Now:</strong> One thing we learned during the pandemic is the importance of automation, and that’s only likely to become more pronounced as we move forward. We’ll talk with UiPath CEO Daniel Dines, Laela Sturdy, an investor at CapitalG, and Dave Wright from ServiceNow about why this is automation’s moment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>What Happens After Your Startup Is Acquired:</strong> During this panel, we’ll speak to three founders — Jyoti Bansal (AppDynamics), Jewel Burks Solomon (Partpic) and Nick Mehta (GainSight) — about the emotional upheaval of being acquired and what happens after the check clears and the sale closes.</p>
<p>We’re less than one month away from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=3dayslefttosavepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a>, but your chance to save $100 on the price of admission disappears in just three days. Stop procrastinating, beat the deadline and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/#tickets">purchase your pass</a> <strong>before the early-bird price expires on October 1 at 11:59 pm (PT)</strong>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Read Dashboard sits in virtual meetings to measure engagement, performance and sentiment among participants.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meetings can go one of two ways&#8230; either be productive, or be ineffective. <a href="https://www.read.ai/">Read AI</a> wants all meeting goers to be engaged and feel productive, and it has developed a real-time shared dashboard to alert meeting participants when things are going well or not so well.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based company emerged from stealth mode Wednesday with its first financing, a $10 million seed round, led by Madrona Venture Group, and joined by PSL Ventures and a group of angel investors, including former Placed board member David Joerg, Verishop CEO Imran Khan, AI2 CEO Oren Etzioni, Qumulo CEO Bill Richter, Wunderman CEO Shane Atchison, Divvy founder Brian Ma, Snapchat product VP Peter Sellis and Snapchat engineering VP Nima Khajehnouri.</p>
<p>Read was co-founded in May by a team that has known each other for the past 20 years: CEO David Shim, former CEO of Foursquare, vice president of engineering Rob Williams and vice president of data science Elliott Waldron. The trio previously worked together at location analytics startup Placed, where Shim was also CEO. The company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/snapchat-placed/">acquired by Snapchat in 2017</a>, and spun out into Foursquare in 2019.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2209764" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2209764" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2209764" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Read-Dashboard-Meeting-in-Progress.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2209764" class="wp-caption-text">Read Dashboard</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s first product, Read Dashboard, is a dashboard for virtual meetings that leverages artificial intelligence, computer vision and natural language processing to measure engagement, performance and sentiment among participants.</p>
<p>“Read Dashboard is like ‘Waze for meetings,’ ” Shim told TechCrunch. “We want to make collaboration easier, so it gives you analytics on how the meeting is going.”</p>
<p>Instead of checking each two-inch video box to read a participant&#8217;s emotions, Read provides real-time graphs and meters that show if one or more people are dominating the conversation, if people seem bored, not paying attention or if people seem happy or sad about what is being said. For example, on a sales call, Read can show if what is being said is trending negatively quickly so you can either stop talking or pivot to another topic, Shim said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, the dashboard is available as a free service on Zoom through Google Calendar integration. It notifies attendees when it is activated and can also be removed. As different use cases are supported, there will be additional features added that can be accessed for a fee, he added.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Matt McIlwain, managing director at Madrona Venture Group, is joining Read’s board of directors.</p>
<p>McIlwain also worked with Shim when they were both at Farecast, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/17/microsoft-acquires-farecast-for-115m/">bought by Microsoft in 2008</a>. They stayed in contact, and McIlwain was also a seed investor in Placed.</p>
<p>He regards Shim as someone who “has a good eye for having transparency and for creating products that are valuable to all constituents.” With Placed and Foursquare, McIlwain said he could see that Shim was “very hungry to make an impact and make a difference for the world.”</p>
<p>Now with Real, he says the co-founder team has complementary skills and are building something that will live on now that companies are operating in a digital-first world where it will be important to know if someone is not engaged enough, talking too much or not enough, he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Read decided to go after seed funding for a couple of reasons: one, the <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-conferencing-market">global video conferencing market</a> is big — valued at $4.2 billion in 2020 — and two, the company is seeing massive adoption, Shim said. It is also seeing additional use cases like weekly stand ups where it was difficult to get a good read on people because there are so many on the video.</p>
<p>“We could have gone slower and built out over a few years, but we could see the need right now,” he added. “Half of all meetings are considered unproductive. We used to spend 30 or 60 minutes in meetings, and now it is hours a day in virtual conferences.”</p>
<p>In less than five months, Read has grown to 15 employees, something Shim said was a different experience while at Placed, where it took 15 months to reach the same milestone.</p>
<p>The new funding will go toward adding even more staff. The company will also add platforms in the future, like WebEx, Teams and Google Meet. It will also eventually provide integrations with other areas of the digital world, including Facebook and Apply Glass, Shim said.</p>
<p>“There is a huge opportunity for someone to get hints,” he added. “The more we can facilitate the ability to help people with social cues, the better the interactions will be.”</p>
