										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish this morning downplayed his company&#8217;s interest in a potential merger &#8212; like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/comcast-and-viacomcbs-consider-partnership-to-bolster-streaming-tv.html">one with its partner Comcast</a>. At the WSJ Tech Live conference today, the media company exec said the company&#8217;s current strategy was to focus on its &#8220;organic plan&#8221; in streaming, which would be the best path forward to create shareholder value. He also claimed it was still &#8220;early days&#8221; for its new service Paramount+, essentially downplaying the ideas that a merger would be necessary for the service to succeed.</p>
<p>Pressed for comment on the matter, Bakish didn&#8217;t give a direct answer as to whether the company is considering any M&amp;A deals, and instead touted the growth Paramount+ has been seeing throughout the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paramount+ is seven months old. So it&#8217;s very early days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have nice subscriber acquisition in Q1 and Q2, frankly on the back of a pretty weak content slate,&#8221; he continued, adding that the slate would grow significantly later in the year. &#8220;We see nice momentum ahead of us. And that&#8217;s the lane I continue to feel we should be focused on,&#8221; Bakish noted.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219450" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, describing Paramount+ as a new service is only somewhat accurate.</p>
<p>In reality, the service is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/paramount-the-successor-to-cbs-all-access-launches-march-4-in-the-u-s-canada-and-latin-america/">successor</a> to the company&#8217;s earlier streaming endeavor, CBS All Access, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/a-rebranded-and-updated-version-of-cbs-all-access-will-launch-this-summer/">rebranded</a> and expanded to include Viacom content following the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/viacomcbs/"> 2019 CBS and Viacom merger</a>. In a sense, it&#8217;s a new product with a larger library, but the core service has been around for years. And, as of yet, it has not been able to pose a viable threat to top rivals like Netflix or Disney+, for example, which have <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-adds-1-5-million-subscribers-in-q2-as-pandemic-growth-slows/">209 million+</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/business/disney-plus-subscribers.html">116 million subscribers</a>, respectively. In fact, CBS historically wouldn&#8217;t even break out numbers for CBS All Access separately from Showtime. That tradition continues at ViacomCBS which <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-plus-42-million-subscribers-viacomcbs-subscriptions-showtime-icarly/">announced</a> in Q2 the two platforms &#8212; Paramount+ and Showtime OTT &#8212; had together topped 42 million paid global subscribers in the quarter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s led to the company looking for other ways to drive growth &#8212; including, recently, through international joint ventures, like its new partnership with Comcast on <a href="https://www.skygroup.sky/article/comcast-and-viacomcbs-announce-skyshowtime-a-new-streaming-service-to-launch-in-select-european-markets">SkyShowtime</a> in Europe, for instance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite Bakish&#8217;s remarks downplaying M&amp;A, Comcast&#8217;s NBCU and ViacomCBS had been talking about the various ways they could work together, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nbcuniversals-streaming-strategy-raise-prospect-of-warnermedia-merger?rc=ajsw4d">reports have said</a>. This has included discussions of offering a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/comcast-and-viacomcbs-consider-partnership-to-bolster-streaming-tv.html">bundle</a> of their streaming services, Peacock and Paramount+. But a merger or acquisition could always be another option. While these types of deals are more complex, the question remains as to how either service will get scale in the current market by going it alone.</p>
<p>Bakish, speaking at today&#8217;s event, seemed to dismiss the idea that M&amp;A was the way to go for now, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, we&#8217;re focused on shareholder value creation. As we look at the landscape today, particularly where our stock trades at the moment, we believe the strongest route to shareholder value creation is executing against our organic plan in streaming,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Further pressed on the idea of a horizontal merger in order to achieve faster scale, Bakish recalled that not all deals work out as expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consolidation has been true in business for a very long time, whether that&#8217;s vertical mergers, horizontal mergers &#8212; that&#8217;s a tried and true business technique. By the way, a lot of deals get unwound too when they didn&#8217;t work out well. Ultimately it comes down to execution,&#8221; he said. He then touted the company&#8217;s asset base which includes a Hollywood film studio, 100-year old library, and significant ongoing production.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I look at that content asset and deploying against a  streaming platform &#8212; in this case, Paramount+ &#8212; there&#8217;s real momentum already and there&#8217;s real growth ahead. And I think that&#8217;s a very compelling lane to be in,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Leashes, you say? No leashes here, pal. No, Apple is apparently going <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/apple-is-going-unleashed-for-an-october-18-event/">fully off-leash</a> for today’s big presser. Today at <strong>10AM PT/1PM ET</strong>, it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/what-to-expect-from-apple-google-and-samsungs-big-events/">kicking off a big week of hardware news</a>, as part of a final industry push ahead of the holidays.</p>
<p>It was just over a month ago that the company unveiled a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-event-this-morning/">whole bunch of new devices</a>, including iPhones, iPads and the latest Apple Watch. So, what’s left? Macs, obviously. As Apple makes a line-wide transition to first-party silicon, we expect a number of new products, including (potentially) a new MacBook, Mac Mini and a larger iMac, all powered by the latest M1X chip.</p>
<p>Given that this is (likely) a last hurrah for the year, other products may well be on-tap, including a new version of Apple’s entry-level AirPods. Matthew and Darrell will be on hand, bringing you the news as it breaks. All of the information for watching the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-unleashed-macbook-pro-keynote-livestream/">livestream can be found here</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is set to announce new hardware today. The company is holding a (virtual) keynote at <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>. And you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/exM1uajp--A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/what-to-expect-from-apple-google-and-samsungs-big-events/">Rumor has it</a> that the company is set to announce some new Macs. Over the past year, Apple has updated its entry-level computers with new custom-designed M1 chips. And now, the company could bring its own chips to higher-end computers, such as a 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, a new Mac Mini and a 27-inch iMac.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple could use this opportunity to redesign its laptops from the ground up with new display technologies, a new array of ports and a new form factor in general. But that’s not all. Apple has also been working on an updated version of its entry-level AirPods.</p>
<p>You can watch the livestream directly on this page, as Apple is streaming its conference on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you have an Apple TV, you can open the TV app and look for the ‘Apple Special Event’ section. It lets you stream today’s event and rewatch old ones.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have an Apple TV and don’t want to use YouTube, the company also lets you livestream the event from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events section</a> on its website. This video feed now works in all major browsers — Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.</p>
<p>We’ll be covering the event and you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/live-from-apples-unleashed-event/">follow our liveblog</a> for live commentary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">REvil, the notorious Russian-linked <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> gang responsible for the high-profile <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">cyberattacks</a> on Kaseya, Travelex, and JBS earlier this year, has disappeared again after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/tor/">Tor</a> payment portal and data leak blog were allegedly hijacked.</p>
<p>The shutdown comes weeks after the group re-emerged following a months-long hiatus, during which the group went quiet after facing heat from the U.S. government in response <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/kaseya-hack-flood-ransomware/">to its attack on Kaseya</a>, which resulted in thousands of companies becoming infected with ransomware. News of the shutdown was first claimed by a threat actor known to be affiliated with the REvil operation in a post on a known criminal forum, first discovered by Recorded Future&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/ddd1ms/status/1449865145308651528">Dmitry Smilyanets</a>.</p>
<p>The threat actor&#8217;s post said the group&#8217;s Tor services were hijacked and replaced with a copy of the group&#8217;s private keys, likely from an earlier backup. &#8220;The server was compromised and they were looking for me,&#8221; the post reads. &#8220;To be precise, they deleted the path to my hidden service in the torrc file [used for configuring the Tor service] and raised their own so that I would go there. I checked on others — this was not. Good luck everyone, I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219367" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2219453" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219453" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="446" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg 1616w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=1536,856 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/nginx-revil.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219453" class="wp-caption-text">What REvil&#8217;s Tor site looks like at the time of publication following an apparent hijack. (Image: TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>At the time of writing, it isn&#8217;t clear who compromised REvil&#8217;s servers. A report by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/ransomware-fbi-revil-decryption-key/2021/09/21/4a9417d0-f15f-11eb-a452-4da5fe48582d_story.html">The Washington Post</a> in September said the FBI had obtained the group&#8217;s encryption keys for the companies hit by the Kaseya attack in July, but that the agency&#8217;s planned takedown never happened after the group disappeared. Others are <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/revil-ransomware-shuts-down-again-after-tor-sites-were-hijacked/">pointing to a possible takeover</a> by a former group member, known as &#8220;Unkn,&#8221; or Unknown, a long-time spokesperson for the group, who did not return when the rest of the group reemerged in September.</p>
<p>“Since there was no confirmation of the reason for his loss, we resumed work, thinking that he was dead,” the threat actor explained in their forum post. “But since we have today at 17.10 from 12:00 Moscow time, someone brought up the hidden-services of a landing and a bog with the same key as ours, my fears were concerned.”</p>
<p>VX-Underground, a website that hosts malware source code, samples, and papers, <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1449776517983215620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">tweeted</a> that only Unknown and the forum-posting threat actor had REvil domain keys and that the ransomware group’s domain was recently accessed using Unknown&#8217;s keys.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether REvil — linked to the majority of ransomware detections in the second quarter this year, according to McAfee — is gone for good. But since the group’s surprise reappearance in September, it has struggled to recruit users, prompting the group to <a href="https://twitter.com/y_advintel/status/1446528895537356825">increase its affiliate commissions</a> to entice new threat actors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the course of the last decade or so, open source changed dramatically. What was once mostly a philosophical discussion about cathedrals, bazaars and the evils of Microsoft &#8212; which in turn lead to the people building compilers and the likes of the Linux kernel &#8212; became the de facto standard for how even traditional enterprises build modern software in the open. With that came new business models that now range from selling professional services for open source users to adding proprietary paid extensions with additional &#8220;enterprise&#8221; features and, increasingly, launching fully managed hosted SaaS versions of open source products.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, at our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=opensourcepost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=opensourcepost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS 2021</a> event on October 27, we will talk about exactly that: how to build successful SaaS products on top of open source. To do so, Puppet CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbykearns/">Abby Kearns</a>, Kong CEO, president and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonicaghi/">Augusto &#8220;Aghi&#8221; Marietti</a> and Redpoint Ventures managing director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcwarner/">Jason Warner</a> will join us.</p>
<p>Kearns is currently the CTO of IT automation service Puppet, which offers and open source version of its core tools, as well as a large ecosystem of open sourced modules that extend its services. But before joining the company, she was also the executive director of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, where she helped shepherd one of the largest and most active enterprise-focused open source projects through a time of change. Cloud Foundry, which was first developed inside of VMware, itself formed the basis of a number of SaaS-like offerings from the likes of Pivotal and SUSE.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216879" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://konghq.com/">Kong</a>, previously known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mashape/">Mashape</a>, is somewhat of a posterchild of open source commercialization. A lot of the core services of its API and microservices management tools are available under <a href="https://github.com/Kong/">an open source license today</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/28/mashape-open-sources-its-kong-api-management-platform/">Back in 2015</a>, the company first open-sourced the Kong API management service, and it has kept this focus on open source going. The company recently launched new open source projects like its Kuma control plane (which it then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/kong-donates-its-kuma-control-plane-to-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation/">donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>), for example. Meanwhile, the company now has raised over $171 million in funding and was most recently valued at $1.4 billion. Its customers range from the likes of Deutsche Telekom to Papa John&#8217;s and Siemens. Italy-born Marietti founded the company back in 2009 and the team actually showed a first prototype at what was then the TechCrunch50 conference.</p>
<p>Redpoint&#8217;s Jason Warner made a name for himself during his time at Heroku and than as GitHub&#8217;s CEO, but even before he decamped to the VC world this summer, he was already a very active angel investor whose name kept popping up in the press releases about some of the most interesting startups in recent years. Over the course of the last year or so, he invested in companies like <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/census-raises-16m/">Census</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/jam-raises-3-5-million-to-figma-tize-product-collaboration/">Jam</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/sym-raises-9m-series-a-for-its-security-workflow-platform/">Sym</a>, for example. Some of these build a lot of open source themselves, some only consume it, but either way, Warner will be able to give us the VC perspective on the state of the open source industry and what makes him want to invest (or not) in open source centric startups.</p>
<p>In addition to our discussion on open source, the conference will also include Google’s Javier Soltero, as well as investors Kobie Fuller and Casey Aylward, among others. We hope you’ll join us. It’s going to be a thought-provoking lineup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Organizations that have made the leap into using big data to drive their business are increasingly looking for better, more efficient ways to share data with others without compromising privacy and data protection laws, and that is ushering in a rush of technologists building a number of new approaches to fill that need. In the latest development, a startup called TripleBlind &#8212; which has devised a way to encrypt data so that it can be shared without ever being decrypted or even leaving the data owner&#8217;s firewall, and keeping the whole process compliant with data protection regulations &#8212; is announcing new funding on the heels of strong demand for its technology.</p>
<p>The Kansas City, Missouri startup has closed a round of $24 million, a Series A that it will be using to continue developing its technology and to extend into a wider range of enterprise verticals. The round is being co-led by General Catalyst and the Mayo Clinic, with AVG Basecamp Fund, Accenture Ventures, Clocktower Technology Ventures, Dolby Family Ventures, Flyover Capital, KCRise Fund, NextGen Venture Partners and Wavemaker Three-Sixty Health also participating. The round was oversubscribed but the company is not disclosing its valuation. It&#8217;s raised more than $32 million to date.</p>
<p>TripleBlind&#8217;s platform, which officially launched in November 2020, is compliant today with data privacy and data residency regulations in some 100 countries, HIPAA, GDPR and California’s CCPA among them. The company estimates there are some 43 zetabytes of data stored by enterprises today globally that is not being used as it could be because of the limitations imposed both by these and other data protection rules, as well as general hesitancy over sharing IP and other issues around sharing data. It works with data in a variety of formats, including PII, PHI, genomic data, images and confidential financial records.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219197" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As an indicator of where TripleBlind is finding initial traction for its product, Mayo &#8212; one of the world&#8217;s leading institutions for medical research &#8212; is one of TripleBlind&#8217;s strategic investors. Mayo is using its technology both around data encryption and to help build algorithms based on data sets without needing to share raw data.</p>
<p>This addresses a longstanding problem typically faced when two institutions (or even one institution working with multiple data sets) collaborate: normally, they have to transfer data and/or algorithms based on that data, in order to train systems or to conduct research.</p>
<p>With TripleBlind, the idea is that they no longer have to. (The &#8220;triple&#8221; in its name is a reference to TripleBlind or a receiving data user variously being &#8220;blind to data, blind to processing, and blind to the result.&#8221;)</p>
<p>“Bringing together AI algorithms and data in ways that preserve privacy and intellectual property is one of the keys to delivering the next generation of digital medicine,” says John Halamka, M.D., president of Mayo Clinic Platform. “These novel privacy-protected solutions promise to usher a new era of collaboration.” Halamka and Shail Jain, global managing director, Data &amp; AI from Accenture, are both joining as board observers with this round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mayo Clinic also invested an undisclosed amount in an extension to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/04/27/2217775/0/en/TripleBlind-Receives-Investment-from-Mayo-Clinic-Expanding-Current-Collaboration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TripleBlind&#8217;s $8.2 million seed round</a>. Mayo Clinic is not its only strategic backer: Accenture and Okta are two others; other customers include Snowflake.</p>
<p>Riddhiman Das, TripleBlind’s co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that healthcare and medical research continue to be big areas for TripleBlind, and that it is seeing growing interest also from financial services, media and utilities.</p>
<p>Innovations in big data analytics are opening up new frontiers in how organizations can pool wider bodies of knowledge to help them make breakthroughs and develop new algorithms in areas that have often been presented as figurative black holes, whether that is in medical research, or training an autonomous system, or tracking network activity for trends or malfunctions, or around better information about customer sentiment, or something else altogether.</p>
<p>The catch is that we&#8217;re in an age where privacy and data protection matter more than ever, not just from a regulatory point of view, but from our own tastes as consumers, and, in the case of businesses, as a matter of intellectual property protection, so using data liberally comes with a lot of caveats, if not outright restrictions.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re seeing an interesting proliferation of technologies being honed to address this paradox, including applications of homomorphic encryption, synthetic datasets, federated learning and putting data &#8220;on the blockchain,&#8221; among others</p>
<p>TripleBlind&#8217;s approach has been to create a system that it believes addresses the various issues exposed by other approaches: for example, homomorphic encryption is resource-intensive and hard to scale; tokenization/masking/hashing and differential privacy reduces accuracy; synthetic data is not actual real data; federated learning leaves open the potential for data reconstruction; and blockchain is not set up for data sharing.</p>
<p>(On the other hand, and to the credit of a lot of the wider community of technologists working in this area, those working on specific solutions are, in fact, moving to blended approaches, borrowing pieces from different techniques, as a next-generation approach, TripleBlind included.)</p>
<p>At TripleBlind, Das said he started to think about trying out a new approach to sharing data without compromising data protection or privacy when he was previously working at Alibaba&#8217;s Ant. The financial services giant had, in 2017, acquired <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/09/13/alibaba-buys-eye-scan-firm-eyeverify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">eye-scanning biometrics startup </span></a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">EyeVerify for $100 million &#8212; where Das was the product architect &#8212; but the acquisition was not developing as Ant had hoped: it ran into controversy over privacy issues, or what Das described as &#8220;data access issues.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">More specifically, &#8220;We struggled with accessing data to improve our models and the precision of the service,&#8221; he said. So he moved over from there into corporate development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">(In fact, Alibaba never did manage to square that circle, and now it is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ant-group-divestiture-eyeverify-idUSKBN29W02V" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly looking to divest the company</a>, which has now been rebranded as the more vague-sounding Zoloz.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In his new role, Das said he started to see a bigger picture emerge about how enterprises, Ant specifically and others more generally, tackle data and privacy issues. It covered more than just biometrics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We also had problems in accessing data for anti-money laundering, know your customer algorithms, and more,&#8221; he said. Regulations around data residency and privacy &#8220;really hindered our ability to use data.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He spent years evaluating different solutions and eventually came upon the idea of building something a little different to approach the same problem: &#8220;The predominant school of thought on data privacy is that it&#8217;s about computational privacy&#8221; &#8212; that is, encryption &#8212; &#8220;but there are restrictions around contractual limitations.&#8221; TripleBlind still applies encryption to data and algorithms, but its patented approach to encryption and the architecture of how data is used mean that the data never leaves its owner when it&#8217;s being used in computations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">That is the critical point for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“TripleBlind is an incredible platform for empowering companies to collaborate on data while preserving privacy, data rights and intellectual property. Particularly important today in the healthcare industry, as the lack of data mobility results in fragmented and non-optimal care,” said Quentin Clark, managing director, General Catalyst. “At General Catalyst we believe that TripleBlind&#8217;s platform for enabling teams to work together with the most private and sensitive data is a necessary part of how companies will be able have agility while respecting the privacy of their customers, and the intellectual property of their partners. We are thrilled to work with the TripleBlind team as they work to achieve their mission.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>GitLab, for example, went public last week. The devops giant raised its price range, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/3-things-gitlabs-wild-ipo-pricing-says-about-public-markets/">priced above that interval</a>, and then shot higher once shares began to trade. It&#8217;s a great time to go public for tech companies with growth stories.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>Expensify is one such company, though things have been turbulent this past year and a half. The Portland, Oregon-based expense management company had a tough COVID-19 cycle. As we&#8217;ll see, COVID impacted the company&#8217;s growth rate as well as its retention metrics. But things have since turned around, fortunately.</p>
<p>For more on the Expensify story, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">our own Anna Heim wrote the definitive series on the company</a>.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s get into the guts of this profitable, growing technology company that hasn&#8217;t raised material primary capital since <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/expensify-com-series-c--9d36bead">its 2015-era Series C</a>. The company was valued at around $143 million, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">per PitchBook data</a>, in the $17.5 million fundraise.</p>
<p>That valuation is a bit out of date, so we&#8217;ll have to come up with some new estimates.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re digging into the Expensify S-1 filing, looking at its 2019, 2020, and H1 2021 results through the lens of COVID&#8217;s impact on the company&#8217;s operating results and its rebound. We also want to understand <em>how</em> the company is profitable, and how its SMB focus has turned out to be more of a boon than a burr.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have some fun!</p>
<h2>How Expensify makes money</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about Expensify&#8217;s business model first.</p>
<p>The company mostly sells to SMBs, or smaller companies. Venture investors have historically viewed SMB-focused businesses as less valuable than those selling to larger customers, as the latter tend to have lower churn and better upsell metrics. That may be true, but Expensify&#8217;s results indicate that you can actually do quite well selling software to SMBs, provided you have the right go-to-market motion.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Builder.io provides a drag-and-drop visual editor and headless content management system so that marketers can update websites without developer support.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Any e-commerce business has to constantly change its digital storefront to ensure accurate inventory is represented. But to launch a new product or test a homepage placement often requires the need to tap busy developers for guidance, slowing down the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.builder.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Builder.io</a> believes customers should be able to create the kinds of commerce experiences they want, like a drag-and-drop system, that they could plug into their tech stack without that developer support.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $14 million new funding from Greylock, with participation from Imaginary Ventures and a group of angel investors, including Everlane founder and CEO Michael Preysman, Hopin CTO Anthony Kennada and Datadog COO Adam Blitzer.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Company co-founders Steve Sewell and Brent Locks saw this problem play out when they worked together building web applications at the fashion e-commerce company ShopStyle. CEO Sewell said the company was one of the first to go “headless,” meaning to separate the front-end applications from the back-end so they can be independently updated without affecting the other.</p>
<p>However, while updating the ShopStyle pages, they ran into a flood of non-developer requests for assistance updating and testing pages and it became overwhelming.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We did not really think about content management at all,” Sewell told TechCrunch. “We weren&#8217;t prepared for that. We had this nice API infrastructure, but didn&#8217;t have a way to manage these things.”</p>
<p>Typically to get something like a new button on a webpage, that request might go to an engineer and be done in a month, if even prioritized at all.</p>
<p>To get around the timing, the marketing team would often create their own pages using other software and then integrate it into the company’s site, which slows down the website, he added.</p>
<p>“Code is a bottleneck for merchants, and the reality becomes that they don’t build anything new or test anything because it takes too long and is too expensive,” Sewell added.</p>
<p>Instead, Builder.io provides the proper web flow with a drag-and-drop visual editor and headless content management system so that marketers, product managers or designers can use existing components, or create their own, to build out the content, run the A/B tests and measure the conversions they need.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Commercetools raises $140M at a $1.9B valuation as &#8216;headless&#8217; commerce continues to boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/commercetools-raises-140m-at-a-1-9b-valuation-as-headless-commerce-continues-to-boom/embed/#?secret=YM2gWXsUe7" data-secret="YM2gWXsUe7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since launching the commerce tool in 2019, the company is seeing six times year-over-year customer growth and now works with over 400 customers, including Everlane, Alo Yoga, Afterpay and Vistaprint. It also brought in Angular founder Misko Hevery as its chief technology officer.</p>
<p>That growth led to the company going after new funding to hire additional staff in support and sales. It launched a native integration with Shopify in 2020, and with the funding announcement, also is unveiling universal connectors so that commerce companies can integrate with any headless commerce platform or API without code changes, as well as for developers to build their own connectors to data sources.</p>
<p>“We want to get to the point where every person can make something easily and know how to create anything they can imagine,” Sewell said.</p>
<p>Mike Duboe, a partner at Greylock and a Builder board member, says he also saw this problem firsthand while working at Stitch Fix, where he was the first in-house growth hire.</p>
<p>One of the problems he was looking at was reducing dependencies on developers and allowing more headless operations. For every new page that someone wanted to spin up, it would go to the end of the cue. Merchants don’t often have engineers, or just a few, and any byproducts added to the site slows the speed down, Duboe added.</p>
<p>“Steve and Brent were living this stuff before it became the lexicon,” he said. “They are also interesting complements: Steve has the caliber of a technical leader, and recruiting the founder of Angular to be CTO has resulted in the company being a talent magnet. We invested before that happened, but he has passion and cares about performance. Brent is a leader on the product and business side, and they both have deep empathy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoox, the autonomous vehicle startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-to-acquire-autonomous-driving-startup-zoox/">acquired last year by Amazon</a>, is expanding to Seattle. The company plans to open in 2022 an engineering office and operations facility, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing,</p>
<p>Zoox, which today employs more than 1,300 people, tests its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City, California, near its headquarters. The company started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/self-driving-vehicle-startup-zoox-has-expanded-to-las-vegas/">testing its autonomous vehicles</a> on public roads in Las Vegas in 2019.</p>
<p>The operations facility and engineering office will be staffed by mostly new employees, according to co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson. The exact number of employees in Seattle was not disclosed, but Levinson said it is part of the company&#8217;s goal to create 450 new jobs in 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219250" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While Zoox is setting up operations in the city where Amazon is based, Levinson told TechCrunch the two companies still operate separately. The Zoox office and operations hub will not be housed on the Amazon campus, for instance. Zoox will take advantage of its proximity to Amazon to work with the company on various collaborations in the future, Levinson said, describing that as an &#8220;extra bonus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Levison said Zoox has been eyeing Seattle as a test site for years. The company even completed a small pilot in the city in late 2019. The frequency of rain in the area is one of the primary reasons Zoox picked Seattle, Levinson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For better or for worse, it doesn&#8217;t rain very much in San Francisco and rains even less than Las Vegas,&#8221; he said &#8220;We want an ODD (operational design domain) that has a significant amount of rain and a frequent amount of rain for our testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoox has developed some advanced weather proofing, including what Levinson described as &#8220;active rain mitigation&#8221; for its sensors. &#8220;We&#8217;re very excited about that and we want to test it and validate it in the rain; Seattle is a great place for that,&#8221; Levinson said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zoox is also interested in Seattle because of its tunnels and differentiated road network topology, policy toward AVs and because the company views Seattle as an ideal city to launch a commercial robotaxi service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve obviously announced already that San Francisco and Las Vegas are two target commercialization cities that we&#8217;ve been working on and that&#8217;s still the case,&#8221; Levinson said. &#8220;But as far as future expansion goes, Seattle is way up there on our list of good places to launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoox will be testing its so-called &#8220;Level 3&#8221; fleet of vehicles in Seattle. These are Toyota Highlander SUVs equipped with an autonomous vehicle system. The sensor architecture on its L3 testing fleet matches that of its purpose-built electric autonomous robotaxi, a vehicle with no steering wheel and a moonroof that is capable of transporting four people at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour. The idea is that testing and validation of its L3 vehicles directly relates to its purpose-built &#8220;L5&#8221; vehicle, Levinson said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota Motor is joining other major automakers in putting its money behind electrification, saying Monday it would invest $3.4 billion in battery development and production in the United States through the end of the decade.</p>
<p>The investment, which comes through the Japanese automaker’s North American arm, includes plans for a new $1.3 billion electric vehicle battery plant under a new company and with its metals unit Toyota Tsusho. The plant is anticipated to enter production in 2025 and expand through 2031, by which time it will employ around 1,750 people. The location has not been announced.</p>
<p>The new plans are part of Toyota’s larger aim to invest $13.5 billion globally to keep up with other automakers who have already pledged to earmark massive sums to boost battery development and electrify their respective portfolios. Major auto OEMs like General Motors have announced similar, though much larger, investments. GM plans to spend<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/"> $35 billion through 2025</a> to bring 30 new EVs to the global market and build additional assembly capacity for electric models.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219379" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The factory will initially produce batteries for hybrid vehicles, Toyota said. The automaker did not disclose the expected production capacity of the new facility.</p>
<p>Toyota’s plans for a new battery manufacturing facility echo other recent announcements from companies like Ford, which along with its battery partner SK Innovation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/ford-sk-to-spend-11-4b-to-build-two-us-manufacturing-campuses-dedicated-to-evs-and-batteries/">will spend $11.4 billion</a> on two U.S. manufacturing sites dedicated to EV batteries. Stellantis, the automaker formed after a merger between Fiat Chrysler and Groupe PSA, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/stellantis-lg-energy-to-build-u-s-battery-factory-in-new-joint-venture/">also said Monday</a> it would produce battery cells and modules in North America in a preliminary deal with LG Energy Solutions.</p>
<p>However, Toyota’s news strikes a slightly different note, as it clearly indicates that the industrial giant is planning on producing batteries entirely in-house.</p>
<p>Relative to other automakers, Toyota has been slow to roll out electric vehicles. The company does not currently sell any battery electric vehicles (BEV) in the U.S., though it does sell several plug-in hybrids and hybrid vehicles. It announced plans earlier this year to introduce the first BEV to North American markets &#8212; the bZ4X crossover &#8212; next year. It aims to boost its EV lineup to 15 models globally by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart+, the retailer&#8217;s low-cost alternative to Amazon Prime <a href="https://www.walmart.com/plus/benefits">offering</a> free shipping with no minimums, free grocery delivery, and other perks, is now adding one more reason to become a subscriber: early access to Black Friday deals. The company <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/10/17/walmart-announces-2021-return-of-black-friday-deals-for-days-this-time-with-special-early-access-for-walmart-members">announced</a> today it will allow paying Walmart+ subscribers to gain early access to its Black Friday events throughout the month of November, including the ability to shop the deals four hours earlier than the scheduled start times for the three planned events.</p>
<p>This is the first time Walmart+ has bundled in some sort of early access to deals for the holiday shopping season. Before, the subscription service was primarily competing with Amazon Prime on free delivery with a few other <a href="https://www.walmart.com/plus/benefits">perks</a>, like discounted gas prices, the ability to use Scan &amp; Go inside stores for faster checkouts, and more recently, savings on prescriptions.</p>
<p>The new addition is a timely one, as many consumers are likely worried about how <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-04/out-of-stock-shortages-for-christmas-shopping-put-retailers-at-risk?sref=gni836kR">supply chain disruptions</a> due to Covid may impact their holiday shopping plans. With containers piling up outside ports, Walmart was already among the big retailers that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/big-retailers-book-pricey-private-cargo-ships-holiday-scramble-n1277321">booked</a> their own private cargo ships to keep goods flowing. However, consumers are still being warned of potential merchandise shortages this year &#8212; including with toys, which are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/29/business/toy-shortage-supply-chain-shipping-holidays/index.html">expected to be</a> scarcer and more expensive, as well as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/29/business/toy-shortage-supply-chain-shipping-holidays/index.html">consumer tech</a>, due to the global chip shortages which have been hitting everything from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/apples-iphone-hot-streak-will-run-into-global-chip-shortage.html">iPhones</a> to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/xbox-series-x-restock-best-buy-and-amazon-come-through-with-more-consoles/">Xbox</a> consoles to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/03/gm-to-shut-truck-assembly-plants-again-cites-global-chip-shortage.html">cars</a> and more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219356" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Walmart says it will again spread out its Black Friday shopping days across three separate events in November this year, with deals that start online before they arrive in the stores. The first event will take place on Nov. 1 and will continue in stores starting on Nov. 5. The second event begins Nov. 10 and continues in-store Nov. 12. And the third will arrive at the end of the month, encompassing the traditional Black Friday shopping day (Nov. 26). Among the deals being offered are those for numerous toys and electronics, like LOL Surprise dolls, Keurig coffee makers, Shark vacuums, HP laptops, Roku streaming devices, 4K TVs, trampoline sets, Legos, and more.</p>
<p>In each case, Walmart+ subscribers will get first access to the deals with a four-hour head start.</p>
<p>The idea to provide early access to deals to subscribers is an idea that Amazon has historically capitalized on with Amazon Prime. On top of the free shipping benefits and broad set of other perks which include free streaming, free ebooks, and more, Amazon Prime members also get early access to Lightning Deals on Amazon throughout the holiday season and every day. Amazon also lets members shop first on its own sales holiday, Prime Day.</p>
<p>But Amazon&#8217;s Black Friday strategy this year was to roll out its deals <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-unveils-black-friday-worthy-deals-earlier-ever-giving?ots=1&amp;slotNum=0&amp;imprToken=48be49db-7a6a-870a-042">earlier than ever</a>, as many consumers were likely heeding the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/experts-urge-early-holiday-shoppingwhat-know-about-return-policies-major-retailers-1639466">advice</a> to start their shopping ahead of schedule this year in case of shortages. For Prime members, it introduced a new perk that would allow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/amazon-will-allow-u-s-prime-members-to-send-gifts-using-only-an-email-or-phone-number/">sending gifts to someone using</a> just an email address or phone number.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/walmart-plus-launches-sept-15-offering-same-day-delivery-for-98-per-year-plus-gas-discounts-and-cashierless-checkout/">Launched last year,</a> Wamart+ remains a slightly more affordable free shipping service, compared with Amazon Prime. Walmart+ members can choose to pay $98 per year or they can pay $12.95 on a month-to-month basis. Prime, which offers a wider range of perks, is $119 per year or $12.99 per month. However, Walmart+ excludes free shipping on marketplace items, while Prime does include a selection of third-party sellers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to build Walmart+ to be the ultimate life hack for our customers,&#8221; said Janey Whiteside, chief customer officer for Walmart U.S., in a statement about the launch of the new perk. &#8220;That means we’re there for our customers during the everyday with key benefits like free unlimited delivery from stores and free shipping with no order minimum, but it also means we create extra excitement for them during the big moments, like Black Friday. We’re excited for our Walmart+ members to be first in line for the hottest Black Friday deals out there,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, two Nigerian startups, Treepz (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">formerly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/nigerias-plentywaka-gets-backing-from-techstars-plans-expansion-to-canada/"> Plentywaka</a>) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/african-talent-recruitment-company-talentql-joins-techstars-to-further-global-ambition/">TalentQL</a> got into the Techstars Toronto accelerator program alongside eight other companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The<a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/toronto"> program</a>, held </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, provided these startups with funding ($100,000 convertible note and $20,000 stipend), mentorship and access to its network. For Treepz and TalentQL, the acceptance also served as an opportunity to operate from Canada with a modest ambition to become global companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While two African startups made the cut in the fourth class, the number from the now announced fifth class is fourfold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another change is the total number of startups in a class which has increased from ten to twelve.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219349" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the 12, eight startups focused on the continent have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been selected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to participate in the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/toronto">three-month-long program (culminating in a Demo Day)</a> slated to start today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startups selected in Techstars Toronto&#8217;s October 2021 class include Lenco, OurPass, Healthtracka, Rentsmallsmall, Kyshi, Duhga, Fleri and PayDay. H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ere are a few details about them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.lenco.co">Lenco</a> gives full-fledged current accounts, expense management features and banking services to businesses. <a href="https://www.ourpass.co/">OurPass</a> provides a one-click checkout option for digital commerce. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.healthtracka.com">Healthtracka</a> is a digital health platform that provides at-home lab testing, sample collection and result collection in less than three days</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="http://www.rentsmallsmall.com">Rentsmallsmall</a> is an on-demand home rental service that offers monthly payment plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.kyshi.co">Kyshi</a> is a UK-based but Africa-focused fintech that helps people send and receive money to and from Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="http://www.duhqa.com">Duhqa</a> is a last-mile end-to-end supply chain and distribution platform. <a href="http://www.joinfleri.com">Fleri</a> helps immigrants provide health care and insurance for their loved ones back home from the U.S. <a href="http://www.mypayday.africa">PayDay</a> facilitates transactions between Africa and the world by assisting foreign employers and clients pay people in the continent.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Why Techstars Toronto is accepting more African startups</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y Combinator remains the most strategic global accelerator for African startups and has invested in about 60 of them in the last six years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African startups in YC&#8217;s cohorts have grown slow and steady over the years hovering around five to eight before witnessing a climb to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/most-african-yc-backed-startups-in-todays-batch-are-focused-on-fintech/">ten</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/this-yc-summer-batch-features-the-largest-group-of-african-startups-yet/">fifteen</a> startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the winter and summer batches this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by how YC has operated so far &#8212; which isn&#8217;t a yardstick anyway &#8212; one can see why it is surprising that the number of startups in Techstars jumped from two to eight in a single year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason behind this is due to the track record of previous Techstars-backed African companies. They have been impressive, said Sunil Sharma, the managing director of the Toronto-based accelerator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Techstars began making inroads into Africa after backing payments infrastructure company Korapay and cryptocurrency exchange platform Quidax the following year. The accelerator also backed cross-border payment infrastructure company Fliqpay in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What has happened is that the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> performance of Techstars has been very good, in part because of the [previous] African companies &#8212; Treepz, Korapay, Quidax, TalentQL, Fliqpay,&#8221; Sharma said to TechCrunch in an interview. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So to answer the question of why we are doubling down on Africa, we are actually more than quadrupling down and it is because we see the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Techstars </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to multiply its investments in African startups per year to 24, Sharma added. But so far, it has invested in 10 this year and a total of 13 since 2018.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Queried if this might be a similar occurrence in other Techstars locations globally, Techstars Sharma said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other Techstars accelerators will increase their investments in African startups. We are seeing the valuations explode and the trend towards more and more unicorn companies, so of course we want to play a part in that and we know we can help these entrepreneurs succeed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about the criteria Techstars uses to select startups operating in the region, Sunil said the accelerator first looks at the founders and the team. Then, it checks if the team can provide more value and disrupt the industry they are playing in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, the accelerator still finds itself leaning towards startups in fintech, crypto, insurance, payment and future of work areas because of Toronto&#8217;s reputation as a global financial and talent centre. However,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Canada has a much smaller tech market than the U.S. but</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with some comparative advantages such as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> better immigration policies, talent accessibility and cheaper cost of living. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma and his team believe these resources will convince more African startups to set up shop in Toronto, and they are creating more awareness to capitalize on the accelerator&#8217;s go-ahead to increase participation from African startups. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our DJ, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy dancefloor come, thy steps be done, on earth, as it is at <a href="https://go.dancechurch.com/">Dance Church</a>. The 11-year-old startup, which started back in 2010 as an in-person experience, has seen tremendous growth, especially as people were forced out of dance studios because of COVID-19. Fueled by a rise in popularity in at-home tush-shaking, the company snagged $4.7 million from a handful of investors led by MaC Ventures.</p>
<p>The company started with four to five people gathering in a dance studio in Seattle, but rapidly grew in popularity and impact, to the point where Dance Church&#8217;s founder, Kate Wallich, decided it was time to shift gears, turning the passion project into a full-fledged tech endeavor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dance Church offers joyful and inclusive movement classes that are one part performance, one part fitness and one part dance party,&#8221; explains Dance Church community member Clara Siegel, who joined the company as its CEO at the start of the year. &#8220;And you can think of Dance Church as a grassroots community movement that turned into a tech company when going online during the pandemic.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217563" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The project started its life under the name &#8220;Sunday Morning Movement Practice,&#8221; but the dancers showing up to the sessions started referring to it as Dance Church &#8212; and the name stuck. The company has no religious undercurrent, but its following certainly grew at biblical speed. Siegel explains that the community grew rapidly during the pandemic, with a very simple tech stack. At launch, 40,000 people started following the dance videos seemingly overnight, and in the last year, almost 150,000 people have tuned in to participate in classes. With traction like that, no wonder VCs started paying attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joining as the CEO has been absolutely incredible, the honor of my life,&#8221; says Siegel. &#8220;My role models throughout my career in tech have been incredible, trailblazing women. Kate [Wallich] is this incredible entrepreneur.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s product grew organically, as well; the community members started playing the instruction videos together and dancing together on Zoom. Of course, that&#8217;s a somewhat clunky solution, and Dance Church saw an opportunity: building a tech platform around the behaviors it knew its members were already displaying.</p>
<p>One of the powerful drivers for Dance Church is inclusivity, with a very Seattle &#8220;come as you are&#8221; approach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We reach a really broad audience, which is really exciting. What we do is a wrapper for fitness, but I think fitness has become synonymous with reaching a goal and trying to get your body to look a certain way,&#8221; says Siegel, outlining the company&#8217;s inclusive-first approach, welcoming people of all ages, backgrounds and physical abilities. &#8220;I feel like I can be myself in this space. We are seeing really broad age ranges of people who are taking Dance Church classes, especially with going online. We have people in their 90s take classes, alongside people with disabilities, and there&#8217;s a lot of demand for kids&#8217; dance classes, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The investors agreed, shaking the money tree to the tune of $4.7 million led by MaC Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;MaC is our lead investor, and they&#8217;ve been absolutely phenomenal,&#8221; Siegel explains. &#8220;They have a breadth of experience in a number of things, and for us, it was this intersection between technology and entertainment that was really unique. Dance Church, as a product, straddles a couple of different verticals. And entertainment is one of them. MaC has experience in that field and were able to add value right away. A big part of their mission is around investing in underrepresented founding teams and underserved communities. They&#8217;re very aligned with our mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to MaC Ventures, PSL Ventures, Crush Ventures, Kid Venture Capital, Spike Ventures and Graham &amp; Walker participated in the round. The money will be spent on building out the tech platform, producing more content and driving more sign-ups and engagement among its members.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were struck by the outpouring of admiration from the Dance Church community,&#8221; said Zhenni Liu, the partner at MaC who led the investment and will be joining the Dance Church board. &#8220;It is wellness that&#8217;s joyful and connective. Dance Church doesn&#8217;t ask people to change, and people love that.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Update: An earlier version of this article referred to the original name of Dance Churce as &#8220;Sunday Movement Practice&#8221;. It has been updated to the correct name, &#8220;Sunday Morning Movement Practice&#8221;</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's software records a process with movement and clicks, then converts all of that into a step-by-step guide with screenshots and text that is editable and shareable.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Employees come and go, often taking their knowledge with them. There are also times when just a handful of employees know how to do something and don’t have time to provide a mass tutorial. That’s where <a href="http://scribehow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scribe</a> comes in. Its software records movement and clicks and converts them into a step-by-step guide in less than a minute with screenshots and text that is editable and shareable. The information can be recorded from a Chrome extension or desktop app and also live in a repository until it is needed.</p>
<p>Today, the company launched with $30 million in venture capital, including a new $22 million round of Series A funding that was led by Tiger Global Management. A group of existing investors also participated in the investment, including Amplify Partners, which led Scribe’s $8 million seed round at the beginning of 2021, Haystack Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital, AME Cloud Ventures, Morado Ventures and SEV.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Jennifer Smith, formerly of McKinsey &amp; Company and Greylock Partners, formed the San Francisco-based company a couple of years ago with entrepreneur and former Google engineer Aaron Podolny after seeing a knowledge gap in how operational work was done.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219064" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Smith’s background is in organization and operations work. She talked to more than 1,200 founders about how software was bought and sold, and what they wished existed &#8212; and learned that not much had changed in this area in a decade.</p>
<p>“The process is still being done manually,” she told TechCrunch. “There is not a standard way to communicate how to do something. With Scribe, it is a standard. You can click the record button, do the task and it auto generates step-by-step instructions.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Scribe has been heads-down since it was founded, but the software is now being used by over 10,000 organizations globally as a way to share with others how to do something. These include use cases by organizations outside of those initially targeted by Smith and Podolny, like governments and schools.</p>
<p>In addition to the investors mentioned earlier, angel investors involved include former Microsoft chairman John Thompson, Adobe chief product officer Scott Belsky, Gainsight CEO Nick Mehta and Opendoor CEO Eric Wu. As part of the investment, Amplify Partners general partner Mike Dauber joins Scribe’s board of directors.</p>
<p>Scribe is the latest company to attract venture capital for efforts to capture and share digital processes. For example, in August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tango-dances-in-with-5-7m-to-making-employee-onboarding-easier/">Tango raised $5.7 million</a> for its Chrome extension that auto-captures workflow best practices so that teams can learn from their top performers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Selling into the enterprise: How Slack and other startups get it wrong&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/selling-into-the-enterprise-how-slack-and-other-startups-get-it-wrong/embed/#?secret=G6YfrrmYJZ" data-secret="G6YfrrmYJZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ross Fubini, managing director of XYZ, said Scribe was building a company that makes something complex look easy. He credits Smith for helping many marquee startups ramp up their enterprise selling during her time at Greylock and believes that she and her team are creating a product that is doing the same: showing them how to do their job better.</p>
<p>“And companies will pay for that,” he added. “This is just the first part of the journey. When we talk to companies describing problems on creating documentation, we see that bottom-up part. We are here to put in yet more money into the company so that Jennifer and her team can keep doing the work, build the go-to-market and get paid for that value.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Scribe has both a free version and pro/enterprise plans, and averages nearly 50% reduction in non-productive time spent learning how to do a process.</p>
<p>Smith intends to use the new funding to scale the team to respond to customer demand that is coming from startups all the way to Fortune 500 companies. The company’s 20-person employee base is a majority of women and underrepresented minorities, something Smith is proud of as she focuses on building an inclusive, culture- and talent-first organization, she added. She will also invest in R&amp;D and product development that is coming down the pipeline.</p>
<p>“We want Scribe to be the new common standard for sharing how to do something,” Smith added. “We take inspiration from Zoom and Slack, which have both become standard and lexicon. It’s really about driving that reach and distribution with colleagues and customers.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">At its HHTD21 event, Foxconn unveiled three electric vehicle prototypes including two sedans and an electric bus, according to a <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Foxconn-aims-to-turn-EVs-into-a-35bn-business-in-five-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Nikkei</em></a> report and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGukbUZgoKI" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">YouTube video</a>. The company said it is &#8220;no longer the new kid in town&#8221; when it comes to EVs, and aims to develop a business worth up to $NT 1 trillion, or around $36 billion per year.</p>
<p>Foxconn developed the EV prototypes under the Foxtron brand in collaboration with Taiwan&#8217;s Yulon Motor. The latter has its own brand (Luxgen) and manufactures Nissan and Mitsubishi vehicles for the local market. The prototypes include a luxury sedan, SUV and transit bus, labeled the Model E, Model C and Model T, respectively.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGukbUZgoKI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219327" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The vehicles are based on Foxconn&#8217;s open software and hardware platform, MIH Consortium. They&#8217;re essentially designed as kits, serving as reference designs that EV brands can mass produce to their own specifications.</p>
<p>The Model T bus could hit roads as early as next year (hopefully under a different name), with a projected range of 400 km and top speed of 120 km/h (75 MPH). It also includes technology like pedestrian warnings, advanced temperature management and high crashworthiness, according to <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4318102" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>Taiwan News</em></a>.</p>
<p>Foxtron&#8217;s Model C is an electric SUV that will be available in Taiwan by 2023 with high efficiency and zippy 3.8 second 0-to-62 MPH speeds. It&#8217;s expected to cost below $NT 1 million ($35,700), said Foxconn chairperson Young Liu. The Model E, a luxury performance sedan designed in partnership with Pininfarina, will enter the market at a later, unspecified date. It will offer 750 horsepower and deliver a 0-62 MPH time of 2.8 seconds, along with a 750 km range. Yulon will be among the first EV makers to use the designs, said chairperson Lilian Chen.</p>
<p>Foxtron said it aims to capitalize on a trend of producing EVs close to the markets where they&#8217;re sold in order to keep costs down. The company plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/foxconn-electric-vehicle-factories-us-thailand-141124688.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">build EV factories</a> in the US, and recently <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37851210/lordstown-selling-plant-to-foxconn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">announced</a> that it would acquire <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-232701777.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">troubled</a> Lordstown&#8217;s Ohio manufacturing plant.

Foxconn said it would announce details of its EV production plans for Europe soon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://n26.com">N26</a> has raised a $900 million Series E round at a $9 billion valuation. That represents a big jump from the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/n26-raises-another-100-million-in-series-d-extension/">Series D</a> valuation of $3.5 billion. The Berlin-based startup operates a digital bank with 7 million clients across 25 countries.</p>
<p>Third Point Ventures and Coatue Management are leading today’s round. Dragoneer Investment Group and some of N26’s existing investors are also participating.</p>
<p>“It gives us a lot of time over the next three to four years to line up for an IPO,” co-founder and CEO Valentin Stalf told me earlier today. N26 also plans to hire 1,000 people “as soon as possible.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219319" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>N26 offers bank accounts and debit cards that you can control from a mobile app. Opening a bank account is quite easy as you don’t need to go to a branch and fill out lengthy paperwork. After that, N26 users get a bank account with their own account numbers and a virtual card that they can add to Apple Pay or Google Pay.</p>
<p>Users can then send and receive money from their account, spend and withdraw money using their card. On top of that, the company has launched several financial products, starting with premium subscriptions.</p>
<p>If you want to use N26 as your main bank account, you might be tempted to subscribe to N26 Smart, N26 You or N26 Metal. Those subscriptions let you create more sub-accounts, get higher limits and access more card designs. N26 You and N26 Metal users also get insurance products as part of their subscriptions.</p>
<p>In addition to premium subscriptions, N26 users can access first-party or third-party products, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/challenger-bank-n26-to-offer-insurance-products/">phone and electronics insurance</a>, credit products, overdraft capabilities, etc.</p>

<h2>Doubling-down on Europe</h2>
<p>Like many tech startups, the coronavirus pandemic affected N26’s roadmap. N26 tweaked its product offering to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/fintech-startups-are-increasingly-focusing-on-profitability/">optimize for profitability</a> and long-term financial sustainability. After some impressive growth across multiple markets, the startup has refocused on its core market (Europe) and its core products (revenue from card transactions, subscriptions and banking products).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fintech startups are increasingly focusing on profitability&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/fintech-startups-are-increasingly-focusing-on-profitability/embed/#?secret=DfRUDc86qE" data-secret="DfRUDc86qE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In particular, Valentin Stalf told me several times that the company’s focus is now Europe. First, there’s still a lot of room for growth in its strongest markets. “If you look at the penetration that we have — in Paris, we have 5 to 7% of the population. In Berlin, it’s 5 to 7% of the population as well,” he said.</p>
<p>“So the market is still huge so it makes a lot of sense to deepen our investments in those markets,” he added.</p>
<p>In addition to central Europe, N26 now plans to expand aggressively to Eastern Europe throughout 2022. This is a significant shift in the company’s international strategy. According to the company’s website, N26 still <a href="https://n26.com/en-br">plans to launch</a> N26 in Brazil — but there&#8217;s no launch date. In the U.S., people can’t sign up directly, they have to <a href="https://n26.com/en-us">join a waitlist first</a>.</p>
<p>But N26 wants to be a market leader. And let’s be honest, there are <em>a ton</em> of fintech startups around the world these days. In Brazil, <a href="https://nubank.com.br/en/">Nubank</a> has tens of millions of clients. In the U.S., <a href="https://www.chime.com">Chime</a> is also well-positioned to become a dominant player.</p>
<p>“We’re currently dominating in central Europe and then you have Revolut doing the U.K. and Eastern Europe mainly,” Stalf said. That’s why N26 wants to increase the size of the cake in central Europe and expand to Eastern Europe where there’s still room for some competition. N26 plans to open an office in Belgrade, Serbia.</p>
<h2>Building a grown-up company</h2>
<p>Startups tend to move fast and break things, as Facebook’s old motto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook,_Inc.#History">used to say</a>. And N26 is now trying to move away from this reputation of unpredictability.</p>
<p>While the company has a full-fledged banking license in Germany, the German banking regulator is keeping a close eye on N26. In 2019, BaFin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/n26-faces-banking-regulator-order-about-fraudulent-transactions/">criticized</a> N26 for some of its internal processes. Earlier this year, BaFin also imposed a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9b57f9f-ee90-4124-af82-15976d701ab9">$4.9 million fine</a> (€4.25 million).</p>
<p>“The fine that we got is a fine for 50 cases that we forwarded to the regulator too late — not within 72 hours,” Stalf told me. He’s not debating the fine and says N26 has to pay it. However, according to Stalf, the company has improved its internal processes since those cases occurred.</p>
<p>“We have invested a lot on regulatory topics over the last 18 months,” Stalf said. We’ll find out soon enough if that’s true as N26 and the German regulator have decided to temporarily limit new signups to a maximum of 50,000 to 70,000 new customers per month. If the German regulator thinks N26 is doing a good job when it comes to anti-money laundering, know-your-customer policies and more, those restrictions will be lifted in a few months.</p>
<p>Similarly, Sifted <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/fintech-equity-packages-europe/">criticized</a> N26 for its equity incentive plans for employees. Stalf admitted that it has been too restrictive until now. So the company plans to expand its employee equity pool. 100% of employees will participate in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). N26 employees will learn more about the terms of the plan later this week.</p>
<p>When you look at all these points of friction, it’s clear that N26 is looking for long-term solutions as it wants to remain an independent company. The long-term goal is an initial public offering.</p>
<p>“From today’s perspective there’s no need to raise more. It’s definitely an option that this will be the last round before a public listing,” Stalf said. He doesn’t want to rule out completely that another funding round is never going to happen, but it’s not the goal.</p>
<p>With that much money on the company’s bank account, N26 can also start working on long-term projects. For instance, the company wants to do more when it comes to investment and trading. In addition to day-to-day banking, investment and trading also represent a lot of opportunities when it comes to recurring interactions, revenue per customer and total transaction volume.</p>
<p>N26 is on track to process $90 billion in transaction volume in 2021. Now that it owns the customer relationship with its loyal user base, the company can add more products and greatly increase that metric.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">College is time for learning, and sometimes the best type of learning is hands-on where you come to understand a trade by doing it. Emory University students wanted to learn about venture investing, while figuring out a way to get funds to underrepresented startup founders. They are managing to do both in a new venture capital fund called <a href="https://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/entrepreneurship-innovation/programs/venture-fund">Peachtree Minority Venture Fund</a>, which will be introduced next spring as part of a class that students who run the fund will be taking.</p>
<p>The idea for the project had its genesis in some research at the Emory University Goizueta Business School. Willie Sullivan and his fellow students Kristen Little, Chis Anen and Alan Quigley were doing research on the experience of underrepresented entrepreneurs in the Atlanta area where the university is located.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we conducted interviews, one of the main things that came up, which always comes up, is how large of a problem access to capital is still for Black entrepreneurs. And so we were coming up with our recommendations. It was really &#8216;okay how can we as a university address this issue,'&#8221; Sullivan told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218896" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sullivan says that the research team understood that this was an age-old issue, one that there hasn&#8217;t been a great answer for. He also knew that students had been running venture funds for a couple of decades at other schools, so he began to explore the idea of starting one at Emory with the goal of finding a way to fund some of these companies while teaching students how to be VCs.</p>
<p>The team concluded that a student-run venture fund was a missing component in Emory&#8217;s business education, one that could be a great experiential learning opportunity for students to deal with real money making investments in real companies and conducting all of the due diligence and analysis that they would as a venture capitalist or investor at any company.</p>
<p>But Sullivan said the idea was to do more than that. They also wanted to help close the capital gap they found with their research by funding those startups that typically have a hard time accessing capital, looking not only at Black founders, but also Native American and Latinx founders.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218906" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218906" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2218906 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg" alt="Emory University Peachtree Minority Venture Fund founding team." width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Founding-Team-Photo-.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218906" class="wp-caption-text">Founding team: Kristen Little, Willie Sullivan, Chis Anen, Alan Quigley.

<p>&#8220;[We decided to] start the first student-run fund where we&#8217;re focusing on multiple things. First of all we&#8217;ll be making equity investments into these underrepresented minorities, but our goal is also to create multiple classes of investors of all different racial and ethnic backgrounds that have been super engaged with this type of entrepreneur while they were at Goizueta Business School,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He believes if the school can produce a new generation of investors used to looking at a more diverse group of businesses than the typical venture firms, they can bring these learnings with them when they go out into the world and join these companies.</p>
<p>But before they could form a venture fund, they needed money. Sullivan said he spoke to around a dozen other school venture funds and most of those had been funded by rich alums, an option he said that he didn&#8217;t really have. But when he pitched his idea to the Goizueta interim dean, Karen Sedatole, he said that she loved the idea and decided to allocate $1 million from the school&#8217;s endowment as seed capital for the fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s already really supported a lot of racial equity and racial justice things that we&#8217;ve done at the school. And once we laid out all our plans and how we were going to set this up, she basically said, &#8216;I want to allocate money from our endowment to set this up,'&#8221; Sullivan said.</p>
<p>The research and analysis will take place under the supervision of a Goizueta Business School professor as part of a class the student investors will be taking to be a part of this group. The course will teach students about the technical aspects of investing, such as understanding what a cap table is, as well as how to create a financial model. It will also examine the diversity and inclusion side of investing and how to avoid unconscious bias in investment decisions.</p>
<p>The fund is also in the process of setting up an advisory board of Atlanta area groups that includes The Russell Center for Innovation, Atlanta Tech Village and Venture Atlanta. And while the deal sourcing and final decisions will rest with the students, they will be able to lean on this advisory board whenever they have specific questions where they could benefit from the wisdom of a more experienced investor.</p>
<p>The venture fund will be run by three students who will serve as managing partners and do the bulk of organizing and deal sourcing. These students will also serve as teaching assistants for the professors teaching related coursework, and they will supervise the other students who will have titles like senior associates and analysts, just as you do at other firms. As the managing partners graduate, new managing partners would be selected from the staff from the previous year in order to create a level of continuity in the program.</p>
<p>The firm intends to make a couple of investments in the $20,000-$25,000 range each year, and also set up a micro investment fund with another four or five checks for around $10,000 per year to jump-start some companies with underrepresented owners who might not get the attention of traditional investors or banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other half of what we&#8217;re looking to do is to help those people who are right at the beginning, somebody that has a great idea, maybe they built out their product a little bit, maybe they even have some revenue, but what they really need is [a small check to get them going]&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The fund is still in the formation stage, but the first course is expected to begin in January with the first investments coming in March. Sullivan and his team has created a database of between 100 and 150 companies as a starting point for the class.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing a lot of that [setup] right now, really getting familiar with people who are out there and things like that so that once those students are trained and we can get started, we can just hit the ground running and hopefully make those first investments in March,&#8221; he said.</p>
