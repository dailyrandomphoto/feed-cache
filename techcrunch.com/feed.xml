										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last October as <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> was preparing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/">for its virtual Frontiers conference</a>, the company began thinking about different ways people could communicate on the platform. While it had built its name on being able to integrate a lot of services in a single place to alleviate the dreaded task-switching phenomenon, it has been largely text-based up until now.</p>
<p>More recently, Slack has started developing a few new features that could bring different ways of interacting to the platform. CEO Stewart Butterfield discussed them on Thursday with former TechCrunch reporter Josh Constine, now a SignalFire investor, <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/taming-the-hybrid-work-chimera-tips">in a Clubhouse interview</a>.</p>
<p>The talk was about the future of work, and Slack believes these new ways of communicating could help employees better connect online as we shift to a hybrid work world &#8212; one which has been hastened by the pandemic over the last year. There is a general consensus that many companies will continue to work in a hybrid fashion, even when the pandemic is over.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For starters, Slack aims to add a way to communicate by video. But instead of trying to compete with Zoom or Microsoft Teams, Slack is envisioning an experience that&#8217;s more like Instagram Stories.</p>
<p>Think about the CEO sharing an important announcement with the company, or the kind of information that might have gone out in a companywide email. Instead, you can skip the inbox and deliver the message directly by video. It&#8217;s taking a page from the consumer approach to social and trying to move it into the enterprise.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="y6at1voAY8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/">Slack introduces new features to ease messaging between business partners</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Slack introduces new features to ease messaging between business partners&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/slack-introduces-new-features-to-ease-messaging-between-business-partners/embed/#?secret=y6at1voAY8" data-secret="y6at1voAY8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Writing <a href="https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/innovation-for-a-new-moment">in a company blog post</a> earlier this week, Slack chief product officer Tamar Yehoshua was clear this was going to be an asynchronous approach, rather than a meeting kind of experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;To help with this, we are piloting ways to shift meetings toward an asynchronous video experience that feels native in Slack. It allows us to express nuance and enthusiasm without a meeting,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>While it was at it, Slack decided to create a way of just chatting by voice. As <a href="https://constine.substack.com/p/taming-the-hybrid-work-chimera-tips">Butterfield told Constine</a> in his Clubhouse interview, this is essentially Clubhouse (or Twitter Spaces) being built for Slack.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve always believed the ‘good artists copy, great artists steal’ thing, so we&#8217;re just building Clubhouse into Slack, essentially. Like that idea that you can drop in, the conversation&#8217;s happening whether you&#8217;re there or not, you can enter and leave when you want, as opposed to a call that starts and stops, is an amazing model for encouraging that spontaneity and that serendipity and conversations that only need to be three minutes, but the only option for you to schedule them is 30 minutes. So look out for Clubhouse built into Slack.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, it&#8217;s taking a consumer social idea and applying it to a business setting with the idea of finding other ways to keep you in Slack when you could be using other tools to achieve the same thing, whether it be Zoom meetings, email or your phone.</p>
<p>Butterfield also hinted that another feature &#8212; asynchronous audio, allowing you to leave the equivalent of a voicemail &#8212; could be coming some time in the future. A Slack spokesperson confirmed that it was in the works, but wasn&#8217;t ready to share details yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to look at these features without thinking about them in the context of the $27 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce acquisition of Slack</a> at the end of last year. When you put them all together, you have this set of tools that let you communicate in whatever way makes the most sense to you.</p>
<p>When you combine that <a href="https://slack.com/connect">Slack Connect DM</a>, a new feature to communicate outside the organization that was released this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/slacks-new-dm-feature-connect-is-thankfully-opt-in/">to some controversy,</a> as people wanted assurances that they could control spam and harassment, it takes the concept one step further &#8212; outside the organization itself.</p>
<p>As part of a larger entity like Salesforce, these tools could be useful across sales, service and even marketing as a way to communicate in a variety of ways inside and outside the organization. And they greatly expand the value prop of Slack as it becomes part of Salesforce sometime later this year.</p>
<p>While it began talking about the new audio and video features last fall, the company has been piloting them since the beginning of this year. So far Slack is not saying when the new features will be generally available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Headless commerce&#8221; is a phrase that gets thrown around lot (I&#8217;ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/">typed it several times</a> today already), but <a href="https://www.vuestorefront.io/">Vue Storefront</a> CEO Patrick Friday has an especially vivid way of using the concept to illustrate his startup&#8217;s place in the broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vue Storefront is the bodiless front end,&#8221; Friday said. &#8220;We are the walking head.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, while most headless commerce companies are focused on creating back-end infrastructure, Vue powers the front end, namely the progressive web applications with which consumers actually interact. The company describes itself as &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">the lightning-fast front-end platform for headless commerce.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Friday said that he and CTO Filip Rakowski created the Vue Storefront technology as an open-source project while working at e-commerce agency Divante, before eventually spinning it out into a separate startup last year. The company was also part of the latest class at accelerator Y Combinator, and it <a href="https://www.vuestorefront.io/blog/vue-storefront-raises-1-5m-to-turn-the-fastest-growing-open-source-ecommerce-project-into-a-business">recently raised $1.5 million in seed funding</a> led by SMOK Ventures and Movens VC.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VLG4AZMuci"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/">Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where is the e-commerce app ecosystem headed in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/where-is-the-e-commerce-app-ecosystem-headed-in-2021/embed/#?secret=VLG4AZMuci" data-secret="VLG4AZMuci" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We had to set up a new entity in the middle of COVID, we had to raise in the middle of COVID and we had to convince the agency to get rid of the product in the middle of COVID,&#8221; Friday said. He even recalled signing papers with an investor one morning in early December and doing an interview with Y Combinator that evening.</p>
<p>As they&#8217;ve created a business around the core open-source technology, Friday and his team have realized that Vue has more to offer than just building web apps, because it connects e-commerce platforms like Magento and Shopify with headless content management systems like Contentstack and Contentful, payments systems like PayPal and Stripe and other third-party services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130922" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130922" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130922" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?w=680" alt="Vue Storefront screenshot" width="680" height="371" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?resize=768,419 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Vue-Storefront-Mobile-Desktop.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130922" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vue Storefront</p></div></p>
<p>In fact, Friday said customers have been telling them, &#8220;You are like the glue. Headless was so complex to me, and then I got this Vue Storefront thing to come in on top everything else and be the glue connecting things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform has been used to create more than 300 stores worldwide. Friday said adoption has accelerated as the pandemic and resulting growth in e-commerce have driven businesses to realize they&#8217;re using &#8220;this legacy platform, using outdated frameworks and technologies from a good four or five years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rakowski added, &#8220;We also see that many customers actually come to us deciding that Vue Storefront can be the first step of migration to another platform. We can quickly migrate the front end and write back-end agnostic code.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because it had just raised funding, the Vue Storefront team did not participate in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/our-favorite-companies-from-y-combinators-w21-demo-day-part-1/">the recent YC Demo Day</a>, and it will be presenting at the next Demo Day instead. In the meantime, the company will be holding its own virtual <a href="https://hopin.com/events/vue-storefront-summit-2021">Vue Storefront Summit</a> on April 20.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In October 2019, The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/nyregion/nyc-amazon-delivery.html">reported</a> that 1.5 million packages were delivered in New York City every single day. Though convenient for customers and profitable for the Amazons of the world, getting so many boxes from warehouse to customer generates considerable negative externalities for cities.</p>
<p>As the Times put it, “The push for convenience is having a stark impact on gridlock, roadway safety, and pollution in New York City and urban areas around the world.”</p>
<p>Since that article was published, the global pandemic has taken e-commerce to new heights, and experts don’t expect this upward trend to slow down<a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-consumer-after-covid-19/575634/"> anytime soon</a>. Without strategic intervention, we will find our cities facing increasingly severe traffic problems, safety issues and polluting emissions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</p>
<p>The same frustrations have plagued urban roadways for decades. However, technology is finally catching up, providing new means of addressing the challenges of crowding, pollution and parking enforcement on dense city streets.</p>
<p>As is almost always the case, an effective solution begins by first understanding the detailed circumstances giving rise to the problem. In this case, a simple means of assessing the problem is to observe curbside parking and street traffic using streetlight cameras.</p>
<p>Deploying cameras to monitor public spaces may immediately incite the ire of die-hard privacy advocates (I consider myself among them), which is why companies like mine have taken a privacy-by-design approach to product development. Our technology processes video in real time and addresses further concerns about potential misuse for surveillance purposes by blurring faces and license plates beyond recognition prior to making any kind of image data available either internally or to public officials.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/embed/#?secret=i9e79lLV3H" data-secret="i9e79lLV3H" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The point of these cameras is not to surveil but rather to leverage concrete data from real-world city streets to generate crucial insights and power automations at the curb. Automotus’ computer vision software is already using this model to help cities manage the aforementioned flood of commercial vehicles on their streets.</p>
<p>This technology can also be used to optimize and incentivize parking turnover. According to one study, drivers in New York City<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/searching-for-parking-costs-americans-73-billion-a-year-300486543.html"> spend</a> an average of 107 hours per year searching for parking spots, at a cost of $2,243 per driver in wasted time, fuel and emissions, which represents $4.3 billion in total costs to the city. Similar wasteful dynamics are unfolding across America and the world. By collecting comprehensive data around the demand for curbside space, cities can design parking policies that ensure proper alignment between the supply of curb space and the way vehicles are actually using it.</p>
<p>In one pilot we ran on the campus of Loyola Marymount University, traffic caused by drivers searching for parking dropped by more than 20% after our data was used to adjust parking policy. Using data to optimize parking results in more efficient turnover, less time spent circling for a spot and reduced traffic delays. Real-time parking availability data can also be used to direct drivers to open parking spots via an application or API.</p>
<p>By arming city planners with accurate, up-to-date information on all forms of curbside activity, we empower them to fully understand the temporal and spatial patterns that rule their curbs. This gives planners the information they need to make informed decisions about curbside policy tailored to their city’s peculiarities.</p>
<p>Suddenly, questions such as “How many ride-hailing drop-offs occur here?” and “Whose delivery trucks are double parking on Tuesday morning?” become trivial to answer. Gone are the days of using vague heuristics to guide policy; this new wealth of information makes possible precise and impactful decisions on the locations of passenger parking, dedicated delivery zones and ride-hailing areas, as well as optimal rates to charge for parking, appropriate penalties for violations and much more.</p>
<p>This tech is also a win for delivery companies. When delivery fleets have data about real-time and predicted parking availability, this can improve route efficiency, saving them money. Instead of paying for curb usage via fines, delivery companies can instead receive an invoice for their time spent at the curb (a tax-deductible expense, I might add).</p>
<p>A<a href="https://www.columbus.gov/publicservice/parking/Loading-Zones-Rules-and-Regulations/"> study</a> done in Columbus, Ohio, found that designated loading zones decreased double parking violations by 50% and reduced commercial vehicle time at the curb by 28%. Radically increasing the efficiency of delivery translates into savings for companies like FedEx and Amazon, which can then afford to pay fair rates for their curb access and pass on those savings to consumers.</p>
<p>Several interrelated trends make the current moment an especially opportune time to apply new technology to our streets and curbs. Pre-pandemic, many cities already faced<a href="https://bbmr.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/Final%20SOTA%20FY20-compressed%20web.pdf"> declining revenue</a> from parking as citizens shifted toward using ride-shares. Now,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/14/cities-budget-cuts-coronavirus/"> thousands of American municipalities are expecting major budget shortfalls</a> in the wake of COVID-19. At the same time, a report from the World Economic Forum<a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-the-last-mile-ecosystem"> predicts</a> that the number of commercial delivery vehicles will increase by 36% in inner cities by the year 2030. Our research suggests that more than 50% of parking violations are unenforced and committed by commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that Columbus was the<a href="https://www.industryweek.com/technology-and-iiot/emerging-technologies/article/21973956/and-the-smart-city-of-the-future-is-columbus-ohio"> winner</a> of the 2016 federal Smart City Challenge. When former President Barack Obama pledged over $160 million as part of his<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/09/14/fact-sheet-administration-announces-new-smart-cities-initiative-help"> &#8220;Smart Cities&#8221; initiative</a> in 2015, reducing congestion and pollution were among the program’s major goals. Better management of parking and curb space are crucial tools for achieving these aims. Though former President Donald Trump campaigned on a massive infrastructure plan, his delivery on promises in this area were<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-16/what-did-all-those-infrastructure-weeks-add-up-to"> mixed at best</a>. Despite the lack of federal support, there are currently promising initiatives underway in cities such as Santa Monica, which is<a href="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/santa-monica-LACI-pilot-voluntary-zero-emissions-delivery-zone/579937/"> piloting</a> a zero-emissions delivery zone in the heart of its downtown.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has outlined a plan to build the infrastructure America needs both to combat climate change and modernize urban transportation. This plan includes<a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/building-a-stronger-fairer-economy/"> a provision</a> for 500,000 public charging stations for electric vehicles; changes to our cities that allow drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and others to safely share the road; and investment in critical clean energy solutions.</p>
<p>Curb management technology is one of a suite of options on the market that federal and local governments can leverage to reduce pollution and improve quality of life in cities. If the incoming administration is willing to champion this novel approach toward solving the problems of urban mobility, America’s infrastructure will not just be modernized but made ready for the future.</p>
<p>I, for one, hope this renewal is realized; our nation’s health, safety and shared prosperity depend on it.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">This year is all about the roll-ups. No, not those fruity snacks you used to find in your lunchbox; roll-ups are the aggregation of smaller companies into larger firms, creating a potentially compelling path for equity value.</p>
<p>Right now, all eyes are on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thrasio-reaches-1b-valuation-sets-new-us-speed-record-for-unicorns-301093829.html">Thrasio, the fastest company to reach unicorn status</a>, and its cadre of competitors, such as Heyday, Branded and Perch, all vying to become the modern model of consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies.</p>
<p>Making things even more interesting, famed investor and operator Keith Rabois recently announced that he too is <a href="https://www.axios.com/keith-rabois-startup-ecommerce-e164cd05-7c36-4dbc-9d95-7bc311179007.html">working on a roll-up concept</a> called OpenStore with Atomic co-founder Jack Abraham.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Like any investment firm, to be successful, a roll-up should have a thesis or two providing it with a cohesive strategy across its portfolio.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Thrasio has been reaping the benefits of the e-commerce market’s Cambrian explosion in 2020, in which over $1 billion of capital was invested in firms on a mission to <a href="https://www.marketplacepulse.com/marketplaces-year-in-review-2020">acquire independent Amazon sellers and brands</a>.</p>
<p>This catalyst can be attributed to a few key factors, the first and most notable being the <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/05/29/how-covid-19-is-changing-everyones-behaviour-and-how-businesses-can-react/">pandemic accelerating spending on Amazon</a> and e-commerce more broadly. Next is the low cost of capital, a reflection of interest rates making markets flush with cash; this has made it easier to raise both equity and debt capital.</p>
<p>The third is the emerging and quantifiable proofs of concept: Thrasio is one of several raising hundreds of millions of dollars, and Anker, a primarily Amazon-native brand, went public. Both stories have provided further validation that a meaningful brand can be built on top of Amazon’s marketplace.</p>
<p>Still, the interest in creating value through e-commerce brands is particularly striking. Just a year ago, digitally native brands had fallen out of favor with venture capitalists <a href="https://builtin.com/e-commerce/dtc-dnvb-brand-growth">after so many failed to create venture-scale returns</a>. So what’s the roll-up hype about?</p>
<h2>Roll-ups are another flavor of investing</h2>
<p>Roll-ups aren’t a new concept; they’ve existed for a while. In the offline world, roll-ups often achieve much greater exit multiples, known as “<a href="https://www.axial.net/forum/multiple-arbitrage-primer/#:~:text=Multiple%20arbitrage%20is%20the%20practice,company%20is%20bought%20and%20sold.">multiple arbitrage</a>,” so it’s no surprise that the trend is making its way online.</p>
<p>Historically, though, roll-ups haven’t been all that successful; <a href="https://hbr.org/2008/09/seven-ways-to-fail-big">HBR notes that more than two-thirds of roll-ups fail to create</a> value for investors. While roll-ups are often effective at building larger companies, they don’t always increase profits or operating cash flows.</p>
<p>Acquirers, i.e., those rolling up smaller companies, need to uncover new operating approaches for their acquired companies to increase equity value, and the only way to increase equity value is to increase operating cash flow. There are four ways to do this: reducing overhead costs, reducing operating costs without sacrificing price or volume, increasing pricing without sacrificing volume or increasing volume without increasing unit costs.</p>
<p>E-commerce could present a new and different opportunity, or at least that’s what investors and smart money are betting on. Let’s explore how this new wave of roll-ups is approaching both growth and value creation.</p>
<h2>Channel your enthusiasm: Why every roll-up needs a thesis</h2>
<p>Like any investment firm, to be successful, a roll-up should have a thesis or two providing it with a cohesive strategy across its portfolio. There are a few that are trending in this particular wave.</p>
<p>The first is the primary distribution channel upon which a company grows. Evaluating companies with a common distribution channel can be helpful for creating economies of scale, focusing marketing and growth resources in a specific channel versus diluting resources across several.</p>
<p>On the downside, these companies become reliant on this distribution strategy and any changes could create vulnerabilities for their portfolio companies. As a study, let’s take a look at how two companies take different approaches:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week’s Amazon public relations push will no doubt go down as one of the odder public-facing strategies in tech. As some of the company’s biggest rivals were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/house-big-tech-hearing-energy-commerce-misinformation-extremism/">getting ready to virtually testify</a> on Capitol Hill, the retail giant’s CEO of worldwide consumer business appeared to suggest that Amazon is not only as progressive as self-declared democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, but also more effective in achieving those leftist policies.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Vermont senator’s visit to Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama fulfillment center, Dave Clark tweeted, “I welcome [Sanders] to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers, but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/3 I welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSanders?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SenSanders</a> to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace. I often say we are the Bernie Sanders of employers, but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace <a href="https://t.co/Fq8D6vyuh9">https://t.co/Fq8D6vyuh9</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Dave Clark (@davehclark) <a href="https://twitter.com/davehclark/status/1374853182484963332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The statement was unsurprisingly greeted with pushback from labor groups. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) sent TechCrunch a lengthy response from president Stuart Appelbaum to the odd statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>How arrogant and tone deaf can Amazon be? Do they really believe that the wage they pay – which is below what workers in nearby unionized warehouses receive and below Alabama’s median wage – gives them the right to mistreat and dehumanize their employees, put their workers’ health and safety in jeopardy, require them to maintain an unbearable pace, which even Amazon itself admits that a quarter of their workforce won’t be able to meet, and to deny working men and women the dignity and respect they deserve.</p></blockquote>
<p>The organization, which is helping facilitate the Bessemer warehouse’s union voting, goes on to cite high turnover rates and pay cuts amid the pandemic and founder Jeff Bezos’s ballooning wealth. The founder &#8212; who is set to step down as CEO some time in Q3 &#8212; <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/21/billionaires-who-added-the-most-to-their-net-worths-in-2020.html">reportedly added more than $72 billion</a> to his net worth in 2020, as Amazon employees became essential workers amid COVID-19-fueled shutdowns.</p>
<p>“Stuart Appelbaum, Chief Disinformation Officer of RWDSU, in an attempt to save his long declining union, is taking alternative facts to a whole new level,” Amazon’s head of worldwide comms Drew Herdener tells TechCrunch. “But our employees are smart and know the truth—starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace. We encourage all of our employees to vote.”</p>
<p>For many in the U.S., Amazon’s online delivery service provided a lifeline, as many stores were forced to close over pandemic precautions. The Bessemer facility <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/news/2020/04/16/amazon-officially-opens-in-bessemer-jobs-still.html">opened on March 29</a>, just as the first wave was cresting in the U.S. The company was anticipating a potential strain on its resources as record numbers of Americans were suddenly forced to stay home and were otherwise avoiding in-person shopping at all costs.</p>
<p>“Our team at Amazon is thankful for the support we have received from state and community leaders, and we are excited to be a part of the Bessemer community,” Director of Operations Travis Maynard said at the time. “We’re proud to create great jobs in Bessemer with industry-leading pay and benefits that start on day one, in a safe, innovative workplace.”</p>
<p>After several years of negative coverage over its warehouse working conditions, it’s not surprising that the company has become proactively reflexive when it comes to working conditions.</p>
<p>“When New York City became the epicenter [of COVID-19], that’s when the Bessemer facility opened up,” Christian Smalls, a former Amazon worker-turned-critic said at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/the-path-forward-for-essential-workers/">TechCrunch’s Justice event earlier this month</a>. &#8220;So the union got a head start on talking to workers. So that’s a gem for anybody or any union that plans on trying to unionize the building — that you have a facility in your community that’s about to open up, when opening, that’s the best time to connect with workers. That’s what happened last year. And as a result, the workers had seen what happened to the workers that were unprotected and they don’t want that. They want better for themselves.”</p>

<p>Next week, the RWDSU will begin tallying votes for what has shaped up to be the largest union push since Amazon’s 1995 founding, much to the company’s chagrin. In recent months, the company has been hoping to throw a wrench in the works. In January, it unsuccessfully appealed a ruling by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that allowed workers to vote by mail, as more than 350,000 COVID-19 cases had been reported in the state since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Amazon expressed concerns that mail-in voting would monopolize too much time and resources. “Union avoidance” firm Jackson Lewis <a href="https://www.jacksonlewis.com/publication/plan-ahead-employers-nlrb-ordering-mail-ballot-elections-because-covid-19-pandemic">suggested</a> that such rules put employers at a disadvantage, “because eligible voters are given several days after receiving their ballots to return them to the NLRB, the impact and momentum of the employer’s voter education campaign is decreased. This does not exist in connection with a manual ballot election, where the employer may educate employees one-on-one until the last moment before they vote.”</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: Amazon is running glossy anti-union ads to combat the organizing drive by workers at their Bessemer, AL, warehouse.

<p>The following month, Amazon ran anti-union ads on its streaming subsidiary, Twitch. The spots featured employees discussing why they were planning to vote no, and compelled people to visit Do it Without Dues, which blasted potential union membership fees.</p>
<p>“Amazon feels that it has to go to extremes like this in order to gaslight its workers about the dreadful working conditions at its Bessemer warehouse,” Appelbaum <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301352/twitch-removes-amazon-anti-union-ads">told the press</a> in response to the ads. Twitch pulled the spots, adding that they, “should never have been allowed to run on [the] service.”</p>

<p>Workers have continued to be critical of conditions in Amazon’s warehouses, frequently comparing the work to that of robots that have increasingly become their colleagues. Last week,<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/bessemer-alabama-amazon-worker-on-the-union-drive.html"> <em>New York Magazine</em> published a piece</a> from a Bessemer picker who describes long and tiring days on the floor.</p>
<p>“It really is not fair for employees to get fired for going to the bathroom,” the worker, Darryl Richardson, tells the magazine. “Sometimes the water in the bathrooms isn’t working on the floor, and you have to go down another flight of stairs to go to the bathroom.”</p>
<p>A number of similar stories have been recounted to the media over the years. Images of workers peeing in water bottles so as to not be docked pay &#8212; or worse &#8212; for taking a bathroom break have almost certainly become the most visceral.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/2 You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one.</p>
<p>&mdash; Amazon News (@amazonnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1374911222361956359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan called out Clark’s Sanders comparisons on Twitter earlier this week, an official account shot back, “We hope you can enact policies that get other employers to offer what we already do.”</p>
<p>Sanders has been a long-time critic of the company. The Vermont senator was one of a handful of progressive politicians who compelled Amazon to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour, while criticizing massive tax breaks. In 2018, he introduced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/bernie-sanders-intros-stop-bad-employers-by-zeroing-out-subsidies-bezos-bill/">Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (BEZOS) bill</a>.</p>

<p>“The taxpayers in this country should not be subsidizing a guy who’s worth $150 billion, whose wealth is increasing by $260 million every single day,” Sanders told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/28/bernie-sanders-problem-with-amazon/">TechCrunch at the time.</a> “That is insane. He has enough money to pay his workers a living wage. He does not need corporate welfare. And our goal is to see that Bezos pays his workers a living wage.” That November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/amazon-minimum-wage/">the company relented</a>, increasing minimum wage to $15 an hour &#8212; something that has since become a major talking point for Amazon.</p>
<p>Responding to Pocan’s comments about “union-bust[ing] &amp; mak[ing] workers urinate in water bottles,” the Amazon News Twitter account wrote, “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one.”</p>

<p>&mdash; Rep. Mark Pocan (@repmarkpocan) <a href="https://twitter.com/repmarkpocan/status/1374937541338628096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Pocan’s reply was simple: “[Y]es, I do believe your workers. You don&#8217;t?”</p>
<p>In addition to past reports of warehouse workers and delivery drivers peeing in bottles, a new report from<a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/25/amazon-drivers-pee-bottles-union/"> The Intercept notes</a> that the act is “widespread,” due to workplace pressures. It cites an email from last May that also adds defecation into the mix.</p>
<p>“We’ve noticed an uptick recently of all kinds of unsanitary garbage being left inside bags: used masks, gloves, bottles of urine,” the email titled Amazon Confidential reads. “By scanning the QR code on the bag, we can easily identify the DA who was in possession of the bag last. These behaviors are unacceptable, and will result in Tier 1 Infractions going forward. Please communicate this message to your drivers. I know it may seem obvious, or like something you shouldn’t need to coach, but please be explicit when communicating the message that they CANNOT poop, or leave bottles of urine inside bags.”</p>

<p>As misguided or glib as the Amazon Twitter response may seem, it’s clear why the company has gone on the offensive here. &#8220;We’re not alone in our support for a higher federal minimum wage,&#8221; the accounted noted in the wake of the dustup with Pocan. The company adds that it <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/job-creation-and-investment/new-study-is-a-powerful-reminder-of-the-need-for-action-on-the-minimum-wage?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=tw&amp;utm_term=amznnews&amp;utm_content=Ipsos_15&amp;linkId=114538207">has been pushing</a> for a federal minimum wage increase following its own.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Marco Rubio says he ‘stands with’ Amazon warehouse workers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/marco-rubio-says-he-stands-with-amazon-warehouse-workers/embed/#?secret=36y0ijhvms" data-secret="36y0ijhvms" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The push to unionize, meanwhile, has made strange political bedfellows, ranging from Stacey Abrams to Marco Rubio. Breaking with the customary party position, the Republican senator wrote in an op-ed, &#8220;Here’s my standard: When the conflict is between working Americans and a company whose leadership has decided to wage culture war against working-class values, the choice is easy — I support the workers. And that’s why I stand with those at Amazon’s Bessemer warehouse today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rubio&#8217;s support of unionizing was tied, in part, to concerns over a &#8220;‘woke’ human resources fad,&#8221; but it&#8217;s still fairly uncommon for an event like this to find him on the side of the likes of Joe Biden, who had previously promised to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon will no doubt be keeping a close eye on Tuesday’s vote count, aware that the results will have a far wider ranging impact than the 6,000 workers currently employed at Bessemer. If unionization fails, the company will tout the results as vindication that its work force is perfectly happily without labor interference. A vote to unionize, on the other hand, could well embolden further unionization efforts across the company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With Roblox’s massive IPO this month, game developers, brands and investors alike are wondering what factors cause the most successful games on this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/welcome-to-bloxburg-public-investors/">$47 billion</a> platform to break out from the millions of user-generated passion projects.</p>
<p>According to Roblox’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm">S-1 filing</a>, nearly 250 developers and creators earned $100,000 or more in Robux in the year through September 2020 out of nearly 1 million creators on the platform.</p>
<p>From Gamefam&#8217;s first game two years ago that topped out at only 25 concurrent players to our current portfolio with 2 million to 3 million daily visits, our team learned to develop on Roblox the hard way &#8212; by trial and error and by getting better at listening to the Roblox community’s unique gamer culture and vernacular.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Even the most experienced and talented game designers from the mobile F2P business usually fail to understand what features matter to Robloxians.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>For those entrepreneurs just starting their journey in Roblox game development, these are the most common mistakes I have seen gaming professionals (myself included) make on Roblox:</p>
<h2>1. Using the established free-to-play (F2P) mobile game mechanics</h2>
<p>In the F2P mobile games market, it’s all about layered game loops: play a match with the hero, level the hero up using resources from the match, buy more heroes to merge with the first hero, open up new matches with new rules to win more resources, and on and on. These require ongoing player tutorials across hours of play sessions. These mechanics tend to backfire on Roblox because players have no tolerance for anything but immediate, visceral fun.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in mobile F2P, a robust tutorial for new users is oftentimes one of the biggest investments during development. But in our Roblox game Speed Run Simulator (more than 400,000 daily visits), we saw a significant increase in D1 retention when we removed the tutorial entirely and just allowed existing players to guide new players’ understanding of the game. The differences between Roblox and mobile F2P are not only numerous but also sometimes profoundly counterintuitive.</p>
<h2>2. Optimizing to make money off of &#8220;whales&#8221;</h2>
<p>Roblox players spend because they’re getting something they want. They won’t be cajoled or coerced into spending like in a mobile game where progress is restricted or slowed without making an in-app purchase (think Candy Crush).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota&#8217;s innovation-focused subsidiary Woven Planet, has announced an investment into Silicon Valley-based autonomous delivery vehicle company Nuro. This kicks off the new $800 million strategic fund, which will invest in growth-stage technology companies that could one day develop into partners or acquisitions to further a mission of building the future of safe mobility, according to George Kellerman, Woven Capital’s head of investments and acquisitions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woven Capital&#8217;s contribution was part of Nuro’s $500 million Series C funding round, which was announced last November. Chipotle also invested in the round, which also included funds managed by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., with participation from new investors Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, LLC and Baillie Gifford. The specific amounts invested by each stakeholder were not disclosed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toyota announced the <a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/woven-capital-new-800m-global-investment-fund-toyota/">$800 million investment pool in September 2020</a>, and Woven Capital was officially formed in January 2021, with the aim of investing in technologies including autonomous mobility, machine learning, artificial intelligence, automation, connectivity and data and analytics. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nuro was a good jumping off point, because a lot of the work that we’re doing is really focused on developing autonomous passenger vehicles, so this is a way for us to learn and advance through a partner that is laser-focused on local goods delivery,” Kellerman told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of opportunity to learn from them, and potentially over time, to collaborate and help them expand globally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuro’s fleet of cargo-only self-driving vehicles has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already been approved by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles to test on public roads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, delivering goods from partners like Krogers, Domino’s, Walmart and CVS. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated the need for goods delivery, giving Nuro an opportunity to become a leader in this space. Woven Capital saw an opportunity to help accelerate and strengthen that leadership position, while also setting up a strategic knowledge sharing arrangement between the two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Woven Capital] has assembled a great team with ambitious goals for the future, and we share a common objective of transforming the way people live and move to make life better,” said Nuro co-founder and president Dave Ferguson in a statement. “We’ll use this new capital, and the support of one of the largest automotive companies in the world, to continue growing our team and building a great autonomous delivery product.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automation will be a big part of Woven Capital’s portfolio, which exists to support all of <a href="https://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2020/08/toyota-creates-woven-planet-to-spearhead-tech-development-growth/">parent Woven Planet’s activities</a>, including <a href="https://www.woven-city.global">Woven City</a>, a testing ground for new technologies set in an interconnected smart city prototype. In February, Toyota broke ground at the Higashi-Fuji site in Susono City, Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we think about Woven City, we think about autonomous mobility and automation more broadly,” said Kellerman. “To facilitate that, you’re going to need artificial intelligence, machine learning, data and analytics, connectivity. So we’re going to be building a portfolio that has investments in all those areas.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing trend in the mobility industry is to view mobility not just as the movement of people and goods, but as the movement of information and data. Woven Planet recognizes this and is taking a software-first approach, particularly when it comes to automobiles. This means that instead of the historical auto industry approach of designing the hardware first, and then fitting in the software to operate that vehicle, you start with the software and build hardware around it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building off a software-first architecture provides a lot flexibility for future innovation. If the hardware changes, you don’t have to rewrite the code, you could just add in another application. Kellerman said all the software Woven Planet is developing as a company should be usable in as many applications as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having really strong, integrated software is also the logical next step for connected mobility, and it opens up doors for rethinking what a vehicle has the potential to transport. A Nuro vehicle isn’t just a vehicle for whatever groceries it’s delivering, but it’s also a vehicle for all the information it picks up along the way and transmits back to the cloud, such as traffic flows and weather patterns. The value, therefore, is less in the A to B utility, and more in the interchange of information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the information collected by Nuro that could be immediately useful to Woven City is that related to street safety. Nuro’s vehicles don’t carry passengers, so the design features focus more on the safety of people outside of the vehicle, the aggregate data of which could be useful in human-centered city planning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, Woven Capital’s long-term view is always a potential funnel to future mergers and acquisitions, said Kellerman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Toyota is not historically a very acquisitive company, but within Woven Planet we’re building a corporate development team with an eye to how we can accelerate the vision and mission of Woven Planet through strategic acquisitions, as well,” said Kellerman.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hub.inc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a productivity platform for technical pre-sales, has formally launched with $1 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Freddy Mangum and CTO Karl Gainey founded Hub in 2020. The pair both had experience in technical sales and recognized the challenges of using spreadsheets to manage their business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They researched and surveyed sales engineers at big and small companies alike, discovering that many of these professionals were spending a lot of time doing things like “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrangling data to report to management, forcing individual contributors to enter data into a CRM (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">customer relationship management) system.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Performing these kinds of mundane tasks was taking time away from them actually selling,” said Mangum. “We also came to the conclusion that technical sales professionals have been the unsung heroes of sales, behind the scenes driving enterprise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they set about creating a better way for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">presales, solution architects and sales engineers to manage their day-to-day technical sales activities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then COVID hit, and obviously, as Mangum puts it, digital selling became much more real.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That really accentuated the need for specific commercial tooling,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based Hub was born. The company describes its offering as a SaaS application that “securely interconnects and complements popular CRM systems and productivity applications.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a personalized productivity platform, Hub is designed to help individual contributors manage the sales process. By gaining greater visibility into every step, the goal is to better analyze and do more accurate forecasting so an organization can better “identify investment areas while taking corrective actions in real time,” Mangum said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our tool </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can help them automate the mundane tasks and put the focus on high-value tasks to actually win more business,” he added.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130773" style="width: 666px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130773" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2130773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hub-product-screenshot.png?w=300" alt="" width="656" height="376" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hub-product-screenshot.png 2833w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hub-product-screenshot.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hub-product-screenshot.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hub-product-screenshot.png?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hub-product-screenshot.png?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hub-product-screenshot.png?resize=1536,879 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hub-product-screenshot.png?resize=2048,1173 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Hub-product-screenshot.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Courtesy of Hub</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeting technical sales professionals is an underserved market, according to Mangum, which presents tremendous opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors in the company include Tom Noonan, general partner of Atlanta-based TechOperators (and former chairman and CEO of Internet Security Systems, which was acquired in 2007 by IBM for $1.3 billion) and SalesLoft CEO and co-founder Kyle Porter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Noonan, the pandemic presented the challenge of keeping an enterprise sales force effective while working remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest concern was not that sales people couldn’t engage with customers. It was how the technical part of the sales cycle was going to be conducted remotely, such as the concepts demonstrations integrations, the modifications, all the things that have to be articulately communicated, and also aligned with the customer&#8217;s needs,” he told TechCrunch. “And to me that just made the need for this model of selling that we&#8217;re in today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Noonan believes these teams are going to question why they spent so much time on travel and on-site activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More and more customers have actually gotten accustomed to remote interactions and even more importantly, many of the customers are not working in a place of business now either,” he said. “And that leaves a huge challenge for the solution architects, because they are the glue that bridge between a buyer saying that&#8217;s interesting, and an organization concluding that the capabilities of whatever system is being sold to them truly meets their needs both from a technical perspective and integration perspective and a functional perspective.”</span></p>
<p>Hub, he believes, can help address that challenge.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a diverse founding team (Mangum is a Bolivian immigrant and Gainey is Black), Hub aims to reflect that diversity in its team. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its developers are based in Argentina, for example. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As someone who graduated from ESL when I came to this country it is important that opportunities not be closed off to people just because of language barriers,” Mangum said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When TechCrunch covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/uipath-raises-30m-to-build-software-robots-for-internal-business-tasks/">UIPath&#8217;s Series A in 2017</a>, it was a small startup out of Romania working in a little known area of enterprise software called robotic process automation (RPA).</p>
<p>Then the company took off with increasingly large multibillion dollar valuations. It progressed through its investment rounds, culminating with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">a $750 million round</a> on an eye-popping $35 billion valuation last month.</p>
<p>This morning, the company took the next step on its rapid-fire evolutionary path <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/a-first-look-at-uipaths-ipo-filing/">when it filed its S-1</a> to go public. To illustrate just how fast the company&#8217;s rise has been, take a look at its funding history:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2130783" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130783" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2130783" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UIPath-chart2.png?w=680" alt="Chart illustrating rapid rise of UIPath through its funding rounds from 2017-2021" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UIPath-chart2.png 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UIPath-chart2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UIPath-chart2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UIPath-chart2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UIPath-chart2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UIPath-chart2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UIPath-chart2.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/UIPath-chart2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130783" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>RPA is much better understood these days with larger enterprise software companies like SAP, Microsoft, IBM and ServiceNow getting involved. With RPA, companies can automate a mundane process like processing an insurance claim, moving work automatically, while bringing in humans only when absolutely necessary. For example, instead of having a person enter a number in a spreadsheet from an email, that can happen automatically.</p>
<p>In June 2019, Gartner reported that RPA was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/gartner-finds-rpa-is-fastest-growing-market-in-enterprise-software/">the fastest-growing area</a> in enterprise software, growing at over 60% per year, and attracting investors and larger enterprise software vendors to the space. While RPA&#8217;s growth has slowed as it matures, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-09-21-gartner-says-worldwide-robotic-process-automation-software-revenue-to-reach-nearly-2-billion-in-2021">a September 2020 Gartner report</a> found it expanding at a more modest 19.5% with total revenue expected to reach $2 billion in 2021. Gartner found that stand-alone RPA vendors UIPath, Blue Prism and Automation Anywhere are the market leaders.</p>
<p>Although the market feels rather small given the size of the company&#8217;s valuation, it&#8217;s still a nascent space. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1734722/000119312521094920/d98556ds1.htm">In its S-1 filing this morning</a>, the company painted a rosy picture, projecting a $60 billion addressable market. While TAM estimates tend to trend large, UIPath points out that the number encompasses far more than pure RPA into what they call &#8220;Intelligent Process Automation.&#8221; That could include not only RPA, but also process discovery, workflow, no-code development and other forms of automation.</p>

<p>Indeed, as we wrote earlier today on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">the soaring process automation market</a>, the company is probably going to need to expand into these other areas to really grow, especially now that it&#8217;s competing with much bigger companies for enterprise automation dollars.</p>
<p>While UIPath is in the midst of its quiet period, it came up for air this week to announce that <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210323005238/en/UiPath-Acquires-Cloud-Elements-to-Deliver-Expanded-API-Based-Automation-Capabilities">it had bought Cloud Elements</a>, a company that gives it access to API integration, an important component of automation in the enterprise. Daniel Dines, the company co-founder and CEO said the acquisition was about building a larger platform of automation tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;The acquisition of Cloud Elements is just one example of how we are building a flexible and scalable enterprise-ready platform that helps customers become fully automated enterprises,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>While there is a lot of CEO speak in that statement, there is also an element of truth in that the company is looking at the larger automation story. It can use some of the cash from its prodigious fundraising to begin expanding on its original vision with smaller acquisitions that can fill in missing pieces in the product road map.</p>
<p>The company will need to do that and more to compete in a rapidly moving market, where many vendors are fighting for different parts of the business. As it continues its journey to becoming a public company, it will need to continue finding new ways to increase revenue by tapping into different parts of the wider automation stack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While new headless commerce platforms are emerging all the time, <a href="https://www.swell.is">Swell</a> CEO Eric Ingram told me that it remains &#8220;really hard to do something new in e-commerce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically, he told me that most headless platforms (which offer back-end infrastructure separate from the front-end shopping experience) allow businesses to build a faster shopping experience, but they&#8217;re largely designed for marketplaces where you search, browse and purchase from a traditional product catalog.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most interesting ideas in e-commerce aren&#8217;t just another catalog,&#8221; Ingram said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Swell, which is announcing that it has raised $3.4 million in seed funding, was designed to offer more flexibility when it comes to the underlying business models. Ingram (who founded the company with Stefan Kende, Dave Loneragan, Joshua Voydik and Mark Regal) described it as the &#8220;future-proof backend&#8221; for e-commerce companies, which can grow and adapt with them as their business models evolve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Typical catalogs&#8221; have been built on the platform, he said, but it also supports <a href="https://www.spinn.com">Spinn</a>&#8216;s marketplace of independent coffee roasters, B2B vacuum pump marketplace <a href="https://www.nowvac.com">Nowvac</a> and ethical direct-to-consumer diamond retailer <a href="https://greatheights.com">Great Heights</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fftdCHea8s"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/chord-series-a/">Chord, a headless commerce startup led by former Glossier execs, raises $18M</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chord, a headless commerce startup led by former Glossier execs, raises $18M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/chord-series-a/embed/#?secret=fftdCHea8s" data-secret="fftdCHea8s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In fact, Voydik described Swell as &#8220;infinitely flexible.&#8221; Among other things, the company says it achieves this flexibility by offering API access to every component, as well as native subscription support and an unlimited number of product attributes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every store on Swell effectively has their own database SaaS platform,&#8221; Ingram added.</p>
<p>Overall, he said the platform offers the flexibility that you&#8217;d normally get from an open-source approach without the technical headaches: &#8220;No one wants to maintain their own code base and their own database.&#8221;</p>

<p>He continued, &#8220;You don’t need to be technical, you don’t need to have developers to leverage this. A lot of our customers are developers, but a lot of them are just regular marketers and ops people who know a bit of development concepts and want to have control over the systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s new funding was led Jim Andelman of Bonfire Ventures, with participation from Willow Growth Partners, Andreas Klinger of Remote First Capital, Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, GitHub CTO Jason Warner and former Salesforce Commerce Cloud CEO Mike Micucci.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[UiPath added its name to the list of companies pursuing public-market offerings with the release of its S-1, which details a quickly growing software company with sharply improving profitability.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation platform UiPath added its name to the list of companies pursuing public-market offerings this morning with the release of its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1734722/000119312521094920/d98556ds1.htm">S-1 filing</a>. The document details a quickly growing software company with sharply improving profitability performance. The company also flipped from cash burn to cash generation on both an operating and free-cash-flow basis in its most recent fiscal year.</p>
<p>Companies that produce robotic process automation (RPA) software help enterprises reduce labor costs and errors. Instead of having a human perform repetitive tasks like data entry, processing credit card applications and scheduling cable installation appointments, RPA tools employ software bots instead.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Given that UiPath has a number of business lines, including a services effort that doubled in size during its most recent 12 months of operations, you might expect its blended gross margins to fade. They did not.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The phrase that matters most when digesting this IPO filing is <em>operating leverage</em>, what <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingleverage.asp">Investopedia defines</a> as &#8220;the degree to which a firm or project can increase operating income by increasing revenue.&#8221; In simpler terms, we can think of operating leverage as how quickly a company can boost profitability by growing its revenue.</p>
<p>The greater a company&#8217;s operating leverage, the more profitable it becomes as it grows its top line; in contrast, companies that see their profitability profile erode as their revenue scales have poor operating leverage.</p>
<p>Among early-stage companies in growth mode, losing money is not a sin — after all, startups raise capital to deploy it, often making their near-term financial results a bit wonky from a traditionalist perspective. But for later-stage companies, the ability to demonstrate operating leverage is a great way to indicate future profitability, or at least future cash-flow generation.</p>
<p>So, the UiPath S-1 filing is at once an interesting picture of a company growing quickly while reducing its deficits rapidly, and a look at what a high-growth company can do to show investors that it will, at some point, generate unadjusted net income.</p>
<p>There are caveats, however: UiPath had some particular cost declines in its most recent fiscal year that make its profitability picture a bit rosier than it otherwise might have proven, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. This morning, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/a-first-look-at-uipaths-ipo-filing/">now that we&#8217;ve looked at the big numbers</a>, let&#8217;s dig in a bit deeper and learn whether UiPath is as strong in operating leverage terms as a casual observer of its filing might guess.</p>
<p>Then we&#8217;ll dig into four other things that stuck out from its IPO filing. Into the data!</p>
<h2>Operating leverage, cost control and COVID-19</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2130698" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130698" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2130698 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-26-at-9.50.45-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="344" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-26-at-9.50.45-AM.png 831w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-26-at-9.50.45-AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-26-at-9.50.45-AM.png?resize=300,152 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-26-at-9.50.45-AM.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-26-at-9.50.45-AM.png?resize=680,344 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-26-at-9.50.45-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130698" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> UiPath</p></div></p>
<p>To avoid forcing you to flip between the filing and this piece, here&#8217;s UiPath&#8217;s income statement for its fiscal years that roughly correlate to calendar 2019 and calendar 2020:</p>
<p>From top-down, it&#8217;s clear UiPath is growing rapidly. We can see that its gross profit grew more quickly than its overall revenue in its most recent 12-month period. As you can imagine, that combination led to rising gross margins at the company, from 82% in its fiscal year ending January 31, 2020, to 89% in its next fiscal year.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s super good, frankly; given that UiPath has a number of business lines, including a services effort that doubled in size during its most recent 12 months of operations, you might expect its blended gross margins to fade. They did not.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the following section, the company&#8217;s cost profile, that leads us to our first real takeaway from the UiPath S-1:</p>
<h3>UiPath&#8217;s operating leverage looks good, even if COVID helped</h3>
<p>Every operating expense category at the company fell from the preceding fiscal year to its most recent. That&#8217;s an impressive result, and one that is key when it comes to understanding where UiPath&#8217;s recent operating leverage came from. But how the declines came to be is just as important to understand.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[At this point, if you aren't going public via a direct listing, traditional IPO or SPAC, are you even a growthy business?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At this point, if you aren&#8217;t going public via a direct listing, traditional IPO or SPAC, are you even a growthy business?</p>
<p>Every CEO I talk to at a startup that&#8217;s doing more than Series B-level revenue tells me that SPACs are circling, hungry for a deal so they won&#8217;t have to return collected capital to their original backers. There&#8217;s an old joke: If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Except this time, if all you have is a blank-check company, every erstwhile startup looks like a public company in waiting.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Enter WeWork. Yes, the company famous for torching a mountain of cash that would rival the Ever Given in sheer bulk is going public via a SPAC. This morning we&#8217;re going through <a href="https://www.wework.com/ideas/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/03/WeWork-Management-Presentation-March-2021-vF-1.pdf">its investor presentation</a>, asking ourselves questions like, &#8220;Is this as nasty a business as it was a few years ago?&#8221; and &#8220;Why, oh God, why do we have to talk about WeWork again?&#8221;</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. Axios, the rare media startup that appeared positioned for a good run, could merge with The Athletic and go public via a SPAC. At <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/media-startups-axios-and-the-athletic-discuss-merger-eyeing-spac-deal-11616756401">least per WSJ reporting</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>It&#8217;s possible to summon arguments in favor of the deal. The Athletic has what Axios lacks and vice versa, so perhaps combining the former&#8217;s subscription base with the newsletter-and-ads prowess of the latter would make for an attractive company. Maybe.</p>
<p>But the main gist of this morning is that private investors in companies of all stripes are trying to get their money out while it&#8217;s still possible. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/the-station-the-lidar-spac-craze-and-10-investors-give-their-mobility-predictions/">eleventy-seven lidar</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/battery-companies-are-the-latest-spac-target-as-evs-get-a-huge-regulatory-boost/">electric-vehicle SPACs</a>. These aren&#8217;t usually companies that are ready to go public; they&#8217;re companies with investors that are ready to cash out.</p>
<p>The same momentum applies to the WeWork deal and the possible Axios combo-and-SPAC, I reckon.</p>
<p>Today, greed isn&#8217;t really good, to quote an old movie. It&#8217;s been good for so long among the tech-and-money class that quoting a film about a corrupt financier is too boring to warrant even warmed-over ennui. Instead, greed is god, and we&#8217;re all watching its ascension.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s digest the latest sacrifices.</p>
<h2>WeWork</h2>
<p>First, is WeWork a recovered company that has shown an ability to grow while losing less money? Not really.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nestares and his co-founder Benedict Dohmen (they each gave the company a few syllables for its name) started Benitago while students at Dartmouth, with the back pain brand <a href="https://supportiback.com">Supportiback</a>. The company has subsequently expanded into categories like beauty, maternity and nutrition, but Nestares said they funded that growth with revenue, without raising much outside capital before now.</p>
<p>As a result, team members may not have been experts in, say, orthopedics, but they&#8217;ve succeeded because they&#8217;re &#8220;hyper-focused&#8221; on how brands can grow on Amazon, becoming what Nestares described as &#8220;Amazon natives.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crossbeam raises $25M to back startups built on &#8216;platform economies&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/crossbeam-first-fund/embed/#?secret=vEkwCbydhx" data-secret="vEkwCbydhx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The process usually starts with a comprehensive look at the competitive landscape and what customers are saying in their reviews. Then, Nestares said, &#8220;We design everything around Amazon, from the feature selection to the way we create the colors in the packaging [to] the way the product fits in an Amazon box.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company said that when it acquires brands, the process only takes a few weeks, and that the previous owners retain a financial stake in the brand&#8217;s continued growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a passive financial play, it&#8217;s an impact growth play,&#8221; Nestares added.</p>
<p>Amazon is unlikely to lose its e-commerce dominance anytime soon, but Nestares acknowledged that building Benitago&#8217;s business on a single platform is its &#8220;biggest risk.&#8221; At the same time, he suggested that the risks aren&#8217;t the same as, say, those faced by companies that are threatened any time Google changes its search algorithm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Amazon is different, because Amazon has the same goal as you: To sell to the customer as much as they can,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Benitago currently operates five brands with more than 100 total products. With the new funding, that number could increase dramatically — Nestares said there are 12 new brands in development, while he&#8217;s also hoping to acquire another 25 or more brands by the end of the year.</p>
<p>CoVenture led the equity funding and provided one of the credit lines.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s largest question and answer platform, Zhihu, began trading in New York at $9.50 per share at the lower end of its IPO range, valuing the company at about $5.3 billion.</p>
<p>The aggregate offering size of Zhihu&#8217;s IPO and the concurrent private placements is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zhihu-inc-announces-pricing-initial-123000235.html">$772.5 million</a>, assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs. With Zhihu&#8217;s sizable flotation, some Silicon Valley executives and investors may start to pay more attention to this 10-year-old company from China that was once simply regarded as the &#8220;Quora of China.&#8221;</p>
<p>Q&amp;A remains at the core of Zhihu, which means &#8220;do you know&#8221; in classical Chinese, but the service has become much more than the American counterpart that was founded two years before it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I think Quora is a good product, but I think Quora today still equals Quora 10 years ago,&#8221; said Kai-Fu Lee, whose investment firm Sinovation Ventures is a seed investor in Zhihu and is the company&#8217;s largest outside shareholder with a 13% stake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zhihu has already grown up and is on the path to becoming a multifaceted super app centered around knowledge, while Quora is still a question and answer website with an app,&#8221; added Lee, an AI expert and an avid Zhihu contributor himself.</p>
<p>Aside from facilitating Q&amp;As, Zhihu has also dabbled in premium content, live videos and audio, and online education, among other forms that it believes are ripe for sharing knowledge.</p>
<p>Today, Zhihu generates about 70-80% of its revenues from advertising, according to its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1835724/000119312521070815/d72883df1.htm">prospectus</a>, though other businesses like membership and e-commerce are growing financial contributors, a sign that it&#8217;s working to diversify monetization streams.</p>
<p>The willingness of Chinese startups to &#8220;reinvent themselves and cannibalize their own success&#8221; is what differentiates them from American companies, Lee observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because they know if they don&#8217;t do that, their challenger will, and they are ambitious towards building the super app as a dream. I think American entrepreneurs tend to build something really good and light, partner with other companies and stay in their comfort zone,&#8221; said the investor who was the president of Google China in the late 2000s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really think that Silicon Valley and U.S. entrepreneurs should look to China for ideas or inspirations of doing things differently.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Conflict of interest</h2>
<p>From 2019 to 2020, Zhihu&#8217;s monthly active users grew from 48 million to 68.5 million, an indication that the platform has thrived beyond the small clientele of Chinese tech elites, investors and academics whom it first attracted. A new mother could be on Zhihu asking for postnatal tips and a Foxconn worker may be on the site sharing her factory stories.</p>
<p>Zhihu&#8217;s revenue increased from 670.5 million yuan ($102 million) in 2019 to 1.4 billion yuan in 2020, while its net loss shrank from 1 billion yuan to 517.6 million yuan. It may seem at first that commercialization is at odds with Zhihu&#8217;s principle rooted in open user collaboration. Oftentimes, answerers are not economically incentivized but simply participating for leisure. But Zhihu is for-profit from day one and needs income after all.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a always delicate matter to balance a product&#8217;s commercial and user interests. The bottom line is to be vigilant and deliberate about the kind of ads or sponsored content allowed on the platform. Restraint could mean smaller advertising revenue, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/baidu-slashes-revenue-forecast-as-government-probes-its-medical-advertising-business/">a medical ad scandal</a> that hit Chinese search giant Baidu back in 2016 showed how easily user trust could be lost. Well-placed and responsible ads, on the other hand, could bring greater returns for both advertisers and the platform.</p>
<p>On the innovative side, not all users have appreciated Zhihu&#8217;s new features. Zhihu has recently upped its ante on short videos, which have become the default medium through which many Chinese users receive information, thanks to more affordable connectivity and industry forerunners like Douyin and Kuaishou. But some users argue that short videos by nature verge on entertainment and are obtrusive for the more serious, text-focused Zhihu.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Zhihu has become one of China&#8217;s biggest hubs for experts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/how-zhihus-become-one-of-chinas-biggest-hubs-for-experts/embed/#?secret=fb2YkMQ98m" data-secret="fb2YkMQ98m" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Zhihu has other interests to balance. Its shareholders include Tencent, Baidu and Kuaishou, which are &#8220;super apps&#8221; themselves for their extensive functionalities. They all have traffic deals with Zhihu. For example, Zhihu content is surfaced in the search results on WeChat, which has its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/wechat-2020/">own search engine</a>.</p>
<p>While joining hands with giants could drive user growth for a smaller player, dependence on outsiders could also handcuff a startup, forcing it to give away significant shares too early and joggle the interests of multiple allies, who could be rivals themselves.</p>
<p>Lee declined to comment on Zhihu&#8217;s relationship with any specific partner, but he did indicate that Zhihu doesn&#8217;t currently have an &#8220;overreliance&#8221; on partners and that the firm keeps &#8220;natural working business relationships with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That also speaks to the purity and the ambition of the Zhihu team that it hopes to maintain more independence by making more friends,&#8221; said Lee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security researchers say a powerful new Android malware masquerading as a critical system update can take complete control of a victim&#8217;s device and steal their data.</p>
<p>The malware was found bundled in an app called &#8220;System Update&#8221; that had to be installed outside of Google Play, the app store for Android devices. Once installed by the user, the app hides and stealthily exfiltrates data from the victim&#8217;s device to the operator&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>Researchers at mobile security firm Zimperium, which discovered the malicious app, said once the victim installs the malicious app, the malware communicates with the operator&#8217;s Firebase server, used to remotely control the device.</p>
<p>The spyware can steal messages, contacts, device details, browser bookmarks and search history, record calls and ambient sound from the microphone, and take photos using the phone&#8217;s cameras. The malware also tracks the victim&#8217;s location, searches for document files and grabs copied data from the device&#8217;s clipboard.</p>
<p>The malware hides from the victim and tries to evade capture by reducing how much network data it consumes by uploading thumbnails to the attacker&#8217;s servers rather than the full image. The malware also captures the most up-to-date data, including location and photos.</p>

<p>Zimperium CEO Shridhar Mittal said the malware was likely part of a targeted attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easily the most sophisticated we&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; said Mittal. &#8220;I think a lot of time and effort was spent on creating this app. We believe that there are other apps out there like this, and we are trying our very best to find them as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2130628" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130628" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2130628" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="662" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg?resize=150,132 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg?resize=300,265 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg?resize=768,678 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg?resize=680,600 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/android-malware-jpg.jpg?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130628" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of the malware masquerading as a system update running on an Android phone. The malware can take full control of an affected device. (Image: Zimperium)</p></div></p>
<p>Tricking someone into installing a malicious app is a simple but effective way to compromise a victim&#8217;s device. It&#8217;s why Android devices warn users not to install apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/millions-dozens-android-apps-adware/">from outside of the app store</a>. But many older devices don&#8217;t run the latest apps, forcing users to rely on older versions of their apps from bootleg app stores.</p>
<p>Mittal confirmed that the malicious app was never installed on Google Play. When reached, a Google spokesperson would not comment on what steps the company was taking to prevent the malware from entering the Android app store. Google has seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/x-mode-location-google-apple-ban/">malicious apps</a> slip through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/google-removes-3-android-apps-for-children-with-20m-downloads-between-them-over-data-collection-violations/">its filters</a> before.</p>
<p>This kind of malware has far-reaching access to a victim&#8217;s device and comes in a variety of forms and names, but largely does the same thing. In the early days of the internet, remote access trojans, or RATs, let snoops spy on victims through their webcams. Nowadays, child monitoring apps are often repurposed to spy on a person&#8217;s spouse, known as stalkerware or spouseware.</p>
<p>Last year, TechCrunch reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">the KidsGuard stalkerware</a> — ostensibly a child monitoring app — that used a similar &#8220;system update&#8221; to infect victims&#8217; devices.</p>
<p>But the researchers don&#8217;t know who made the malware or who it&#8217;s targeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are starting to see an increasing number of RATs on mobile devices. And the level of sophistication seems to be going up, it seems like the bad actors have realized that mobile devices have just as much information on them and are much less protected than the traditional endpoints,&#8221; said Mittal.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> were all here to chat through the week’s biggest tech happenings. News was right back up to a dull roar this week, so we did our best to trim and hone and just bring you the most important things.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>David Dobrik stepped down from Dispo, the photo-sharing app he co-created, this past week after allegations came out about him. We talked about the venture capital angle, since early-stage investors in the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">reactively distanced</a> from their investments.

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/robinhood-files-confidentially-to-go-public/">Robinhood filed privately to go public</a>! So, it&#8217;s happening, everyone. At long last, one of Silicon Valley&#8217;s hottest companies is kicking off its IPO process. We&#8217;re hype, you&#8217;re hype and we had some jokes.</li>
<li>And in other mega-unicorn news, it appears that Microsoft is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/discords-10b-exit-compass-and-intermedia-cloud-communications-set-ipo-price-ranges/">tempted to plonk down $10 billion for Discord</a>. Why, you ask? Well why not. It&#8217;s just $10 billion from Microsoft&#8217;s $1,780 billion valuation. Or around half a percent.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com">Chainalysis</a>, a blockchain analysis company, announced Friday it has closed on $100 million in Series D financing, doubling its valuation to over $2 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The round comes just four months after the company secured a $100 million <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chainalysis-raises-100-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation-to-expand-its-global-regulatory-platform-for-surging-cryptocurrency-market-301179156.html?tc=eml_cleartime">Series C round</a> at a $1 billion valuation. Paradigm led the latest funding event while existing backers Addition and Ribbit doubled down on their investment in the company. TIME Ventures, Marc Benioff’s investment fund, also participated in the latest financing, which brings Chainalysis’ total raised to $265 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This latest round marks Chainalysis’ fourth raise in less than two years. Previous backers in the company also include Accel and Benchmark.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Chainalysis was founded in 2014 as the official investigators into <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mt-gox.asp">the hack of Mt. Gox</a>, then the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Today, the New York-based company provides data, software, services and research to government agencies, exchanges, financial institutions and insurance and cybersecurity companies in more than 60 countries. Among its 400 customers are fintechs such as Square, financial institutions like Barclays and cryptocurrency businesses like Gemini, Bitstamp and BitPay.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2130527" style="width: 611px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2130527" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2130527" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="601" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chainalysis_DK38926.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2130527" class="wp-caption-text">Co-founders Michael Gronager and Jonathan Levin; Image courtesy of Chainalysis</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">Chainalysis’ self-described mission is “to build trust in blockchains to promote more financial freedom with less risk.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company says its data platform powers investigation, compliance and risk management tools “that have been used to solve some of the world&#8217;s most high-profile cyber criminal cases and grow consumer access to cryptocurrency safely.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chainalysis operates under the belief that eventually every company will use the blockchain to conduct their business, according to co-founder and CEO Michael Gronager.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve collected more information about what happens on blockchains than anyone in the cryptocurrency industry,” he said. “That information enables our customers to make better data-driven decisions.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the past year, the company says it has achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Increased its annual recurring revenue (ARR) by more than 100% year-over-year</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Doubled its client base to include government agencies in over 30 countries and private sector businesses in over 60 countries</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Grown its support to cover over 100 digital assets across 10 native blockchains, encompassing an estimated approximate 90% of cryptocurrency economic activity</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Doubled its number of employees over the past year to 233 today</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">Expanded its <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chainalysis-debuts-partnership-program-to-expand-cryptocurrency-compliance-301038075.html">partnership program</a>, which now consists of more than 50 companies, including Fireblocks and Flashpoint</li>

<p>Looking ahead, Chainanalysis said it plans to hire hundreds over the course of 2021; it also plans to use its new funds primarily to expand its enterprise data offering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ll continue to invest in investigations and compliance software, but we’ll also build out new data products both for our existing customer base and new audiences,” Gronager said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is particularly focused on building out its presence in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Cryptocurrency is global, and so is Chainalysis,” said Gronager.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To Chainalysis, cryptocurrencies present unprecedented transparency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They are the first global payment systems outside of any one organization’s control, but their blockchains create public, permanent records of all transactions, including illicit activity,” Gronager told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blockchain analysis comes in by helping people interpret those public blockchain ledgers. Chainalysis tools aim to help government agencies, cryptocurrency businesses and financial institutions understand which real-world entities transact with each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For example, we can show that a given transaction took place between two different cryptocurrency exchanges, or between a cryptocurrency exchange and an illicit entity, such as a darknet market or a sanctioned organization,” Gronager said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Paradigm co-founder Fred Ehrsam said his firm was drawn to the way Chainalysis provides key data infrastructure and software for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The team knows the regulatory landscape better than anyone, has been refining their tools for years, and deeply know what their customers want. This is not an overnight success story &#8211; rather a team that has built with a long run vision, through multiple crypto cycles, that has created a market leading position for themselves, with the opportunity to compound,” he added. “As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so will demand for Chainalysis offerings.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As further evidence of a cryptocurrency boom, <a href="http://www.blockfi.com/">BlockFi </a>earlier this month announced it closed on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/blockfi-lands-a-350m-series-d-at-3b-valuation-for-its-fast-growing-crypto-lending-platform/">massive $350 million Series D funding</a> at a $3 billion valuation. The financial services company for crypto market investors offers a retail and institutional-facing suite of products.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notably, BlockFi is also a Chainalysis customer. In a written statement, CEO and co-founder Zac Prince said that <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis provides BlockFi with data &#8220;that delivers insights beyond compliance that can help inform our business development activities, tailor our offerings, and identify new revenue streams.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, well-known robotic process automation (RPA) unicorn <a href="https://www.uipath.com/">UiPath</a> has filed to go public.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s S-1 filing comes after it <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uipath/company_financials">raised billions</a> of dollars while private, making it amongst the best-funded startups in history. Over the last year, for example, the company&#8217;s rapid-fired fundraising included its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/uipath-reels-in-another-225m-as-valuation-soars-to-10-2b/"> Series E</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">Series F</a> rounds of capital, both of which came inside the last 12 months.</p>
<p>UiPath&#8217;s filing details a rapidly growing company. From its fiscal year ending January 31, 2020, to its fiscal year ending January 31, 2021, UiPaths&#8217;s revenues grew from $336.2 million to $607.6 million, which translates to just under 81% growth. That top-line expansion brought with it GAAP net income of -$519.9 million in its year ending in early 2020, and -$94.7 million in the year ending January 31 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>UiPath was valued privately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/uipath-reels-in-another-225m-as-valuation-soars-to-10-2b/">at $10.2 billion</a> in mid-2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">and $35 billion</a> in early 2021.</p>
<p>For the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/uipath/company_financials">27 known</a> investors, the IPO filing is a critical moment. If UiPath can defend its rich private valuation, its IPO could be viewed as a success. However, investors in that final round &#8212; Alkeon Capital and Coatue, the investors that also led its Series E &#8212; will want to see its market value appreciate.</p>
<p>If UiPath can reach a public valuation of more than $35 billion remains to be seen.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oAyboGZbMm"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/wework-lines-up-for-a-second-run-at-the-public-markets/">WeWork lines up for a second run at the public markets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WeWork lines up for a second run at the public markets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/wework-lines-up-for-a-second-run-at-the-public-markets/embed/#?secret=oAyboGZbMm" data-secret="oAyboGZbMm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s financials paint the picture of a high-growth company that got its costs in line after a very expensive fiscal year ending January 31, 2020. UiPath cut its sales and marketing costs, its research and development spend and even its general and administrative budget in its most recent fiscal year. The result is that its gross profit scaled against a smaller cost base. And the result of that was dramatically improved profitability and cash generation.</p>
<p>As the S-1 notes: &#8220;[UiPath&#8217;s]<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> operating cash flows were $(359.4) million and $29.2 million and our free cash flows were $(380.4) million and $26.0 million in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.&#8221; </span>That&#8217;s a massive turnaround, perhaps one that&#8217;s even more impressive than the company&#8217;s improving GAAP net margins.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to come from UiPath, namely a dive into its quarterly results, which the company says will come in a &#8220;subsequent amendment to [its] prospectus.&#8221;</p>
<p>All told, UiPath&#8217;s most recent fiscal year shows material operating leverage — something about which not every software company going public can brag.</p>

While all of these technologies can work on their own, they are deeply connected and we are starting to see some movement toward bringing them together. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve seen a lot of trend lines moving throughout 2020 and into 2021 around automation, workflow, robotic process automation (RPA) and the movement to low-code and no-code application building. While all of these technologies can work on their own, they are deeply connected and we are starting to see some movement toward bringing them together.</p>
<p>While the definition of process automation is open to interpretation, and could include things like industrial automation, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/257170/global-automation-market-revenue-by-end-market/">Statista estimates that the process automation</a> market could be worth $74 billion in 2021. Those are numbers that are going to get the attention of both investors and enterprise software executives.</p>
<p>Just this week, Berlin-based <a href="https://camunda.com">Camunda</a> announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/camunda-snares-98m-series-b-as-process-automation-continues-to-flourish/">a $98 million Series B</a> to help act as a layer to orchestrate the flow of data between RPA bots, microservices and human employees. Meanwhile, UIPath, the pure-play RPA startup that&#8217;s going to IPO any minute now, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210323005238/en/UiPath-Acquires-Cloud-Elements-to-Deliver-Expanded-API-Based-Automation-Capabilities">acquired Cloud Elements</a>, giving it a way to move beyond RPA into API automation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not enough proof for you? How about ServiceNow announcing this week that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/servicenow-takes-rpa-plunge-by-acquiring-india-based-startup-intellibot/">it is buying Indian startup Intellibot</a> to give it — you guessed it — RPA capabilities. That acquisition is part of a broader strategy by the company to move into full-scale workflow and automation, which it discussed just<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/servicenow-adds-new-no-code-capabilities/"> a couple of weeks ago</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the end of last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/sap-is-buying-berlin-business-process-automation-startup-signavio/">SAP bought a different Berlin process automation startup</a>, Signavio, for $1.2 billion after announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/sap-latest-enterprise-software-giant-to-offer-low-code-workflow/">new automated workflow tools and an RPA tool</a> at the beginning of December. Microsoft is in on it too, having acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsoft-acquires-robotic-process-automation-platform-softomotive/">process automation startup Softmotive</a> last May, which it then combined with its own automation tool <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsofts-power-automate-desktop-is-now-free-for-all-windows-10-users/">PowerAutomate</a>.</p>
<p>What we have here is a frothy mix of startups and large companies racing to provide a comprehensive spectrum of workflow automation tools to empower companies to spin up workflows quickly and move work involving both human and machine labor through an organization.</p>
<p>The result is hot startups getting prodigious funding, while other startups are exiting via acquisition to these larger companies looking to buy instead of build to gain a quick foothold in this market.</p>

<p>Cathy Tornbohm, Distinguished Research vice president at Gartner, says part of the reason for the rapidly growing interest is that these companies have stayed on the sidelines up until now, but they see an opportunity and are using their checkbooks to play catch-up.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM, SAP, Pega, Appian, Microsoft, ServiceNow all bought into the RPA market because for years they didn’t focus on how data got into their systems when operating between organizations or without a human. [Instead] they focused more on what happens inside the client&#8217;s organization. The drive to be digitally more efficient necessitates optimizing data ingestion and data flows,&#8221; Tornbohm told me.</p>
<p>For all the bluster from the big vendors, they do not control the pure-play RPA market. In fact, Gartner found that the top three players in this space are UIPath, Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism.</p>
<p>But Tornbohm says that, even as the traditional enterprise vendors try to push their way into the space, these pure-play companies are not sitting still. They are expanding beyond their RPA roots into the broader automation space, which could explain why UIPath came up from its pre-IPO quiet period to make the Cloud Elements announcement this week.</p>

<p>Dharmesh Thakker, managing partner at Battery Ventures, agrees with Tornbohm, saying that the shift to the cloud, accelerated by COVID-19, has led to an expansion of what RPA vendors are doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;RPA has traditionally focused on automation-UI flow and user steps, but we believe a full automation suite requires that ability to automate processes across the stack. For larger companies, we see their interest in the category as a way to take action on data within their systems. And for standalone RPA vendors, we see this as validation of the category and an invitation to expand their offerings to other pillars of automation,&#8221; Thakker said.</p>
<p>The activity we have seen across the automation and workflow space over the last year could be just the beginning of what Thakker and Tornbohm are describing, as companies of all sizes fight to become the automation stack of choice in the coming years.</p>
