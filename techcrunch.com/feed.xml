<p>SBIP’s funding comes from the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/national-research-foundation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="national-research-foundation">National Research Foundation, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and will be used to develop, commercialize and encourage the adoption of blockchain technology by companies. The program will first focus on the use of blockchain in trade, logistics and the supply chain.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the program &#8220;will engage close to 75 companies&#8221; over the next three years. It is already working with Dimuto, a global supply chain platform, to use blockchain technology to trace perishables with the goal of improving farmers’ creditworthiness.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The program’s other plans include finding ways to help blockchain systems and networks collaborate with one another, and growing the blockchain sector’s talent pool.</p>

<p>While companies ranging from startups to giants like IBM have been exploring the use of blockchain technology to create more transparent and cohesive supply chains for years, the issue has become more urgent as the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted vulnerabilities in international logistics and supply chains.</p>
<p>In a statement, Peter Ong, the chairman of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/enterprise-singapore" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="enterprise-singapore">Enterprise Singapore, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said &#8220;COVID-19 has emphasized the need for trusted and reliable business systems in the new digital world. Blockchain technology helps embed trust in applications spanning logistics and supply chains, trade financing to digital identities and credentials.&#8221;</p>
<p>Singapore’s government is positioning itself as a partner to blockchain developers and companies, with the goal of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/22/singapore-is-the-crypto-sandbox-that-asia-needs/">becoming a &#8220;crypto hub&#8221; that is more open to the technology than other countries</a>. Other blockchain-related government initiatives include the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Ubin. Launched in 2016, Project Ubin announced in July that its multi-currency payments network had proved its commercial potential after tests with more than 40 companies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.luko.eu">Luko</a> has raised a $60 million Series B funding round (€50 million). The round is led by EQT Ventures, with existing investors Accel, Founders Fund and Speedinvest also participating.</p>
<p>Some angel investors with a background in insurance and technology are also investing in the startup, such as Assaf Wand, the co-founder of <a href="https://www.hippo.com">Hippo Insurance</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/luko" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="luko">Luko <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is selling home insurance products for both homeowners and renters. And the company has managed to attract 100,000 clients so far. Over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/luko-raises-22-million-to-improve-home-insurance/">past year</a> or so, the company has grown quite rapidly, jumping from 15,000 customers to 100,000.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to a speedy on-boarding process, Luko has been refining its insurance product to make the experience better for the client. For instance, Luko doesn’t want to benefit from unused premiums.</p>
<p>Luko has a straightforward revenue model. It takes a 30% cut on monthly payments. Everything else is pooled together to pay compensation. This way, the startup isn’t always trying to generate bigger margins from premiums.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, you can choose to donate your portion of what’s left of the 70% share. Luko is also B-Corp certified.</p>
<p>This model is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.lemonade.com">Lemonade</a>, another insurtech company that recently went public and that should <a href="https://www.latribune.fr/entreprises-finance/banques-finance/lemonade-le-trublion-de-l-assurance-habitation-debarque-en-france-857201.html">launch in France soon</a>. Let’s see whether Luko can keep growing at the same pace with Lemonade entering the market.</p>
<p>In order to speed up repayments, Luko can send you money through Lydia, the leading peer-to-peer payment app in France. This way, you get your money back in just a few seconds.</p>
<p>With 85 employees, Luko plans to expand beyond its home country. It also wants to proactively protect homes by providing water meters to detect leaks, door sensors to detect when somebody is trying to get in, etc.</p>

This new cargo Dragon has greater carrying capacity and can dock fully autonomously with the Space Station, both improvements over the last iteration.</p>
<p>This is the first launch for this redesigned cargo Dragon, and also the first mission for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> new series of CRS missions under a renewed contract with NASA. It&#8217;s carrying 6,400 lbs of both supplies for the Space Station and its crew, as well as experimental supplies and equipments for the research being done on the Station. This version of Dragon can carry 20% more than the last cargo spacecraft from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">SpaceX, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and it also has twice the number of powered lockers for climate controlled transportation of experimental material.</p>
<p>The new cargo Dragon is a modified version of the Crew Dragon that delivered astronauts to the ISS during May&#8217;s Demo-2 mission, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/15/watch-spacex-launch-its-historic-first-nasa-astronaut-crew-mission-live/">during last month&#8217;s Crew-1 flight</a>. Its modifications include removal of the Super Draco engines that are equipped on the crew version, which provide propulsion to carry the capsule quickly away from the Falcon 9 in case of the need for an early abort to protect the astronauts on board. It can also be reused up to five times, vs. just three for the last cargo version.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>This launch was SpaceX&#8217;s 100th successful <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/falcon-19ff" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="falcon-19ff">Falcon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 9 take-off, and the company has flown 43 of those on recovered and refurbished boosters. Today&#8217;s mission also included a recovery of the Falcon 9 first stage, which has now flown four times in total. This marks the 68th successful booster landing for SpaceX so far.</p>
<p>Next up for CRS-21 is a rendezvous between the cargo Dragon and the ISS, which is st to take place Monday evening. The capsule will autonomous dock with one of the Station&#8217;s new international docking adapters, which are designed specifically to make this automated docking procedure possible. It&#8217;ll be the second Dragon docked at the station when it arrives, since SpaceX&#8217;s Crew Dragon is still there from last month&#8217;s crew mission.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[If funding round stories were simply stories about funding, we would only need Twitter to be educated. TechCrunch is proof that the stories are so much more than the dollar signs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Funding-round stories are TechCrunch&#8217;s bread and butter.</p>
<p>For early-stage companies, the fact that an investor has put thousands, millions (or billions) into an idea that will likely fail, and might never make money, is big news. That’s a story that we can tell every day.</p>
<p>From time to time, a debate pops up about the role of funding-round stories: Are financings the right metric to focus on? Should the trend be scratched and reinvented? After all, raising money is not indicative of making money. Let&#8217;s be real: news needs news to be published. There needs to be a tension, or a surprise, but most of all, a reason for the reader to keep reading.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a healthy conversation, and one the <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">Equity crew</a> decided to discuss last Friday:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Wilhelm: Funding rounds are largely rose-tinted trade journalism, but they’re worth writing</li>
<li>Danny Crichton: I hate funding announcements but write them anyway</li>
<li>Natasha Mascarenhas: The stories are so much more than the dollar signs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alex: Funding rounds are rose-tinted trade journalism, but they’re worth covering</h2>
<p>It’s easy to mock funding-round coverage: There are far more rounds than hands to write them, so the coverage is inherently partial; they are a poor milestone to use as a benchmark for growth; and coverage of the startup in question nearly always has an overly positive tilt, given that the piece in question centers around something that is a win for the company.</p>
<p>Yet, I still think they are worth writing and try to get to a few each week.</p>
<p>There are good reasons for doing so that run counter to the obvious complaints. Sure, there are more rounds than we could ever cover, but in theory we’re filtering as best we can for the most interesting, the furthest outlying and the trend-elucidating rounds that we can use as a light to better illuminate how the broader startup and technology worlds are changing.</p>
<p>I think TechCrunch does a reasonable job of picking the right companies to cover and we spend a good amount of time aggregating discrete funding events into trends. It’s super-hard work, as covering a single round is time-consuming and ultimately not incredibly well-read.</p>
<p>And yes, funding rounds are not really milestones to celebrate. The startup isn’t suddenly destined to win. Capital just means that the venture class has increased its wager on the startup generating more wealth for themselves and their backers, whom are largely already rich.</p>
<p>But trying to lever <em>any</em> information from private companies is an exercise in sadistic dentistry, and startups tend to open up the most around funding rounds. So, if you want to chat with a CEO on the record for half an hour, the next time their startup raises is probably your best chance.</p>
<p>And there is signal in a venture round. Someone felt strongly enough about the company’s prospects to inject it with more capital, making a funding event a reasonable signal that <em>something</em> is going on at the company.</p>
<p>Then there’s the issue of positive bias. All publications have a bias. TechCrunch has many biases, the most important and salutary of which is that we think that startups are cool. We do! Quickly-growing, private companies are inherently interesting and I came back to this publication in part so that I could keep writing about them. I am never bored.</p>
<p>So, yes, funding-round coverage tends to be a bit more on the positive side of balanced than I would like, but I balance that by becoming increasingly orthodox as a startup scales. When a young company raises its first few million, the chat with the CEO is her telling me about her small team, first customers and fitful progress.</p>
<p>By the time she raises a $50 million Series C, we’re talking gross margin expansion, YoY ARR growth and diversity metrics. Before she takes her unicorn public, I’m asking pressing questions about GAAP results, the public markets and what sort of external offers are coming in for the whole concern.</p>
<p>Being slightly optimistic about startups when they’re young is, then, tempered by increasing scrutiny as the company grows. That seems like a fair balance for the company and our readers.</p>
<p>So I won’t stop covering funding rounds. Even if I didn’t have this job I probably still would for my personal blog. I always learn something from high-growth companies; they have a window into the market that is dynamic and far from ossified. And early-stage founders tend to not be overly media-trained, so they are still interesting.</p>
<p>And sometimes something you write winds up changing the direction of a startup. That’s always a very weird and disconcerting feeling. But as this impact is nearly always good for the company in question, you’ve only accidentally made the lives of others a bit better for a short while. It’s not so harsh a sentence.</p>
<h2>Danny: I hate funding announcements but write them anyway</h2>
<p>Covering startups is one of the hardest news beats out there (trust me, I’m unbiased — I cover startups for a living).</p>
<p>If you cover the Senate, you report regularly on 100 individuals, their staffs and interactions. If you cover banking, you watch a handful of banks since no one gives a flying rat’s tushy about the industry&#8217;s middle market. There’s generally a limited scope in political and general business reporting where you know the key players and the key newsmakers.</p>
<p>In startups, you cover … everything. There are a couple of hot sectors that everyone is talking about … and then there is every other sector that might be the next hot sector, but no one has ever heard of it. It’s probably not important. <em>But it might just be.</em> That startup you talked to this week sounds boring. Four years later, it sells for $20 billion. The startup world is constantly changing, and unless you blow up your whole worldview on a regular basis, you’ll never keep up.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mixtape-podcast/">Mixtape</a>, the TechCrunch podcast that examines diversity, inclusion and the human labor that drives tech.</p>
<p>This week, Megan moderated a panel at <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/">Sight Tech Global</a>, a conference dedicated to fostering discussion among technology pioneers on how advances in AI and related technologies will alter the landscape of assistive technology.</p>
<p>The panel featured three heavy hitters in the accessibility space: <a href="https://habengirma.com/">Haben Girma</a> (pictured above), the first deafblind person to graduate from Harvard Law School and who is a human rights lawyer advancing disability justice; <a href="https://www.lflegal.com/">Lainey Feingold</a>, a disability rights lawyer who was on the team that negotiated the first web accessibility agreement in the U.S. in 2000; and <a href="http://kerscher.montana.com/">George Kerscher</a>, the chief innovations officer for the DAISY Consortium.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/d4df6777-a8e0-4eb8-b42a-41ba57df9c4b?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Among the topics they discussed were communicating via Zoom and other video platforms in the days of COVID, how tech companies have adhered to the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the need for a culture shift if we’re going to realize any significant change.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s all about a culture change to really make sure technology is accessible for everyone,” Feingold told Megan. “And you can&#8217;t get a culture change, I don&#8217;t believe, by hammering people. You get a cultural change by having conversation and relying on civil rights laws, but not as the hammer.”</p>

	</p>
<p>And then there are the robots. Girma acknowledges that people in the disability community and people in the AI community are having conversations about technological advancements and accessibility. But she says that not enough of the people how are building the robots and using AI are having these conversations.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t blame the robots,” she says. “It&#8217;s the people who build the robots who are inserting their biases that are causing ableism and racism to continue in our society. If designers built robots in collaboration with disabled people who use our sidewalks and blind people who would Use these delivery apps, then the robots and the delivery apps would be fully accessible. So we need the people designing the services to have these conversations and work with us.”</p>

The launch is set to take off at 11:17 AM EST (8:17 AM PST) from Kennedy <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">Space <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Center in Florida, and will be the first ever flight of an updated version of SpaceX&#8217;s cargo-specific Dragon spacecraft, which can carry more supplies and experiment materials and which can dock all on its own with the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-station-6ec2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-station-6ec2">Space Station <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. Prior Dragon cargo craft required docking assistance from the robotic Canadarm guided by astronauts on board the ISS.</p>
<p>This redesigned version of Dragon can carry 20 percent more than the one it replaces, and it has twice the amount of powered locker cargo storage, which are used for transferring science experiments that require specific transportation environment conditions. It can also stay at the Space Station for over twice the max duration of the original, and each capsule is made to be reused up to five times. This new cargo craft is a modified version of the Crew Dragon, which SpaceX created to transport astronauts to the ISS. One of those is already docked at the station, so when this cargo Dragon arrives on Monday, there will be two SpaceX spacecraft attached to the ISS at once.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SpaceX realizes a bunch of performance improvements by using the new cargo Dragon design, but it also should mean that its supply chain is simpler since it&#8217;s essentially building the same Dragon spacecraft with modifications required depending on whether it&#8217;s intended for human crew use, or for a pure cargo mission like this one.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s launch also uses a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/falcon-19ff" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="falcon-19ff">Falcon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 9 first stage which flew the Demo-2 crew mission for SpaceX back in May, as well as a Starlink launch and the ANANSIS-II mission. It will attempt a landing at sea on SpaceX&#8217;s drone landing ship following separation from the second stage, so that SpaceX can reuse it again in future.</p>

<p>With one fell swoop, WarnerMedia eradicated the status quo in Hollywood, turning its 2021 feature film schedule on its head. Well, not quite. By moving 2021’s theatrical releases to both physical and digital theaters, the AT&amp;T affiliate gave us a reason to sign up for its HBOMax streaming service. With a simultaneous window of one month per title, the idea is that the vaccines will govern the timetable for viable return to movies plus popcorn.</p>
<p>Streaming has picked the lock on our path to the future. Even Donald Trump thinks so. Faced with open refusal by the networks to carry his rants about the election, he’s taken to Facebook Live to produce “press conferences” with his own cameras and no press. These shows are designed to fuel contributions of (so far) 200 million dollars to fund what in essence will be a nonstop infomercial campaign for the 2024 election. One problem: I don’t think it will work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, millions of Americans will begin to turn working from home into living through work. Digital networks like Zoom are becoming a superhighway for transforming ideas into post-pandemic realities. As the vaccines take root, we’ll inexorably restore the dream of mobility, the feeling of hitting the open road in search of our dreams. Only this time, we’re taking our families, friends, and coworkers with us. The rise of digital devices and notifications is disrupting the old business models and replacing them with next best step workflow.</p>
<p>We know what the office gives us: a place for hallway conversations that harness the elastic essence of the team. It’s based on inspiration, camaraderie, shared values, and just plain good timing. Don’t believe me? Ask anybody how their parents met. In the rush to virtualize the hallway conversation, we’re missing the fact that it’s really the only thing that’s working by default. The notification channel dominates our attention, and in aggregate who we give that to creates successful business outcomes.</p>
<p>Zoom is a perfect example of hallway serendipity. A brain dead simple on boarding process starts by clicking on a notification. If you have the Zoom client installed you&#8217;re in; if you don&#8217;t the download starts, and then you&#8217;re in. Zoom takes care of what device you&#8217;re using, what software tools are necessary to gather multiple people together across time zones and latencies, and provides in our case the recording and switching tools to stream the meeting across the network. If you can&#8217;t make the scene in real-time you can time shift until later.</p>
<p>How does Hollywood compete with that? The short answer is they don’t. HBO is saying the old way of business is over. It may seem like it will return to the good old days of the Saturday afternoon matinee (and it will) but the way it will happen is infused with digital. If you’re embedded in the Zoom economy you first hear about things over that channel. News, pitches, reminders, delivery arrivals, early voting, everything that can most efficiently alert you will succeed. If the networks you use produce effective service and empathetic trustworthy processes, they will be rewarded with your attention.</p>
<p>HBO has decided to run a vaccine trial where they give out a dose of the what will be alongside a placebo, what has been working up til now. Same product, two different experiences. What they’re really saying is: at some point, we’ll feel safe enough to return to the theaters. But will we? Sure, for the big experiences, the blockbusters, the roar of laughter and shared relief of having made it through. But that blockbuster is not the experience we crave, and the new streaming shared water cooler experience has its own joys and power.</p>
<p>How else do you explain the success of streaming shows like The Queen’s Gambit, where millions of us watch a small story about a young girl’s path to chess stardom. A chess movie? You betcha. Or The Crown, which blatantly makes up stories about the Royal Family with an underlying central truth that the show’s writer proclaims. To paraphrase, if I tell the essential truth about these people, I can get away with making up the dialogue. These shows are the thing the blockbusters can’t deliver, the emotional truth that soothes us as we shelter in place. HBO is betting on that model, plus the blockbusters when they’re safe again. Make America Safe Again.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Subscribe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>So very much happened this week. If you are just catching up, the Equity crew spent good time this week parsing through a host of recent early-stage venture capital rounds; if that’s your jam, head <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/what-about-30-billion-under-30/">here</a>. Today for the newsletter The Exchange is digging into later-stage news, though smaller startups will still make an appearance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We begin with notes on a company that was net-new to me when I met it earlier this week: <a href="https://www.nextiva.com/">Nextiva</a>. Now north of $200 million in revenue, the company is a quiet giant and, notably, has not taken venture capital funding along its path to scale.</p>
<p>Given how frequently conversation in the tech press concerns funding news it was a refreshing break to talk to Nextiva about how it managed to scale without leaning on high-burn growth and external capital.</p>
<p>Chatting with CEO and co-founder Tomas Gorny, I got to dig a little under the skin of the company’s history. It goes a little something like this: After moving to California in 1996 at the age of 20, Gorny eventually founded a web hosting company in 2001 after working for tech companies during the dot-com boom. The web hosting company wound up selling to another company <a href="https://www.pehub.com/endurance-buys-ipower/">called Endurance International in 2007</a>, which sold as a combined entity for around a billion dollars in 2011, later going public before <a href="https://clearlake.com/endurance-international-group-announces-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-clearlake-capital-group-l-p-for-9-50-per-share/">being taken private</a> last month for $3 billion &#8212; you can read this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/26/weebly-web-host-endurance/">TechCrunch piece that mentions Endurance from 2010</a> for a bit of the historical record.</p>
<p>Gorny founded Nextiva in 2008, focused on what it describes today as “UcaaS,” or unified communications as a service. The startup grew to about $40 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), at which point it ran into issues with a third-party system that would integrate hardware, and support and services software, which sparked a shift in its thinking. The company set out to build a platform.</p>
<p>Nextiva expanded horizontally, adding CRM software, analytics and other functionality to its broader suite as it scaled. And it grew efficiently; starting with money from its founding team, Gorny told TechCrunch that even if he had used someone else’s money, he would have built the company in the same manner.</p>
<p>The platform switch was expensive, with Nextiva calculating that it spent $100 million on the project, telling TechCrunch that it might have been able to grow more quickly in the short-term if it had only focused on its original offerings.</p>
<p>The platform work that Nextiva has spent so much time and money on is <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/02/2138418/0/en/Nextiva-Launches-NextOS-Platform-to-Bring-Communications-Business-Applications-to-All-Companies.html">now in the market</a>, and after scaling <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nextiva-ceo-tomas-gornys-rags-to-riches-life-story-2016-6">from $100 million ARR in 2016</a> to $200 million this year, the company now considers itself to have completed the evolution to platform status. Which raised my hackles slightly, as quite literally every company wants to be a platform. And nearly none of them are.</p>
<p>Gorny, however, swayed me somewhat with his thinking on the matter. Nextiva built a suite of products, he explained, but wasn’t a platform at that point. Correct. However, he argued that the company became one when it built a system that created a shared pool of customer data for all its apps and services, allowing Nextiva to build faster on top of its foundational layer. By the definition of platform that precedes tech’s abuse of the word, that seems fair.</p>
<p>What’s next for Nextiva? Growing at more than 30% a year, it could go public. Given that it is self-funded, it cannot have horrorshow cash burn by definition and meet requisite benchmarks for an IPO. Even more, while Gorny did highlight that being private allowed his company to accelerate and decelerate growth when it wanted to focus more on product work, I got the impression that Nextiva wants to be better-known. And an IPO would help with that.</p>
<p>2021 is said to be a coming ground for a stampede of unicorn IPOs. Perhaps some of those debuts will be dark horses as well.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>We have three themes this week for our discussion of the broader startup market that warrant discussion: AI fundraising, fintech and private-market liquidity.</p>
<p>On the AI front, it’s been a busy sector of late, especially amongst the later-stages. Ohio-based healthcare AI company <a href="https://oliveai.com/media/olive-attracts-additional-225-5mm-investment-to-fast-track-ai-workforce-for-healthcare/">Olive raised $225.5 million</a>, or about half of the $456 million that it has raised to date. Olive is a unicorn, to boot, with <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook</a> pegging its new valuation at $1.50 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>It’s nice to see a win for the Midwest. But Olive was hardly alone. Scale AI also raised a huge chunk of money, this time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/scale-ai-hits-3-5b-valuation-as-its-turns-the-ai-boom-into-a-venture-bonanza/">$155 million at a $3.5 billion valuation</a>. Last year it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/scale-ai-and-its-22-year-old-ceo-lock-down-100-million-to-help-label-silicon-valleys-data/">raised $100 million at a valuation north of $1 billion</a>. And elsewhere in the AI startup realm, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/ai-construction-startup-versatile-raises-a-20m-series-a/">Versatile raised $20 million</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/ultimate-ai-scores-20m-for-a-supportive-approach-to-customer-service-automation/">ultimate.ai raised $20 million</a>. Busy!</p>
<p>Scooting along. Stripe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/">dropped a host of banking-as-a-service tooling</a>, shifting the richly valued payments company from its initial niche into a much broader &#8212; and potentially lucrative &#8212; domain.</p>
<p>So, doom for smaller startups working in the same problem space? Not if they have anything to say about. Chris Dean, the CEO of <a href="https://treasuryprime.com/">Treasury Prime</a>, a startup that I’ve <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/treasury-prime-raises-9m-to-bring-its-banking-apis-to-market/">written about</a> that offers banking services via an API, wrote in to The Exchange, saying that the “most significant signal [from the Stripe news] is to banks” that they “need an open banking API to stay relevant.”</p>
<p>And Dean reckons that as every fintech has multiple vendors for different things, there will be room for many vendors per major fintech served by banking-via-an-API services, noting that Treasury Prime has “clients who use Marqeta, Galileo, and Stripe” for their banking needs.</p>
<p>Let’s see; but the Stripe news <em>is</em> big news all the same. And the new updates explain the IPO wait, I reckon. Better to go public when it has these new pieces driving growth. So much <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/28/what-to-make-of-stripes-possible-100-billion-valuation/">for our notes last week</a> that were censorious concerning its IPO lag.</p>
<p>Finally, Carta X. I am bursting with excitement about this bit of news. Carta, which helps startups manage their cap table and employees handle their equity stakes, is building an exchange of sorts that should bring more liquidity &#8212; and therefore more pricing signal, and, pray, transparency &#8212; to the private markets. It’s coming early next year. <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/liquidity-is-coming-761a9140dedd">More here</a>.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>We’re low on room, so just three final things to close out this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scale Venture Partners raised a new fund <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scale-venture-partners-announces-close-of-new-600-million-fund-301185735.html">worth $600 million</a>. That’s up 50% <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/10/scale-venture-partners-has-a-new-400-million-fund-to-invest-in-enterprise-companies/">from its last fund</a>.</li>
<li>Also, <a href="https://twitter.com/cailen/status/1334554579862573056">this note</a> on a mistake that Slack might have made is worth pondering.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, to close, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/army-air-force-exchange-service" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="army-air-force-exchange-service">The Exchange <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> caught up with <a href="https://twitter.com/howard">Yext CEO Howard Lerman</a> about its recent earnings report, which <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3641539-yext-eps-beats-0_06-beats-on-revenue">bested near-term expectations</a> regarding its Q3 results, but <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3641751-yext-slumps-15-after-target-lowered-da-davidson">left investors wanting more</a> when it came to Q4 guidance.</p>
<p>Chatting with Lerman &#8212; who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/how-yext-reinvented-itself-on-its-way-to-going-public/">joined TechCrunch for an Extra Crunch Live</a> the other week &#8212; I got the lay of the land. On one hand, Yext’s push into offering search services is working, driving new logo lands, and helping it trim costs in its sales process. On the other, the world is reentering a shutdown, which means that the company is seeing upsell weakness in certain geographies, denting its near-term net retention results, a key driver of growth for software companies.</p>
<p>Now, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yext" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yext">Yext <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is a single public SaaS company, so I don’t want to over-index on its results too much, but the company’s honest assessment of the uncertainties that it faces in terms of near-term growth cannot be unique to its operations &#8212; something to consider as we ask startups about their Q4 growth in a few weeks’ time.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, Yext appears in the midst of an intelligent product expansion while parts of the market it sells into struggle with a macro hangover. This is the situation that startups say is best to weather while private. Perhaps Yext will become a working case for how to navigate the same circumstance while public.</p>
<p>Hugs, and thank golly for the weekend’s respite,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back to Human Capital, a weekly newsletter that looks at the latest in diversity and inclusion in tech, as well as labor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Google made headlines a couple of times for its workplace issues, while Coinbase found itself back in the news after the New York Times reported on alleged issues of racism and discrimination at the cryptocurrency startup. On the more positive side, however, Nasdaq proposed to the SEC some diversity requirements for public companies. </span></p>

<h3><b>Alleged racial discrimination at Coinbase </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The week kicked off with news about cryptocurrency company Coinbase’s diversity issues. Specifically, the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYT reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a myriad of internal complaints alleging discriminatory treatment against Black employees. Here’s a key snippet from the story:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 15 people worked at Coinbase, the most valuable U.S. cryptocurrency start-up, where they represented roughly three-quarters of the Black employees at the 600-person company. Before leaving in late 2018 and early 2019, at least 11 of them informed the human resources department or their managers about what they said was racist or discriminatory treatment, five people with knowledge of the situation said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the article was published, Coinbase flagged the upcoming story for its employees, saying “only three of these people filed complaints during their time at Coinbase,” and that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing.</span></p>
<h3><b>Pinterest faces lawsuit from shareholders alleging race and gender discrimination</b></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_1543140" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1543140" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1543140" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tcdisrupt_sf17_silbermann-2657.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tcdisrupt_sf17_silbermann-2657.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tcdisrupt_sf17_silbermann-2657.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tcdisrupt_sf17_silbermann-2657.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tcdisrupt_sf17_silbermann-2657.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tcdisrupt_sf17_silbermann-2657.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tcdisrupt_sf17_silbermann-2657.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tcdisrupt_sf17_silbermann-2657.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1543140" class="wp-caption-text">Ben Silbermann (Pinterest) at TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2017</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of shareholders filed a lawsuit against Pinterest executives, including CEO Ben Silbermann, alleging they enabled a culture of discrimination. The complaint also alleges that culture of discrimination has harmed Pinterest’s reputation and led to financial harm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement to Fast Company, </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90581144/pinterest-lawsuit-racial-gender-discrimination"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinterest said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pinterest’s leadership and Board take their fiduciary duties seriously and are committed to continuing our efforts to help ensure that Pinterest is a place where all of our employees feel included and supported,” said a Pinterest spokesperson when reached for comment. “We believe the actions we’ve initiated as well as the ongoing independent review regarding our culture, policies, and practices will help us achieve our goal of building a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for everyone.”</span></p>
<h3><b>NLRB alleges Google unlawfully surveilled employees and violated other labor laws</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/google-nlrb-labor-complaint/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Labor Relations Board this week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued a complaint against </span><a href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">after investigating the firing of several employees last November. The complaint alleges Google violated parts of the National Labor Relations Act by surveilling employees, and generally interfered with, restrained and coerced employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by </span><a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NLRB also alleges Google discouraged “its employees from forming, joining, assisting a union or engaging in other protected, concerted activities,” the complaint states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Google has always worked to support a culture of internal discussion, and we place immense trust in our employees,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. “Of course employees have protected labor rights that we strongly support, but we have always taken information security very seriously. We’re confident in our decision and legal position. Actions undertaken by the employees at issue were a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Google’s co-lead of Ethical AI team says she was fired for sending an email</b></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2082620" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082620" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2082620" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1028811898.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082620" class="wp-caption-text">SAN FRANCISCO, CA &#8211; SEPTEMBER 07: Google AI Research Scientist Timnit Gebru speaks onstage during Day 3 of TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2018 at Moscone Center on September 7, 2018 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timnit Gebru, a leading researcher and voice in the field of ethics and artificial intelligence, says Google fired her for an email she sent to her direct reports. According to Gebru, Google fired her because of an email she sent to subordinates that the company said reflected “behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email in question, </span><a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtained by Casey Newton</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, discussed how Gebru was disappointed in how her organization had, “After all this talk,” only hired 14% or so women this year, she wrote. She pointed to how Samy Bengio, who leads a group of researchers inside the Google Brain team, hired 39% women but that there is no incentive for him to do so. She added:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I want to say is stop writing your documents because it doesn’t make a difference. The DEI OKRs that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the “we need more mentorship” rather than “we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing” the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter. Because there is zero accountability. There is no incentive to hire 39% women: your life gets worse when you start advocating for underrepresented people, you start making the other leaders upset when they don’t want to give you good ratings during calibration. There is no way more documents or more conversations will achieve anything. We just had a Black research all hands with such an emotional show of exasperation. Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gebru’s email also discussed issues with silencing marginalized voices, how her expertise has been dismissed and how she’s felt gaslighted by Google.</span></p>
<h3><b>Instacart outlines its healthcare subsidies for workers in California</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of Prop 22, gig workers promised healthcare subsidies for their workers. </span><a href="https://medium.com/shopper-news/delivering-for-california-shoppers-healthcare-subsidy-e345dae0878"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Instacart provided some more detail on what that means in practice. TL;DR is that it will be available on a quarterly basis to shoppers who work an average of 15 hours or more per week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who average between 15 to 25 hours per week will be eligible for 50% of the average contribution. Those that average 25 hours or more will be eligible for 100% of the average contribution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it&#8217;s important to note that those with employer-sponsored healthcare, Medicare and Medicaid are not eligible for subsidies.</span></p>
<h3><b>Nasdaq</b> <b>wants to require diversity at the board level</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nasdaq-to-advance-diversity-through-new-proposed-listing-requirements-2020-12-01"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasdaq filed a proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt new rules around diversity. If approved, the SEC would require companies listed on the Nasdaq to publicly report the diversity of its board of directors. The rule would also require many companies to have at least two diverse directors &#8212; one who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as either a person from an underrepresented minority group or as LGBTQ+. If a company does not meet that requirement, they would need to explain why.</span></p>

<h2>Virtual fundraising is here to stay</h2>
<p>Connie Loizos sat down with Jason Green of leading <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/enterprise-investor-jason-green-on-spac-hopefuls-versus-startups-bound-for-traditional-ipos/">enterprise-focused firm Emergence Capital to get his view of SPACs</a>, and how they are likely to be used next year and beyond. But early-stage startups, don&#8217;t miss his affirmation of Zoom meetings as part of the fundraising process going forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would say that over the last five years, we’ve made almost a total transition. Now we’re very much a data-driven, thesis-driven outbound firm, where we’re reaching out to entrepreneurs soon after they’ve started their companies or gotten seed financing. The last three investments that we made were all relationships that [date back] a year to 18 months before we started engaging in the actual financing process with them. I think that’s what’s required to build a relationship and the conviction, because financings are happening so fast.</p>
<p>I think we’re going to actually do more investments this year than we maybe have ever done in the history of the firm, which is amazing to me [considering] COVID. I think we’ve really honed our ability to build this pipeline and have conviction, and then in this market environment, Zoom is actually helping expand the landscape that we’re willing to invest in. We’re probably seeing 50% to 100% more companies and trying to whittle them down over time and really focus on the 20 to 25 that we want to dig deep on as a team.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thousands of startup founders will resume the trek around Silicon Valley VC offices, once the vaccines arrive. But we&#8217;ll remember 2020 as the year that venture truly joined the cloud.</p>

<h2>Edtech looks to the future</h2>
<p>Every level of education was forced online by the pandemic this year, at least temporarily. While the children might be back in the classroom already, higher education and corporate education are still booming remotely. Natasha Mascarenhas analyzed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/as-edtech-grows-cash-rich-some-lessons-for-early-stage/">latest market changes for Extra Crunch</a>, and put together a panel of industry leaders for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/equity-dive-edtechs-2020-wakeup-call/">a special Thanksgiving edition of Equity</a>. Here&#8217;s more about what you&#8217;ll find on the show:</p>
<blockquote><p>For this Equity Dive, we zero onto one part of that conversation: Edtech’s impact on higher education. We brought together <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/udacity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="udacity">Udacity </a>co-founder and Kitty Hawk CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/sebastianthrun?lang=en">Sebastian Thrun</a>, Eschaton founder and college dropout <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imdilick/">Ian Dilick</a>, and Cowboy Ventures investor <a href="https://twitter.com/jomayra_herrera">Jomayra Herrera</a> to answer our biggest questions.</p>
<p>Here’s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">How the state of remote school is leading to gap years among students.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">A framework for how to think of higher education’s main three products (including which is most defensible over time).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">What learnings we can take from this COVID-19 experiment on remote schooling to apply to the future.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Why edtech is flocking to the notion of life-long learning.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The reality of who self-paced learning serves — and who it leaves out.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to price your SaaS product for a bottoms-up growth strategy</h2>
<p>SaaS is continuing to be reshaped by consumer internet techniques, with top companies of our era competing through word-of-mouth growth versus incumbent <em>sales forces</em>. The revenue model must be precise for this to scale, though. In a guest post for Extra Crunch, Caryn Marooney and David Cahn of Coatue lay out a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/bottom-up-saas-a-framework-for-mapping-pricing-to-customer-value/">strategic framework for how to price your bottoms-up SaaS product</a> the right way for the market. Called &#8220;MAP,&#8221; for Metrics, Activity and People, it helps you sort your product against the actual ways that people are trying to use and pay for it. Here&#8217;s how they describe the A:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Activity</strong>: How do your customers really use your product and how do they describe themselves? Are they creators? Are they editors? Do different customers use your product differently? Instead of metrics, a key anchor for pricing may be the different roles users have within an organization and what they want and need in your product. If you choose to anchor on activity, you will need to align feature sets and capabilities with usage patterns (e.g., creators get access to deeper tooling than viewers, or admins get high privileges versus line-level users). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Figma — Editors versus viewers: Free to view, starts changing after two edits.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Monday — Creators versus viewers: Free to view, creators are charged $10-$20/month.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Smartsheet — Creators versus viewers: Free to view, creators are charged $10+/month.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Happiest Season,&#8221; a new film on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hulu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hulu">Hulu, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> feels like a traditional, Christmas-themed romantic comedy — with one important exception.</p>
<p>The movie stars Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis as Abby and Harper, a lesbian couple who are visiting Harper&#8217;s parents for the holidays. As they drive back to Harper&#8217;s childhood home, she makes a big confession: Despite what she&#8217;s told Abby previous, she never actually came out to her parents, which means Abby has to spend five days simultaneously ingratiating herself with Harper&#8217;s family while hiding the true nature of their relationship.</p>
<p>As we discuss on the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, &#8220;Happiest Season&#8221; can feel predictable or even formulaic at times. But in some ways, that&#8217;s what makes it so worthwhile — it demonstrates how a broad, crowd-pleasing comedy can just happen to star queer characters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the frequent laugh-out-loud moments, the movie also feels surprisingly honest in its depiction of how hurtful Harper&#8217;s secrecy can be,  and it enters surprisingly painful and emotional territory as it approaches the end.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing &#8220;Happiest Season,&#8221; we also name our favorite Christmas movies and discuss the news that that Warner Bros. will release its entire 2021 slate (including &#8220;Dune&#8221; and &#8220;The Matrix 4&#8221;) on HBO Max <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">at the same time that the movies are released in theaters</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla&#8217;s top leadership positions skew white and male with just 4% of those roles going to Black employees, according to the company&#8217;s first <a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2020-DEI-impact-report.pdf">diversity and inclusion report</a> released Friday.</p>
<p>The report shows that overall the company, which has factories in California, Nevada and New York, has a workforce that includes women as well as Black, Hispanic and Asian employees. Some 60% of its workforce is made up of people who are Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American and Pacific Islander. However, the vast majority of its workforce is male at 79%. That male representation ticks up to 83% when looking at leadership positions. It also gets whiter with 59% of leadership positions held by white people.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some of the stats of its U.S. workforce</strong>:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Black employees</strong>: 10% of workforce. This group has experienced a 60% increase in representation in management with 4% holding &#8220;director level and above&#8221; roles. Some 12% of its new hires in 2020 are Black and African American, a 9% increase from the previous year. Black employees received 10% of promotions in 2020, an 11% increase from 2019.</li>
<li><strong>Asian employees</strong>: 21% of workforce. Some 25% of Asian employees hold leadership positions.  Asian employees comprise 20% of all new hires and 23% of all promotions — a 15% increase from last year.</li>
<li><strong>Hispanic and Latinx employees</strong>: 22% of workforce and 4% of Tesla&#8217;s Director level and above employees. Hispanic and Latinx employees represented 24% of all promotions this year — a 14% increase. About 27% of all new hires in 2020 were Hispanic and Latinx.</li>
<li><strong>Women</strong>:  represent 21% of Tesla&#8217;s overall U.S. workforce and 23% of all promotions &#8212; a 5% increase from last year. Women hold 17% of &#8220;Director&#8221; and &#8220;Vice President&#8221; positions. In 2020, nearly 25% of all U.S. hires have been women.</li>
<li><strong>Men</strong>: represent 79% of its workforce in the United States and hold 83% of leadership positions.</li>
<li><strong>Veterans</strong>: represent 4% of its U.S. workforce.</li>
<li>Additional groups: a designation that Tesla gives to employees who Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, and other Pacific Islander or multiracial, represent 7% of its workforce and 1% of leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tesla did not provide additional details on retention of its minority workforce, information that can provide insight into the company&#8217;s culture and whether its efforts at inclusion are successful. The report didn&#8217;t release data on how many of its employees have disabilities. And while Tesla mentions LGBTQ employees receiving support at the company, there is no breakdown of how many are employed there or hold leadership positions.</p>
<p>The company acknowledged it had &#8220;work to do&#8221; to improve its numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;While women are historically underrepresented in the tech and automotive industries, we recognize we have work to do in this area,&#8221; the company said in its report, one of several areas it is seeking employment. The report added that Tesla is &#8220;taking active steps&#8221; to increase outreach to women and build an inclusive culture that supports their development and retention. &#8220;Increasing women&#8217;s representation at all levels, especially in leadership, is a top priority in 2021,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Tesla listed a few efforts to attract and retain women and minorities such as recruiting at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and expanding its internship program. However, the company didn&#8217;t provide targets or a timeline to reaching its goal to improve its diversity and inclusion metrics.</p>

<p>Both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/apple-releases-its-best-of-2020-app-store-winners-and-most-downloaded-apps-of-the-year/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Apple</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">Google</a> released their &#8220;best apps of 2020&#8221; year-end lists and there were some similarities between the two, as well as some differences. Both companies&#8217; lists reflected the tough and stressful year 2020 has been, with everyone being stuck at home during a pandemic that changed how we worked, attended school, connected with friends and family, and entertained ourselves.</p>
<p>Apple and Google, as a result, both selected at least one &#8220;de-stressing&#8221; app among their year-end winners. In Apple&#8217;s case, it was <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/endel-focus-sleep-relax/id1346247457">Endel</a>, an iOS app that won for Apple Watch App of the Year. Google, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/google-plays-best-of-2020-awards-highlight-the-stressful-year-its-been/">awarded</a> sleep app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.loona&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Loóna</a> the title of best app of the year.</p>
<p>Disney+ also made both Apple and Google&#8217;s lists, the former as Apple TV App of the Year and the latter as the User&#8217;s Choice for app of the year. The new streaming service was a godsend for families with younger children, who often struggled in 2020 to keep kids entertained. New releases like Onward and Mulan in 2020 helped give families something to look forward to, while Marvel and Star Wars content, including new series &#8220;The Mandalorian,&#8221; were hits with streamers, as well.</p>
<p>Another pandemic-prompted choice was Zoom, which won as iPad App of the Year. Though Zoom was around before the coronavirus outbreak, it&#8217;s now become a part of our everyday lexicon as an interchangeable term for &#8220;online video meeting&#8221; &#8212; as in, &#8220;let&#8217;s do a zoom call about that.&#8221; The iPad app at least made these endless virtual meetings a little less painless.</p>
<p>And home workout companion <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wakeout-active-breaks/id1242116567">Wakeout!</a> become Apple&#8217;s iPhone app of the year, as most people gave up the gym due to coronavirus risks. The app&#8217;s quick one-minute breaks helped users stay moving, even when stuck at home for days on the couch or working on their laptop in bed.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083205" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083205" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2083205" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/genshin-impact-400-million-first-two-months.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="399" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/genshin-impact-400-million-first-two-months.jpg 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/genshin-impact-400-million-first-two-months.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/genshin-impact-400-million-first-two-months.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/genshin-impact-400-million-first-two-months.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/genshin-impact-400-million-first-two-months.jpg?resize=680,399 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/genshin-impact-400-million-first-two-months.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083205" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Genshin Impact (screenshot via Sensor Tower)</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, gacha-based action role-playing game Genshin Impact won as &#8220;best game&#8221; of the year on both Apple and Google&#8217;s lists. While a cynical take is that the app stores wanted to point users to a huge moneymaker &#8212; the game <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/genshin-impact-first-two-months-revenue">reportedly earned</a> $245 million its first month and nearly $400 million in two months on mobile &#8212; it also highlights consumers&#8217; desire for console-like experiences on mobile.</p>
<p>The game, however, has been heavily <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/genshin-impact-gacha-backlash/">criticized</a> for its gacha game monetization techniques, which though common to games in China, Japan and South Korea, are basically gambling mechanics. And addictive ones at that. But as a Wired report noted, some of this comes down to cultural differences. U.S. users grew up on cartridge games, not arcade games, where you were constantly inserting more money to keep playing. Western users just aren&#8217;t as comfortable with this &#8220;spend to keep playing&#8221; business model, which they feel is predatory.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s other top apps of the year included perennial favorite Fantastical as Apple’s Mac App of the Year; Legends of Runeterra as iPad Game of the Year; Disco Elysium as Mac Game of the Year; Dandara Trials of Fear as Apple TV Game of the Year; and Sneaky Sasquatch as the Apple Arcade Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s list also included SpongeBob: Krusty Cook-Off as users&#8217; choice for best game, and it highlighted a variety of top titles in various gaming subgenres in a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/editorial_collection/promotion_topic_bestof2020_games_hub">dedicated section of its Play Store</a>.</p>
<h3>2020&#8217;s most downloaded apps</h3>
<p>Apple also gave a peek into the &#8220;best&#8221; apps of the year, as determined by app downloads. The pandemic played a role here as well, making Zoom the most-downloaded iPhone app of 2020.</p>
<p>Also of note, <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/the-year-on-tiktok-top-100">TikTok</a> was the biggest social media app by downloads, ahead of all the Facebook-owned apps making the list, including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. Square&#8217;s Cash App hit No. 10, as the pandemic saw increased demand for contactless payments and direct giving to people in need.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/a-tween-tries-apples-new-family-setup-system-for-apple-watch/">tried</a> the Apple Watch Family Setup with a tween. They weren&#8217;t impressed with the apps or the controls, but did like the Memoji. No Roblox group chat on the small screen? Boo.</p>

<p>If you find it too frustrating to use Apple&#8217;s Shortcuts to build your own custom icons, you can turn to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iconboard/id1535254664">Iconboard</a> instead. This newly launched app lets you design a style for your icons and apply it to all of your icons at once. It can even create invisible icons to give you a way to space out items on your screen.</p>

Like Punkpost, Cardlet will send a real paper card on your behalf, but it adds a modern-day touch: The app includes a hidden AR experience that brings the card to life when viewed with the camera.</p>
<h3><strong>Heynote</strong></h3>

<p>Some people don&#8217;t trust to-do lists, reminders or calendar notifications to always get the job done. When there&#8217;s something we <em>really</em> need to remember, we stick it directly on our home screen. (Okay, this one may only appeal to a small niche of scatterbrained users like me.) But if you have, in the past, also designed your own temporary wallpaper just so you won&#8217;t forget a super critical appointment, the Android app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.si.heynote">Heynote</a>, (hat tip to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/01/heynote-turns-your-wallpaper-into-a-personalized-to-do-list/#ap-lightbox">Android Police</a>!) might help. Instead of a widget or reminder, this app lets you put custom text directly on your home screen as a custom wallpaper. Doctor appt. at 11 AM? You can&#8217;t forget it when it&#8217;s there every single time you look at your phone.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think there are some companies that have a lot of COVID tailwind."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Who says that chats about enterprise software have to be boring? They don&#8217;t, we learned during our conversation earlier this week with <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/team/jai-das-managing-director/">Sapphire&#8217;s Jai Das</a>, a pleasant time that touched on a host of topics including startup sectors, his investing group&#8217;s capital base and, of course, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/salesforce-slumps-8-5-as-its-post-slack-selloff-continues/">the Slack-Salesforce deal</a>.</p>
<p>Our conversation took place about an hour before the deal was formally announced, but the tea leaves had been read by the market far in advance, so we were able to chat about it as if it was already consummated. Which it became a little while later.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Our conversation with Das was part of our Extra Crunch Live series, which you can learn more about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/announcing-the-extra-crunch-live-event-series/">here</a>. If you&#8217;re not a member, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=jaidaspost">head here to get started</a>. Extra Crunch Live has previously hosted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/why-bessemers-byron-deeter-thinks-saas-companies-could-grow-even-faster-in-2021/">Bessemer&#8217;s Byron Deeter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/10/sequoia-roelof-botha-extra-crunch-live/">Sequoia&#8217;s Roelof Botha</a>, among others.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>The whole chat with Das was interesting and good, but his comments explaining why <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sale to the larger CRM giant stuck with me all week. Using <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> acquisition of MuleSoft (a company in which Das invested) as a prism, here&#8217;s how the venture capitalist discussed the plusses and minuses of selling to a bigger company.</p>
<p>After noting that MuleSoft might have been able to earn a larger revenue multiple as an independent company in today&#8217;s markets than it managed by selling to Salesforce, Das then detailed the sort of boost that a huge company can bring to one that is merely big (quote has been edited and condensed):</p>
<blockquote><p>Going into your question about Salesforce and Slack, Salesforce, like any large company, does add a lot of value. When I talked to [former MuleSoft CEOs] Simon [Parmett] and Greg [Schott], they were astonished how much account control these large companies have with CIOs and CMOs.</p>
<p>MulesSoft would be beating on the door to get a meeting with the CIO and it wouldn&#8217;t happen. And you know, the Salesforce management team would just make one phone call, and Simon and Greg would be presenting to the CEO on down.</p>
<p>So I think that is the thing that people forget, that these large companies have so much ability to increase your sales velocity with large accounts, [so] it makes a lot of sense for some of these [smaller] companies to end up in Salesforce or SAP or Oracle, or WorkDay.</p></blockquote>
<p>So perhaps Slack will find more oomph under Salesforce&#8217;s auspices than it could as a solo project. We spent the majority of our time talking about startups and smaller companies, so hit the jump for the full video and a few more quotes I transcribed for you.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

Not long after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/technology/sofi-chief-executive-toxic-workplace.html?_r=0">sexual harassment allegations</a> prompted him to leave SoFi, the personal finance company that he cofounded in 2011, he raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/30/sofi-founder-mike-cagney-is-back-with-a-new-startup-and-50-million-in-funding-too/">$50 million</a> for a new lending startup called <a href="https://www.figure.com/#about">Figure</a> that has since raised at least <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191205005276/en/Figure-Closes-Series-C-Round-of-103-Million-to-Expand-Lending-Products-and-Executive-Hires">$225 million</a> from investors and was valued a year ago at $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Now, Cagney is trying to do something unprecedented with Figure, which says it uses a blockchain to more quickly facilitate home equity, mortgage refinance, and student and personal loan approvals. The company has applied for a national bank charter in the U.S., wherein it would not take FDIC-insured deposits but it could take uninsured deposits of over $250,000 from accredited investors.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? The approach, <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FCyo9xlA1MAJ:https://www.americanbanker.com/news/a-fintechs-novel-bank-charter-application-draws-industrys-ire+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">as American Banker explains it</a>, would bring regulatory benefits. As it reported earlier this week, &#8220;Because Figure Bank would not hold insured deposits, it would not be subject to the FDIC’s oversight. Similarly, the absence of insured deposits would prevent oversight by the Fed under the Bank Holding Company Act. That law imposes restrictions on non-banking activities and is widely thought to be a deal-breaker for tech companies where banking would be a sidelight.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, if approved, Figure could pave the way for a lot of fintech startups &#8212; and other retail companies that want to wheel and deal in lucrative financial products without the oversight of the Federal Reserve Board or the FDIC &#8212; to nab non-traditional bank charters.</p>
<p>As Michelle Alt, whose year-old <a href="https://www.klaros.com/">financial advisory firm</a> helped Figure with its application, tells AB: &#8220;This model, if it’s approved, wouldn’t be for everyone. A lot of would-be banks want to be banks specifically to have more resilient funding sources.&#8221; But if it’s successful, she adds, &#8220;a lot of people will be interested.”</p>
<p>One can only guess at what the ripple effects would be, though the Bank of Amazon wouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone who follows the company.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the strategy would seemingly be a high-stakes, high-reward development for a smaller outfit like Figure, which could carry on far more freely than banks traditionally but that would also be operating without a safety net for itself or its customers. The most glaring danger would be a bank run, wherein those accredited individuals who are today willing to lend money to the platform at high interest rates begin demanding their money back at the same time. (It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/worldbusiness/13iht-indy.4.14456887.html">happens</a>.)</p>
<p>Either way, Cagney might find a receptive audience right now with Brian Brooks, a longtime Fannie Mae executive who served as Coinbase&#8217;s chief legal officer for two years before jumping this spring to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), an agency that ensures that national banks and federal savings associations operate in a safe and sound manner.</p>
<p>Brooks was made acting head of the agency in May and green-lit one of the first national charters to go to a fintech, Varo Money, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fintech-varo-money-gets-green-light-to-become-bank-11596207033">this past summer</a>. In late October, the OCC also granted SoFi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sofi-bank-charter/fintech-startup-sofi-gets-preliminary-approval-for-u-s-bank-charter-idUSKBN27D27W">preliminary, conditional approval</a> over its own application for a national bank charter.</p>
<p>While Brooks isn&#8217;t commenting on speculation around Figure&#8217;s application, in July, <a href="https://www.bankingdive.com/news/occ-controller-brian-brooks-special-purpose-charters-unbundling/586155/">during a Brookings Institution event</a>, he reportedly commented about trade groups&#8217; concerns over his efforts to grant fintechs and payments companies charters, saying: &#8220;I think the misunderstanding that some of these trade groups are operating under is that somehow this is going to trigger a lighter-touch charter with fewer obligations, and it&#8217;s going to make the playing field un-level . . . I think it&#8217;s just the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Christopher Cole, executive vice president at the trade group <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.icba.org/">Independent Community Bankers of America</a>, doesn&#8217;t seem persuaded. Earlier this week, he voiced concerns about Figure&#8217;s bank charter application to AB, adding that he suspects that Brooks &#8220;wants to approve this quickly before he leaves office.”</p>
<p>Perhaps so. Brooks&#8217;s days are likely numbered. Last month, he was <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/526425-trump-to-nominate-brooks-as-comptroller-of-the-currency">nominated</a> by President Donald to a full five-year term leading the federal bank regulator and is currently awaiting Senate confirmation. But the move &#8212; designed to slow down the incoming Biden administration &#8212; could be undone by President-elect Joe Biden, who can <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/526425-trump-to-nominate-brooks-as-comptroller-of-the-currency">fire the comptroller of the currency at will</a> and appoint an acting replacement to serve until his nominee is confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>Even still, Cole&#8217;s suggestion is that Brooks still has enough time to figure out a path forward for Figure &#8212; and, if its novel charter application is approved, and it stands up to legal challenges &#8212; a lot of other companies, too.</p>

<p>The pandemic has meant we leave our homes far less often, and that means fending for ourselves when it comes to coffee.

<h1>Superior drip coffee makers</h1>
<p>Every grocery store sells a cheap drip coffee maker that does the job adequately, but if anyone is going to use a device every day, it should be something they look forward to, not the bare minimum.</p>
<p>That said, a coffee maker shouldn&#8217;t be an IQ test — you have to operate it before you&#8217;ve had your coffee, after all. I personally find the ones with touchscreens and apps add nothing but new ways to get it wrong. So I tested a few coffee makers that balance quality with simplicity, and after a few weeks of jitters here are my favorites.</p>
<h2><strong>For the industrial design appreciator: OXO 8-cup coffee maker</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2076136" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="829" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=150,121 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=768,621 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=680,550 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=1536,1243 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=2048,1657 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-1.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Pros</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, well-thought-out design</li>
<li>Lots of actually useful features</li>
<li>Thermal carafe included</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-cup brewing is a bit over-complicated</li>
<li>Could be more coffee-efficient</li>
</ul>
<p>OXO&#8217;s reputation as a kitchen goods designer is well deserved, but I often find their items a bit much for the job. Not so with the 8-cup coffee maker, which manages to balance thoughtful design with simplicity and quality. I can say with confidence: if you aren&#8217;t sure which coffee maker to get&#8230; get this one.</p>
<p>The OXO 8-cup is the (obviously) smaller alternative to the 9-cup, losing the ability to schedule brewing but gaining simpler operation and a single-cup option using a separate, Kalita-compatible basket. The lids of the reservoir and basket area flip up (the latter allowing condensed water to flow safely into the filter) and the basket itself sits securely but pops out easily.</p>
<p>The coffee is uniformly good; I would say as good but slightly less strong than the KBGV below. It flows directly into a thermal carafe with a dedicated hole in the top, simplifying even that part. Pretty much everything about this machine is made to simplify and foolproof itself, making the brewing process extremely reliable.</p>
<p>I honestly struggled to find any complaints, but I would say that the necessity of keeping a second basket that uses a different filter type, then adjusting the various bits so that you can slip the mug in, etc., is arguably more trouble than it&#8217;s worth. But the capability for single-cup brewing is there and doesn&#8217;t take away from the rest at all.</p>
<p>It also recommends somewhat more grounds per cup than the KBGV, not a crazy amount but enough that you&#8217;ll probably get one less pot out of a standard 16 oz bag of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $170 <a href="https://www.oxo.com/8-cup-coffee-maker.html">from OXO</a></p>
<h2><strong>For the FBI stakeout: Technivorm Moccamaster KBGV</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2076138" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Pros</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streamlined retro-institutional look</li>
<li>Strong, reliable brew</li>
<li>Automatic hot plate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of removable parts</li>
<li>Materials unremarkable for the price</li>
</ul>
<p>The KBGV brewed my favorite coffee and in my opinion has the best look, like what you&#8217;d expect in the background of an FBI stakeout field HQ in a 70s movie. Where the OXO is rounded-off and unassuming, designed to disappear in a modern kitchen, the KBGV is bold and shiny.</p>
<p>The coffee it makes is bold, too: reliably strong and flavorful. Its #4 filter process to me was also pretty efficient with grounds.</p>
<p>The squat glass carafe sits on a hot plate that remains on for an hour or so after brewing, which is great but also means you must remember to turn it off — it won&#8217;t start a fire or anything, it&#8217;s just going to sit there being hot.</p>
<p>My main issue with the KBGV is that the reservoir and basket covers just sit on top rather than being on hinges, making the process of brewing involve removing and replacing several pieces. A small complaint, but they, like the carafe lid and basket, are also made of a rather ordinary plastic rather than something more durable. I feel like given the premium price you should be given something a bit more classy and convenient.</p>
<p>The good news is they&#8217;ll be easy to replace if they break, and Technivorm has an excellent warranty.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $330<a href="https://us.moccamaster.com/kbgv-select-polished-silver.html"> from Technivorm</a></p>
<h2><strong>For the &#8216;gram: Ratio 8</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2076139" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/coffeemakers-3.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Pros</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely handsome</li>
<li>Excellent materials</li>
<li>Very simple operation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing to keep coffee warm</li>
<li>Quite large!</li>
<li>Very expensive</li>
</ul>
<p>Objectively the most good-looking of the machines here (even if I prefer the quirky charm of the KBGV), the Ratio 8, with its wood and textured metal finish, is obviously meant to be a display piece. And you couldn&#8217;t hide it if you wanted to — this thing is <em>big</em>, and the thick power cord juts straight out of the back, making it difficult to put anywhere but somewhere central.</p>
<p>The machine is basically an automatic Chemex brewer (Chemex makes one of their own that I tried to test but never heard back on), which kind of tells you everything you need to know. Chemex, with its wood-collared, single-piece carafes and luxuriously thick filters, is almost like the BMW of drip coffee, with all that implies. I like it, but I also acknowledge that it&#8217;s a bit over the top. And a machine that does it for you — well!</p>
<p>But as a Chemex brewer goes, it&#8217;s a lovely thing. You get that special extra clarity that the Chemex process brings, and there&#8217;s something wonderful about the way the coffee comes out of those carafes. Operating the machine is a single-button affair, which activates a short bloom period then showers the grounds over time with however much water you put in the reservoir.</p>
<p>I found that the Ratio 8 was best when making a full carafe, as with a half-portion I felt it over-watered and consequently under-extracted what I put in there. Unfortunately that full carafe will have to be consumed with a quickness, as the Ratio 8, despite its size and price, has nothing to keep the coffee warm once it&#8217;s been brewed.</p>
<p>For a showy and unique machine the Ratio 8 is great. But if all you want to do is make great drip, the OXO or KBGV is a much better use of your funds.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$495<a href="https://ratiocoffee.com/products/eight"> from Ratio</a></p>
<h1>More exotic methods</h1>
<p>There are lots of ways to make coffee, and while drip is the easiest and most reliable for most people, the following slightly more unusual options are also viable and perhaps more interesting as gifts.</p>

The <a href="https://frankdepaula.com/">FrankOne </a>is a cool device that quickly makes a pourover-like cup by steeping the grounds then creating a vacuum in the chamber below it, sucking the liquid out but leaving the grounds up top. It works great, operates on a rechargeable battery and is easy to clean (especially if you have a garbage disposal).</p>

<h2><strong>ROK manual espresso maker</strong></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2082839" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rok-espresso.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082839" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2082839" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rok-espresso.gif" alt="" width="800" height="484" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2082839" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ROK</p></div></p>
<p>I avoided the many fancy espresso machines out there for this review mainly for the reason that they are complex, expensive and require considerable upkeep. The ROK is about as simple an espresso maker as you can get, bested only by a stovetop Moka pot.</p>
<p>To work the ROK, you pack your grounds into the included espresso filter and attach it to the machine like any other. Then you pour your hot water into the reservoir up top, raise the arms, and depress them with a slow, steady pressure that forces it through the filter. It really is that simple.</p>
<p>It may not be quite the high-pressure espresso you get from a &#8220;real&#8221; machine, but it&#8217;s quite good, and the process can be repeated to increase the volume and produce something like an americano. The coffee produced by the ROK is a bit like a Moka Pot&#8217;s, but a bit less strong and far less likely to be burnt.</p>
<p>The machine itself is bulletproof — and I mean I think it&#8217;s actually bulletproof. It&#8217;s practically solid metal, though the reservoir and bellows are rubber. Use this to make coffee while camping and then fend off a bear attack.</p>
<p>For a unique, electricity-free coffee experience the ROK is a great option, though not necessarily a practical one.</p>

<h2>Osma</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2082853" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osma-coffee.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082853" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2082853" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osma-coffee.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="669" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osma-coffee.jpg 1666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osma-coffee.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osma-coffee.jpg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osma-coffee.jpg?resize=768,502 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osma-coffee.jpg?resize=680,444 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osma-coffee.jpg?resize=1536,1003 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/osma-coffee.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2082853" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Osma</p></div></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t gotten to test this one yet (though I will), but designer Joey Roth hasn&#8217;t done me wrong yet. This new device from his workshop uses a completely new method of circulating hot water through grounds, making a drip-like cup in a very short time, or cold brew, or tea. If your loved one is a gadget fiend, this is one they probably haven&#8217;t had the chance to covet yet. Technically it uses pods, but they&#8217;re totally biodegradable and you can fill them with your own grounds or leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $185<a href="https://drinkosma.com"> from Osma</a></p>
<h1>Pourover cones</h1>
<p>I&#8217;ve used pourover as my main method of making coffee for years, and it reliably produces the best single cup you can have, though at the cost of being somewhat time-consuming.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2082838" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg 1246w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg?resize=768,327 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg?resize=680,290 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dripper.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Kalita Wave 185</h2>
<p>Kalita makes a couple sizes of these pourover cones, and although I have happily used my 155 for many years, if I could do it over again I&#8217;d opt for the slightly larger 185, which is more forgiving when you&#8217;re pouring and can brew more than the 16 ounces that is the realistic upper limit of mine.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $36 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1AM0Y/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B000X1AM0Y&amp;linkId=32460a58cd4553793b909296495c7bf3">from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>OXO&#8217;s pourover cone with tank</h2>
<p>If hovering by the stove and watering your grounds for the two to three minutes it takes to make a cup is not something you enjoy, <a href="https://www.oxo.com/categories/coffee-tea/brew/coffee-makers/pour-over-coffee-maker-with-water-tank.html#">OXO has a nice little gadget</a> that simplifies things. It&#8217;s basically a pourover cone with a reservoir that sits on top, dripping water through a few tiny holes at a steady rate.</p>
<p>It made a good cup and with minimal fuss, but the capacity is limited, so if you want more than 12 ounces you&#8217;ll have to refill the reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$16 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ENK41Q6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B01ENK41Q6&amp;linkId=2b186288107c19ad72ed22836a0554b8">from Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Kone and other metal filters</h2>
<p>These <a href="https://ablebrewing.com/products/kone-coffee-filter">permanent filters</a> have gotten quite good, and I have one that sits right on top of a cup. No more paper! However I would recommend these only to people who have a garbage disposal or sink that can handle a lot of grounds, because cleaning the filter involves losing a lot of grit down the drain. Occasional deep cleaning is required but it&#8217;s nice to reduce waste even a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Around $30-40, depending on brand.</p>
<h1>Coffee subscriptions</h1>
<p>Just as a general note: These types of subscriptions are great, but you need to do a little bit of research or your loved one will end up with a roast they don&#8217;t like. I don&#8217;t want to recommend any in particular, since they all specialize in different things, but aim to prop up independent roasteries and fair trade rather than just getting a steady supply of the same old thing from a major chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the amount of time you&#8217;re spending at home these days, you deserve a better headset. A wireless one that works with your computer and maybe your console as well, with a mic for calls and great sound for games and movies. Fortunately there are a lot to choose from, and I&#8217;ve tested out your best options.</p>
<p>I asked the leading audio and peripheral companies to send over their flagship wireless headset, with prices ranging from about $100 to $250. Beyond this price range returns diminish swiftly, but right now that&#8217;s the sweet spot for comfort, sound and usability.</p>
<p>For years I&#8217;ve avoided wireless headsets because there were too many compromises, but I&#8217;m pleased to say that the latency has been eliminated and battery life in the ones I reviewed is uniformly excellent. (NB: If the wireless version feels too expensive, you can often get wired ones for $50-100 less.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To test the headphones, I used them all for a variety of everyday tasks, from video calls to movies and music (with only minimal EQing to get a sense of their natural sound) to AAA games and indies. None require an app to work, though some have companion software for LEDs or game profiles. I have a fairly large head and medium-sized ears, for what it&#8217;s worth. All the headphones are rather bulky, though the angle I shot them at individually makes them look huge — you can see in the image up top that they&#8217;re all roughly the same size.</p>
<p>None of these headphones have active noise cancelling, but many offer decent physical isolation to the point where they offer a &#8220;monitor&#8221; feature that pipes in sound from the outside world — useful if you&#8217;re playing a game but waiting for the oven to preheat or something. Only the first set has a built-in mic, the rest have detachable ones of generally solid quality, certainly good enough for streaming and chatting, though for broadcast a separate one would be better. All these headphones use a USB-A style dongle, though the 7P/7X also has a USB-C connector.</p>
<h3>SteelSeries 7P/7X &#8211; $149</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076127" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076127" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076127 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1747" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=680,475 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=1536,1073 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=2048,1431 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-3.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076127" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The 7P and 7X headsets, designed with the PS5 and Xbox Series X in mind (as well as PC) respectively, are my first and most unreserved recommendation.</p>
<p>The standout feature on these is, to me, a truly surprising sound with an almost disturbingly broad stage and clarity. I almost couldn&#8217;t believe what I was hearing when I put on some familiar tracks I use for reference. This isn&#8217;t a 7.1 simulation or anything like that — but no doubt the gaming focus led to creating a large soundstage. It worked!</p>
<p>I also found the headphones to be very comfortable, with a &#8220;ski goggle&#8221; strap instead of a per-band adjustment that lets them sit very lightly as well as &#8220;remembering&#8221; your setting. The spacious earcups rotate for travel or comfort.</p>
<p>The built-in mic is unobtrusive and stows away nicely, but if you&#8217;re picky about placement it was a bit floppy to adjust. Many of the other headsets have nicer mics that completely detach — maybe that&#8217;s a plus for you, but I tend to lose them.</p>
<p>My main issues with these are that the controls feel cheap and not particularly well laid out. The bottom of the headset is a jumble of ports and buttons and the volume dials don&#8217;t have much travel — it&#8217;s 0 to 100 in one full swipe. (Volume control is independent from system volume.)</p>
<p>The dongle is different from the others in that it is itself USB-C, but with a USB-A cable attached. That&#8217;s good for compatibility, but the cable is three feet long, making it kind of silly to attach to some laptops and whatnot. You could easily get your own short cord, though.</p>
<p>At $150 I think these are an easy recommendation for just about anyone looking at that price range.</p>
<h3>Audio-Technica AT-GWL &#8211; $250</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076130" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076130" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076130 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1760" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=768,541 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=680,479 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=1536,1081 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=2048,1442 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-5.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076130" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The high price on these is partly because they are the wireless version of a headset that also comes wired, so if you want the solid audio performance and comfy fit, you can save some money by going wired.</p>
<p>The sound of the AT-GWLs is rich and naturally has a focus on the upper-mid vocal range, which makes voices in media really pop. I did find the sound a bit confined, which hitting the &#8220;surround&#8221; setting actually helped with. I know that this sort of virtualization has generally been frowned on, but it&#8217;s been a while since these settings have been over the top and distortive. I found surround better for games but not necessarily for music, but it&#8217;s very easy to switch on and off.</p>
<p>The headphones are light and adjusted with traditional, no-nonsense metal bands, with a single pad on the top. I would say they are the lightest-feeling pair I tested, with the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/steelseries" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="steelseries">SteelSeries <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Razer coming in just behind owing to some extra weight and bulk. Despite being compact, the AT-GWLs felt airy but not big. The leather-microfiber combo cups are nice, and I think they&#8217;ll break in well to provide better isolation over time.</p>
<p>Where they fall short is in the interface. First, a note to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/audio-technica" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="audio-technica">Audio-Technica: <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Turn down the notification noises! Turning the headset on, the mic on or off or hitting the system-independent volume max produces loud, surprising beeps. Too loud!</p>
<p>Second, the buttons and dials are stiff, small and same-feeling. Lifting a hand quickly to turn down the volume (maybe after a huge beep) you may very easily mistake the power switch for the volume dial. The dial also doubles as a button for surround mode, and next to it is a microscopic button to turn on and off the sound of surroundings. It&#8217;s a bit of a jumble — nothing you can&#8217;t get used to, but considering how nice other headsets on this list made their controls, it has to be said.</p>
<h3>HyperX Cloud II wireless &#8211; $100</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076131" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076131" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076131 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1739" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=768,534 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=680,473 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=1536,1068 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=2048,1425 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-6.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076131" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hyperx" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hyperx">HyperX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (owned by Kingston) wasn&#8217;t exactly known for audio until fairly recently, but its previous Cloud headset got the crucial Wirecutter endorsement, and it&#8217;s easy to see why. For less money than any of the other headsets in this roundup, the follow-up to that headset (which I&#8217;m wearing right now) has excellent sound and isolation.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find a soundstage nearly as wide as the 7P/7X, but with more of a focus on the punchy lower register instead of on detail and placement. My music felt big and close, and the atmosphere of games likewise, more immediately present.</p>
<p>The Cloud II&#8217;s controls are simple and effective. The volume dial, tied directly to the system volume, is superb: grippy, with smooth motion and just the right amount of friction, and just-barely-there clicks. There are two good-size buttons, the power one concave and the mic mute (which gives different sounds for muted and active) convex.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that they&#8217;re not as comfortable, for me anyway, as the others on this list. The cups (though a bit on the warm side) and band are perfectly fine. It&#8217;s that there&#8217;s little rotation to those cups, meaning there&#8217;s no play to accommodate the shape of your head. I don&#8217;t know, maybe it&#8217;s just my big dome, but they were noticeably tighter at the front of my ear than the back, so I was constantly adjusting or trying to twist them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say this: If they add a bit more adjustment to the cups, these would be my default recommendation over the 7P/7X. As exciting as the SteelSeries sound is to me, the Cloud IIs seem more like what people expect, and are $50 cheaper.</p>
<h3>Logitech G-733 &#8211; $130</h3>

Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>These are <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/logitech" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="logitech">Logitech&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> streamer-friendly, color-coordinated, LED-sporting set, but they&#8217;re better than the loud design would suggest.</p>
<p>The sound is definitely gaming-forward, with a definite emphasis on the low end and a very central, present sound that was a lot like the Cloud II.</p>
<p>To be honest, I was not expecting the G733s to be very comfortable — their stiff plastic look suggested they&#8217;d creak, weigh down my ears and crush my noggin. But in fact they&#8217;re really light and quite comfy! There&#8217;s a lot of play in the positions of the earcups. The fit is a little odd in that there&#8217;s a plainly inferior version of the 7P/7X&#8217;s &#8220;ski goggle&#8221; strap that really only has four settings, while the cups slide up and down about two thirds of an inch. It was <em>just</em> enough to accommodate my (again, apparently very large) head.</p>
<p>The mic boom is rather short, and sadly there is no indicator for when the mic is on or off, which is sometimes a minor inconvenience and sometimes a major pain. You can tell from the sound the mute button makes, though.</p>
<p>The volume dial is nice and smooth, though the &#8220;clicks&#8221; are really far apart. I like the texture of it and the mic mute button, the power button not so much. But it works.</p>
<p>The colors may not be to everyone&#8217;s liking, but I have to hand it to Logitech for going all the way. The headset, mic and even the USB dongle are all the same shade, making it much easier to keep track of them in my growing pile of headphones and widgets.</p>
<h3>Logitech Pro-X &#8211; $200</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076129" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076129" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076129 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1791" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=768,550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=680,487 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=1536,1100 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=2048,1467 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-4.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076129" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Currently Logitech&#8217;s most premium set of gaming headphones, the Pro-X abandon the bright, plasticky look of its other sets and goes for understated and black.</p>
<p>The sound of the Logitech is big and very clear, with almost a reference feel in how balanced the bands are. I felt more presence in the mid-lows of smart bass-playing than the other sets. There is a &#8220;surround&#8221; feel that makes it feel more like you&#8217;re in a room of well-configured speakers than headphones, something that I think emerges from a de-emphasis of the center channel. The media is &#8220;out there,&#8221; not &#8220;in here.&#8221; It&#8217;s not a bad or a good thing, just distinct from the others.</p>
<p>The controls are about on par with the Cloud II&#8217;s: a nice frictiony volume wheel controlling system volume, a nice mic toggle button and a fairly meaty on-off switch you&#8217;re unlikely to trip on purpose.</p>
<p>Also like the Cloud IIs, there is no rotation to the earcups, making them less comfortable to me than the ATs and SteelSeries, and Logitech&#8217;s cheaper G-733s. A larger head than my own, if that&#8217;s possible, would definitely feel clamped. I do think these would wear in well, but all the same a bit of play would help a lot.</p>
<p>The external material, a satinized matte plastic, looks truly lovely but is an absolute fingerprint magnet. Considering you&#8217;ll be handling these a lot (and let&#8217;s be honest, not necessarily with freshly washed hands), you&#8217;re going to need to wipe them down rather more than any of the others I tested.</p>
<h3>Razer Blackshark V2 Pro &#8211; $180</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2076125" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2076125" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2076125 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1826" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=300,219 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=768,561 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=680,497 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=1536,1122 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=2048,1496 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/headphones-review-1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2076125" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Devin Coldewey / TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>The understated Razer Blackshark V2 Pro soon became my go-to for PC gaming when the SteelSeries set was attached to the PS5.</p>
<p>Their sound is definitely gaming-focused, with extra oomph in the lows and mid-lows, but music didn&#8217;t sound overly shifted in that direction. The soundstage is full but not startlingly so, and everything sounded detailed without being harsh.</p>
<p>The Razers look heavy but aren&#8217;t — it varies day to day but I think they&#8217;re definitely competing for &#8220;most comfortable&#8221; with the A-Ts and SteelSeries. The cups feel spacious and have a nice seal, making for a very isolated listening experience. Adjustment is done with the wires attached to the cups, which is nothing special — I kind of wish this setup would let you adjust the cant as well as the height. The material is like the Logitechs — prone to fingerprints, though a little less so, in my experience.</p>
<p>Their controls are very well designed and laid out, all on one side. The protruding (system-independent) volume knob may seem odd at first but you&#8217;ll love it soon. The one big notch or click indicates exactly 50%, which is super useful for quick &#8220;calibration,&#8221; and turning the knob is smooth yet resistant enough that I never once accidentally changed it. Meanwhile there are conveniently placed and distinguishable buttons for mute and power, and ports for the detachable mic, charge cord and 3.5mm input.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hard pressed to think of any downsides to the Blackshark except that it doesn&#8217;t work with consoles.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Ever since the pandemic hit the U.S. in full force last March, the B2B tech community keeps asking the same questions: Are businesses spending more on technology? What’s the money getting spent on? Is the sales cycle faster? What trends will likely carry into 2021?</p>
<p>Recently we decided to join forces to answer these questions. We analyzed data from the just-released Q4 2020 Outlook of the <a href="https://www.coupa.com/thecoupaBSI/">Coupa Business Spend Index (BSI)</a><u>,</u> a leading indicator of economic growth, in light of hundreds of conversations we have had with business-tech buyers this year.</p>

This perspective gives Coupa unique, real-time insights into tech spending trends across multiple industries.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			Tech spending is continuing despite the economic recession &#8212; which helps explain why many startups are raising large rounds and even tapping public markets for capital.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, tech spending is continuing despite the economic recession &#8212; which helps explain why many tech startups are raising large financing rounds and even tapping the public markets for capital. Here are our three specific takeaways on current tech spending:</p>
<h2>Spending is shifting away from remote collaboration to SaaS and cloud computing</h2>
<p>Tech spending ranks among the hottest boardroom topics today. Decisions that used to be confined to the CIO’s organization are now operationally and strategically critical to the CEO. Multiple reasons drive this shift, but the pandemic has forced businesses to operate and engage with customers differently, almost overnight. Boards recognize that companies must change their business models and operations if they don’t want to become obsolete. The question on everyone’s mind is no longer “what are our technology investments?” but rather, “how fast can they happen?”</p>
<p>Spending on WFH/remote collaboration tools has largely run its course in the first wave of adaptation forced by the pandemic. Now we’re seeing a second wave of tech spending, in which enterprises adopt technology to make operations easier and simply keep their doors open.</p>
<p>SaaS solutions are replacing unsustainable manual processes. Consider Rhode Island’s decision to <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/how-surveys-are-powering-rhode-island-gov-gina-raimondos-fight-against-coronavirus/">shift from in-person citizen surveying to using SurveyMonkey</a>. Many companies are shifting their vendor payments to digital payments, ditching paper checks entirely. Utility provider PG&amp;E is accelerating its digital transformation roadmap from five years to two years.</p>
<p>The second wave of adaptation has also pushed many companies to embrace the cloud, as this chart makes clear:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083157" style="width: 890px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083157" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2083157" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png" alt="covid-19 has expanded cloud adoption chart" width="880" height="495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png 880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image001.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083157" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.battery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battery Ventures <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Similarly, the difficulty of maintaining a traditional data center during a pandemic has pushed many companies to finally shift to cloud infrastructure under COVID. As they migrate that workload to the cloud, the pie is still expanding. Goldman Sachs and Battery Ventures data suggest $600 billion worth of disruption potential will bleed into 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p>In addition to SaaS and cloud adoption, companies across sectors are spending on technologies to reduce their reliance on humans. For instance, Tyson Foods<strong> </strong>is investing in and accelerating the adoption of automated technology to process poultry, pork and beef.</p>
<h2>All companies are digital product companies now</h2>
<p>Mention “digital product company” in the past, and we’d all think of Netflix. But now <em>every</em> company has to reimagine itself as offering digital products in a meaningful way.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.zephr.com">Zephr</a> has raised $8 million in a new funding round led by <a href="https://www.bdmifund.com">Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments</a> (owned by media giant Bertelsmann).</p>
<p>The London-headquarted startup&#8217;s customers already include publishers like McClatchy, News Corp Australia, Dennis Publishing and PEI Media. CEO James Henderson told me via email that rather than creating &#8220;a monolithic product that tries to do a bit of everything,&#8221; Zephr is &#8220;focused entirely on the experience and journey for the prospect or customer,&#8221; driving an average 150% increase in conversion rates and 25% increase in subscription revenue within the first six months.</p>
<p>Henderson added, &#8220;By offering the right product, package or message at the right time to the right person, Zephr improves conversion rates, drastically decreases churn and drives new, stable revenue.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To do this, Zephr largely relies on the publisher&#8217;s first-party data about its readers — Henderson said that this data is &#8220;by far the most important and powerful type of data that Zephr both uses and generates.&#8221; But it also takes advantage of contextual data, such as &#8220;time of day, to location, device or consumption patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also noted that Zephr is a no-code tool, allowing non-technical members of the marketing, revenue and product teams to use a drag-and-drop editor to create different customer journeys.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083186" style="width: 487px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083186" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2083186" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?w=477" alt="Zephr" width="477" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?resize=105,150 105w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?resize=210,300 210w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?resize=768,1096 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?resize=477,680 477w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Feature-RuleFeature-Rule-iPad.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083186" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zephr</p></div></p>
<p>Asked how the pandemic has affected the startup&#8217;s business, Henderson said there were both &#8220;positive and negative indicators,&#8221; with newsrooms seeing record readership but in some cases also freezing spending.</p>
<p>&#8220;As firms prepare for a &#8216;post-pandemic&#8217; world, we are beginning to see our markets seize the opportunity of all these new potential subscribers and invest in subscription models &#8212; and in Zephr.&#8221; he said. &#8220;In publishing and news media, the old model of dominant advertising revenue is on the way out and we are well-placed to capitalize on that interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding also includes financing from Silicon Valley Bank UK Branch and brings Zephr&#8217;s total funding to $11 million. Previous investors include Knight Capital and Nauta Capital.</p>
<p>According to the company&#8217;s funding announcement, this money will go toward further product development (with a focus on increased personalization), as well as expansion across the United States, Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>“The recent weakness in the advertising market increased pressure for media companies to diversify revenue streams and aim to introduce or optimize subscription models,&#8221; said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bertelsmann-digital-media-investments" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bertelsmann-digital-media-investments">BDMI <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Managing Director Urs Cete in a statement. &#8220;We recognise Zephr’s excellent technology that empowers publishers to galvanise the online subscription opportunity and create customer journeys that are truly unique.&#8221;</p>
