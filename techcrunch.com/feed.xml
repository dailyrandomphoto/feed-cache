										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Word nerds with a love for linguistic curiosities and novel nomenclature that&#8217;s more fulsome than their ability to make interesting new terms stick will be thrilled by <a href="https://yaktack.com">Yak Tack</a>: A neat little <em>aide</em>&#8211;<em>mémoire</em> (in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yaktackapp&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yak-tack/id1530700944">iOS</a> app form) designed for expanding (English) vocabulary, either as a native speaker or language learner.</p>
<p>Yak Tack uses <a href="https://yaktack.substack.com/p/enter-leitner">adaptive spaced repetition</a> to help users remember new words &#8212; drawing on a system devised in the 1970s by German scientist Sebastian Leitner.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s core mechanic is a process it calls &#8216;tacking&#8217;. Here&#8217;s how it works: A user comes across a new word and inputs it into Yak Tack to look up what it means (definition content for words and concepts is sourced from Oxford, Merriam-Webster, and Wikpedia via their API, per the developer).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now they can choose to &#8216;tack&#8217; the word to help them remember it.</p>
<p>This means the app will instigate its system of space repetition to combat the routine problem of memory decay/forgetting, as new information tends to be jettisoned by our brains unless we make a dedicated effort to remember it (and/or events conspire to make it memorable for other, not necessarily very pleasant reasons).</p>
<p>Tacked words are shown to Yak Tack users via push notification at spaced intervals (after 1 day, 2,3,5,8, and 13; following the fibonacci sequence).</p>
<p>Tapping on the notification takes the user to their in-app Tack Board where they get to re-read the definition. It also displays all the words they&#8217;ve tacked and their progress in the learning sequence for each one.</p>
<p>After the second repeat of a word there&#8217;s a gamified twist as the user must select the correct definition or synonym &#8212; depending on how far along in the learning sequence they are &#8212; from a multiple-choice list.</p>
<p>Picking the right answer means the learning proceeds to the next fibonacci interval. An incorrect answer moves the user back to the previous interval &#8212; meaning they must repeat that step, retightening (instead of expanding) the information-exposure period; hence adaptive space repetition.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple and neat use of digital prompts to help make new words stick.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2139025,2139022,2139023,2139024,2139026"]</p>
<p>The app also has a simple and neat user interface. It actually started as an email-only reminder system, says developer Jeremy Thomas, who made the tool for himself, wanting to expand his own vocabulary &#8212; and was (intentionally) the sole user for the first six months after it launched in 2019. (He was also behind an earlier (now discontinued) vocabulary app called <a href="https://lifehacker.com/ink-paste-helps-you-learn-new-vocabulary-words-as-you-c-1725759009">Ink Paste</a>.)</p>
<p>For now Yak Tack is a side/passion project so he can keep coding (and indulge his &#8220;entrepreneurial proclivities&#8221;, as he wordily puts it), his day job being head of product engineering at Gusto. But he sees business potential in bootstrapping the learning tool &#8212; and has incorporated it as an LLC.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have just over 500 users spread across the world (17 different timezones). We&#8217;re biggest in Japan, Germany, and the U.S.,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m funding it myself and have no plans to take on investment. I&#8217;ve learned to appreciate technology companies that have an actual business model underneath them,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;There&#8217;s an elegance to balancing growth and business fundamentals, and given the low cost of starting a SaaS business, I&#8217;m surprised more companies don&#8217;t bootstrap, frankly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The email-only version of Yak Tack still works (you send an email to <a href="mailto:word@yaktack.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">word@yaktack.com</a> with the word you&#8217;d like to learn as the subject and the spaced repeats happen in the same sequence &#8212; but over email). But the mobile app is much more popular, per Thomas.</p>
<p>It is also (inevitably) more social, showing users words tacked by other users who tacked the same word as them &#8212; so there&#8217;s a bit of word discovery serendipity thrown in. However the user who will get the most out of Yak Tack is definitely the voracious and active reader who&#8217;s ingesting a lot of text elsewhere and taking the time to look up (and tack) new and unfamiliar words as they find them.</p>
<p>The app itself doesn&#8217;t do major lifting on the word discovery front &#8212; but it will serve up random encounters by showing you lists of latest tacks, most-tacked this month and words from any other users you follow. (There&#8217;s also a &#8216;last week&#8217;s most tacked words&#8217; notification sent weekly.)</p>
<p>Taking a step back, one of the cruel paradoxes of the COVID-19 pandemic is that while it&#8217;s made education for kids harder, as schooling has often been forced to go remote, it&#8217;s given many stuck-at-home adults more time on their hands than usual to put their mind to learning new stuff &#8212; which explains why online language learning has seen an uplift over the past 12 months+.</p>
<p>And with the pandemic remaining the new dystopian &#8216;normal&#8217; in most parts of the world, market conditions seem pretty conducive for a self-improvement tool like Yak Tack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a lot of good user growth during the pandemic, in large part because I think people are investing in themselves. I think that makes the timing right for an app like Yak Tack,&#8221; says Thomas.</p>
<p>Yak Tack is freemium, with free usage for five active tacks (and a queue system for any other words you add); or $5 a year for unlimited tacks and no queue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I figure the worldwide TAM [total addressable market] of English-learners is really big, and at that low price point Yak Tack is both accessible and is a huge business opportunity,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon on Thursday announced a $250 million venture fund to invest in Indian startups and entrepreneurs focusing on digitization of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in the key overseas market.</p>
<p>The announcement comes at a time when the American e-commerce group, which has previously invested over $6.5 billion in its India business, faces heat from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-india-operations-enforcement-idUSKBN2AI1TC">government bodies</a>, and the small and medium-sized businesses that it purports to serve.</p>
<p>Through the new venture fund, called Amazon Smbhav Venture Fund, Amazon said it wants to invest in startups that focus on helping small businesses come online, sell online, automate and digitize their operations, and expand to customers worldwide.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Agriculture and healthcare are two additional areas Amazon is focusing on with its new venture fund, but it said it is open to looking at tech startups from other sectors if their work intersects with SMBs.</p>
<p>In the agri-tech sector, Amazon is looking to invest in Indian startups that are using technology to make agri-inputs more accessible to farmers, provide credit and insurance to farmers, reduce food wastage, and improve the quality of produce to consumers. In the healthcare sector, Amazon said it will invest in startups that are enabling healthcare providers to leverage telemedicine, e-diagnosis, AI powered treatment recommendations.</p>
<p>The announcement was made at Amazon&#8217;s annual event, called Sambhav, that focuses on India-based SMBs. At the virtual event, Amazon also unveiled &#8216;Spotlight North East&#8217;, an initiative to bring 50,000 artisans, weavers and small businesses online from the eight states in the North East region of India by 2025 and to boost exports of key commodities like tea, spices and honey from the region.</p>
<p>In the first edition of Sambhav last year, Amazon announced it would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">investing $1 billion to help digitize 10 million small and medium sized businesses</a>. Amazon said earlier this month that it had created 300,000 jobs in India since January 2020, and enabled exports for Indian-made goods worth $3 billion.</p>
<p>The company said more than 50,000 offline retailers and neighborhood stores &#8212; called kirana locally &#8212; are using Amazon marketplace and about 250,000 new sellers have also joined the platform. The company said today it aims to onboard 1 million offline retailers and neighbourhood stores by 2025 through the Local Shops on Amazon program.</p>
<p>Not far from Sambhav&#8217;s first event last year, which was attended by Amazon chief executive and founder Jeff Bezos, tens of thousands of protesters <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">marched on the street and expressed their concerns</a> about what they alleged was unfair practices employed by Amazon to crush them.</p>
<p>A similar protest was seen today. You can hear some of their stories <a href="https://twitter.com/sellers_indian">here</a>. It&#8217;s an ongoing challenge for Amazon, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/india-plays-hardball-with-amazon/">long struggled to stay out of controversy in India</a>.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">An influential India trader group that represents tens of millions of brick-and-mortar retailers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/indian-trader-group-calls-for-ban-on-amazon-following-dodging-regulations-claims/">called New Delhi to ban Amazon in the country in February</a> this year after a report claimed that the American e-commerce group had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers in India, publicly misrepresented its ties with those sellers and used them to circumvent foreign investment rules in the country.</p>
<p>The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) “demanded” serious action from the Indian government against Amazon following <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation/">revelations made in a Reuters story</a>. “For years, CAIT has been maintaining that Amazon has been circumventing FDI [Foreign Direct Investment] laws of India to conduct unfair and unethical trade,” it said.</p>
<p>Several international technology giants including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">Google</a>, Facebook, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/microsoft-100x100x100-b2b-saas-india-startups/">Microsoft</a> have invested in Indian startups in recent years. Amazon, too, has backed a number of firms including ride-hailing startup Shuttl, and consumer brand MyGlamm. Last month, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/amazon-acquires-indian-retail-startup-perpule/">acquired retail startup Perpule for about $20 million</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Automation has become a big theme in enterprise IT, with organizations using RPA, no-code and low-code tools, and other  technology to speed up work and bring more insights and analytics into how they do things every day, and today <a href="https://ibm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM</a> is announcing an acquisition as it hopes to take on a bigger role in providing those automation services. The IT giant has acquired <a href="https://www.my-invenio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyInvenio</a>, an Italian startup that builds and operates process mining software.</p>
<p>Process mining is the part of the automation stack that tracks data produced by a company’s software, as well as how the software works, in order to provide guidance on what a company could and should do to improve it. In the case of myInvenio, the company&#8217;s approach involves making a &#8220;digital twin&#8221; of an organization to help track and optimize processes. IBM is interested in how myInvenio&#8217;s tools are able to monitor data in areas like sales, procurement, production and accounting to help organizations identify what might be better served with more automation, which it can in turn run using RPA or other tools as needed.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed. It is not clear if myInvenio had any outside investors (we&#8217;ve asked and are awaiting a response). This is the second acquisition IBM has made out of Italy. (The first was in 2014, a company called CrossIdeas that now forms part of the company&#8217;s security business.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>IBM and myInvenio are not exactly strangers: the two inked a deal as recently as <a href="https://www.my-invenio.com/news/ibm-meet-process-mining-myinvenio-brings-new-capabilities-to-ibms-cloud-pak-for-automation-with-process-mining-integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2020</a> to integrate the Italian startup&#8217;s technology into IBM&#8217;s bigger automation services business globally.</p>
<p>Dinesh Nirmal, GM of IBM Automation, said in an interview that the reason IBM acquired the company was two-fold. First, it lets IBM integrate the technology more closely into the company&#8217;s Cloud Pak for Business Automation, which sits on and is powered by Red Hat OpenShift and has other automation capabilities already embedded within it, specifically robotic process automation (RPA), document processing, workflows and decisions.</p>
<p>Second and perhaps more importantly, it will mean that IBM will not have to tussle for priority for its customers in competition with other solution partners that myInvenio already had. IBM will be the sole provider.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partnerships are great but in a partnership you also have the option to partner with others, and when it comes to priority who decides?&#8221; he said. &#8220;From the customer perspective, will they will work just on our deal, or others first? Now, our customers will get the end result of this&#8230; We can bring a single solution to an end user or an enterprise, saying, &#8216;look you have document processing, RPA, workflow, mining. That is the beauty of this and what customers will see.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that IBM currently serves customers across a range of verticals including financial, insurance, healthcare and manufacturing with its automation products.</p>
<p>Notably, this is not the first acquisition that IBM has made to build out this stack. Last year, it <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-07-08-IBM-to-Acquire-WDG-Automation-to-Advance-AI-Infused-Automation-Capabilities-for-Enterprises" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired WDG</a> to expand into robotic process automation.</p>
<p>And interestingly, it&#8217;s not even the only partnership that IBM has had in process mining. Just earlier this month, it announced a deal with one of the bigger names in the field, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/celonis-announces-significant-partnership-with-ibm-to-sell-its-process-mining-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Celonis</a>, a German startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/celonis-a-leader-in-big-data-process-mining-for-enterprises-nabs-290m-on-a-2-5b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $2.5 billion in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Ironically, at the time, my colleague Ron wondered aloud why IBM wasn&#8217;t just buying Celonis outright in that deal. It&#8217;s hard to speculate if price was one reason. Remember: we don&#8217;t know the terms of this acquisition, but given myInvenio was off the fundraising radar, chances are it&#8217;s possibly a little less than Celonis&#8217;s pricetag.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked and IBM has confirmed that it will continue to work with Celonis alongside now offering its own native process mining tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;In keeping with IBM&#8217;s open approach and $1 billion investment in ecosystem, [Global Business Services, IBM&#8217;s enterprise services division] works with a broad range of technologies based on client and market demand, including IBM AI and Automation software,&#8221; a spokesperson said in a statement. &#8220;Celonis focuses on execution management which supports GBS&#8217; transformation of clients’ business processes through intelligent workflows across industries and domains. Specifically, Celonis has deep connectivity into enterprise systems such as Salesforce, SAP, Workday or ServiceNow, so the Celonis EMS platform helps GBS accelerate clients’ transformations and BPO engagements with these ERP platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, at the end of the day, companies that offer services, especially suites of services, are working in environments where they have to be open to customers using their own technology, or bringing in something else.</p>
<p>There may have been another force pushing IBM to bring more of this technology in-house, and that&#8217;s wider competitive climate. Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/sap-is-buying-berlin-business-process-automation-startup-signavio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAP acquired another European startup in the process mining space, Signavio</a>, in a deal reportedly worth about $1.2 billion. As more of these companies get snapped up by would-be IBM rivals, and those left standing are working with a plethora of other parties, maybe it was high time for IBM to make sure it had its own horse in the race.</p>
<p>“Through IBM’s planned acquisition of myInvenio, we are revolutionizing the way companies manage their process operations,” said Massimiliano Delsante, CEO, myInvenio, who will be staying on with the deal. “myInvenio’s unique capability to automatically analyze processes and create simulations &#8212; what we call a ‘Digital Twin of an Organization’ &#8212;  is joining with IBM’s AI-powered automation capabilities to better manage process execution. Together we will offer a comprehensive solution for digital process transformation and automation to help enterprises continuously transform insights into action.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digital adoption in a number of areas, particularly in the financial services space. Within financial services, there are few spaces hotter than B2B payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2020/visa-says-frictionless-b2b-payments-are-the-future-rails-must-adapt-to-new-use-cases/">a $120 trillion market size</a>, it’s no surprise that an increasing number of fintechs focused on digitizing payments have been attracting investor interest. The latest is Routable, which has nabbed $30 million in a Series B raise that included participation from a slew of high-profile angel investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike most raises, Routable didn’t raise the capital from a bunch of VC firms. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator, and Jack Altman, CEO of Lattice, led the round. (The pair are brothers, in case you didn’t know.)</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank-backed unicorn </span><a href="https://www.flexport.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexport</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also participated, along with a number of angel investors, including Instacart co-founder Max Mullen, Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, Box co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie, Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff (who also started TIME Ventures),  DoorDash’s Gokul Rajaram, early Stripe employee turned angel Lachy Groom and Behance founder Scott Belsky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Series B comes just over eight months after Routable came out of stealth with </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200810005100/en/Routable-Launches-Transformative-Solution-to-Make-Easy-Business-Payments-a-Reality"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $12 million Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Omri Mor and CTO Tom Harel founded Routable in 2017 after previously working at marketplaces and recognizing the need for better internal tools for scaling business payments. They went through a Y Combinator batch and embarked on a process of interviewing hundreds of CFOs and finance leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair found that the majority of the business payment tools that were out there were built for large companies with a low volume of business payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After running enough customer development we identified a huge scramble to solve high-volume business payments, and that&#8217;s what we double down on,” Mor told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="esoECzOjrE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/all-b2b-startups-are-in-the-payments-business/">All B2B startups are in the payments business</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;All B2B startups are in the payments business&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/all-b2b-startups-are-in-the-payments-business/embed/#?secret=esoECzOjrE" data-secret="esoECzOjrE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Routable’s mission is simple: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to automate bill payment and invoicing processes (also known as accounts payables and accounts receivables), so that businesses can focus on scaling their core product offerings without worrying about payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A business payment is more like moving a bill through Congress, where a consumer payment is more like a tweet,” Mor said. “We automate every step from purchase order to reconciliation and by extending an API, companies don’t have to build their own inner integration. We handle it, while helping them move their money faster.”</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone wp-image-2138652 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png" alt="" width="1791" height="1713" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png 1791w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=300,287 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=768,735 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=680,650 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=1536,1469 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Routable-screenshot.png?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1791px) 100vw, 1791px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its August 2020 raise, Routable has seen its revenue grow by 380%, according to Mor. And last month alone, the company tripled its amount of new customers compared to the month prior. Customers include Snackpass, Ticketmaster and Re-Max, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve been beating every quarter expectation for the past 18 months,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company started out focused on the startup and SMB customer, but based on demand and feedback, is expanding into the enterprise space as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has established integrations with QuickBooks, NetSuite and Xero and is looking to invest moving forward in integrating with Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics Workday and SAP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of our investment moving forward is to be able to bring that same level of automation and ease of use that we do for SMB and mid-market customers to the enterprise world,” Mor told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead investor Sam Altman is in favor of that approach, noting that the recent booms in the gig and creator economies are leading to a big spike in the volume of both payments and payees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the addition of enterprise capabilities, we think this can lead to an enormous business,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round brings Routable’s total raised to $46 million. The company has headquarters in San Francisco and Seattle with primarily a remote team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Altman also told me that he was drawn to Routable after having experienced the pain of high-volume business payments himself and working with many startup founders who had experienced the same problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also impressed with the company’s engineering-forward approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They can offer the best service by being embedded in a company’s flow of funds instead of the usual approach of just being an interface for moving money,” Altman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regard to the other investors, Mor said the decision to partner with founders of a number of prominent tech companies was intentional so that Routable could benefit from their “deep enterprise and high-growth experience.”</span></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the B2B payments space is white-hot. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.meliopayments.com/">Melio</a>, which provides a platform for SMBs to pay other companies electronically using bank transfers, debit cards or credit — along with the option of cutting paper checks for recipients if that is what the recipients request — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/melio-raises-110m-on-a-1-3b-valuation-to-bring-b2b-payments-for-smbs-into-the-21st-century/">closed on $110 million in funding</a> at a $1.3 billion valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank Vision Fund 2 is in advanced stages of talks to invest up to half a billion dollars into food delivery startup Swiggy, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The new investment values the Indian startup at about $5.5 billion, the sources said.</p>
<p>The new investment would add to the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/indias-swiggy-nears-5-billion-valuation-in-new-800-million-fundraise/"> $800 million fundraise Swiggy unveiled earlier this month</a>. SoftBank began exploring investment in India&#8217;s food delivery space earlier this year, and also looked at Swiggy&#8217;s rival Zomato. But the investment firm picked Swiggy earlier this week, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Swiggy and SoftBank declined to comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new investment talks come amid Zomato <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/indian-food-delivery-startup-zomato-valued-at-5-4-billion-in-new-250-million-investment/">raising $910 million in recent months</a> as the Gurgaon-headquartered firm prepares for an IPO this year. The last tranche of investment valued Zomato at $5.4 billion. During its fundraise, Zomato said it was raising money partially to fight off “any mischief or price wars from our competition in various areas of our business.”</p>
<p>A third player, Amazon, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/amazon-expands-its-food-delivery-service-across-bangalore/">entered the food delivery market in India last year</a>, though its operations are still limited to parts of Bangalore.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s food delivery market, which analysts at Bernstein expect to balloon to be worth $12 billion by 2022, they wrote in a report to clients earlier this year.</p>
<p>After raising $800 million, Swiggy co-founder and chief executive Sriharsha Majety told employees in a memo that the new fundraise &#8220;gives us a lot more firepower than the planned investments for our current business lines. Given our unfettered ambition though, we will continue to seed/experiment new offerings for the future that may be ready for investment later. We will just need to now relentlessly invent and execute over the next few years to build an enduring iconic company out of India.”</p>
<p>He added in that memo that the long-term goal for the startup is to serve 500 million users in the next 10-15 years, pointing to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/25/chinas-food-delivery-giant-meituan-hits-100b-valuation-amid-pandemic/">Chinese food giant Meituan</a>, which had 500 million transacting users last year and is valued at over $100 billion.</p>
<p>“We’re coming out of a very hard phase during the last year given Covid and have weathered the storm, but everything we do from here on needs to maximise the chances of our succeeding in the long-term,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Swiggy, which counts Prosus Ventures among its largest investors, last year eliminated some jobs — so did Zomato — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/indias-swiggy-to-cut-1100-jobs-scale-down-cloud-kitchen-operations/">scaled down its cloud kitchen efforts</a> as it attempted to stay afloat during the pandemic, which had prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long lockdown.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As computing systems become increasingly bigger and more complex, forensics have become an increasingly important part of how organizations can better secure them. As the recent Solar Winds breach has shown, it&#8217;s not always just a matter of being able to identify data loss, or prevent hackers from coming in in the first place. In cases where a network has already been breached, running a thorough investigation is often the only way to identify what happened, if a breach is still active, and whether a malicious hacker can strike again.</p>
<p>As a sign of this growing priority, a startup called <a href="https://www.cadosecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cado Security</a>, which has built forensics technology native to the cloud to run those investigations, is announcing $10 million in funding to expand its business.</p>
<p>Cado&#8217;s tools today are used directly by organizations, but also security companies like <a href="https://www.redacted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redacted</a> &#8212; a somewhat under-the-radar security startup in San Francisco co-founded by Facebook&#8217;s former chief security officer Max Kelly and John Hering, the co-founder of Lookout. It uses Cado to carry out the forensics part of its work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding for London-based Cado is being led by Blossom Capital, with existing investors Ten Eleven Ventures also participating, among others. As another signal of demand, this Series A is coming only six months after Cado raised its seed round.</p>
<p>The task of securing data on digital networks has grown increasingly complex over the years: not only are there more devices, more data and a wider range of configurations and uses around it, but malicious hackers have become increasingly sophisticated in their approaches to needling inside networks and doing their dirty work.</p>
<p>The move to the cloud has also been a major factor. While it has helped a wave of organizations expand and run much bigger computing processes are part of their business operations, it has also increased the so-called attack surface and made investigations much more complicated, not least because a lot of organizations run elastic processes, scaling their capacity up and down: this means when something is scaled down, logs of previous activity essentially disappear.</p>
<p>Cado&#8217;s Response product &#8212; which works proactively on a network and all of its activity after it&#8217;s installed &#8212; is built to work across cloud, on-premise and hybrid environments. Currently it&#8217;s available for AWS EC2 deployments and Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift and AWS Fargate container systems, and the plan is to expand to Azure very soon. (Google Cloud Platform is less of a priority at the moment, CEO James Campbell said, since it rarely comes up with current and potential customers.)</p>
<p>Campbell co-founded Cado with Christopher Doman (the CTO) last April, with the concept for the company coming out of their respective experiences working on security services together at PwC, and respectively for government organizations (Campbell in Australia) and AlienVault (the security firm acquired by AT&amp;T). In all of those, one persistent issue the two continued to encounter was the issue with adequate forensics data, essential for tracking the most complex breaches.</p>
<p>A lot of legacy forensics tools, in particular those tackling the trove of data in the cloud, was based on &#8220;processing data with open source and pulling together analysis in spreadsheets,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;There is a need to modernize this space for the cloud era.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a typical breach, it can take up to a month to run a thorough investigation to figure out what is going on, since, as Doman describes it, forensics looks at &#8220;every part of the disk, the files in a binary system. You just can&#8217;t find what you need without going to that level, those logs. We would look at the whole thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, that posed a major problem. &#8220;Having a month with a hacker running around before you can do something about it is just not acceptable,&#8221; Campbell added. The result, typically, is that other forensics tools investigate only about 5% of an organization&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>The solution &#8212; for which Cado has filed patents, the pair said &#8212; has essentially involved building big data tools that can automate and speed up the very labor intensive process of looking through activity logs to figure out what looks unusual and to find patterns within all the ones and zeros.</p>
<p>&#8220;That gives security teams more room to focus on what the hacker is getting up to, the remediation aspect,&#8221; Campbell explained.</p>
<p>Arguably, if there were better, faster tracking and investigation technology in place, something like Solar Winds could have been better mitigated.</p>
<p>The plan for the company is to bring in more integrations to cover more kinds of systems, and go beyond deployments that you&#8217;d generally classify as &#8220;infrastructure as a service.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Over the past year, enterprises have compressed their cloud adoption timelines while protecting the applications that enable their remote workforces,” said Imran Ghory, partner at Blossom Capital, in a statement. “Yet as high-profile breaches like SolarWinds illustrate, the complexity of cloud environments makes rapid investigation and response extremely difficult since security analysts typically are not trained as cloud experts. Cado Security solves for this with an elegant solution that automates time-consuming tasks like capturing forensically sound cloud data so security teams can move faster and more efficiently. The opportunity to help Cado Security scale rapidly is a terrific one for Blossom Capital.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Flipkart said on Thursday it has agreed to acquire online travel and hotel ticketing firm Cleartrip as the Walmart-owned e-commerce firm looks to expand its offerings in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>The deal values 14-year-old Cleartrip, which raised about $74 million prior to the acquisition, at about $40 million, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The distress sale comes as Cleartrip, like most other travel firms, faces unprecedented stress amid the global pandemic that has severely slowed down people&#8217;s appetite to move around.</p>
<p>Indian news outlet MoneyControl <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/walmart-owned-flipkart-in-talks-to-add-cleartrip-to-its-shopping-cart-6591061.html">reported</a> about the two companies exploring the deal last month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

(Data: Tracxn)</p></div></p>
<p>Cleartrip is also a partner of Amazon in India, powering the ticketing engine for the American e-commerce group. The two firms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/amazon-flight-plane-tickets-booking-india/">inked a deal in 2019</a>. TechCrunch asked Amazon earlier this week if it was aware and fine with its vendor partner exploring a buyout deal with Flipkart. The American e-commerce firm, which is currently fighting a court battle to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/bse-sebi-amazon-reliance-retail-future-india/">block its estranged Indian partner Future Group from selling business to Reliance Retail</a>, did not respond.</p>

<p>Cleartrip will continue to operate as a separate brand, retaining all employees while working closely with Flipkart to &#8220;further develop technology solutions to make travel simple for customers,&#8221; the two companies said today.</p>
<p>Flipkart has been rumored to be working on introducing flight tickets purchase feature on its marketplace for over a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Flipkart Group is committed to transforming customer experiences through digital commerce. Cleartrip is synonymous with travel for many customers, and as we diversify and look at new areas of growth, this investment will help strengthen our wide range of offerings for customers. We welcome the Cleartrip team with their deep industry knowledge and technology capabilities to the Flipkart Group and look forward to providing deeper value and travel experiences for customers together,&#8221; said Kalyan Krishnamurthy, CEO of Flipkart Group, in a statement.</p>

<p class="p1">E-wallets are rapidly gaining popularity in the Philippines, overtaking credit cards, which <a href="http://newsbytes.ph/2019/07/10/e-money-accounts-eclipsing-credit-card-penetration-bsp-report-shows">have a penetration rate of under 10%</a>. Fintech startup <a href="https://www.plentina.com/">Plentina</a> is leveraging that trend with buy now, pay later (BNPL) installment loans that can be used and repaid through e-wallets.</p>
<p class="p1">The company announced today it has closed a $2.2 million seed round, co-led by former Tableau executive and ClearGraph chief executive officer Andrew Vigneault, Unpopular Ventures and DV Collective. Other participants included JG Digital Equity Ventures (JGDEV), Amino Capital, Canaan Partners Scout Fund and Ignite Impact Fund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">Its last funding was $750,000 pre-seed round raised last year from investors including Techstars, Emergent Ventures and the 500 Startups Vietnam Fund. Plentina also participated in the Techstars Western Union and Stanford’s StartX accelerator programs.</p>
<p>Plentina launched in the Philippines in October 2020 and has been downloaded more than 30,000 times. Its merchant partners include 7-Eleven Philippines and Smart Communications, a telecom provider with more than 70 million prepaid subscribers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The company will use its seed round to onboard more merchant partners in the Philippines before expanding in Southeast Asia and other regions.</p>

<p class="p1">Plentina uses machine learning models to gauge the creditworthiness of loan applicants, drawing on founders Kevin Gabayan and Earl Valencia’s data science backgrounds. Gabayan was data science lead at Bump Technologies and then spent five years working at Google after it acquired the startup. Valencia&#8217;s experience includes serving as managing director of digital transformation at Charles Schwab.</p>
<p class="p1">“We’re making BNPL work in emerging markets where few have credit scores and merchants can’t easily integrate technology,” Valencia, Plentina’s chief business officer, told TechCrunch. In addition to alternative credit scoring, the startup also focuses on making installment payment work with merchants’ legacy workflows, he said.</p>
<p class="p1">So for, Plentina has generated 10 million credit scores from alternative data sources, including mobile data obtained with user permission and retail loyalty programs, and will continue to develop its models as its merchant partnerships and customer base grows. Customers who build good credit scores with Plentina can increase their credit limits and unlock more offers.</p>

<p class="p1">Loans have a flat 5% service fee, with no interest. 7-Eleven and Smart Communications both offer 14 day loans, and Plentina will introduce more dynamic loan terms in the future, Valencia said. Loans can be used to purchase goods at all of 7-Eleven’s 3000 stores in the Philippines and prepaid mobile airtime with Smart Communications.</p>
<p>Other installment loan services in the Philippines include BillEase, Tendopay and Cashalo. Valencia said Plentina &#8220;aim[s] to be a customer&#8217;s financial service partner throughout their lifetime. We’re starting by offering closed-loop store credit for essentials purchases for consumers to easily establish their financial identity. As a customer’s financial wellness matures, we can graduate them into additional financial services.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">In a press statement about his investment, Vigneault said, “I’ve worked with many early stage fintech companies over the years. However, I’ve come across few founders who are as impressive as Kevin and Earl and have been able to achieve such levels of success with customers, channel partners, and product at such an early stage.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://en.justkitchen.com/">JustKitchen</a>, a cloud kitchen startup, will start<a href="https://investors.justkitchen.com/press-releases/just-kitchen-to-commence-trading-on-tsx-venture-exchange/"> trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) Venture Exchange</a> on Thursday morning. It is doing a direct listing of its common shares, having already raised $8 million at a $30 million valuation.</p>
<p>The company says this makes it one of the first—if not <em>the</em> first—cloud kitchen company to go public in North America. While JustKitchen launched operations last year in Taiwan, it is incorporated in Canada, with plans to expand into Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines and the United States. TSX Venture is a board on the Toronto Stock Exchange for emerging companies, including startups, that can move to the main board once they reach certain thresholds depending on industry.</p>

<p>“It’s a really convenient way to get into the market and with the ghost kitchen industry in particular, it’s early stage and there’s a lot of runway,” co-founder and chief executive officer Jason Chen told TechCrunch. “We felt there really was a need to get going as quickly as we could and really get out into the market.”</p>
<p>Participants in JustKitchen’s IPO rounds included returning investor SparkLabs Taipei (JustKitchen took part in its accelerator program last year), investment institutions and retail clients from Toronto. More than half of JustKitchen’s issued and outstanding shares are owned by its executives, board directors and employees, Chen said.</p>
<p>One of the reasons JustKitchen decided to list on TSX Venture Exchange is Chen’s close ties to the Canadian capital markets, where he worked as an investment banker before moving to Taiwan to launch the startup. A couple of JustKitchen’s board members are also active in the Canadian capital markets, including Darren Devine, a member of TSX Venture Exchange’s Local Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>These factors made listing on the board a natural choice for JustKitchen, Chen told TechCrunch. Other reasons included ability to automatically graduate to the main TSX board once companies pass certain thresholds, including market cap and net profitability, and the ease of doing dual listings in other countries. Just Kitchen is also preparing to list its common shares on the OTCQB exchange in the U.S. and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in Germany.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup out of Berlin that&#8217;s built and grown a successful online language learning platform based around live teachers and virtual classrooms is announcing some funding today to continue expanding its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lingoda." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lingoda</a>, which connects students who want to learn a language &#8212; currently English, Spanish, French or German &#8212; with native-speaking teachers who run thousands of 24/7 live, immersion classes across a range of language levels, has picked up $68 million (€57 million). CEO Michael Shangkuan said the funding will be used both to continue enhancing its tech platform &#8212; with more tools for teachers and asynchronous supplementary material &#8212; and to widen its footprint in markets further afield such as the U.S.</p>
<p>The company currently has some 70,000 students, 1,400 teachers and runs more than 450,000 classes each year covering some 2,000 lessons. Shangkuan said that its revenue run rate is at 10x that of a year ago, and its customer base in that time grew 200% with students across 200 countries, so it is not a stranger to scaling as it doubles down on the model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want the whole world to be learning languages,&#8221; Shangkuan said. &#8220;That is our vision.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Summit Partners, with participation from existing investor Conny Boersch, founder of Mountain Partners. The valuation is not being disclosed.</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 by two brothers &#8212; Fabian and Felix Wunderlich (now respectively CFO and head of sales) &#8212; Lingoda had only raised around $15 million before now, a mark of the company being pretty capital efficient.</p>
<p>&#8220;We only run classes that are profitable,&#8221; said Shangkuan (who is from the US, New Jersey specifically) in an interview. That being said, he added, &#8220;We can’t answer if we are profitable, but we’re not hugely <em>un</em>profitable.&#8221; The market for language learning globally is around $50 billion so it&#8217;s a big opportunity despite the crowds of competition.</p>
<p>A lot of the innovation in edtech in recent years has been focused around automated tools to help people learn better in virtual environments: technology built with scale, better analytics or knowledge acquisition in mind.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s interesting to come across edtech startups that may be using some of these same tools &#8212; the whole of Lingoda is based on Zoom, which it uses to run all of its classes online, and it&#8217;s keen to bring more analytics and other tech into the equation to improve learning between lessons, to help teachers get a better sense of students&#8217; engagement and progress during class, and to more &#8212; but are fundamentally also retaining one of the more traditional aspects of learning, humans teaching other humans.</p>
<p>This is very much by design, Shangkuan said. At first, the idea was to disrupt in-person language schools, but if the startup had ever considered how and if it would pivot to more automated classes and cut the teachers out of the equation, it decided that it wasn&#8217;t worth it.</p>
<p>Shangkuan &#8212; himself a language enthusiast who moved himself to Germany specifically to immerse himself in a new country and language, from where he then proceeded to look for a job &#8212; noted that feedback from its students showed a strong inclination and preference for human teachers, with 97% saying that language learning in the Lingoda format has been more effective for them than the wave of language apps (which include the likes of Duolingo, Memrise, Busuu, Babbel, Rosetta and many more).</p>
<p>&#8220;For me as an entrepreneur trying to provide a great product, that is the bellwether, and why we are focused on delivering on our original vision,&#8221; he said, &#8220;one in which it does take teachers and real quality experiences and being able to repeat that online.&#8221; Indeed, it&#8217;s not the only tech startup that&#8217;s identified this model: VIPKid out of China and a number of others have also based learning around live teachers.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for why human teaching may be more suitable for language acquisition &#8212; starting with the fact that language is a living knowledge and so learning to speak it requires a pretty fundamental level of engagement from the learner.</p>
<p>Added to that is the fact that the language is almost never spoken in life in the same way that it is in textbooks (or apps) so hearing from a range of people speaking the language, as you do with the Lingoda format, which is not focused on matching a student with a single instructor (there is no Peloton-style following around instructors here), works very well.</p>
<p>On the subject of the teachers, it&#8217;s an interesting format that taps a little into the concept of the gig economy, although it&#8217;s not the same as being employed as a delivery driver or cleaner.</p>
<p>Lingoda notes that teachers set their own schedules and call classes themselves, rather than being ordered into them. Students meanwhile <a href="https://www.lingoda.com/en/#cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay for courses</a> along a sliding scale depending on various factors like whether you opt for group or one-to-one classes, how frequently you use the service, and which language you are learning, with per-classes prices typically ranging between $6.75 and $14.30 depending on what you choose.</p>
<p>Students can request a teaching level if they want it: there is always a wide selection yet with dozens of levels between basic A1 and advanced C1 proficiency, if you don&#8217;t find what you want and order it, it can take between a day and a week for it to materialise, typically with 1-5 students per class. But in any case, a teacher needs to set the class herself or himself. This format makes it fall into more standardized language learning labor models.</p>
<p>&#8220;We closely mirror the business model of traditional (brick and mortar) in-person language schools, where teachers work part time in compliance with local laws and have the flexibility to schedule their own classes,&#8221; a spokesperson said. &#8220;The main difference is that our model brings in-person classes online, but we are still following the same local guidelines.&#8221;<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>After students complete a course, Lingoda provides them with a certification. In English, you can take a recognized <a href="https://www.lingoda.com/en/linguaskill-from-cambridge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cambridge assessment</a> to verify your proficiency.</p>
<p>Lingoda&#8217;s growth is coming at an interesting moment in the world of online education, which has been one of the big juggernauts of the last year. Schools shutting down in-person learning, people spending more time at home, and the need for many of us to feel like we are doing something at a time of so many restrictions have all driven people to spend time learning online have all driven edtech companies to expand, and the technology that&#8217;s being used for the purpose to continue evolving.</p>
<p>To be clear, Lingoda has been around for years and was not hatched out of pandemic conditions: many of the learners that it has attracted are those who might have otherwise attended an in-person language class run by one of the many smaller schools you might come across in a typical city (London has hundreds of them), learning because they are planning to relocate or study abroad, or because people have newly arrived in a country and need to learn the language to get by, or they have to learn it for work.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s been interesting in this last year is how services created for one kind of environment have been taken up in our &#8220;new normal.&#8221; The classes that Lingoda offers become a promise of a moment when we will be able to visit more places again, and hopefully order coffees, argue about jaywalkers, and chat with strangers here and there a little more easily.</p>
<p>“The language learning market is increasingly shifting to online offerings that provide consumers with a more convenient, flexible and cost-effective way to improve their foreign language skills,” said Matthias Allgaier, MD at Summit Partners, in a statement. “We believe Lingoda has developed one of the most comprehensive and effective online language learning solutions globally and is positioned to benefit from the ongoing and accelerating trend of digitization in education. We are thrilled to partner with the entire Lingoda team, and we are excited about the future for this business.” Allgaier is joining Lingoda&#8217;s board with this round.</p>
<p><em>Updated with an additional investor and a slight change in funding amount due to conversion rates.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://n26.com">N26</a> is launching N26 Insurance as it plans to offer insurance products that you can access from the company’s mobile app and website. The first insurance product is a smartphone insurance plan for German customers.</p>
<p>But the startup doesn’t plan to stop there. N26 says it is also working on private liability insurance, home insurance, life insurance, pet insurance and coverage for bikes, electronics and large purchases.</p>
<p>The idea is that you’ll be able to purchase coverage, manage your plans and initiate claims within the N26 app. As N26 already has your personal information, it should be easier to sign up to a new insurance product through N26 compared to creating a new account in a separate app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The challenger bank isn’t becoming an insurtech company overnight. Instead, it is partnering with other companies, such as <a href="https://www.simplesurance.com">Simplesurance</a>, for those products.</p>
<p>“The big thing we’re doing in Q1 and Q2 is a big focus on the marketplace,” co-founder and CEO Valentin Stalf told me a few months ago. “Early on we always tried to integrate the full experience.”</p>
<p>N26 Insurance is the first release of this new API-driven strategy. Partners will be able to integrate their products on their own and N26 will make it easy to share KYC files (‘know your customer’), transfer money between N26 and partners, etc.</p>
<p>“Most fintech startups are super low frequency,” Stalf said. He mentioned mortgage as one financial product that you set up once and never touch again. These companies have high customer acquisition costs, so N26 can help on that front. For instance, if you purchase a bike online, N26 could recommend a bike insurance product after your purchase.</p>
<p>As for phone insurance launching today, prices will vary depending on your phone. If you spent a lot of money on your phone, your insurance plan is going to be more expensive. N26 lets you opt for annual plans to save a bit of money.</p>
<p>Phone insurance also contributes to the freemium strategy of N26. The company offers free and paid accounts that start at €4.90 per month. The most expensive plan, N26 Metal, costs €16.90 per month and includes phone insurance.</p>
<p>Some customers who might want to insure their phone might be tempted to switch to N26 Metal to insure their phone and get more features, such as travel insurance.</p>
<p>N26 started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/n26-launches-mid-tier-subscription-plan-for-e4-90-per-month/">revamping its plans</a> in November 2020 by introducing a new mid-tier plan called N26 Smart. In Europe, N26 no longer sends you a plastic debit card if you create a free account — you get a virtual debit card that you can add to Apple Pay or Google Pay by default. You either have to pay a one-off €10 fee to receive a plastic card or subscribe to N26 Smart for €4.90 per month.</p>
<p>Offering new products in the app and pushing users toward paid subscriptions should definitely help N26 when it comes to profitability. The startup has grown tremendously over the past few years and the company is focused on consolidating the business as much as possible now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s no shortage of data-driven sales management tools in the market. Naturally, <a href="https://www.atriumhq.com/">Atrium</a>, a five-year-old, San Francisco-based company cofounded by serial entrepreneur Pete Kazanjy, says it does a far better job of empowering sales managers to improve their team&#8217;s performance. How? By giving them easy, digestible, real-time insights into who on their team is outperforming, who is on track to reach his or her goals, and who is losing momentum and in what areas so that potential issues don&#8217;t spiral into major problems.</p>
<p>Atrium has convinced investors of its merits. Though Kazanjy candidly offers that an earlier version of the software &#8220;was not phenomenal,&#8221; its current product line-up just prompted Bonfire Ventures, Bullpen Capital, CRV and First Round Capital to provide the 30-person company with $13.5 million in seed funding so it can more aggressively grow its reach inside of organizations, both big and small. (It already counts roughly 100 companies as customers, including <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a>, <a href="https://clearbit.com/">Clearbit</a>, and <a href="https://saasoptics.com/">SaasOptics</a>.)</p>
<p>As for what Atrium is selling exactly, it&#8217;s the continuous monitoring of dozens of key performance indicators like bookings, average selling prices, the number of customer-facing meetings a rep has had in any given week and the length of deal cycles. The idea is to provide managers a clear view into their teams so that when something is off or, conversely, when it&#8217;s going better than planned, those same managers can drive positive behavior change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Perhaps as important, Atrium says it provides automated root-cause analytics via anomaly detection with additional filters to uncover why someone&#8217;s performance may be peaking or dipping.  Consider: if someone is doing particularly well, other team members might want to emulate the behaviors that are fueling that success.</p>
<p>The cost of all that monitoring costs $5,000 per year smaller outfits and much more than that for some of Atrium&#8217;s bigger customers.</p>
<p>The findings are also delivered to managers where they live, which is via their email and Slack channels, though there&#8217;s a web app, too.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2138911 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atrium-Product-Image-2.png" alt="" width="2770" height="1482" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atrium-Product-Image-2.png 2770w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atrium-Product-Image-2.png?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atrium-Product-Image-2.png?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atrium-Product-Image-2.png?resize=768,411 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atrium-Product-Image-2.png?resize=680,364 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atrium-Product-Image-2.png?resize=1536,822 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atrium-Product-Image-2.png?resize=2048,1096 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Atrium-Product-Image-2.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /></p>
<p>As with many software tools, the need for what Atrium makes really began to explode as companies abruptly saw their workforces scatter because of pandemic lockdowns. &#8220;The importance of data-driven sales management only only accelerated [in a world] where all of a sudden, managers can&#8217;t really tell themselves a story of like, &#8216;Yeah, I know what&#8217;s going on with my team because I can see them right from across the sales floor,'&#8221; notes Kazanjy.</p>
<p>He has some personal insight into the issue. Atrium&#8217;s own team is largely based in San Francisco, but because it&#8217;s also more distributed than before COVID-19 struck the U.S., the company is using its own software, as well as selling it.</p>
<p>Kazanjy previously cofounded TalentBin, a talent search engine that allowed technical recruiters and hiring managers to find passive candidates and which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/24/monster-acquires-talentbin-and-gozaik/">acquired</a> by Monster in 2014.</p>
<p>He also recently authored a book called <a href="https://www.foundingsales.com/">Founding Sales</a>, which bills itself as an &#8220;early-stage, go-to-market handbook.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kazanjy&#8217;s background is actually in product management and product marketing, but like a lot of founders, when he launched his last company, the looming question quickly became: who is going to sell this stuff?</p>
<p>Kazanjy quickly realized the answer was himself, in the process becoming TalentBin&#8217;s first sales rep, then its first sales manager.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s how he learned modern sales and data-driven sales management, deciding afterward to write about the missteps he&#8217;d made &#8212;  and the solutions he struck on &#8212; so people &#8220;won&#8217;t make the same mistakes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://trypico.com">Pico</a>, a New York startup that helps online creators and media companies make money and manage their customer data, <a href="https://trypico.com/blog/company/2-0">announced today</a> that it has launched an upgraded platform and raised $6.5 million in new funding.</p>
<p>In a statement, the startup&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Nick Chen said Pico helps creators with their two biggest problems — &#8220;how to make money more easily and how to get to know your audience better&#8221; — while also giving them control over their two most important assets, namely &#8220;your brand and the relationship to your audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company provides a long list of different tools, including landing pages, pop-ups to collect email addresses, paid newsletters, subscription paywalls, tiered membership programs, recurring and one-time donations and video revenue tools. With version 2.0, the company says it&#8217;s bringing all these features together with a unified data structure, so that customers can see &#8220;who is paying for what content and where they came from&#8221; in one dashboard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Via email, co-founder and President Jason Bade (pictured above with Chen) pointed to &#8220;the power of our CRM to help creators understand their audience&#8221; as the most significant upgrade, suggesting that this &#8220;makes Pico the operating system for the creator economy.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2138791" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2138791" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2138791" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?w=680" alt="Pico" width="680" height="553" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=300,244 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=768,624 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=680,553 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=1536,1248 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=2048,1664 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/products_modal.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2138791" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pico</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;A creator can’t scale a business without the proper tools,&#8221; Bade continued. &#8220;Take email capture, that is the first step in audience development. But what next? You need data and a CRM to handle it. 2.0 upgrades every part of Pico to rearchitect it for the scalability and extensibility that the creator economy demands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pico also said it will be launching an API soon to support integrations with different parts of the platform.</p>
<p>Apparently, the company has seen its customer count increase nearly 5x in the past year, with customers including The Colorado Sun, Defector Media and The Generalist. And it recently recruited Rodolphe Ködderitzsch (who held a number of roles at YouTube, including global head of partner sales) as its chief revenue officer.</p>
<p>The new funding was led by Ann Lai at Bullpen Capital and brings Pico&#8217;s total funding to $10 million. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/stripe-and-precursor-lead-4-5m-seed-into-media-crm-startup-pico/">Other investors</a> include Precursor Ventures, Stripe, BloombergBeta and Village Global.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/orchard/">Orchard</a>, founded in 2017, was relatively early to the proptech industry. The company, originally called Perch, focused on dual-trackers, which are folks who are both buying and selling a home simultaneously. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/firstmark-capital/">FirstMark Capital</a> led both the Series A and the Series B funding rounds for Orchard, doubling down on the real estate platform.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, we&#8217;re absolutely thrilled to have FirstMark Capital Managing Partner Rick Heitzmann and Orchard CEO Court Cunningham join us on an upcoming episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>. The event takes place on <strong>May 5 at 3pm ET/noon PT</strong>. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-firstmark-capital-and-orchard">Register here.</a></p>
<p>Orchard has raised more than $350 million, including a $200 miilion+ debt financing. Alongside running a full brokerage company for dual-tracking home buyers and sellers, it also offers title and mortgage services. But what&#8217;s most interesting about the vertically integrated company is the innovation it&#8217;s doing around the consumer experience. Namely, Orchard is taking an entirely new approach to home searching, which has been incredibly stagnant despite the rush to digitize the process by major tech players.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Orchard allows consumers to get ML-driven recommendations based on homes they&#8217;ve already liked, and search by different rooms in the house. For example, perhaps the backyard or the kitchen is the most important part of the house &#8212; Orchard lets you default to that pic when browsing listings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rick Heitzmann founded FirstMark Capital all the way back in 2008. He&#8217;s led investments in companies including Pinterest, Airbnb, StubHub, Tapad, DraftKings, Riot Games, Ro, Discord, Carta and more.</p>
<p>On Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll talk more about what Heitzmann looks for in a founder, what he sees in Cunningham and the future of proptech, why Cunningham chose FirstMark and even take a walk through Orchard&#8217;s early pitch deck.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also look at pitch decks submitted by the audience, giving you the chance to hear directly from a founder and investor how they consume funding decks, what works and what doesn&#8217;t. If you want to submit your deck to be featured in a future episode of ECL, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">hit up this link</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s gonna be a blast.</p>
<p>As a reminder, anyone can attend Extra Crunch Live, but on-demand access to the content is reserved strictly for Extra Crunch members. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">You can join Extra Crunch here.</a></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In business today, many believe that consumer privacy and business results are mutually exclusive — to excel in one area is to lack in the other. Consumer privacy is seen by many in the technology industry as an area to be managed.</p>
<p>But the truth is, the companies who champion privacy will be better positioned to win in all areas. This is especially true as the digital industry continues to undergo tectonic shifts in privacy — both in government regulation and browser updates.</p>
<p>By the end of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">2022</a>, all major browsers will have phased out third-party cookies — the tracking codes placed on a visitor’s computer generated by another website other than your own. Additionally, mobile device makers are limiting identifiers allowed on their devices and applications. Across industry verticals, the global enterprise ecosystem now faces a critical moment in which digital advertising will be forever changed.</p>
<p>Up until now, consumers have enjoyed a mostly free internet experience, but as publishers adjust to a cookieless world, they could see more paywalls and less free content.</p>
<p>They may also see a decrease in the creation of new free apps, mobile gaming and other ad-supported content unless businesses find new ways to authenticate users and maintain a value exchange of free content for personalized advertising.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The truth is, the companies who champion privacy will be better positioned to win in all areas.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When consumers authenticate themselves to brands and sites, they create revenue streams for publishers as well as the opportunity to receive discounts, first-looks and other specially tailored experiences from brands.</p>
<p>To protect consumer data, companies need to architect internal systems around data custodianship versus acting from a sense of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/ccpa-wont-be-enough-to-fix-techs-data-entitlement-problem/">data entitlement</a>. While this is a challenging and massive ongoing evolution, the benefits of starting now are enormous.</p>
<p>Putting privacy front and center creates a sustainable digital ecosystem that enables better advertising and drives business results. There are four steps to consider when building for tomorrow’s privacy-centric world:</p>
<h2>Transparency is key</h2>
<p>As we collectively look to redesign how companies interact with and think about consumers, we should first recognize that putting people first means putting transparency first. When people trust a brand or publishers&#8217; intentions, they are more willing to share their data and identity.</p>
<p>This process, where consumers authenticate themselves — or actively share their phone number, email or other form of identity — in exchange for free content or another form of value, allows brands and publishers to get closer to them.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://dell.com">Dell</a> announced this afternoon that it&#8217;s spinning out <a href="http://vmware.com">VMware</a>, a move that has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/dells-debt-hangover-from-67b-emc-deal-could-put-vmware-stock-in-play/">suspected for some time</a>. Dell acquired VMware as part of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/">massive $58 billion EMC acquisition</a> (announced as $67 billion) in 2015.</p>
<p>The way that the deal works is that Dell plans to offer VMware shareholders a special dividend of between $11.5 and $12 billion. As Dell owns approximately 81% of those shares that would work out to somewhere between $9.3 and $9.7 billion coming into Dell&#8217;s coffers when the deal closes later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;By spinning off VMware, we expect to drive additional growth opportunities for Dell Technologies as well as VMware, and unlock significant value for stakeholders. Both companies will remain important partners, with a differentiated advantage in how we bring solutions to customers,&#8221; Dell CEO Michael Dell said in a statement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xU51XhBYOA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/">$67 billion Dell-EMC deal closes today</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;$67 billion Dell-EMC deal closes today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/embed/#?secret=xU51XhBYOA" data-secret="xU51XhBYOA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While there is a fair amount of CEO speak in that statement, it appears to mean that the move is mostly administrative as the companies will continue to work closely together, even after the spin-off is official. Dell will remain as chairman of both companies.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://investors.delltechnologies.com/static-files/09096f9a-3f71-4059-b7bb-8c38b6a25904">a presentation to investors</a>, the companies indicated that the plan to work together is more than lip service. There is a five-year deal commercial agreement in place with plans to revisit that deal each year thereafter. In addition, there is a plan to sell VMware products through the Dell sales team and for VMware to continue to work with Dell Financial Services. Finally, there is a formalized governance process in place related to achieving the commercial goals under the agreement, so it&#8217;s pretty firm that these companies will continue to work closely together at least for another five years.</p>
<p>For its part, VMware said in a <a href="https://ir.vmware.com/download/companies/vmware/Presentations/VMware%20and%20Dell%20Technologies%20Reach%20Agreement%20Regarding%20Spin-off.pdf">separate release</a> that the deal will allow it &#8220;increased freedom to execute its strategy, a simplified capital structure and governance model and additional strategic, operational and financial flexibility, while maintaining the strength of the two companies’ strategic partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dell shares are up more than 8% following the announcement. The company intends on using parts of its proceeds to deleverage, writing in a release that it will use &#8220;net proceeds to pay down debt, positioning the company well for Investment Grade ratings.&#8221; By that it means that Dell will reduce its net debt position and, it hopes, garner a stronger credit rating that will limit its future borrowing costs.</p>

<p>Even when it was part of EMC, VMware had a special status in that it operates as a separate entity with its own executive team and board of directors, and the stock has been sold separately as well.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close at the end of this year, but it has to clear a number of regulatory hurdles first. That includes garnering a favorable ruling from the IRS that the deal qualifies for a tax-free spin-off, which could prove to be a considerable hurdle for a deal like this.</p>
<p>The transaction is not a surprise. The company has been open about its intention to shake up its broader corporate structure. And with Dell bloated in debt terms and, perhaps, in product scope as well, the VMware deal could be an intelligent way forward. Dell investors are more excited about the transaction than VMware shareholders, with the latter company&#8217;s stock is up a more modest 1.4%.</p>
<p>VMware&#8217;s most recent earnings release notes that it had $4.715 billion in &#8220;total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.&#8221; Perhaps its shareholders aren&#8217;t enthused at the prospect of levering VMware&#8217;s balance sheet to help Dell do the opposite.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security lapse at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/mercato-raises-26m-series-a-to-help-smaller-grocers-compete-online/">online grocery delivery startup Mercato</a> exposed tens of thousands of customer orders, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>A person with knowledge of the incident told TechCrunch that the incident happened in January after one of the company&#8217;s cloud storage buckets, hosted on Amazon&#8217;s cloud, was left open and unprotected.</p>
<p>The company fixed the data spill, but has not yet alerted its customers.</p>
<p>Mercato was founded in 2015 and helps over a thousand smaller grocers and specialty food stores get online for pickup or delivery, without having to sign up for delivery services like Instacart or Amazon Fresh. Mercato operates in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, where the company is headquartered.</p>
<p>TechCrunch obtained a copy of the exposed data and verified a portion of the records by matching names and addresses against known existing accounts and public records. The data set contained more than 70,000 orders dating between September 2015 and November 2019, and included customer names and email addresses, home addresses and order details. Each record also had the user&#8217;s IP address of the device they used to place the order.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mercato raises $26M Series A to help smaller grocers compete online&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/mercato-raises-26m-series-a-to-help-smaller-grocers-compete-online/embed/#?secret=w1YDg8Mshf" data-secret="w1YDg8Mshf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The data set also included the personal data and order details of company executives.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how the security lapse happened since storage buckets on Amazon&#8217;s cloud are private by default, or when the company learned of the exposure.</p>
<p>Companies are required to disclose data breaches or security lapses to state attorneys-general, but no notices have been published where they are required by law, such as California. The data set had more than 1,800 residents in California, more than three times the number needed to trigger mandatory disclosure under the state&#8217;s data breach notification laws.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not known if Mercato disclosed the incident to investors ahead of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/mercato-raises-26m-series-a-to-help-smaller-grocers-compete-online/">its $26 million Series A raise</a> earlier this month. Velvet Sea Ventures, which led the round, did not respond to emails requesting comment.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mercato chief executive Bobby Brannigan confirmed the incident but declined to answer our questions, citing an ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are conducting a complete audit using a third party and will be contacting the individuals who have been affected. We are confident that no credit card data was accessed because we do not store those details on our servers. We will continually inform all authoritative bodies and stakeholders, including investors, regarding the findings of our audit and any steps needed to remedy this situation,&#8221; said Brannigan.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["We would go all in on a product and we'd build it and put blood, sweat and tears into it, and then I would kill it, and we'd move on to the next thing."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few years ago, founder Sean Lane thought he&#8217;d achieved product-market fit.</p>
<p>Speaking to attendees at TechCrunch&#8217;s Early Stage virtual event, Lane said Queue, a secure <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2015/12/16/electronic-check-in-for-hospitals-just-next-step.html">digital check-in</a> tablet for hospital waiting rooms that reduced wait times by uniting and correcting electronic medical records, was &#8220;selling like hotcakes.&#8221; But once Lane realized it would only ever address one piece of a much bigger market opportunity, he sold off the product, laid off two-thirds of the people affiliated with it and redirected the employees who were left.</p>
<p>Lane explained that what he really wanted to build is what his company &#8212; since renamed <a href="https://oliveai.com/">Olive</a> &#8212; has now become, a robotic process automation (RPA) company that takes on hospital workers&#8217; most tedious tasks so nurses and physicians can spend more time with patients.</p>
<p>Customers seem to like it. According to Lane, more than 600 hospitals use the service to assist employees with tasks like prior authorizations and patient verifications.</p>
<p>Investors clearly approve of what Olive is selling, too: Last year, the company raised three rounds of funding totaling roughly $380 million and valuing the company at $1.5 billion. According to Crunchbase, it&#8217;s raised a total of $456 million altogether.</p>
<p>In fact, VCs think so much of Lane that in February, they invested <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-columbus-ohio-insurtech-company-circulo-raises-50m-to-disrupt-medicaid-301231146.html">$50 million</a> in another company that Lane runs simultaneously called <a href="https://www.circulohealth.com/">Circulo</a>, a startup that describes itself as building the &#8220;Medicaid insurance company of the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, the path from point A to B was painful, and it might not have happened if Lane didn&#8217;t have a few things going for him, including a deeply personal reason to build something that could have greater impact on the U.S. healthcare system.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford will debut its new hands-free driving feature on the 2021 F-150 pickup truck and certain 2021 Mustang Mach-E models through a software update later this year, technology that the automaker developed to rival similar systems from Tesla and GM.</p>
<p>That hands-free capability — which uses cameras, radar sensors and software to provide a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane centering and speed-sign recognition — has undergone some 500,000 miles of development testing, Ford emphasized in its announcement and tweet from its CEO Jim Farley in a not-so-subtle dig at Tesla&#8217;s approach of rolling out beta software to customers. The system also has an in-cabin camera that monitors eye gaze and head position to help ensure the driver’s eyes remain on the road.</p>
<p>The hands-free system will be available on vehicles equipped with Ford&#8217;s Co-Pilot360 Technology and will only work on certain sections of divided highways. The system, which will be rolled out via software updates later this year, will initially be available on more than 100,000 miles of highways in North America.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BlueCruise! We tested it in the real world, so our customers don’t have to. <a href="https://t.co/dgqVkWH31r">pic.twitter.com/dgqVkWH31r</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Jim Farley (@jimfarley98) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimfarley98/status/1382323413826555904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The system does comes with a price. BlueCruise software, which includes a three-year service period, will cost $600. The price of upgrading the hardware will depend on the vehicle. For instance, F-150 owners will have to plunk down another $995 for the hardware, while owners of the &#8220;select&#8221; Mustang Mach-E model variant will have to pay an additional $2,600. BlueCruise comes standard on CA Route 1, Premium and First Edition variants of the Mustang Mach-E.</p>
<p>While nearly every automaker offers some driver assistance features, Ford is clearly aiming to compete with or capture market share away from GM and Tesla — the two companies with the best-known and capable ADAS. Convincing customers that its system is worth the expense will be critical to meeting its internal target of selling more than 100,000 vehicles equipped with BlueCruise in the first year, based on company sales and take-rate projections.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GM is working on a hands-off advanced driving system for city streets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/gm-is-working-on-a-hands-off-advanced-driving-system-for-city-streets/embed/#?secret=FMJPIbWgXm" data-secret="FMJPIbWgXm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>GM <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/gm-is-working-on-a-hands-off-advanced-driving-system-for-city-streets/">Super Cruise</a> uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they’re paying attention. Unlike Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot feature also combines sensors like cameras and radar, computing power and software. Autopilot, which comes standard in all new Tesla vehicles, will steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane. Tesla uses a torque sensor in the steering wheel to determine if drivers are paying attention, although many owners have found and publicly documented hacks so they can keep their hands off the wheels and eyes off the road ahead. Tesla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/tesla-has-increased-the-price-of-its-full-self-driving-option-to-10000/">charges $10,000 for its upgrade to FSD</a> (its own internal branding meant to stand for full self-driving). FSD is not an autonomous system. It does provide a number of more capable driver-assist functions, including automatic lane changes, the ability to recognize and act upon traffic lights and stop signs and a navigation feature that will suggest lane changes en route and automatically steer the vehicle toward highway interchanges and exits.</p>
<p>Ford said that its system communicates with drivers in different ways, including displaying text and blue lighting cues in the instrument cluster, which it says is effective even for those with color blindness.</p>
<p>The so-called BlueCruise hands-free technology will be offered in other Ford vehicle models in the future, the company said. Drivers who opt for the technology will continue to receive software updates as it is improved. Ford said future improvements will include a feature that will let the vehicle change lanes by tapping the turn signal indicator as well as one that will predict and then adjust vehicle speed for roundabouts and curves. The company also said it plans to offer regular mapping updates.</p>
