					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Our thanks to everyone who wrote in this week about the format changes to the newsletter! Feedback largely sorted into two themes: Some people really like the more narrative format, and some folks really want a more link-list styled missive. What follows is an attempt to balance both perspectives.</p>
<p>Starting today we’ll <strong>bold</strong> company names, so that you can more quickly pick out startups, add more bulleted points to sections, and, per a different piece of feedback, include more regular descriptors of companies that are not household names.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That said, we’re not going to abandon chatting with you every day, as TechCrunch is nothing if not full of things to say. So here’s a blend of what the new, updated Daily Crunch team had in mind, and your notes. A big thanks to everyone who wrote in!</p>

<h2>A mega-exit for American fintech</h2>
<p>The news that public fintech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">Bill.com will buy <strong>Divvy</strong></a>, a Utah-based startup that helps small and midsized businesses manage their spend, was perhaps the biggest startup story of the week. Breaking late Thursday, the $2.5 billion transaction was long expected. Divvy had raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/divvy-7ad9/company_financials">more than $400 million</a> from <strong>PayPal Ventures</strong>, <strong>New Enterprise Associates</strong>, <strong>Insight Partners</strong> and <strong>Pelion Venture Partners</strong>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch covered the impending sale, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/brex-ramp-tout-their-view-of-the-future-as-divvy-is-said-to-consider-a-sale-to-bill-com/">rumors of which sprung up</a> before Bill.com reported its Q1 earnings. To see the company drop the news at the same time as its earnings was not a surprise. For the burgeoning corporate payment space (more here on startups in the space like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/"><strong>Ramp</strong></a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/as-corporate-cards-are-subsumed-into-software-airbase-posts-rapid-growth/"><strong>Airbase</strong></a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/"><strong>Brex</strong></a>).</p>
<p>I got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">to noodle</a> on the financial results that Bill.com detailed regarding Divvy &#8212; they are pretty key metrics to help us value the startups that are competing to go public or find a similarly feathered corporate nest. In short, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/ramp-looks-to-raise-more-capital-as-the-corporate-spend-market-mints-unicorns/">corporate spend startup cohort</a> is doing great. It’s even spawning new startups like Latin American-focused <strong>Clara</strong>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">raised $3.5 million earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Broadly, the fintech market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/fintech-startups-set-vc-records-as-the-2021-fundraising-market-continues-to-impress/">had a huge Q1</a> and is blasting its way toward a record venture capital year, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">AI startups</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-vc-soars-in-q1/">the rest of the VC world</a>.</p>
<h2>Startups and venture capital</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/startup-employees-should-pay-attention-to-bidens-capital-gains-tax-plans/">Startup employees should pay attention to Biden’s capital gains tax plans</a> &#8212; Vieje Piauwasdy, a director at <strong>Secfi</strong>, a company working to help startup employees manage equity, has notes on the current political climate in a key startup market, the United States.</li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/youibot-funding/">SoftBank leads $15M round for China’s industrial robot maker Youibot</a> &#8212; Well-known Japanese conglomerate <strong>SoftBank’s</strong> Asian venture group is putting $15 million into <strong>Youibot</strong>, a Chinese startup that builds “autonomous mobile robots,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ritacyliao">Rita</a> reports.</li>

</ul>
<h2>5 investors discuss the future of RPA after UiPath&#8217;s IPO</h2>
<p>Much ink (erm, pixels) has been spilled about robotic process automation (RPA) recently, particularly in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/"><strong>UiPath’s</strong> IPO last month</a>.</p>
<p>But while some of the individuals <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller">Ron</a> interviewed about the future of RPA believe the technology is in its “early infancy,” the pandemic increased attention toward things we can let robots handle for us. And it’s hard to argue that repetitive tasks like billing and spreadsheeting and paper-pushing should <em>not</em> be outsourced to robots.</p>
<p>“RPA allows companies to automate a group of highly mundane tasks and have a machine do the work instead of a human,” Ron writes. “Think of finding an invoice amount in an email, placing the figure in a spreadsheet and sending a <strong>Slack</strong> message to accounts payable. You could have humans do that, or you could do it more quickly and efficiently with a machine. We’re talking mind-numbing work that is well suited to automation.”</p>
<p>Although RPA is the fastest-growing category in enterprise software, the market remains surprisingly small. Ron spoke to five investors about where the sector is headed, where there are opportunities and the biggest threats to the RPA startup ecosystem.</p>

<h2>The tech giants</h2>
<p>It was a quieter day from the tech giants, who made plenty of news earlier in the week. The good news is that their relative calm means we can take a look at news from other Big Tech companies, those that don’t quite crack the $1 trillion market cap threshold yet:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What Tesla CEO Elon Musk says publicly about the company&#8217;s progress on a fully autonomous driving system doesn&#8217;t match up with &#8220;engineering reality,&#8221; according to a memo that summarizes a meeting between California regulators and employees at the automaker.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The memo, which <a href="https://www.plainsite.org/documents/28jcs0/california-dmv-tesla-robotaxi--fsd-notes/">transparency site Plainsite</a> obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request and subsequently released, shows that Musk has inflated the capabilities of the Autopilot advanced driver assistance system in Tesla vehicles, as well the company&#8217;s ability to deliver fully autonomous features by the end of the year. </span></p>
<p>Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system branded as Autopilot. For an additional $10,000, owners can buy &#8220;full self-driving,&#8221; or FSD — a feature that Musk promises will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities. FSD, which has steadily increased in price and capability, has been available as an option for years. However, Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. FSD includes the parking feature Summon as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes. Once drivers enter a destination into the navigation system, they can enable &#8220;Navigate on Autopilot&#8221; for that trip.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla vehicles are far from reaching that level of autonomy, a fact confirmed by statements made by the company&#8217;s director of Autopilot software CJ Moore to California regulators, the memo shows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elon&#8217;s tweet does not match engineering reality per CJ,&#8221; according to the memo summarizing the conversation between regulators with the California Department of Motor Vehicles&#8217; autonomous vehicles branch and four Tesla employees, including Moore.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rdLaDFXvL4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/teslas-decision-to-scrap-its-pr-department-could-create-a-pr-nightmare/">Tesla&#8217;s decision to scrap its PR department could create a PR nightmare</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tesla&#8217;s decision to scrap its PR department could create a PR nightmare&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/teslas-decision-to-scrap-its-pr-department-could-create-a-pr-nightmare/embed/#?secret=rdLaDFXvL4" data-secret="rdLaDFXvL4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The memo, which was written by California DMV&#8217;s Miguel Acosta, states that Moore described Autopilot — and the new features being tested — as a Level 2 system. That description matters in the world of automated driving.</p>
<p>There are five levels of automation under standards created by SAE International. Level 2 means two primary functions — like adaptive cruise and lane keeping — are automated and still have a human driver in the loop at all times. Level 2 is an advanced driver assistance system, and has become increasingly available in new vehicles, including those produced by Tesla, GM, Volvo and Mercedes. Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot and its more capable FSD were considered the most advanced systems available to consumers. However, other automakers have started to catch up.</p>
<p>Level 4 means the vehicle can handle all aspects of driving in <em>certain</em> conditions without human intervention and is what companies like Argo AI, Aurora, Cruise, Motional, Waymo and Zoox are working on. Level 5, which is widely viewed as a distant goal, would handle all driving in all environments and conditions.</p>
<p>Here is an important bit via Acosta&#8217;s summarization:</p>
<blockquote><p>DMV asked CJ to address from an engineering perspective, Elon’s messaging about L5 capability by the end of the year. Elon’s tweet does not match <span class="">engineering reality per CJ. </span>Tesla is at Level 2 currently. The ratio of driver interaction would need to be in the magnitude of 1 or 2 million miles per driver interaction to move into higher levels of automation. Tesla indicated that Elon is extrapolating on the rates of improvement when speaking about L5 capabilities. Tesla couldn’t say if the rate of improvement would make it to L5 by end of calendar year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Portions of this commentary were redacted. However, Plainsite was able to copy and paste the redacted part, which shows up as white space on a PDF, into another document.</p>
<p>The comments in the memo are contrary to what Musk has said repeatedly in the public sphere.</p>
<p>Musk is frequently asked on Twitter and in quarterly earnings calls for progress reports on FSD, including questions about when it will be rolled out via software updates to owners who have purchased the option. In a January earnings call, Musk said he was &#8220;highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of a human this year.&#8221; In April 2021, during the company&#8217;s first quarter earnings call, Musk said &#8220;it&#8217;s really quite, quite tricky. But I am highly confident that we will get this done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The memo released this week provided other insights into Tesla&#8217;s push to test and eventually unlock greater levels of autonomy, including the number of vehicles testing a beta version of &#8220;Navigate on Autopilot on City Streets,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a feature that is meant to handle driving in urban areas and not just highways. Regulators also asked the Tesla employees if and how participants were being trained to test this feature, and how the sales team ensures that messaging about the vehicle capabilities and limitations are communicated.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aRQr9jmJdO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/what-is-up-with-teslas-value/">What is up with Tesla&#8217;s value?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What is up with Tesla&#8217;s value?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/what-is-up-with-teslas-value/embed/#?secret=aRQr9jmJdO" data-secret="aRQr9jmJdO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As of the March meeting, there were 824 vehicles in a pilot program testing a beta version of &#8220;city streets.&#8221;  About 750 of those vehicles were being driven by employees and 71 by non-employees. </span>Pilot participants are located across 37 states, with the majority of participants in California. As of March 2021, pilot participants have driven more than 153,000 miles using the City Streets feature, the memo states. The memo noted that Tesla planned to expand this pool of participants to approximately 1,600 later that month.</p>
<p>Tesla told the DMV that it is working on developing a video for the participants and that the next group of participants will include referrals from existing participants. &#8220;The new participants will be vetted by Tesla by looking at insurance telematics based on the VINs registered to that participant,&#8221; according to the memo.</p>
<p>Tesla also told the DMV that it is able to track when there are failures or when the feature is deactivated. Moore described these as &#8220;disengagements,&#8221; a term also used by companies testing and developing autonomous vehicle technology. The primary difference worth noting here is that these companies only use employees who are trained safety drivers, not the public.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. <i data-stringify-type="italic">Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up<a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"> here</a>.</i></em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<h2>Betting on upcoming startup markets</h2>
<p>This week <a href="https://m25vc.com/">M25</a>, a venture capital concern focused on investing in the Midwest of the United States, announced a new fund worth $31.8 million. As the firm noted in a release that The Exchange reviewed, its new fund is about three times the size of its preceding investment vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I caught up with M25 partner <a href="https://twitter.com/DMikeAsem">Mike Asem</a> to chat about the round. Asem joined M25 in 2016 after partner <a href="https://twitter.com/lalayak">Victor Gutwein</a> spearheaded the effort with a small $1 million fund. Asem and Gutwein have led the firm since its first material, if technically second fund.</p>
<p>Asem said that his team had targeted a $25 million to $30 million fund three, meaning that they came in a bit higher than anticipated in fundraising terms. That’s not a surprise in today&#8217;s venture capital market, given the pace at which capital is both invested into VC funds and startups.</p>
<p>The investor told The Exchange that M25 has been investing out of its third fund for some time, including <a href="https://www.getcashdrop.com/">CASHDROP</a>, a startup that I’ve heard good things about regarding its growth rate. (More <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/a-mobile-storefront-in-under-15-minutes-cashdrops-platform-secures-2-7m-in-seed-funding/">here</a> on the CASHDROP round that M25 put capital into.)</p>
<p>All that’s fine, but what makes M25 an interesting bet is that the firm <em>only</em> invests in Midwest-headquartered startups. Often when I chat to a fund that has a unique geographical focus, it’s merely that, a focus. As opposed to M25’s more hard-and-fast rule. Now with more capital and plans to take part in 12-15 deals per year, the group can double down on its thesis.</p>
<p>Per Asem, M25 has done about a third of its deals in Chicago, where it’s based, but has put capital into startups in 24 cities thus far. TechCrunch covered one of those companies, <a href="https://metafy.gg/">Metafy</a>, earlier this week when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/metafy-adds-5-5m-to-its-seed-round-as-the-market-for-games-coaching-grows/">closed more than $5 million in new capital</a>.</p>
<p>Why does M25 think that the Midwest is the place to deploy capital and generate outsize returns? Asem listed a number of perspectives that underpin his team’s thesis: The Midwest’s economic might, the network that his partner and him developed in the area before founding M25, and the fact that valuations can prove to be more attractive in the region at the stage that his firm invests. They are sufficiently different, he said, that his firm can generate material returns even with exits at around the $100 million mark, a lower threshold than most VCs with larger capital vehicles might find palatable.</p>
<p>M25 is not alone in its bets on alternative regions. The Exchange also chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/somakc?lang=en">Somak Chattopadhyay</a> of <a href="https://www.armorysv.com/">Armory Square Ventures</a> on Friday, a firm that is based in upstate New York and invests in B2B software companies in what we might call post-manufacturing cities. One of its investments has gone public, and the group’s latest fund is a multiple of the size of its first. Armory now has around $60 million in AUM.</p>
<p>All that’s to say that the venture capital boom is not merely helping firms like a16z raise another billion here, or another billion there. But the generally hot market for startups and private capital is helping even smaller firms raise more capital to take on less traditional spaces. It’s heartening.</p>
<h2>On-demand pricing, and grokking the insurance game</h2>
<p>This week The Exchange chatted with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khozema-shipchandler">Twilio CFO Khozema Shipchandler</a> about his company’s earnings report. You can read more on the hard numbers <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/twilio-earnings-are-still-trouncing-its-own-expectations-but-this-time-the-stock-isnt-playing-along-11620246273">here</a>. The short gist is that it was a good quarter. But what mattered most in our chat was Shipchandler riffing on where the center of gravity at Twilio will remain in <em>revenue</em> terms.</p>
<p>Briefly, Twilio is best known for building APIs that allow developers to leverage telecom services. Those developers and their employers pay for as much Twilio as they used. But over time Twilio has bought more and more companies, building out a diverse product set after its 2016-era IPO.</p>
<p>So we were curious: Where does the company stand on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/the-future-of-saas-is-on-demand-use-experts-to-drive-growth-and-engagement/">on-demand versus SaaS pricing debate that is currently raging</a> in the software world? Staunchly in the first camp, still, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">despite buying Segment</a>, which is a SaaS service. Per Shipchandler, Twilio revenue is still more than 70% on-demand, and the company wants to make sure that its customers only buy more of its services as they sell more of their own.</p>
<p>Startups, then, probably don’t have to give up on on-demand pricing as they scale. Twilio is huge and is sticking to it!</p>
<p>Then there was Root’s earnings report. Again, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/root-inc-announces-2021-first-211200537.html">here</a> are the core numbers. The Exchange is keeping tabs on Root&#8217;s post-IPO performance not only because it was a company we tracked extensively during its late private life, but also because it is a bellwether of sorts for the yet-private, neoinsurane companies. Which matters for fellow neoinsurance player Hippo, as it is going public via a SPAC.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-timm-b2371a16/">Alex Timm,</a> Root’s CEO, said that his firm performed well in the first quarter, generating more direct written premium than anticipated, and at better loss-rates to boot. The company also remains very cash-rich post IPO, and Timm is confident that his company’s data science work has lots more room to improve Root’s underwriting models.</p>
<p>So, faster-than-expected growth, lots of cash, improving economics and a bullish technology take &#8212; Root’s stock is flying, right? No, it is not. Instead Root has taken a bit of a public-market pounding in recent months. The Exchange asked Timm about the disparity between how he views his company’s performance and future, and how it is being valued. He said that the insurance folks don’t always get its technology work and that tech folks don’t always grok Root’s insurance business.</p>
<p>That’s tough. But with years and years of cash at its current burn rate, Root has more than enough space to prove its critics wrong, provided that its modeling holds up over the next dozen quarters or so. Its share price can’t be <em>great</em> for the yet-private neoinsurance companies, however. Even if <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/next-insurance-raises-250m-doubling-its-valuation-to-4b-in-under-a-year/">Next Insurance did just raise another grip of cash</a> at another new, higher valuation.</p>
<h2>Corporate spend’s big week</h2>
<p>As you’ve read by now, Bill.com is buying corporate-spend unicorn Divvy for $2.5 billion. I dug into the numbers behind the deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">here</a>, if that’s your sort of thing.</p>
<p>But after collecting notes from the CEOs of Divvy competitors Ramp and Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/brex-ramp-tout-their-view-of-the-future-as-divvy-is-said-to-consider-a-sale-to-bill-com/">here</a>, another bit of commentary came in that I wanted to share. <a href="https://twitter.com/thejo?lang=en">Thejo Kote</a>, the corporate spend startup <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase’s</a> CEO and founder did some math on Divvy’s results that Bill.com shared with its own investors, arguing that the company’s March payment volume and active customer account implies that the company’s “average spend volume per customer was $44,400 per month.”</p>
<p>Is that good or bad? Kote is not impressed, saying that Airbase’s “average spend volume per customer is almost 10 [times] that of Divvy,” or around “$375,000 per month.” What’s driving that difference? A focus on larger customers, and the fact that Airbase covers more ground, in Kote’s view, than Divvy by encompassing software work that Bill.com itself and Expensify manage.</p>
<p>I bring you all of this as the war in managing spend for companies large and small is heating up in software terms. With Divvy off the table, Ramp is now perhaps the largest player in the space not charging for the software it wraps around corporate cards. Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/">recently launched</a> a software product that it charges for on a recurring basis. (More on Brex at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/how-brex-more-than-doubled-its-valuation-in-a-year/">this link</a>, if you are into it.)</p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>Two final notes for you, things that should make you either laugh, grimace, or howl:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/eliotwb/status/1389266357489831937">Wall Street Journal’s Eliot Brown tweeted</a> some data this week from <a href="https://t.co/XFdfrG79OD?amp=1">the Financial Times</a>, namely that amongst the roughly 40 SPACs that completed deals last year, a dozen and a half have lost more than half their value. And that the average drop amongst the combined entities is 38%. Woof.</li>
<li>And, finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/conorsen/status/1389578287685451778">welcome to peak everything</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>More to come next week, </strong>including notes on the return of the Kaltura and Procore IPOs, and whatever it is we can suss out from the Krispy Kreme S-1 filing, as donuts are life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic has just pushed edtech mainstream, but language-learning startup Duolingo had already spent the past decade figuring out how to build a successful edtech app.</p>
<p>In our latest installment of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec-1/">the EC-1 series</a>, Natasha Mascarenhas goes deep with the company to understand how it found product-market fit, then figured out how to grow like a consumer tech startup and monetize like a SaaS startup.

<p>If there has ever been a golden age for fintech, it surely must be now.</p>
<p>As of Q1 2021, the number of fintech startups in the U.S. crossed 10,000 for the first time ever — well more than double that if you include EMEA and APAC. There are now three fintech companies worth more than $100 billion (Paypal, Square and Shopify) with another three in the $50 billion-$100 billion club (Stripe, Adyen and Coinbase).</p>
<p>Yet, as fintech companies have begun to go public, there has been a fair amount of uncertainty as to how these companies will be valued on the public markets. This is a result of fintechs being relatively new to the IPO scene compared to their consumer internet or enterprise software counterparts. Furthermore, fintechs employ a wide variety of business models: Some are transactional, while others are recurring or have hybrid business models.</p>
<p>And fintechs now have a multitude of options in terms of how they choose to go public. They can take the traditional IPO route, pursue a direct listing or merge with a SPAC. Given the multitude of variables at play, valuing these companies and then predicting public market performance is anything but straightforward.</p>

<p>Many fintech startups have tried to become a market-maker between investors and investment opportunities.</p>
<p>However, the challenge with this two-sided market is: How do you get the investors to show up?</p>
<p>It’s hard enough to get retail investors, but family offices and other large check writers are even more challenging to lure.</p>

<p>With an increasing number of enterprise systems, growing teams, a rising proliferation of the web and multiple digital initiatives, companies of all sizes are creating loads of data every day.</p>
<p>This data contains excellent business insights and immense opportunities, but it has become impossible for companies to derive actionable insights from this data consistently due to its sheer volume.</p>
<p>The analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) market is expected to grow to $101.29 billion by 2026. Organizations that have not started on their analytics journey or are spending scarce data engineer resources to resolve issues with analytics implementations are not identifying actionable data insights.</p>
<p>Through AaaS, managed services providers (MSPs) can help organizations get started on their analytics journey immediately without extravagant capital investment.</p>
<p>MSPs can take ownership of the company’s immediate data analytics needs, resolve ongoing challenges, and integrate new data sources to manage dashboard visualizations, reporting and predictive modeling — enabling companies to make data-driven decisions every day.</p>

<p>Flywire, a Boston-based magnet for venture capital, filed to go public Monday.</p>
<p>Flywire is a global payments company that attracted more than $300 million as a startup, according to Crunchbase, most recently raising a $60 million Series F last month. We don’t have its most recent valuation, but PitchBook data indicates that the company’s February 2020, $120 million round valued Flywire at $1 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>So what we’re looking at here is a fintech unicorn IPO. A great way to kick off the week, to be honest, though we thought that Robinhood would be the next such debut.</p>
<p>Fintech venture capital activity has been hot lately, which makes the Flywire IPO interesting. Its success or failure could dictate the pace of fintech exits and fintech startup valuations in general, so we have to care about it.</p>
<p>First, what does Flywire do and with whom does it compete? Then, a closer look at its financial results as we hope to get our hands around its revenue quality, aggregate economics and growth prospects.</p>
<p>After that, we’ll discuss valuations and which venture capital groups are set to do well in its flotation.</p>

<p>If it feels like IPO news slowed for a few weeks at the start of the second quarter, your gut is correct. Investors previously told The Exchange that the first, third and fourth quarters of 2021 would be hot periods for public debuts, but that Q2 would be slower. Their argument revolved around reporting cadences and how long it takes for certain periods of accounting work to be completed.</p>
<p>So we weren’t surprised when the second quarter’s IPO cycle began to feel a bit soft compared to the rapid-fire first quarter. And, as we’ve all heard in recent days, the great SPAC rush is slowing.</p>
<p>But that hasn’t stopped a number of firms from defying expectations and going public all the same.</p>

<p>SAP CEO Christian Klein was appointed co-CEO with Jennifer Morgan in October 2019. He became sole CEO just as the pandemic was hitting full force across the world last April.</p>
<p>He was put in charge of a storied company at 39 years old. By October, its stock price was down and revenue projections for the coming years were flat.</p>
<p>That is definitely not the way any CEO wants to start their tenure, but the pandemic forced Klein to make some decisions to move his customers to the cloud faster. That, in turn, had an impact on revenue until the transition was completed. While it makes sense to make this move now, investors weren’t happy with the news.</p>
<p>There was also the decision to spin out Qualtrics, the company his predecessor acquired for $8 billion in 2018. As he looked back on the one-year mark, Klein sat down with TechCrunch to discuss all that has happened and the unique set of challenges he faced.</p>

<p>Domm Holland, co-founder and CEO of e-commerce startup Fast, appears to be living a founder’s dream.</p>
<p>His big idea came from a small moment in his real life. Holland watched as his wife’s grandmother tried to order groceries, but she had forgotten her password and wasn’t able to complete the transaction.</p>
<p>He built a prototype of a passwordless authentication system where users would fill out their information once and would never need to do so again. Within 24 hours, tens of thousands of people had used it.</p>
<p>Shoppers weren’t the only ones on board with this idea. In less than two years, Holland has raised $124 million in three rounds of fundraising, bringing on partners like Index Ventures and Stripe.</p>
<p>Although the success of Fast’s one-click checkout product has been speedy, it hasn’t been effortless.</p>
<p>For one thing, Holland is Australian, which means he started out as a Silicon Valley outsider.</p>
<p>Holland talks about how he built his network, why it’s important — not just for fundraising but for building the entire business — and how to avoid the mistakes he sees new founders make.</p>

<p>It’s only been three years since they hit the streets, but Revel’s blue electric mopeds have already become a common sight in New York, San Francisco and a growing number of U.S. cities.</p>
<p>However, Revel founder and CEO Frank Reig set his sights far beyond building a shared moped service.</p>
<p>In fact, since the beginning of 2021, Revel has launched an e-bike subscription service, an EV charging station venture and an all-electric rideshare service driven by a fleet of 50 Teslas.</p>

<p>Divvy, a Utah-based corporate spend unicorn, is considering selling itself to Bill.com for a price that could top $2 billion. For the fintech sector, it’s big news.</p>
<p>Corporate spend startups including Ramp and Brex are raising rapid-fire rounds at ever-higher valuations and growing at venture-ready cadences. Their growth and the resulting private investment were earned by a popular approach to offering corporate cards, and, increasingly, the group’s ability to build software around those cards that took into account a greater portion of the functionality that companies needed to track expenses, manage spend access and, perhaps, save money.</p>
<p>It makes sense to see Bill.com decide to take on the yet-private corporate spend startups that are playing the field; why not absorb a growing customer base and fend off competition in a single move?</p>
<p>To get a better handle on how the startups that compete with Divvy feel about the deal, TechCrunch reached out to both Ramp CEO Eric Glyman, and Brex CEO Henrique Dubugras.</p>

<p>It’s an entrepreneur’s market in digital health today, with startups raising record-breaking funding at soaring valuations and debuting on public markets to eager investors.</p>
<p>The massive influx of capital to healthcare should not be surprising; the pandemic has made it starkly clear that digital health is the future of healthcare.</p>
<p>To that end, we should anticipate additional healthcare exits worth more than $1 billion in the near term. Which again, is great for entrepreneurs — as long as they understand how hard it is to build a unicorn in healthcare. Today, becoming a unicorn requires founders who are long on vision and operational experience.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, lots of investors jumped in to invest in digital health for the first time. But we’ve been investing for more than a decade.</p>

<h2>One CMO’s honest take on the modern chief marketing role</h2>

<p>There’s no shortage of commentary around the chief marketing officer title these days, and certainly no lack of opinions about the role’s responsibilities and meaning within a company.</p>
<p>There’s a reason for that. CMO is the shortest tenured C-suite role — the average tenure of a CMO is the lowest of all C-suite titles at 3.5 years.</p>
<p>That’s because the chief marketing officer’s role is increasingly complex. Qualifications require broad, strategic thinking while also maintaining tactical acumen across several functions. There’s a big disparity in what companies expect from CMOs. Some want a strategist with an eye for go-to-market planning, while others want a focus on close alignment with sales in addition to brand awareness, content strategy and lead generation.</p>
<p>Other companies want their CMO to emphasize product marketing and management. Ask 10 CMOs how they define their role and you’ll get 10 different answers.</p>
<p>Here, a tenured CMO shares his honest take on what the role actually means, plus the key attributes of today’s modern CMO.</p>

<p>People have been discussing the importance of expanding opportunities for women in venture capital and startup entrepreneurship for decades. And for some time it appeared that progress was being made in building a more diverse and equitable environment.</p>
<p>The prospect of more women writing checks was viewed as a positive for female founders, a cohort that has struggled to attract more than a fraction of the funds that their male peers manage. All-female teams have an especially tough time raising capital compared to all-male teams, underscoring the disparity.</p>
<p>Then COVID-19 arrived and scrambled the venture and startup scene, creating a risk-off environment during the end of Q1 and the start of Q2 2020. Following that, the venture world went into overdrive as software sales became a safe harbor in the business world during uncertain economic times. And when it became clear that the vaunted digital transformation of businesses large and small was accelerating, more capital appeared.</p>
<p>But data indicate that the torrent of new capital has not been distributed equally — indeed, some of the progress that female founders made in recent years may have eroded.</p>

<p>When it comes to acquiring or merging a business with another, it’s imperative that decision-makers know why they’re pursuing a deal and its potential impact on the company, good and bad.</p>
<p>Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) may indeed be the best route to success, but there’s a lot of room for problems, and many leaders underestimate the role in-house legal teams can play in mitigating these problems and facilitating progress until they’re locked into a deal.</p>
<p>And that’s when issues become much more difficult to resolve and plans unravel.</p>
<p>While a CEO and board might fully appreciate in-house counsel, it’s equally important the team is supported across a company — from marketing to product development — in order to ensure an efficient closing and successful integration. The best way to do that is by bringing in-house counsel into the process early and often.</p>

<p>The number of SPACs in the deep tech sector was skyrocketing, but a combination of increased SEC scrutiny and market forces over the past few weeks has slowed the pace of new SPAC transactions.</p>
<p>The correction is an inevitable step on the path to mainstreaming SPACs as an alternative to IPOs, but it won’t cause them to go away.</p>
<p>Instead, blank-check vehicles will evolve and will occupy a small and specialized — but important — part of the startup financing landscape.</p>

<p>Uber followed Lyft in reporting its Q1 2021 earnings this week. And like its rival, its results take a little bit of work to understand.</p>
<p>We parsed them as a pair so that we understand what’s going on at the ride-hailing and food-delivery giant.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the big numbers: Uber’s revenue missed sharply, while its profitability beat expectations.</p>
<p>How did investors vet Uber’s performance? The company’s stock is off around 4% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Surprised by the revenue miss? Shocked by the profit beat? Startled by the sharp drop in the value of Uber’s stock? Let’s unpack the numbers.</p>

<p>As the COVID-19 lockdowns cascaded around the world last spring, companies large and small saw demand slow to a halt seemingly overnight. Enterprises weren’t comfortable making big, long-term commitments when they had no clue what the future would hold.</p>
<p>Innovative SaaS companies responded quickly by making their products available for free or at a steep discount to boost demand.</p>
<p>But these free offerings didn’t go away as lockdowns loosened up. SaaS companies instead doubled down on freemium because they realized that doing so had a real and positive impact on their business. In doing so, they busted the outdated myths that have held 82% of SaaS companies back from offering their own free plan.</p>

<p>Shortening the diagnostic odyssey of rare diseases and reducing the associated costs was, until recently, a moonshot challenge, but is now within reach.</p>
<p>About 80% of rare diseases are genetic, and technology and AI advances are combining to make genetic testing widely accessible.</p>
<p>Whole-genome sequencing, an advanced genetic test that allows us to examine the entire human DNA, now costs under $1,000, and market leader Illumina is targeting a $100 genome in the near future.</p>

<p>As expected, Bill.com is buying Divvy, the Utah-based corporate spend management startup that competes with Brex, Ramp and Airbase. The total purchase price of around $2.5 billion is substantially above the company’s roughly $1.6 billion post-money valuation that Divvy set during its $165 million, January 2021 funding round.</p>
<p>Per Bill.com, the transaction includes $625 million in cash, with the rest of the consideration coming in the form of stock in Divvy’s new parent company.</p>
<p>Bill.com also reported its quarterly results: Its Q1 included revenues of $59.7 million, above expectations of $54.63 million. The company’s adjusted loss per share of $0.02 also exceeded expectations, with the street expecting a sharper $0.07 per share deficit.</p>
<p>The better-than-anticipated results and the acquisition news combined to boost the value of Bill.com by more than 13% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, Bill.com released a deck that provides a number of financial metrics relating to its purchase of Divvy. This will not only allow us to better understand the value of the unicorn at exit, but also its competitors, against which we now have a set of metrics to bring to bear.</p>
<p>Let’s unpack the deal to gain a better understanding of the huge exit and the value of Divvy’s richly funded competitors.</p>

<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) has certainly been getting a lot of attention in the last year, with startups, acquisitions and IPOs all coming together in a flurry of market activity. It all seemed to culminate with UiPath’s IPO last month. The company that appeared to come out of nowhere in 2017 eventually had a final private valuation of $35 billion. It then had the audacity to match that at its IPO. A few weeks later, it still has a market cap of over $38 billion in spite of the stock price fluctuating at points.</p>
<p>Was this some kind of peak for the technology or a flash in the pan? Probably not. While it all seemed to come together in the last year with a big increase in attention to automation in general during the pandemic, it’s a market category that has been around for some time.</p>
<p>RPA allows companies to automate a group of highly mundane tasks and have a machine do the work instead of a human. Think of finding an invoice amount in an email, placing the figure in a spreadsheet and sending a Slack message to Accounts Payable. You could have humans do that, or you could do it more quickly and efficiently with a machine. We’re talking mind-numbing work that is well suited to automation.</p>

<p>Built for Mars CEO Peter Ramsey tears down Twitch’s UX, asking how Twitch rakes in cash and the psychology used within its app to encourage users to keep spending.</p>
<p>Ramsey describes Twitch’s protocol of asking users if they want to subscribe to a streamer before seeing their stream “unnecessarily boolean,” which would be a great band name.</p>
<p>But that’s neither here nor there. Ramsey notes: “Often it’s at the point of clicking, not the final stage of a process, meaning the user decides to buy the item when they click ‘check out now,’ not when they’ve entered their card details and click ‘complete purchase.’<br />
Ramsey argues Twitch shouldn’t make users choose between doing nothing and subscribing: “Instead, if they changed the text to, say, “learn more,” the user could click it without having to internalize the decision.”</p>

<p>In non-aerobatic fixed-wing aviation, spins are an emergency. If you don’t have spin recovery training, you can easily make things worse, dramatically increasing your chances of crashing. Despite the life-and-death consequences, licensed amateur pilots in the United States are not required to train for this. Uncontrolled spins don’t happen often enough to warrant the training.</p>
<p>Startups can enter the equivalent of a spin as well. My startup, Kolide, entered a dangerous spin in early 2018, only a year after our Series A fundraise. We had little traction and we were quickly burning through our sizable cash reserves. We were spinning out of control, certain to hit the ground in no time.</p>
<p>All spins start with a stall — a reduction in lift when either the aircraft is flying too slowly or the nose is pointed too high. In Kolide’s case, we were doing both.</p>
<p>Kolide had a lot going for it that enabled me to recover the company, but by far the most important was that we recognized we were in a spin very early, and we had enough cash remaining (and therefore sufficient time) to execute a recovery plan.</p>

<p>Shares of Square are up more than 6% after the American fintech company reported a staggering $5.06 billion in revenue in its Q1 2021 earnings report, far ahead of an expected tally of $3.36 billion.</p>
<p>By posting the huge revenue beat, Square grew 266% compared to its year-ago Q1. Because that’s the sort of growth that we generally expect to see from early-stage startups instead of maturing public companies, some exploration is in order. In short, bitcoin revenues from Square, and how they fit into its accounting, are responsible for much of its outsized growth.</p>
<p>And that’s something we need to talk about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Long-running German audio company Sennheiser<a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/newsroom/sonova-acquires-sennheiser-consumer-business-wpc768"> today announced</a> that it has found a buyer for its consumer brand. Swiss holding company Sonova &#8212; a giant in the hearing aid business &#8212; will be acquiring the brand in a deal expected to close by end of year.</p>
<p>The deal will bring headphones and sound bars to Sonova’s existing portfolio, which is largely centered around healthcare products. Among other things, however, the deal could have interesting implications for the so-called hearables category, which can walk the line between headphones and healthcare products. Sennheiser, meanwhile, will shift the entirety of its focus to its pro products.</p>
<p>The company has been fairly open about its intentions. In February, <a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/newsroom/sennheiser-to-reposition-its-business-units-independently-of-each-other-s5jh2n">it publicly announced</a> that it was seeking a buyer for the division. “To be best able to exploit the potential in each of these markets, we are concentrating our own resources on the three business areas in the Professional division and are looking for a strong partner to invest in our Consumer business,&#8221; Co-CEO Daniel Sennheiser noted at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sennheiser describes the deal as a “permanent cooperation” between the two, including licensing the company’s name. The existing consumer wing, including many of its employees, will transfer to Sonovo. A press release announcing the news says there are currently 600 people employed by the brand, but no word on how many are expected the make that move.</p>
<p>“The combination of our strengths provides a very good starting point for future growth,” the company’s other co-CEO says in the release. “We are convinced that Sonova will strengthen the Sennheiser Consumer Business in the long term and capture the major growth opportunities.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sensor data from smartphones and wearables can meaningfully predict an individual&#8217;s &#8216;biological age&#8217; and resilience to stress, according to <a href="https://gero.ai">Gero AI</a>.</p>
<p>The &#8216;longevity&#8217; startup &#8212; which condenses its mission to the pithy goal of &#8220;hacking complex diseases and aging with Gero AI&#8221; &#8212; has developed an AI model to predict morbidity risk using &#8216;digital biomarkers&#8217; that are based on identifying patterns in step-counter sensor data which tracks mobile users&#8217; physical activity.</p>
<p>A simple measure of &#8216;steps&#8217; isn&#8217;t nuanced enough on its own to predict individual health, is the contention. Gero&#8217;s AI has been trained on large amounts of biological data to spots patterns that can be linked to morbidity risk. It also measures how quickly a personal recovers from a biological stress &#8212; another biomarker that&#8217;s been linked to lifespan; i.e. the faster the body recovers from stress, the better the individual&#8217;s overall health prognosis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/202816/text">research paper</a> Gero has had published in the peer-reviewed biomedical journal <em>Aging</em> explains how it trained deep neural networks to predict morbidity risk from mobile device sensor data &#8212; and was able to demonstrate that its biological age acceleration model was comparable to models based on blood test results.</p>
<p>Another paper, due to be published in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em> later this month, will go into detail on its device-derived measurement of biological resilience.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based startup, which has research roots in Russia &#8212; founded back in 2015 by a Russian scientist with a background in theoretical physics &#8212; has raised a total of $5 million in seed funding to date (in two tranches).</p>
<p>Backers come from both the biotech and the AI fields, per co-founder Peter Fedichev. Its investors include Belarus-based AI-focused early stage fund, Bulba Ventures (Yury Melnichek). On the pharma side, it has backing from some (unnamed) private individuals with links to Russian drug development firm, Valenta. (The pharma company itself is not an investor).</p>
<p>Fedichev is a theoretical physicist by training who, after his PhD and some ten years in academia, moved into biotech to work on molecular modelling and machine learning for drug discovery &#8212; where he got interested in the problem of ageing and decided to start the company.</p>
<p>As well as conducting its own biological<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> research into longevity (studying mice and nematodes), it&#8217;s focused on developing an AI model for predicting the biological age and resilience to stress of humans &#8212; via sensor data captured by mobile devices.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Health of course is much more than one number,&#8221; emphasizes Fedichev. &#8220;We should not have illusions about that. But if you are going to condense human health to one number then, for a lot of people, the biological age is the best number. It tells you &#8212; essentially &#8212; how toxic is your lifestyle&#8230; The more biological age you have relative to your chronological age years &#8212; that&#8217;s called biological acceleration &#8212; the more are your chances to get chronic disease, to get seasonal infectious diseases or also develop complications from those seasonal diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gero has recently launched a (paid, for now) API, called <a href="https://gerosense.ai">GeroSense</a>, that&#8217;s aimed at health and fitness apps so they can tap up its AI modelling to offer their users an individual assessment of biological age and resilience (aka recovery rate from stress back to that individual&#8217;s baseline).</p>
<p>Early partners are other longevity-focused companies, AgelessRx and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/humanity-inc-raises-funding-to-allow-us-to-monitor-and-affect-our-rate-of-aging/">Humanity Inc</a>. But the idea is to get the model widely embedded into fitness apps where it will be able to send a steady stream of longitudinal activity data back to Gero, to further feed its AI&#8217;s predictive capabilities and support the wider research mission &#8212; where it hopes to progress anti-ageing drug discovery, working in partnerships with pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>The carrot for the fitness providers to embed the API is to offer their users a fun and potentially valuable feature: A personalized health measurement so they can track positive (or negative) biological changes &#8212; helping them quantify the value of whatever fitness service they&#8217;re using.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every health and wellness provider &#8212; maybe even a gym &#8212; can put into their app for example&#8230; and this thing can rank all their classes in the gym, all their systems in the gym, for their value for different kinds of users,&#8221; explains Fedichev.</p>
<p>&#8220;We developed these capabilities because we need to understand how ageing works in humans, not in mice. Once we developed it we&#8217;re using it in our sophisticated genetic research in order to find genes &#8212; we are testing them in the laboratory &#8212; but, this technology, the measurement of ageing from continuous signals like wearable devices, is a good trick on its own. So that&#8217;s why we announced this GeroSense project,&#8221; he goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ageing is this gradual decline of your functional abilities which is bad but you can go to the gym and potentially improve them. But the problem is you&#8217;re losing this resilience. Which means that when you&#8217;re [biologically] stressed you cannot get back to the norm as quickly as possible. So we report this resilience. So when people start losing this resilience it means that they&#8217;re not robust anymore and the same level of stress as in their 20s would get them [knocked off] the rails.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this loss of resilience is one of the key ageing phenotypes because it tells you that you&#8217;re vulnerable for future diseases even before those diseases set in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In-house everything is ageing. We are totally committed to ageing: Measurement and intervention,&#8221; adds Fedichev. &#8220;We want to building something like an operating system for longevity and wellness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gero is also generating some revenue from two pilots with &#8220;top range&#8221; insurance companies &#8212; which Fedichev says it&#8217;s essentially running as a proof of business model at this stage. He also mentions an early pilot with Pepsi Co.</p>
<p>He sketches a link between how it hopes to work with insurance companies in the area of health outcomes with how Elon Musk is offering insurance products to owners of its sensor-laden Teslas, based on what it knows about how they drive &#8212; because both are putting sensor data in the driving seat, if you&#8217;ll pardon the pun. (&#8220;Essentially we are trying to do to humans what Elon Musk is trying to do to cars,&#8221; is how he puts it.)</p>
<p>But the nearer term plan is to raise more funding &#8212; and potentially switch to offering the API for free to really scale up the data capture potential.</p>
<p>Zooming out for a little context, i<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">t&#8217;s been almost a decade since Google-backed </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/19/wtf-is-calico-and-why-does-google-think-its-mysterious-new-company-can-defy-aging/">Calico</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> launched with the moonshot mission of &#8216;fixing death&#8217;. Since then a small but growing field of &#8216;longevity&#8217; startups has sprung up, conducting research into </span>extending <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">(in the first instance) </span> <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">human lifespan. (Ending death is, clearly, the moonshot atop the moonshot.) </span></p>
<p>Death is still with us, of course, but the business of identifying possible drugs and therapeutics to stave off the grim reaper&#8217;s knock continues picking up pace &#8212; attracting a growing volume of investor dollars.</p>
<p>The trend is being fuelled by health and biological data becoming ever more plentiful and accessible, thanks to open research data initiatives and the proliferation of digital devices and services for tracking health, set alongside promising developments in the fast-evolving field of machine learning in areas like predictive healthcare and drug discovery.</p>
<p>Longevity has also seen a bit of an upsurge in interest in recent times as the coronavirus pandemic has concentrated minds on health and wellness, generally &#8212; and, well, mortality specifically.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it remains a complex, multi-disciplinary business. Some of these biotech moonshots are focused on bioengineering and gene-editing &#8212; pushing for disease diagnosis and/or drug discovery.</p>
<p>Plenty are also &#8212; like Gero &#8212;  trying to use AI and big data analysis to better understand and counteract biological ageing, bringing together experts in physics, maths and biological science to hunt for biomarkers to further research aimed at combating age-related disease and deterioration.</p>
<p>Another recent example is AI startup Deep Longevity, which came out of stealth <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/business-wire/289bd9a1aef046b8adc4934d499c817d">last summer</a> &#8212; as a spinout from AI drug discovery startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/11/insilico-medicine-longevity/">Insilico Medicine</a> &#8212; touting an AI &#8216;longevity as a service&#8217; system which it claims can predict an individual’s biological age &#8220;significantly more accurately than conventional methods&#8221; (and which it also hopes will help scientists to unpick which &#8220;biological culprits drive aging-related diseases&#8221;, as it put it).</p>
<p>Gero AI is taking a different tack toward the same overarching goal &#8212; by honing in on data generated by activity sensors embedded into the everyday mobile devices people carry with them (or wear) as a proxy signal for studying their biology.</p>
<p>The advantage being that it doesn&#8217;t require a person to undergo regular (invasive) blood tests to get an ongoing measure of their own health. Instead our personal device can generate proxy signals for biological study <em>passively</em> &#8212; at vast scale and low cost. So the promise of Gero&#8217;s &#8216;digital biomarkers&#8217; is they could democratize access to individual health prediction.</p>
<p>And while billionaires like Peter Thiel can afford to shell out for bespoke medical monitoring and interventions to try to stay one step ahead of death, such high end services simply won&#8217;t scale to the rest of us.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If its digital biomarkers live up to Gero&#8217;s claims, its approach could, at the least, help steer millions towards healthier lifestyles, while also generating rich data for longevity R&amp;D &#8212; and to support the development of drugs that could extend human lifespan (albeit what such life-extending pills might cost is a whole other matter).</span></p>
<p>The insurance industry is naturally interested &#8212; with the potential for such tools to be used to nudge individuals towards healthier lifestyles and thereby reduce payout costs.</p>
<p>For individuals who are motivated to improve their health themselves, Fedichev says the issue now is it&#8217;s extremely hard for people to know exactly which lifestyle changes or interventions are best suited to their particular biology.</p>
<p>For example fasting has been shown in some studies to help combat biological ageing. But he notes that the approach may not be effective for everyone. The same may be true of other activities that are accepted to be generally beneficial for health (like exercise or eating or avoiding certain foods).</p>
<p>Again those rules of thumb may have a lot of nuance, depending on an individual&#8217;s particular biology. And scientific research is, inevitably, limited by access to funding. (Research can thus tend to focus on certain groups to the exclusion of others &#8212; e.g. men rather than women; or the young rather than middle aged.)</p>
<p>This is why Fedichev believes there&#8217;s a lot of value in creating a measure than can address health-related knowledge gaps at essentially no individual cost.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Gero has u</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">sed longitudinal data from the UK&#8217;s biobank, one of its research partners, to verify its model&#8217;s measurements of biological age and resilience. But of course it hopes to go further &#8212; as it ingests more data. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Technically it&#8217;s not properly different what we are doing &#8212; it just happens that we can do it now because there are such efforts like UK biobank. Government money and also some industry sponsors money, maybe for the first time in the history of humanity, we have this situation where we have electronic medical records, genetics, wearable devices from hundreds of thousands of people, so it just became possible. It&#8217;s the convergence of several developments &#8212; technological but also what I would call &#8216;social technologies&#8217; [like the UK biobank],&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine that for every diet, for every training routine, meditation&#8230; in order to make sure that we can actually optimize lifestyles &#8212; understand which things work, which do not [for each person] or maybe some experimental drugs which are already proved [to] extend lifespan in animals are working, maybe we can do something different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we will have 1M tracks [half a year&#8217;s worth of data on 1M individuals] we will combine that with genetics and solve ageing,&#8221; he adds, with entrepreneurial flourish. &#8220;The ambitious version of this plan is we&#8217;ll get this million tracks by the end of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fitness and health apps are an obvious target partner for data-loving longevity researchers &#8212; but you can imagine it&#8217;ll be a mutual attraction. One side can bring the users, the other a halo of credibility comprised of deep tech and hard science.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect that these [apps] will get lots of people and we will be able to analyze those people for them as a fun feature first, for their users. But in the background we will build the best model of human ageing,&#8221; Fedichev continues, predicting that scoring the effect of different fitness and wellness treatments will be &#8220;the next frontier&#8221; for wellness and health (Or, more pithily: &#8220;Wellness and health has to become digital and quantitive.&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are doing is we are bringing physicists into the analysis of human data. Since recently we have lots of biobanks, we have lots of signals &#8212; including from available devices which produce something like a few years&#8217; long windows on the human ageing process. So it&#8217;s a dynamical system &#8212; like weather prediction or financial market predictions,&#8221; he also tells us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot own the treatments because we cannot patent them but maybe we can own the personalization &#8212; the AI that personalized those treatments for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a startup perspective, one thing looks crystal clear: Personalization is here for the long haul.</p>

The one-day event, scheduled for June 9, is bringing together engineers and founders, investors and CEOs who are working on all the present and future ways people and packages will get from Point A to Point B. Iagnemma and Urmson will come to discuss the past, the present challenges and what both aim to do in the future. We&#8217;ll tackle questions about the technical problems that remain to be solved, the war over talent, the best business models and applications of autonomous vehicles and maybe even hear a few stories from the early days of testing and launching a startup.</p>
<p>Both guests have a long list of accolades and accomplishments — and too many to cover them all here.</p>
<p>Urmson has been working on AVs for more than 15 years. He earned his BSc in computer engineering from the University of Manitoba in 1998 and his PhD in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2005. He was a faculty member of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked with house-sized trucks, drove robots in the desert and was the technical director of the DARPA Urban and Grand Challenge teams. Urmson has authored more than 60 patents and 50 publications.</p>
<p>He left CMU and was one of the founding members of Google&#8217;s self-driving program, serving as its CTO. In 2017, Urmson co-founded Aurora with Sterling Anderson and Drew Bagnell.</p>
<p>Iagnemma is also considered an authority on robotics and driverless vehicles. He was the director of the Robotic Mobility Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where his research resulted in more than 150 technical publications, 50 issued or filed patents and numerous edited volumes, including books on the DARPA Grand Challenge and Urban Challenge autonomous vehicle competitions. He holds a BS from the University of Michigan, where he graduated first in his class, and MS and PhD degrees from MIT, where he was a National Science Foundation fellow.</p>
<p>In 2013, Iagnemma co-founded autonomous vehicle startup nuTonomy, one of the first to launch ride-hailing pilots. The company was acquired by Aptiv <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">in late 2017. Aptiv and Hyundai formed the joint venture, which he now heads, in 2020. </span></p>
<p>Iagnemma and Urmson are two of the many best and brightest minds in transportation who will be joining us on our virtual stage in June.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart-owned Flipkart is exempting storage and cancellation fees for sellers on its marketplace and also providing them with insurance coverage as the top e-commerce platform in India looks to maintain cordial relationships with more than 300,000 sellers who are facing severe disruption amid an unprecedented rise in the spread of coronavirus infections in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-headquartered firm said Friday evening that it is exempting storage fees to sellers who use the company’s fulfilment centres, and also waiving off the cancellation fees until the end of the month. (Several Indian states, as they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/amazon-prioritizes-essential-products-in-india-temporarily-discontinues-lower-priority-items/">did during the first wave of the virus</a>, have imposed restrictions on sale and delivery of non-essential items.)</p>
<p>Flipkart will bear 100% premium of COVID insurance to all sellers that transact on the platform, covering any hospitalization and consultation fees between 50,000 Indian rupees ($685) to 300,000 Indian rupees ($4095).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news today comes a week after Amazon, Flipkart’s chief rival in India, announced it was waiving 50% of the referral fee sellers are required to pay the e-commerce firm for this month, though not all sellers are qualified to avail this benefit. (The company said earlier this week that it was also postponing Prime Day in India and Canada due to the growing cases of the infection.)</p>

<p>Flipkart said it is also making it easier for sellers to access working capital from the firm without any incremental cost, though it did not specify the steps it had made.</p>
<p>It is also extending the window for the Seller Protection Fund to 30 days (from 14) to make claims on returned products. Flipkart said it will also ease its policies and performance metrics to ensure that they are not impacted by state-led lockdowns.</p>
<p>Flipkart, which as of last year was working to go public this year, said it has partnered with Vriddhi, Walmart’s Supplier Development Program in India, to organize webinars for small businesses to share best practices to ensure safety of workforce and provide insights to stay afloat amid the crisis.</p>
<p>“Through these testing times it is our constant effort to support our seller partners who face immense operational challenges as a result of the pandemic. As a democratic marketplace, we want to ensure that our lakhs [hundreds of thousands] of seller partners are able to continue operations and keep the economic engine running,” said Jagjeet Harode, senior director and head of Marketplace at Flipkart, in a statement.</p>
<p>“With them and their family’s financial and health safety in mind, we have rolled out these initiatives that will bring them the much-needed respite to keep their businesses active.”</p>
<p>India has been reporting over 400,00 daily infections this week, more than any other nation, as the world&#8217;s second-most populated nation struggles to contain the second wave of the virus. Scores of firms, startups, investors and people alike are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/">uniting to help the nation fight the virus</a>, which has severely impacted the healthcare facilities.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today we're talking Square earnings and its bitcoin base, especially in how it relates to the results of other entities that offer bitcoin sales.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Square are up more than 6% today after the American fintech company reported a staggering $5.06 billion in revenue in its <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/311240100/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1-2021-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Q1 2021 earnings report</a>, far ahead of an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html">expected tally</a> of $3.36 billion.</p>
<p>By posting the huge revenue beat, Square grew 266% compared to its year-ago Q1. Because that&#8217;s the sort of growth that we generally expect to see from early-stage startups instead of maturing public companies, some exploration is in order. In short, bitcoin revenues from Square, and how they fit into its accounting, are responsible for much of its outsized growth.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s something we need to talk about.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Square&#8217;s performance apart from its bitcoin-driven results were strong. But its bitcoin incomes underscore not only rising consumer sentiment concerning bitcoin, but also an interesting angle on the question of Coinbase and its long-term fee structure.</p>
<p>Mix in the huge growth in bitcoin investment activity that Robinhood has seen and we can easily understand that, at least in the American market, consumers are not beholden to traditional cryptocurrency arguments regarding coin ownership. And the pace at which non-Coinbase entities are accreting trading volume could point to more competition at the now-public crypto exchange than some fans, backers and believers anticipated.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>So today, we&#8217;re talking Square earnings and its bitcoin base, especially in how it relates to the results of other entities that offer bitcoin sales. Our broader question is whether consumers are going to behave as many expect, or if the less crypto-focused on-ramps to bitcoin and its brethren will prove more popular than many crypto-enthusiasts anticipate.</p>
<h2>A bitcoin boom</h2>
<p>If we remove the bitcoin top line from Square&#8217;s quarter, the company posted $1.55 billion in revenue, a figure that was up 44% compared to its year-ago period. That&#8217;s impressive.</p>
<p>But the company&#8217;s bitcoin-related revenue growth was far more so. From $306.1 million in Q1 2020 bitcoin revenue to $3.51 billion in Q1 2021, Square wrote in its report that it saw &#8220;significant growth in bitcoin revenue year over year,&#8221; up &#8220;approximately 11x.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/may-mobility/">May Mobility</a> is one the most exciting companies to enter the transportation space in the past decade. The autonomous shuttle company has a fleet of autonomous low-speed shuttles spread out between Detroit, Grand Rapids and Providence. Recently, May launched a Lexus-based autonomous shuttle. The company has raised $83.6 million in funding, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/toyota-leads-50-million-investment-in-autonomous-shuttle-startup-may-mobility/">$50 million Series B led by Toyota Motor Corp</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Credit Karma Money, a new checking and savings account from the company best known for its credit monitoring service, recently launched a significant new feature. Called Instant Karma, the program rewards users by randomly refunding purchases. So far, since launching the feature, Credit Karma says it has rewarded 100,000 transactions, worth $5 million.</p>
<p>I spoke to Poulomi Damany, general manager at Credit Karma, who said the idea behind Credit Karma Money is to &#8220;change people&#8217;s relationship with money.&#8221; Credit Karma Instant Karma is an extension of that goal.</p>
<p>The process works differently from other cash-back offers. For one, this product is linked to a debt card rather than a credit card. Credit Karma Product Manger Kyle Thibaut says that&#8217;s by design, as their target demographic tends to stay away from credit cards. Second, the refund, though random, happens instantly. Swipe your card at a grocery store, and if selected, the money spent on the transaction is refunded instantly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Gen Z do not necessarily like credit cards,&#8221; Thibaut said. &#8220;When you talk to them, they like debit cards and debit cards are the way they spend. Debit card usage is higher than credit cards in the U.S., and it&#8217;s actually growing while credit card usage is declining.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Damany and Thibaut, a large portion of Credit Karma&#8217;s 110 million members are millennials and this product, along with Credit Karma Money, are targeted at this demographic. They say this model lines up better with the spending habits of this generation, who are generally not optimizing their spending to maximize credit card rewards.</p>
<p>At this time, the company is unwilling to share user numbers for Credit Karma Money and the amount of users who received a refund from Instant Karma. The company says it is saving those numbers for an upcoming earnings release &#8212; Credit Karma is owned by TurboTax maker, Intuit.</p>
<p><em>Update: A previous version of this article stated that Instant Karma works with Credit Karma&#8217;s savings account. The company says the programs are different, and the program for the saving&#8217;s account is being renamed Savings Boost.</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In non-aerobatic fixed-wing aviation, spins are an emergency. If you don’t have spin recovery training, you can easily make things worse, dramatically increasing your chances of crashing. Despite the life-and-death consequences, licensed amateur pilots in the United States are not required to train for this. Uncontrolled spins don’t happen often enough to warrant the training.</p>
<p>Startups can enter the equivalent of a spin as well. My startup, <a href="https://www.kolide.com/">Kolide</a>, entered a dangerous spin in early 2018, only a year after our Series A fundraise. We had little traction and we were quickly burning through our sizable cash reserves. We were spinning out of control, certain to hit the ground in no time.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Kolide had a lot going for it that enabled me to recover the company, but by far the most important was that we recognized we were in a spin very early, and we had enough cash remaining (and therefore sufficient time) to execute a recovery plan.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>All spins start with a stall &#8212; a reduction in lift when either the aircraft is flying too slowly or the nose is pointed too high. In Kolide’s case, we were doing both.</p>
<p>First, we raised too much money too fast. In order to justify the post-money valuation that came with the raise, we set unattainable goals. To make matters worse, we lacked the confidence in our product and strategy, so we developed our solution with hesitancy, underspending in critical areas. As a result, we were flying too steep and too slow. We stalled.</p>
<p>If a stall isn’t corrected promptly, a spin can develop. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThUWB81i4g">Flat spins</a> are one of the worst. Once the flat spin starts, there are a number of techniques experienced pilots should perform to recover the aircraft. Nearly all of these techniques require a critical resource, altitude &#8212; or, put another way, time.</p>
<p>Just like amateur pilots, startup CEOs don’t receive spin recovery training. When Kolide was spinning out of control, the vast majority of the advice I received was to cut our losses and sell the company or return the money to the investors.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn’t find <em>any</em> promising examples of companies with these same problems successfully recovering; I found only smoldering wreckage. By February 2019, my co-founders departed.</p>
<p>Despite this tell-tale sign of imminent demise, I was ultimately able to recover and put us on track for a great fundraise. Here’s how I recreated the engineering process.</p>
<h2>Buying time</h2>
<p>Kolide had a lot going for it that enabled me to recover the company, but by far the most important was that we recognized we were in a spin very early, and we had enough cash remaining (and therefore sufficient time) to execute a recovery plan. Even waiting just a few more months would have likely changed the outcome.</p>

<p>&#8220;I attend TechCrunch Disrupt every year because it’s different every time. It’s inspiring every single time. I&#8217;m never bored. Ever. I always learn something, whether it’s a new company, a new topic or a deeper exploration of a familiar technology. It&#8217;s great. I love stuff like that.&#8221; — Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;The virtual platform’s chat feature made it easy to connect with participants. People got creative using it to promote their business, like posting a LinkedIn profile or offering 15-minute time slots to review business pitches. I even saw a product-naming competition. You could find lots of opportunity rolling through the chat area.&#8221; — Ada Lau, manager of market development, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>The whole team was aboard for this recording, with <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> behind the scenes, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> on the mics. We had to cut more than we included this week, which should give you a good idea of how busy the startup and VC worlds are of late.</p>
<p>Make sure that you are <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">following the podcast on Twitter</a>, where we post all sorts of memes and cuts and, perhaps, the occasional video here and there. That aside, here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing legend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/yales-longtime-and-legendary-endowment-chief-david-swensen-has-passed-away-at-age-67/">David Swenson</a> passed away.</li>
<li>Twitter is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">buying Scroll</a> (neat, very cool) as part of its subscription push, but also killing Nuzzel in the process (bad, very uncool). Natasha and Danny fill us in on why Nuzzel will be missed. Alex has thoughts on why Twitter-Scroll is good.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/epic-games-buys-artist-community-artstation-drops-commissions-to-12/">Epic bought ArtStation</a> and cut its marketplace take rate. This is the future, says Danny, who throws his own estimates in, too.</li>
<li>Sony and Discord are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/sony-announces-investment-and-partnership-with-discord-to-bring-the-chat-app-to-playstation/">tying up</a> after the Microsoft-Discord deal fell apart.</li>
<li>Edtech is doing the edtech thing in which it raises money and consolidates, as shown by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/kahoot-acquires-clever-the-us-based-edtech-portal-for-up-to-500m/">Kahoot&#8217;s latest scoop.</a></li>
<li>A friend of the pod, Jomayra Herrera, <a href="https://twitter.com/jomayra_herrera/status/1389581630361190401">is joining Reach Capital</a> as its first-ever outside-partner hire.</li>
<li>Uber is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/uber-and-arrival-partner-to-create-an-ev-for-ride-hail-drivers/">teaming up with Arrival</a> for ride-hailing-designed electric vehicles. We&#8217;re pretty bullish on the idea. Also Alex likes to say &#8220;microfactories.&#8221;</li>
<li>IVF startups are raising venture capital, and this time<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/alifehealth-seed/"> it&#8217;s Alife Health that we&#8217;re talking about. </a></li>
<li>WorkBoard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/workboard-raises-75m-as-the-okr-focused-startup-bets-on-a-growing-economy-changes-to-business-culture/">raised again</a>. Alex once again made us talk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/">about OKR-focused startups</a>. He needs to get a life, and so does the rest of the Equity team, which fought to do the transition into this segment.</li>
<li>To end, we spoke about Leda Health, a new startup focused on at-home rape kits for sexual assault survivors. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/radical-ethereum-entrepreneurs-are-redefining-what-rape-kit-means/">It&#8217;s a controversial company</a>, and we discuss critiques and opportunities,</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s our show! No private equity deal can slow the Equity team down, so we&#8217;ll see you Monday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Income-share agreements, or ISAs, are a way to bring flexibility to the often steep financial costs of higher education. The financial model allows a student to learn at zero upfront cost, and then pay any costs through a percentage of future income over time.</p>
<p>While the model has caught fire from a variety of trade schools and bootcamps, it’s a hard service to offer at scale. It required underwriting a risky group of people &#8212; and that costs money. Just last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">a leader in the ISA space</a> Lambda School laid off 65 employees amid a broader restructuring.</p>
<p>It’s here that a startup like Blair, which graduated Y Combinator in 2019, could be of use. The startup today helps universities finance and offer income-share agreements, or ISAs, to students. The startup has two services: a capital arm (Blair Capital) for which it secured a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/blair-launches-100m-facility-to-fund-isas-for-students/"> $100 million debt facility</a>, and a services arm (Blair Servicing) that helps manage the flow of money, which just got a new tranche of capital to expand</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company told TechCrunch that it has raised a $6.3 million round led by Tiger Global. Other investors include Rainfall and 468 Capital, along with angels such as Teachable’s Ankur Nagpal and Vouch’s Sam Hodges. The raise came on top of a $1.1 million pre-seed round, bringing Blair’s total capital raised to date at $7.4 million.</p>
<p>A big portion of the venture capital money will go toward doubling or tripling Blair’s San Francisco team, said CEO Mike Mahlkow. It is especially investing in engineering and product, as well as a few senior hires in finance, compliance and the service side.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149018" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149018" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2149018" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg 3205w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149018" class="wp-caption-text">The Blair founding team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blair</p></div></p>
<p>Notably, Blair&#8217;s eight person team is fully male. The lack of gender diversity, even as an early-stage startup with a handful of employees, could hurt its competitive advantage, recruiting prospects, and performance over time. About 25 percent of the employees are LGBT and 37.5% identify as non-white.</p>
<p>Blair started as a tool to underwrite students with loans that would pay for college, a sum that would eventually be repaid through an income-share agreement. It was similar to an Affirm for Education, where it could help students get access with low or nonexistent upfront costs.</p>
<p>“The model worked very well until March last year,” Mahlkow said. “And then the debt market was fairly dead, so we needed to shift our focus to a more software-like approach.” Now, Blair focuses on building ISA-based programs for schools, and underwrites loans based on certain programs at certain schools that have historical returns.</p>
<p>Most companies use its servicing piece &#8212; aka an operating system for offering ISAs &#8212; but a number of companies turn to Blair to help finance the costs of offering an ISA. Either colleges and bootcamps finance the ISA themselves and put it on the balance sheet, or they sell it to a company like Blair to get the money upfront and get repaid eventually.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blair launches $100M facility to fund ISAs for students&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/blair-launches-100m-facility-to-fund-isas-for-students/embed/#?secret=dN3URw5V8r" data-secret="dN3URw5V8r" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Blair Servicing takes a percent of money from an ISA once a student is employed post-graduation, and Blair Capital takes a base fee plus a portion for the ISA as well.</p>
<p>While the company did not share exact numbers, it did say it has doubled its customers since February, tripling revenue during the same time period. Of course, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a bet from the ever-ravenous Tiger Global is a statement. And, unlike his new investor, Mahlkow plans to keep growth sustainable and lean. Long-term, Blair is betting that outcome-based financing could get traction in more than just a savvy startup bootcamp but in how recruiting and placement works in various industries. The startup is in talks with a sports association and large companies that are working on upskilling and reskilling their workforces. Incentives are key in edtech, and Blair speaking that language as an early-stage startup is key as the sector moves more into the spotlight.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Twitch evidently has no issues getting people to spend time on its platform — even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/aocs-among-us-stream-topped-435000-concurrent-viewers/">politicians can draw huge crowds</a> by streaming themselves playing games. But monetizing video content is hard, and Twitch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/twitch-breaks-records-again-in-q2-topping-5b-total-hours-watched/">missed revenue targets</a> for the last few years.</p>
<p>So how does Twitch make money? And more importantly, what subtle psychology does it use within its iOS app to encourage viewers to spend more?</p>
<p>I’m a UX analyst and the founder of UX community <a href="https://builtformars.com">Built for Mars</a> — where I regularly tear down some of the best products in the world, showing you how they’re made, and, more importantly, <em>how they could be improved</em>.</p>
<p>I recently published my <a href="https://builtformars.com/spending-money-on-twitch/">analysis of Twitch</a>. But for Extra Crunch subscribers, I wanted to go a little deeper and bridge the gap between what Twitch does and how you can make meaningful changes to your product’s UX.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			In general, you should encourage the user to make the hard decision (i.e., to commit to subscribing), after understanding all the benefits.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So here are three UX tips to discuss during your next team Zoom call.</p>
<h2>The Anchor Effect</h2>
<p>In short: The Anchor Effect is a heuristic bias whereby people will become attached (anchored) to an initial piece of information. For example, spending $1,000 on an iPhone may not seem like a bad deal if you saw an ad for the $1,500 one first — by comparison, it looks “cheap.”</p>
<p>On Twitch, when a new user subscribes to a channel for the first time, they’re shown the benefits of subscribing, and then asked how long they want those benefits for before being shown a price.</p>

<p>This type of bias is everywhere. For example, the order of your pricing tiers will affect conversions — which is likely why Mailchimp shows its pricing tiers in <a href="https://mailchimp.com/pricing/">reverse order</a>.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Biden Administration has reportedly proposed significant changes to the capital gains tax, aiming to target the wealthiest Americans to help fund his historic aid programs.</p>
<p>If the current proposal goes into effect, it will have an impact on startup employees who aren&#8217;t (yet) wealthy. And it’s unlikely the Biden Administration has considered the consequences, because many of these employees aren’t yet in the highest tax bracket. But startup employees need to pay close attention to these changes when planning what to do with their stock options.</p>
<p>We don’t yet know what will end up in a passed bill, which may look very different from the originally proposed plan. This shouldn’t cause alarm for employees or cause them to avoid exercising options, but it is something they should be thinking about when planning their equity strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When it comes to employee equity, the worst decision is always not having a plan of action.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As always, employees should work with their advisers to plan accordingly and get ahead of any changes.</p>
<h2>How changes in capital gains tax impact startup stock options</h2>
<p>Historically, long-term capital gains, or gains on assets held for over a year, have enjoyed preferential tax rates in comparison to short-term capital gains, which are assets held for less than a year. In Biden’s original proposal, he suggests raising the long-term capital gains rate to the highest ordinary income tax rate on income over $1 million.</p>
<p>If Biden’s changes are enacted, it means that there would no longer be preferential tax rates for those that make over $1 million on the sale of their shares post-IPO or as part of an acquisition. Many employees “go long” with their equity, selling them a year after exercising to benefit from long-term capital gains tax. Under this change, they may be limited to the amount of upside they can convert to preferential capital gains tax depending on their income levels and when they sell.</p>
<p>As with any tax legislation, the devil is in the details, many of which are still to be determined. These are the questions employees should be asking if the legislation moves forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the first $1 million in capital gains still taxed at preferential rates or do I factor in other sources of income to determine the $1 million threshold?</li>
<li>How can I plan around the sale of my shares to stay under the $1 million threshold?</li>
<li>Is there any impact on qualified small business stock (QSBS)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Clarity on these questions and details of the plan will provide critical information for employees looking to exercise if Biden’s tax plan advances in Congress.</p>
<h2>Capital gains tax rules have always been political</h2>
<p>Many presidents have expressed interest in changing the capital gains laws in the past. President Obama, for example, wanted to raise the capital gains tax. President Trump campaigned on capital gains rules, suggesting the carried interest rules, which are possible because of capital gains tax rules, be eliminated.</p>
<p>The questions now are: Will Biden be successful in addressing capital gains tax rules? And will the Democrats risk backlash or potential downsides driven by increased capital gains tax? Many experts suggest that the final legislation, if passed, will result in a capital gains tax increase, but much less than Biden’s original proposal. Some are suggesting Congress will settle on no more than 30% as the highest capital gain rates for those who earn more than $1 million.</p>
<p>Only time will tell, but the suggested tax plan may create a significant, if unintended, burden to startup employees more than anyone else.</p>
<h2>Planning around your equity</h2>
<p>There’s still a lot of uncertainty around what new tax legislation may look like or if it will happen at all. At this point, startup employees may not necessarily need to act on these potential changes, but they should be taking it into account when planning what to do with their equity and, more specifically, when they are planning to exercise.</p>
<p>Either way, employees should still strongly consider exercising their stock options (it’s a key benefit of working at a startup, after all). Taxes are just one consideration. For example, many companies have exercise deadlines after employees leave a company.</p>
<p>Even if rates to capital gains taxes change, exercising early may still have its benefits, as many employees may still be able to create a plan to sell up to a certain number of shares at preferential rates every year.</p>
<p>While Biden’s proposed plan is focused on changing the federal tax rates, state income tax considerations remain. Startup employees have been moving away from high-tax states such as California and New York in favor of no-income tax states such as Texas and Florida. Those that are planning a move may have a big incentive to exercise their options to limit California and New York’s reach on the shares.</p>
<p>It’s important that employees understand the advantages and disadvantages of exercising today versus waiting until after an IPO. When it comes to employee equity, the worst decision is always not having a plan of action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is fresh off a high for its Starship spacecraft development program, but according to CEO Elon Musk, it&#8217;s already looking ahead to potentially repeating its latest success with an unplanned early reusability experiment. Earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/spacex-successfully-launches-and-lands-its-starship-prototype-rocket/">SpaceX flew the SN15 (i.e. 15th prototype) of its Starship from its development site near Brownsville, Texas, and succeeded in landing it upright for the first time</a>. Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390569345361883136">Musk says they could fly the same prototype a second time</a>, a first for the Starship test and development effort.</p>
<p>The successful launch and landing on Wednesday included an ascent to around 30,000 feet, where the 150-foot-tall spacecraft flipped onto its &#8220;belly&#8221; and then descended back to Earth, returning vertical and firing its engines to slow its descent and touch down softly, standing upright. This atmospheric testing is a key step meant to help prove out the technologies and systems that will later help Starship return to Earth after its orbital launches. The full Starship launch system is intended to be completely reusable, including this vehicle (which will eventually serve as the upper stage) and the Super Heavy booster that the company is also in the process of developing.</p>
<p>A second test flight of SN15 is an interesting possibility among the options for the prototype. SpaceX will obviously be conducting a number of other check-outs and gathering as much data as it can from the vehicle, in addition to whatever it collected from onboard sensors, but the options for the craft after that basically amounted to stress testing it to failure, or dismantling it and studying the pieces. A second flight attempt is an interesting additional option that could provide SpaceX with a lot of invaluable data about its planned re-use of the production version of Starship.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whether or not SpaceX actually does re-fly SN15 is still up in the air, but if it does end up being technically possible, it seems like a great learning opportunity for SpaceX that could help fast-track the overall development program.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We spoke to five investors to find out more about RPA. The general consensus? We're just getting started. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) has certainly<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/"> been getting a lot of attention</a> in the last year, with startups, acquisitions and IPOs all coming together in a flurry of market activity. It all seemed to culminate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">with UiPath&#8217;s IPO</a> last month. The company that appeared to come out of nowhere in 2017 eventually had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-meteoric-rise-from-unknown-startup-to-35b-rpa-juggernaut/">a final private valuation of $35 billion.</a> It then had the audacity to match that at its IPO. A few weeks later, it still has a market cap of over $38 billion in spite of the stock price fluctuating at points.</p>
<p>Was this some kind of peak for the technology or a flash in the pan? Probably not. While it all seemed to come together in the last year with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">a big increase in attention</a> to automation in general during the pandemic, it&#8217;s a market category that has been around for some time.</p>
<p>RPA allows companies to automate a group of highly mundane tasks and have a machine do the work instead of a human. Think of finding an invoice amount in an email, placing the figure in a spreadsheet and sending a Slack message to Accounts Payable. You could have humans do that, or you could do it more quickly and efficiently with a machine. We&#8217;re talking mind-numbing work that is well suited to automation.</p>
<p>In 2019, Gartner found RPA was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/gartner-finds-rpa-is-fastest-growing-market-in-enterprise-software/">the fastest-growing category</a> in enterprise software. In spite of that, the market is still surprisingly small, with IDC estimates finding it will reach just $2 billion in 2021. That&#8217;s pretty tiny for the enterprise, but it shows that there&#8217;s plenty of room for this space to grow.</p>
<p>We spoke to five investors to find out more about RPA, and the general consensus was that we are just getting started. While we will continue to see the players at the top of the market &#8212; like UiPath, Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism &#8212; jockeying for position with the big enterprise vendors and startups, the size and scope of the market has a lot of potential and is likely to keep growing for some time to come.</p>
<p>To learn about all of this, we queried the following investors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mallun/">Mallun Yen</a>, founder and partner, Operator Collective</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaidas/">Jai Das</a>, partner and president, Sapphire Ventures</li>
<li><a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/s-somasegar/">Soma Somasegar</a>, managing director, Madrona Venture Group</li>
<li><a href="https://capitalg.com/team/laela-sturdy/">Laela Sturdy</a>, general partner, CapitalG</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edsim/">Ed Sim</a>, founder and managing partner, Boldstart Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We have seen a range of RPA startups emerge in recent years, with companies like UiPath, Blue Prism and Automation Anywhere leading the way. As the space matures, where do the biggest opportunities remain?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mallun Yen</strong>: One of the fastest-growing categories of software, RPA has been growing at over 60% in recent years, versus 13% for enterprise software generally. But we’ve barely scratched the surface. The COVID-19 pandemic forced companies to shift how they run their business, how they hire and allocate staff.</p>
<p>Given that the workforce will remain at least partially permanently remote, companies recognize that this shift is also permanent, and so they need to make fundamental changes to how they run their businesses. It’s simply suboptimal to hire, train and deploy remote employees to run routine processes, which are prone to, among other things, human error and boredom.</p>
<p><strong>Jai Das</strong>: All the companies that you have listed are focused on automating simple repetitive tasks that are performed by humans. These are mostly data entry and data validation jobs. Most of these tasks will be automated in the next couple of years. The new opportunity lies in automating business processes that involve multiple humans and machines within complicated workflow using AI/ML.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is also called process mining. There have been BPM companies in the past that have tried to automate these business processes, but they required a lot of services to implement and maintain these automated processes. AI/ML is providing a way for software to replace all these services.</p>
<p><strong>Soma Somasegar</strong>: For all the progress that we have seen in RPA, I think it is still early days. The global demand for RPA market size in terms of revenue was more than $2 billion this past year and is expected to cross $20 billion in the coming decade, growing at a CAGR of more than 30% over the next seven to eight years, according to analysts such as Gartner.</p>
<p>That’s an astounding growth rate in the coming years and is a reflection of how early we are in the RPA journey and how much more is ahead of us. A recent study by Deloitte indicates that up to 50% of the tasks in businesses performed by employees are considered mundane, administrative and labor-intensive. That is just a recipe for a ton of process automation.</p>
<p>There are a lot of opportunities that I see here, including process discovery and mining; process analytics; application of AI to drive effective, more complex workflow automation; and using low code/no code as a way to enable a broader set of people to be able to automate tasks, processes and workflows, to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>Laela Sturdy</strong>: We’re a long way from needing to think about the space maturing. In fact, RPA adoption is still in its early infancy when you consider its immense potential. Most companies are only now just beginning to explore the numerous use cases that exist across industries. The more enterprises dip their toes into RPA, the more use cases they envision.</p>
<p>I expect to see market leaders like UiPath continue to innovate rapidly while expanding the breadth and depth of their end-to-end automation platforms. As the technology continues to evolve, we should expect RPA to penetrate even more deeply into the enterprise and to automate increasingly more &#8212; and more critical &#8212; business processes.</p>
<p><strong>Ed Sim:</strong> Most large-scale automation projects require a significant amount of professional services to deliver on the promises, and two areas where I still see opportunity include startups that can bring more intelligence and faster time to value. Examples include process discovery, which can help companies quickly and accurately understand how their business processes work and prioritize what to automate versus just rearchitecting an existing workflow.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
