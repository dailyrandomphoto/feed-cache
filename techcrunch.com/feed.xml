										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors placing capital in earlier and earlier tech deals has been a historical trend for the last few years, but this strategy was generally reserved for the traditional, &#8216;high-growth&#8217; VC arena. VCs needed to snag earlier ad earlier deals otherwise they would be diluted at a later stage. But with startups coming up with models which can book revenues faster, they have increasingly less need for the VC deal which typically leaves founders with less control and less equity than the newly-ensconced VC on their board. That said, capital at this early stage for &#8216;growth-based&#8217; startups was often hard to come by. Thus, the ‘early growth fund’ has been invented to address this issue.</p>
<p>Now, the latest arrival in this arena is Balderton, one of the Europe’s top VC funds, with may uicorns uder its belt.</p>
<p>Balderton has now launched a $680M ‘early growth’ fund to invest in high-potential tech companies, targeting around 15 companies at the early-growth stage, sector agostic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It plans to invest between $25m and $50m per company through both primary and secondary investments. The fund will be lead by Bernard Liautaud, David Thévenon, and Rana Yared.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2000, Balderton has raised $4bn to invest in European startups and backed more than 230 companies, primarily at the Series A stage. Its investments include Depop, GoCardless, Infarm, Revolut, THG, Vestiaire Collective, and Zego. The firm’s &#8216;Liquidity I&#8217; portfolio also includes Darktrace, Flywire, Graphcore, and Truecaller.</p>
<p>Bernard Liautaud, Managing Partner said: “I’ve been an investor at Balderton since 2008, and it has been incredible to see the increasing number of ambitious European founders, and to be able to support them financially through those critical first three to five years with our early stage funds. With this Growth Fund, we can now support them as they scale to become global industry leaders. We predict a $50 billion growth opportunity in Europe in the next three years alone, and we want to be the first choice for those ambitious founders.” </p>
<p>Rana Yared, General Partner, added: “Our approach for this fund will be ‘one of few’. This means personalised attention from the entire partnership, plus access to Balderton’s leading platform team. We’re looking for fifteen or so really exceptional companies that have the potential to be sector leaders and disrupt global industries.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[To catch up on this busy IPO week, Marqeta, Monday.com, Zeta Global and 1stDibs are on the docket. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re digging into the final IPO prices set by fintech unicorn Marqeta and enterprise productivity unicorn Monday.com this morning. Briefly, it&#8217;s good news.</p>
<p>A small programming note: The Exchange is off next week. I am taking some time to do nothing other than eat, read books and lose at lawn games. Regular service will resume the week after.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>To catch up on this busy IPO week, Marqeta, Monday.com and two other IPOs are on the docket. The final pair are Zeta Global and 1stDibs, debuts that matter, if a bit less so for our purposes than the others.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995212" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We&#8217;ll unpack the final price of each, comparing it to its IPO valuation range and drawing a few conclusions about where we stand in the larger unicorn liquidity cycle.</p>
<p>This is familiar ground for us, but given the sheer flow of IPOs we cannot sit back and presume that our knowledge is current; things are happening with enough speed that regular revisions of our market views are key.</p>
<p>And we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/as-monday-com-targets-6b-ipo-valuation-zoom-and-salesforce-commit-150m/">may have been too conservative before</a>, so we have a bit of clean-up ahead of us.</p>
<h2>Strong pricing</h2>
<p>Why do we care about IPO pricing? After all, the DoorDash and Airbnb IPOs showed that the value at which a company opens life as a public entity can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/doordash-c3-ai-skyrocket-in-public-market-debuts/">wildly differ</a> from where bankers estimated it should be valued.</p>
<p>Two quick things: First, IPO pricing sets the terms for the floating company&#8217;s fundraise; IPOs are fundraising events that often take the place of one last private round, so their price matters from a dilution perspective. And a lot of the hottest IPOs from the last six months have given back some of their early gains, making their official IPO price relevant.</p>
<p>DoorDash, for example, priced at $102 before soaring as high as $256 per share after its debut. Today, the company is worth $135.50 in pre-market trading. That&#8217;s a lot closer to its IPO price than we might have anticipated after watching its first days as a floating stock.</p>
<p>So, this stuff really does matter, and the numbers that we see below will help private companies price their next venture rounds. Furthermore, strong public market pricing could help keep alive the current game of wealthy private groups like Tiger hunting ever-earlier-stage startups with promising &#8212; if nascent &#8212; growth rates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Waymo will be moving freight for a major customer of transportation logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services under what the two companies are calling a “test run” that will take place in one of the country’s busiest trade corridors.</p>
<p>Waymo Via, the company’s trucking and cargo transportation service, will transport goods along Interstate 45 between Houston and Fort Worth, Texas. The trucks will be powered by the Waymo Driver autonomous platform, though a Waymo “autonomous specialists,” a commercially-licensed truck driver and a software technician will be riding in each truck to monitor the operations.</p>
<p>This is not the first time J.B. Hunt and Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary, have worked together. It seems the companies have been preparing for a trial deployment of autonomous trucks for some time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’ve also worked closely with J.B. Hunt for some time now on operational and market studies and will continue to do so as we roll out autonomous driving technology,” Waymo said in a blog post. “We’ve explored topics such as best practices for regular maintenance, what future facility layouts will look like, and which lanes are best suited for autonomous driving technology, to help ensure long-term preparedness on both sides.”</p>
<p>Waymo declined to share with TechCrunch the specific number of trucks that will be used for the test run, but a spokesperson said that it will be a limited duration pilot “with the goal of jointly developing a long term plan for how our companies can work together.”</p>
<p>Waymo Driver is a Level 4 platform, meaning that it could theoretically operate without a human safety driver behind the wheel, but only under certain conditions (like clear weather).</p>
<p>The autonomous driving company has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/daimler-trucks-partners-with-waymo-to-build-self-driving-semi-trucks/">partnered with Daimler Trucks</a> to equip Daimler freightliners with the Waymo Driver. That’s in addition to partnerships <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/waymo-volvo-partner-to-develop-electric-robotaxis/">with Volvo</a> to develop electric robotaxis, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/waymo-and-fiat-chrysler-expand-partnership-to-develop-self-driving-ram-vans/">Fiat Chrysler Automobiles</a> for autonomous cargo vans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fixed-term-funds (FTFs) have historically been a bank-to-bank market. FTF products allow for investing into some of the safest assets including, UK Government bonds, US Government bonds and highly-rated corporations. They allow holders of large amounts of cash (such as charities, private funds, family offices etc) to reduce and diversify their risk, but also increasing returns.</p>
<p>TreasurySpring is a fintech startup that is aiming to opening up access to this area of financial markets, by creating a Fixed-Term Fund platform. It&#8217;s now raised a $10 million Series A investment round co-led by MMC Ventures and Anthemis Group. Existing investors, including ETFS Capital, participated, taking the total its raised to $15 million.</p>
<p>TreasurySpring says its FTF platform gives holders of large cash balances online access to a menu of proprietary cash investments on a daily basis. This gives them access to an asset class that is usually only available to major financial institutions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Kevin Cook (CEO), Matthew Longhurst and James Skillen, Cook said in a statement: “Following a break-out 12 months in which we increased AUM by 10x, we wanted to bring in the best possible investment partners to support our ambitious growth plans. We have long admired both Anthemis Group and MMC, so I am delighted that they co-led the round and we are excited to work with Sean, Ollie and their respective teams, as we move into the next phase of our journey to redefine cash investment and front-office treasury.”</p>
<p>Given the current low and negative interest rates and an uncertain global financial outlook, TreasurySpring says its platform is likely to appeal as an alternative to traditional bank deposits and money market funds. It says it&#8217;s now issued more than $9B of FTFs to a client base which includes FTSE 100 and other listed companies, fund managers, large private companies, charities, and family offices.</p>
<p>Yann Ranchere, partner at Anthemis Group said: &#8220;With its ambitious and mission-driven team, TreaurySpring is opening the traditional money market industry to a whole new pool of participants.”</p>
<p>Oliver Richards, partner at MMC Ventures added: “Having worked with the team at TreasurySpring for the last two years, we have absolute confidence in their ability to deliver on their unique vision to level the playing field in cash investing and short-term funding, through a platform that not only brings value to its clients and issuers but also enhances the diversification and systemic stability of the money markets as a whole.”</p>
<p>Does TreasurySpring have any direct competitors? The compay sdays not. That said, bank deposits and money market funds are still the only tools available to most holders of large cash balances, so the banks and asset managers that offer these products are competitors, &#8220;to an extent&#8221; admits the firm. Howeverr, they are also &#8220;collaborators in many instances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cook said: &#8220;Adoption of the platform is being driven by a realisation that the risks and returns of the traditional [deposit and MMF] options are becoming ever less attractive, whilst building out the infrastructure to do anything else is complex, cumbersome, time consuming and expensive.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[RSA Security has spun out its fraud and risk intelligence business into a standalone company called Outseer that will double down on payment security tools amid an &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; rise in fraudulent transactions. Led by CEO Reed Taussig, who was appointed head of RSA&#8217;s Anti-Fraud Business Unit last year after previously serving as CEO of ThreatMetrix, [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/rsa-security/">RSA Security</a> has spun out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fraud/">fraud</a> and risk intelligence business into a standalone company called Outseer that will double down on payment security tools amid an &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; rise in fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>Led by CEO Reed Taussig, who was appointed head of RSA&#8217;s Anti-Fraud Business Unit last year after previously serving as CEO of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/threatmetrix/">ThreatMetrix</a>, the new company will focus solely on fraud detection and management and payments authentication services.</p>
<p>Outseer will continue to operate under the RSA umbrella and will inherit three core services, which are already used by more than 6,000 financial institutions, from the company: Outseer Fraud Manager (formerly RSA Adaptive Authentication), a risk-based account monitoring service; 3-D Secure (formerly Adaptive Authentication for eCommerce), a card-not-present and digital payment authentication mapping service; and FraudAction, which detects and takes down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a> sites, dodgy apps and fraudulent social media pages.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Outseer says its product portfolio is supported by deep investments in data and science, including a global network of verified fraud and transaction data, and a risk engine that the company claims delivers 95% fraud detection rates.</p>
<p>Commenting on the spinout, Taussig said: “Outseer is the culmination of decades of science-driven innovation in anti-fraud and payments authentication solutions. As the digital economy continues to deepen, the Outseer mission to liberate the world from transactional fraud is essential. Our role as a revenue enabler for the global economy will only strengthen as every digital business continues to scale.”</p>
<p>RSA, meanwhile, will continue to focus on integrated risk management and security products, including Archer for risk management, NetWitness for threat detection and response, and SecureID for identity and access management (IAM) capabilities.</p>
<p>The spinout comes less than a year after private equity firm Symphony Technology Group (STG), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fireeye-to-sell-products-unit-for-1-2b-to-symphony-led-group/">which recently bought FireEye’s product business for $1.2 billion</a>, acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/dell-sells-rsa-to-consortium-led-by-symphony-technology-group-for-over-2b/">RSA Security from Dell Technologies for more than $2 billion</a>. Dell had previously acquired RSA as part of its purchase of EMC in 2016.</p>
<p>It also comes amid a huge rise in online fraud fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Trade Commission said in March that more than 217,000 Americans had filed a coronavirus-related fraud report since January 2020, with losses to COVID-linked fraud totaling $382 million.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Similarly, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fielded 542,300 fraud complaints in 2020, a 54% increase over 2019.</p>
<p>RSA said that with the COVID-19 pandemic having fueled “unprecedented” growth in fraudulent transactions, Outseer will focus its innovation on payments authentication, mapping to the EMV 3-D Secure 2.x payment standard, and incorporating new technology integrations across the payments and commerce ecosystem.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Outseer’s reason for being isn’t just focused on eliminating payments and account fraud,” Taussig added. “These fraudulent transactions are often the pretext for more sinister drug and human trafficking, terrorism, and other nefarious behavior. Outseer has the ability to help make the world a safer place.”</p>
<p>Valuation information for Outseer was not disclosed, nor were headcount figures mentioned in the spinout announcement. Outseer didn&#8217;t immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for more information.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One clear outcome of the pandemic was pushing more people to do their shopping online, and that was as true for B2B as it was for B2C. Knowing which of your B2B customers are most likely to convert puts any sales team ahead of the game. <a href="https://www.slintel.com/">Slintel</a>, a startup providing that kind of data, announced a $20 million Series A today.</p>
<p>The company has attracted some big-name investors with GGV leading the round and Accel, Sequoia and Stellaris also participating. The investment brings the total raised to over $24 million including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/06/slintel-grabs-4-2m-seed-to-expand-sales-intelligence-platform/">a $4.2 million seed round</a> from last November.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a quick turnaround from seed to A, and company founder and CEO Deepak Anchala, says that while he had plenty of runway left from the seed round, the demand was such that it seemed prudent to take the A money sooner than he had planned. &#8220;So we had enough cash in the bank, but investors came to us and we got a pretty good valuation compared to the previous round, so we decided to take it and use that money to go faster,&#8221; Anchala said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Certainly the market dynamics were working in Slintel&#8217;s favor. Without giving revenue details, Anchala said that revenue grew 5x last year in the middle of the worst of the pandemic. He says that meant buyers were spending less time with sales and marketing folks to understand products and more time online researching on their own.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TQCSY7jHBh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/">Gong going gangbusters, grabs $250M Series E on $7.25B valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gong going gangbusters, grabs $250M Series E on $7.25B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/gong-going-gangbusters-grabs-250m-series-e-on-7-25b-valuation/embed/#?secret=TQCSY7jHBh" data-secret="TQCSY7jHBh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;So what Slintel does as a product is we mine buyer insights. We understand where the buyers are in their journey, what their pain points are, what products they use, what they need and when they need it. So we understand all of this to create a 360 degree view of the buyer that you provide these insights to sales and marketing teams to help them sell better,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After growing at such a rapid clip last year, the company expected more modest growth this year at perhaps 3x, but with the added investment, he expects to grow faster again. &#8220;With the funding we&#8217;re actually looking at much bigger numbers. We&#8217;re looking at 5x in our revenue this year, and also trying for 4x revenue next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that the money gives him the opportunity to improve the product and put more investment into marketing, which he believes will contribute to additional sales. Since the round closed 6 weeks ago, he says that he has increased his advertising budget and is also hopes to attract customers via SEO, free tools on the company website and events.</p>
<p>The company had 45 employees at the time of its seed round in November and has more than doubled that number in the interim to 100 spread out across 10 cities. He expects to double again by this time next year as the company is growing quickly. As a global company with some employees in India and some in the U.S., he intends to be remote first even after offices begin to reopen in different areas. He says that he plans to have company gatherings each quarter to let people gather in person on occasion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In June of last year, <a href="https://twitter.com/kn0thing?lang=en">Alexis Ohanian</a> announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/alexis-ohanian-reddit-co-founder-is-leaving-initialized-capital/">he was leaving Initialized Capital</a>, the venture firm he co-founded alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytan">Garry Tan</a> in 2011. Nearly a year later, he&#8217;s announcing that his new venture firm, <a href="https://sevensevensix.com/">Seven Seven Six</a>, has raised $150 million for its first fund.</p>
<p>Seven Seven Six is named for the year of the first Olympics, when a cook from nearby village ended up winning the Stadion race. Ohanian&#8217;s idea with the name stems from the fact that the cook was likely a fantastic athlete, but not necessarily the <em>best </em>athlete out there; many people were excluded from the first Olympic games, from athletes outside of Greece to those who didn&#8217;t have the means to show up to women, who weren&#8217;t even allowed to watch the games.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I thought about that track record, and all the things that I&#8217;ve been proud of as an entrepreneur and investor, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel like I was celebrating the cook,&#8221; said Ohanian. &#8220;I&#8217;m still very proud of that track record, but I know that I could have done better. I want the idea that we&#8217;re always on the first starting line trying to do better in pursuit of greater returns.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added that this pursuit, to leave no entrepreneurial rock unturned, is not necessarily something he wants to do because he enjoys it and it feels good, but because &#8220;it will make more money, it&#8217;s more successful and more effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Equity and inclusion, then, is built into the DNA of Seven Seven Six. Half of the firm&#8217;s limited partners are women, and 15 percent are black or indigenous people.</p>
<p>Alongside Ohanian, Katelyn Holloway and Lissie Garvin are taking founding positions at Seven Seven Six. Both worked with Ohanian at Initialized and Reddit.</p>
<p>One other unique piece of Seven Seven Six is that it is introducing a 2% &#8220;Growth and Caregiving Commitment.&#8221; Ohanian explained that, when he was going through Y Combinator, he was going through a rough time in his personal life. His mother was suffering from an illness, and his girlfriend (at the time) had been in an accident abroad.</p>
<p>So, as he was establishing a business, he was also traveling to see the people he loved who needed him. The financial burden added even more complexity to his life, and an incalculable level of stress.</p>
<p>The 2% commitment sets aside an extra two percent of an investment Seven Seven Six makes into a particular company, to offer financial support to founders for whatever they might need, from childcare to travel to surfing lessons, if that&#8217;s what it takes to help a founder perform in a healthy, balanced way.</p>
<p>Transparency is also a key part of Seven Seven Six&#8217;s philosophy. The firm plans to report on the spending out of this 2% commitment, as well as the diversity and inclusion breakdown of its investments each year.</p>
<p>Thus far, the VC firm has made 17 investments. From the release:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Threat intelligence company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/recorded-future/">Recorded Future</a> is launching a $20 million fund for early-stage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/startups/">startups</a> developing novel data intelligence tools.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Fund will provide seed and Series A funding to startups that already have venture capital funding, Recorded Future says, as well as equip them with resources to help with the development and integration of intelligence applications in order to accelerate their go-to-market strategy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recorded Future, which provides customers with information to help them better understand the external cyber threats they are facing, will invest in startups that aim to tackle significant problems that require novel approaches using datasets and collection platforms, which the company says could be anything from technical internet sensors to satellites. It’s also keen to invest in startups building intelligence analysis toolsets that make use of technologies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> and machine learning, as well as intelligence-driven applications that can be integrated into its own Intelligence Platform and ecosystem.</p>
<p>Recorded Future co-founder and chief executive Christopher Ahlberg said: “In a world of aggressive uncertainty, intelligence is the only equalizer. With the launch of the Intelligence Fund, we are investing in the next generation of entrepreneurs who share our vision for securing the world with intelligence.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>So far, the Intelligence Fund has invested in two companies, the first being SecurityTrails, which provides customers with a comprehensive overview of current and historical domain and IP address data. The second investment went to Gemini Advisory, a fraud intelligence platform specializing in finding compromised data on the dark web, which Recorded Future went on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/recorded-future-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-gemini-advisory-301248485.html">to acquire</a> earlier this year for $52 million in a bid to bolster its own threat intelligence capabilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Recorded Future told TechCrunch that future investments could also be made with an eye to acquiring, but added that funding could also be given purely on the basis that the startup would make a good business or technology partner. Recorded Future was itself acquired by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/insight-partners-bags-threat-intel-company-recorded-future-for-780m/"> private equity firm Insight Partners back in 2019 for $780 million</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The acquisition effectively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/insight-partners-bags-threat-intel-company-recorded-future-for-780m/">bought out the company&#8217;s earlier investors</a>, including Google&#8217;s venture arm GV, and In-Q-Tel, the non-profit venture arm of the U.S. intelligence community.</span></p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of the fund, Michael Triplett, managing partner at Insight Partners, said: “Cyberattacks continue to impact global enterprises across the globe, and we’re excited to see Recorded Future invest in intelligence startups tackling the business-critical issues that organizations face today.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The Intelligence Fund will provide the resources needed by entrepreneurs to build applications with data and mathematics at the core.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the pandemic hit last year, <a href="http://punchbowl.com">Punchbowl</a>, an online party planning service was left in the lurch with gatherings all but shut down, but instead of lamenting the situation, founder and CEO Matt Douglas went to work to rethink the company&#8217;s approach. He started by expanding the company&#8217;s online greeting card business, which until that point had been a small part of the revenue mix. Then he began talking to investors about a cash influx with an eye toward adding video to the platform.</p>
<p>That all culminated in a slew of announcements today. For starters, the company pulled in $5 million from SG Credit Partners. Douglas then turned around and bought online video production service <a href="http://vidhug.com">VidHug</a> and rebranded it for his platform as <a href="https://www.memento.com/">Memento</a>. Finally, he invested in a couple of apps designed to draw new parents to the service early in their children&#8217;s lives. More on those shortly.</p>
<p>When the government made the no-gatherings rule official, Punchbowl needed a plan. &#8220;So we took our team and we put our energy towards a product that was less than 10% of our business prior to the pandemic and that is greeting cards,&#8221; Douglas said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He made the greeting cards more personalized by adding a video component. His team got that going pretty fast, putting it together by Mother&#8217;s Day 2020 to include a visual message at a time when people couldn&#8217;t get together in person. But he wanted something more than that, and he dove into researching the video montage market. That ultimately led to him connecting with the founders of VidHug and making an offer to buy the Canadian startup.</p>
<p>Memento helps you make and collect video clips, pull them together into a video and choose music and backgrounds in a friendly interface, putting basic video production within reach of of just about any user.</p>

<p>Douglas sees adding video as more than a consumer play though. He believes with Memento, he can also attract business customers to use video &#8212; for example, as a way to welcome new employees, especially in distributed organizations, or to make a good-bye video for a long-time employee leaving the company, and in this way begin to expand the platform to include not only consumer customers, but businesses too.</p>
<p>While he was at it, he invested in some apps directed at new parents, particularly moms, including <a href="https://www.qeepsake.co/">Qeepsake</a> and <a href="https://www.pumpspotting.com/">pumpspotting</a>. Qeepsake is an app that prompts parents with a text to collect different memories of their children&#8217;s lives and then print them in a keep-sake book. It&#8217;s aimed at parents who never got around to making that baby book. Pumpspotting helps support breastfeeding moms, whether they are at home or work, and it also provides resources for their employers to support nursing moms as well.</p>
<p>He believes that by attracting parents at the earliest time in their childrens&#8217; lives, he can get them to use other Punchbowl services to plan birthday parties and other events, add video memories, and build long-term brand loyalty along the way.</p>
<p>Douglas has been at this since 2007 when he conceived and launched Punchbowl, and while he says he has had offers over the years to be acquired, he never wanted to sell. Although 2020 might have been the toughest year ever for his party planning business, he used the crisis to rethink it, and in the process may have built something that can survive and thrive longer term with a wider variety of services and revenue streams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over three months after its last funding round, European fintech giant </span><a href="http://klarna.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is announcing today that it has raised another $639 million at a staggering post-money valuation of $45.6 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rumors swirled in recent weeks that Klarna had raised more money at a valuation north of $40 billion. But the Swedish </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy now, pay later behemoth and upstart bank </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined to comment until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 led the latest round, which also included participation from existing investors Adit</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures, Honeycomb Asset Management and WestCap Group. The new valuation represents a 47.3% increase over Klarna’s post-money valuation of $31 billion</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/invest-now-sell-later/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early March</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it raised $1 billion, and a 330% increase over its $10.6 billion valuation at the time of its $650 million raise </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/klarna-raises-650-million-at-a-10-6-billion-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Previous backers include Sequoia Capital, SilverLake, Dragoneer and Ant Group, among others.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest financing cements 16-year-old Klarna’s position as the highest-valued private fintech in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, Klarna CEO and founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski said the company has seen explosive growth in the U.S. and plans to use its new capital in part to continue to grow there and globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, over the past year, the fintech has seen &#8220;massive momentum&#8221; in the country, with more than 18 million American consumers now using Klarna, he said. That’s up from 10 million at the end of last year’s third quarter, and up 118% year over year. Klarna is now live with 24 of the top 100 U.S. retailers, which it says is “more than any of its competitors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Klarna is live in 20 markets, has more than</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 90 million global active users and more than 2 million transactions a day conducted on its platform. The company’s momentum can be seen in its impressive financial results. In the first quarter, Klarna notched $18.1 billion in volume compared to $9.9 billion in the prior year first quarter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all of 2020, it processed $53 billion in volume. To put that into context; Affirm’s financial report in May projected it would process $8.04 billion in volume for the entire fiscal year of 2021 and Afterpay is projecting $16 billion in volume for its entire fiscal year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March 2021 also represented a record month for global shopping volume with $6.9 billion of purchases made through the Klarna platform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in 2020, Klarna hit over a billion in revenue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company was profitable for its first 14 years of life, it has not been profitable the last two, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski, and that’s been by design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve scaled up so massively in investments in our growth and technology, but running on a loss is very odd for us,” he told TechCrunch. “We will get back to profitability soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna has entered six new markets this year alone, including New Zealand and France, where it just launched this week. It is planning to expand into a number of new markets this year. The company has about 4,000 employees with several hundred in the U.S. in markets such as New York and Los Angeles. It also has offices in Stockholm, London, Manchester, Berlin, Madrid and Amsterdam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Klarna is partnered with over 250,000 retailers around the world (including Macy’s, Ikea, Nike, Saks), its buy now, pay later feature is also available direct to consumers via its shopping app. This means that consumers can use Klarna’s app to pay immediately or later, as well as manage spending and view available balances. They can also do things like initiate refunds, track deliveries and get price-drop notifications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our shopping browser allows users to use Klarna everywhere,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one else is offering that, and are rather limited to integrating with merchants.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other things the company plans to do with its new capital is focus on acquisitions, particularly acqui-hires, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski. According to </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/klarna"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company has made nine known acquisitions over time &#8212; most recently picking up Los Gatos-based content creation services provider Toplooks.ai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re the market leader in this space and we want to find new partners that want to support us in this,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski told TechCrunch. “That </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gives us better prerequisites to be successful going forward. Now we have more cash and money available to invest further in the long term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Klarna has long been rumored to be going public via a direct listing. Siemiatkowski said that the company in many ways already acts like a public company in that it offers stock to all its employees, and reports financials &#8212; giving the impression that the company is not in a hurry to go the public route.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We report quarterly to national authorities and are a fully regulated bank so do all the things you expect to see from public companies such as risk control and compliance,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re reaching a point for it to be a natural evolution for the company to IPO. But we’re not preparing to IPO anytime soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its last funding round, Klarna announced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GiveOne</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">initiative to support planet health. With this round, the company is again giving 1% of the equity raised back to the planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, its investors are bullish on what the company is doing and its market position. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yanni Pipilis, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, said the company’s growth</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded on a deep understanding of how the purchasing behaviors of consumers are</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">changing,” an evolution SoftBank believes is only accelerating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Munson, founder and CIO of Adit Ventures, said his firm believes the “best is yet to come as Klarna multiplies their addressable market through global expansion.”</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Siemiatkowski, what Klarna is trying to achieve is to compete with the $1 trillion-plus credit card industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We really see right now all the signs are there. True competition is coming to this space, this decade,” he said. “This is an opportunity to genuinely disrupt the retail banking space.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft will soon launch a dedicated device for game streaming, the company announced today. It&#8217;s also working with a number of TV manufacturers to build the Xbox experience right into their internet-connected screens and Microsoft plans to bring build cloud gaming to the PC Xbox app later this year, too, with a focus on play-before-you-buy scenarios.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what these new game streaming devices will look like. Microsoft didn&#8217;t provide any further details. But chances are, we&#8217;re talking about either a Chromecast-like streaming stick or a small Apple TV-like box. So far, we also don&#8217;t know which TV manufacturers it will partner with.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Microsoft is bullish about cloud gaming. With Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, it&#8217;s already making it possible for its subscribers to play more than 100 console games on Android, streamed from the Azure cloud, for example. In a few weeks, it&#8217;ll open cloud gaming in the browser on Edge, Chrome and Safari, to all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers (it&#8217;s currently in limited beta). And it is bringing Game Pass Ultimate to Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Japan later this year, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In many ways, Microsoft is unbundling gaming from the hardware &#8212; similar to what Google is trying with Stadia (an effort that, so far, has fallen flat for Google) and Amazon with Luna. The major advantage Microsoft has here is a large library of popular games, something that&#8217;s mostly missing on competing services, with the exception of Nvidia&#8217;s GeForce Now platform &#8212; though that one has a different business model since its focus is not on a subscription but on allowing you to play the games you buy in third-party stores like Steam or the Epic store.</p>
<p>What Microsoft clearly wants to do is expand the overall Xbox ecosystem, even if that means it sells fewer dedicated high-powered consoles. The company likens this to the music industry&#8217;s transition to cloud-powered services backed by all-you-can-eat subscription models.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that games, that interactive entertainment, aren’t really about hardware and software. It’s not about pixels. It’s about people. Games bring people together,&#8221;<br />
said Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox head Phil Spencer. &#8220;Games build bridges and forge bonds, generating mutual empathy among people all over the world. Joy and community -that’s why we’re here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft says it&#8217;s not doing away with dedicated hardware, though, and is already working on the next generation of its console hardware &#8212; but don&#8217;t expect a new Xbox console anytime soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world seems to move faster every year, and yet, nothing feels slower than the speed by which paychecks get distributed. In the United States, work conducted the day after a pay period will take two weeks just to process, with a check or direct deposit coming another week or two later. For the tens of millions of employees who live paycheck-to-paycheck, that multi-week delay can be the difference of making a rent check — or not.</p>
<p>A variety of startups have approached this problem with different solutions, and one of the newest and most compelling offerings is Clair.</p>
<p>Using its own base of capital, New York City-based <a href="https://getclair.com">Clair</a> offers instant — and most importantly — free earned wage advances to workers by integrating into existing HR technology platforms. It works with both full-time employees and also gig workers, and it offers a suite of online and mobile apps for workers to make sense of their finances and ask for an earned wage advance.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded in late 2019 by CEO Nico Simko, COO Alex Kostecki and CPO Erich Nussbaumer, and today, the company announced that it raised $15 million in Series A funding led by Kareem Zaki of Thrive Capital, who will join the company’s board of directors. Just a few months ago, Clair had announced a $4.5 million seed round led by Upfront Ventures, bringing its total funding to $19.5 million.</p>
<p>“Pay advance” or “earned wage advance” (there is a slight distinction) have been the Silicon Valley euphemism for payday loan, an industry that has been plagued with allegations of fraud, deceit and rapacious greed that have bilked workers out of their hard-earned paychecks through usurious interest rates.</p>
<p>What sets Clair apart is that its offering is free to workers. Since it connects directly into HR systems, the startup takes on significantly less financial risk than traditional payday lenders, who don’t have access to the payroll data that Clair is able to analyze.</p>
<p>For Simko, one of his goals is simply to see the elimination of the traditional industry entirely. “I have a payday lender just in front of my apartment in Brooklyn and there is a long line on the 25th of every month, and I am not going to stop until that line disappears,” he said. “Success for us is just to become the winner in earned wage access.”</p>
<p>He is Argentine-Swiss, and came to the States to attend Harvard, where he met Nussbaumer. He ended up working at J.P. Morgan focused on the payments market. He stayed in touch with Kostecki, whose families are good friends, and the Swiss trio decided to go after this problem, partly inspired by Uber’s instant pay feature that it introduced in 2016 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/05/ubers-instant-pay-has-cashed-out-1-3b-to-drivers-in-just-one-year/">which proved wildly successful</a>.</p>

Image Credits: Clair</p></div></p>
<p>Instead of making money on interest rates, fees, or tips, Clair instead wants to be the bank and financial service provider of choice for workers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/coatue-direct-deposits-20m-into-pinwheel-a-payroll-api-for-neobanks/">As I noted last week about Pinwheel</a>, an API platform for payroll, owning the direct deposit relationship with a worker all but guarantees they will conduct the vast majority of their financial transactions through that particular bank account.</p>
<p>Clair offers free instant pay advances as a gateway to its other offerings, which include spending and savings accounts, a debit card, a virtual in-app debit card, and financial planning tools. Simko said, “Our business model is to give earned wage access free for people and then sign them up automatically for a digital bank, and then we make money the same way Chime makes money, which is interchange fees.”</p>
<p>In fact, he and the company believe in that model so much, it will actually pay human capital technology platforms like workforce management and payroll systems to integrate with Clair as an inducement. It offers a recurring revenue fee stream for HR tools based on the number of users who join Clair, regardless of how much those workers use the software. We are “really going down the thesis of embedded fintech,” Simko said. “Employees start spending money on their Clair card, and we distribute that back to our [HR tech] partners.”</p>
<p>Clair joins a number of other companies in this space, which is becoming ever more heated as the perceived opportunity in financial services remains high among investors. Last year, payroll platform Gusto announced that it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/gusto-is-expanding-from-payroll-into-a-full-suite-financial-wellness-platform/">expand from purely payroll to a financial wellness platform</a>, which is partially based on its instant earned wage advances or what it dubs Cashout. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/19/even-raises-40m-to-transform-the-working-class-to-the-savings-class/">We’ve covered Even</a>, which is one of the originals in this space with a major partnership with Walmart, as well as neobank Dave, which offers pay advance features with a tipping revenue model. Dave just <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/mark-cuban-backed-banking-app-dave-going-public-via-4-billion-spac.html">announced a $4 billion valued SPAC with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings III</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Clair’s angle is differentiated as the race to lock in every person globally with new financial services heats up. Simko says he sees a gargantuan opportunity to be the “Alipay” of the United States, noting that unlike China with Alipay, Nubank in Brazil and increasingly Latin America, and N26 and Revolut in Europe, there is still an opportunity for a comprehensive neobank to take over the U.S. market.</p>
<p>With the new funding, the company will continue to expand its product offerings, exploring areas like health care and debt repayment. “I can give APR not based on their credit score but on their employer’s credit score, which is the multi-billion dollar idea here,” Simko said. The team is nominally hubbed in New York with roughly half of the 25 or so person team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/stripe-acquires-taxjar-to-add-cloud-based-automated-sales-tax-tools-into-its-payments-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring sales tax specialist TaxJar in April</a>, today Stripe is making another big move in the area of tax. The $95 billion payments behemoth is launching a new product called Stripe Tax, which will provide automatic, updated sales tax calculations (covering sales tax, VAT, and GST) and related accounting services to Stripe payments customers initially in some 30 countries and across the U.S.</p>
<p>Stripe Tax is a separate service from TaxJar, but the two are not unconnected. As Stripe Tax was being built out of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/04/stripe-will-establish-an-engineering-hub-in-dublin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe&#8217;s offices in Dublin</a> over the last several months, Stripe&#8217;s business lead for EMEA Matt Henderson told me that the team had identified TaxJar as a strong company in the field. That ultimately led to M&amp;A between them.</p>
<p>Sales tax &#8212; and specifically a more seamless way to deal with charging and tracking sales tax &#8212; is a painful issue for people doing business online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Digital and physical goods are taxed in over 130 countries, Stripe said, and within that there can be a huge amount of variation and compliance complexity, since codes get updated all the time, too. Mishandled sales tax, meanwhile, can result in pretty hefty fines, sometimes up to 30% interest on past-due amounts.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, a sales tax tool has been the most-requested feature from Stripe&#8217;s customers, Henderson said, a call that presumably only got louder in the last year, as e-commerce and digital transactions went through the roof with Covid-19.</p>
<p>Arguably, that makes Stripe Tax one of the company&#8217;s more significant product launches, not to mention the first since announcing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monster funding round earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, Stripe customers would have resorted to using a third-party service (like TaxJar) to work out sales tax. Or, more typically, those Stripe customers would have opted to limit the number of places they sold goods and services, in order to minimize the pain of dealing with multiple, complex, and usually quite localized tax codes.</p>
<p>“No one leaps out of bed in the morning excited to deal with taxes,” said John Collison, co-founder and president of Stripe in a statement. “For most businesses, managing tax compliance is a painful distraction. We simplify everything about calculating and collecting sales taxes, VAT, and GST, so our users can focus on building their businesses.”</p>
<p>Stripe said that a survey of its customers found that two-thirds of respondents said the challenge of implementing sales tax actually limited their growth.</p>
<p>TaxJar has built a strong system for handling that, but the company &#8212; based out of Massachusetts &#8212; is primarily focused on the U.S. market, which has sales tax that is complicated enough (there are 11,000 different tax jurisdictions in the country).</p>
<p>That leaves a lot on the table for building out sales tax tools for the rest of the world: the wider focus of Stripe Tax thus fills a particular geographical gap for the company, regardless of how well TaxJar and Stripe integrate over time.</p>
<p>There is another key difference worth noting between the two.</p>
<p>TaxJar came to Stripe&#8217;s attention with an established operation &#8212; 15,000 customers at the time of the announcement. Stripe (wisely) bolted that on as a standalone business, which means that new and existing customers that use TaxJar can continue to use it as is. That is to say, at least for now, they do not need to be Stripe payments customers in order to use TaxJar, even if the integration between the two platforms will only improve over time.</p>
<p>Stripe Tax, on the other hand, is being built from the ground up as a product aimed specifically at increasing touchpoints and stickiness with Stripe customers.</p>
<p>Stripe Tax provides real-time tax calculation based on customer location and product sold; transparent itemizing for customers; tax ID management in areas (like Europe) where business customers can provide their code and get a reverse charge on tax if they are under a certain turnover threshold themselves; and reconciliation and reporting across all transactions to make filing and remittance easier.</p>
<p>But, there is for now no way to use Stripe Tax outside of Stripe payments.</p>
<p>This could pose some problems for some customers. These days, many of the strongest retailers will take an &#8216;omnichannel&#8217; approach that might cover selling through marketplaces, selling through websites, selling through social media and more &#8212; and not all of those experiences may be powered by Stripe. It will be worth watching whether future iterations of Stripe Tax can account for that.</p>
<p>Stripe&#8217; most significant product launch prior to Stripe Tax &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe Treasury</a> last December &#8212; underscores how the company is currently very focused on diversifying outside of its basic payments business and opening the platform to much wider, more scaled transactions.</p>
<p>Treasury, which is still in invite-only mode, saw Stripe partner with established banks to provide a business banking service, providing a way for its customers to handle money that they generate from their Stripe-powered businesses.</p>
<p>The full country list where Stripe Tax is launching is Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the early detection and treatment of health conditions, easy access to primary healthcare is crucial</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primary healthcare is best delivered by teams of primary care clinicians coordinating care between them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ubiquitous access to such care is scant across Sub-Saharan Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a real opportunity for digital healthcare platforms to scale access to team-based care across the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They can reduce the cost of quality care while improving health outcomes, reach patients in remote areas and reduce the pressure on the traditional medical support systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic has seen such platforms scale globally, and Africa is not exempt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new platform (without a name yet) is launching out of South Africa and it wants to provide accessible quality care for Africans with its telehealth service. Today, it has closed a $3 million pre-Series A round to that end</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you&#8217;re wondering why the platform doesn&#8217;t have a name (I am too), but what&#8217;s interesting is the fact that a VC firm (Webrock Ventures) and two health tech companies (Healthforce.io and Doktor.se) joined forces to launch this new venture</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s summarized information on the trio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://webrockventures.com/en/">Webrock Ventures</a> is a Sweden-based investment company that employs a venture-building model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the firm partners with tech companies in Sweden and combines its cash with the company&#8217;s business models to create portfolio businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It does this while maintaining a sizeable stake in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://healthforce.io/">Healthforce</a> is a South Africa-based health tech company that tries to improve healthcare through multidisciplinary clinical teams</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, it has set up nurses in over 450 clinics across the country while conducting more than 1 million nurse consultations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthforce also has a telemedicine play with over 110,000 consultations since launching the service last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Sweden-based telehealth company, <a href="https://doktor.se/">Doktor.se</a> allows patients to contact healthcare professionals through their smartphones across the whole spectrum of primary care</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most of its customers are in Europe, as well as in Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why form a partnership to launch a telehealth product in South Africa with a plan for further roll-out in other African countries down the line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globally, telehealth investments have skyrocketed and increased by more than 50% since the start of the pandemic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many of the fastest-growing economies globally, investors and companies (in this case, Webrock and Doktor.se) are now turning to Africa as a major growth region for such high-demand services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164287" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164287" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164287" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Saul-Kornik-CEO-Co-Founder.jpg?w=680" alt="South African telehealth" width="680" height="606" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Saul-Kornik-CEO-Co-Founder.jpg 1780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Saul-Kornik-CEO-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=150,134 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Saul-Kornik-CEO-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=300,267 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Saul-Kornik-CEO-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=768,684 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Saul-Kornik-CEO-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=680,606 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Saul-Kornik-CEO-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=1536,1369 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Saul-Kornik-CEO-Co-Founder.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164287" class="wp-caption-text">Saul Kornik (CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Healthforce and CEO of the new venture)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Doktor.se has two models for commercialising its telemedicine application. The first is to use its technology to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deliver healthcare services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second model licenses the core technology to third parties in markets in which Doktor.se has no intention of expanding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doktor.se achieved this with Brazilian health tech startup ViBe Saúde (via Webrock), and last year, the platform had over 1.2 million patient consultations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It plans to do the same by licensing its technology to deliver care through Healthforce across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By forming a new partnership, a completely new opportunity is set up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthforce can leverage its current position to take core tech from Doktor.se to a new direct-to-patient market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the background is Webrock, a willing investment machine set up to scale the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new venture will focus on the uninsured, B2C segment through a freemium-type offering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform offers on-demand and scheduled consultations with nurses, general practitioners and mental health professionals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also provides chronic care management and will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be integrated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Healthforce’s broader primary care offering</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/saulkornik">Saul Kornik</a>, co-founder and CEO at Healthforce, will resume a new role at the newly formed company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to him, the partnership gives Healthforce an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> product to add to its healthcare product stack</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it gives Doktor.se the ability to generate license fee revenue from a new market, while Webrock has an opportunity to invest in yet another large developing market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Webrock and Healthforce partnered to bring funding and strategic/operational capacity to this new pan-African direct-to-patient play, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;All existing independent operations will continue. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, under the NewCo, Healthforce as a major shareholder will expand its primary care product stack and Doktor.se will generate revenue off license fees earned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sub-Saharan Africa has a healthcare market of about $90 billion. But health insurance coverage is in single-digit (percentage-wise) across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa except for South Africa with 16% coverage. Kornik says the three parties want to tackle a large portion of this challenge and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are aligned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how the healthcare system in Africa could look if it were functioning </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">optimally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is a pure-play provider-of-healthcare venture. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this pan-African venture, we will deliver high-quality healthcare at low cost to 75 million people through telemedicine, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> putting healthcare in the palm of their hands,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner at Webrock Ventures <a href="https://webrockventures.com/en/about/team/#:~:text=Joshin%20Raghubar&amp;text=He%20is%20the%20founder%20of,and%20a%20Yale%20World%20Fellow.">Joshin Raghubar</a> and co-founder and CEO of Doktor, <a href="https://se.linkedin.com/in/martin-lindman-304b4438">Martin Lindman</a>, are enthusiastic about the opportunity Africa presents due to its large population and increasing smartphone penetration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>This new venture, which should hopefully have a name soon, is one of the few health tech platforms based in South Africa that have raised seven-figure sums in a fintech-dominated year. In February, <a href="https://hearxgroup.com/">hearX Group, a company that specializes in making hearing healthcare technologies</a>, raised $8.3 million Series A to expand into the U.S. April saw Quro Medical <a href="https://www.quromedical.co.za/">close a $1.1 million seed round</a> to scale its service that manages ill patients in the comfort of their homes. Judging by the spacing between each fundraise, we should see more from the country before the year runs out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eightfold AI, a startup which uses deep learning and artificial intelligence to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/two-facebook-and-google-geniuses-are-combining-search-and-ai-to-transform-hr/">help companies find, recruit and retain workers</a>, said on Thursday it has raised $220 million in a new round as it looks to accelerate its growth.</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the Series E round of the five-year-old startup, which is now valued at $2.1 billion, up from $1 billion in Series E last October, <a href="http://eightfold.ai">Eightfold AI</a> founder and chief executive <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashutoshgarg893/">Ashutosh Garg</a> told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>Existing investors General Catalyst, Capital One Ventures, Foundation Capital, IVP and Lightspeed Venture Partners also participated in the new round, which brings the startup’s all-time raise to over $410 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Mountain View-based startup provides its clients with a talent acquisition platform that helps them identify suitable candidates and import and filter thousands of resumes. One of Eightfold AI&#8217;s missions is to help companies reduce biases in their hirings, so it masks candidates&#8217; personal information during evaluation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of searching for a job, a candidate can upload their resume and the system will tell the most relevant job for that candidate in real-time,&#8221; explained Garg. &#8220;What this does is, it reduces the drop-off rate. And our clients see more applications &#8212; and field more diverse applications.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup, which has amassed clients in over 100 countries and offers its platform in over a dozen languages, also enables employers to deploy the Eightfold platform internally and help employees discover promotions and new role opportunities within their organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has helped businesses almost double their internal mobility,&#8221; said Garg, who previously worked at IBM Research, where he filed patents on understanding people behavior, and Google, where he worked on the company&#8217;s user personalization efforts.</p>
<p>Recruiting remains a big global problem and an untapped opportunity. Garg said solving this requires expertise with sifting through a plethora of data points and right talent. Eightfold itself analyzes data it sources from a range of places including employers&#8217; sales, customer management and human resources as well as public sources such as patent sites and publications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transforming HR and global talent further unlocks trillions of dollars&#8217; worth of human potential. SoftBank shares our bold vision, and we are excited to welcome them as our partner,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the state of Indiana, Eightfold maintains partnership for people applying for unemployment insurance to build up their resumes and find job opportunities instantly. The startup also has a program for veterans in the U.S. to help them find opportunities relevant to their skills, said Garg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Powered by AI and machine learning, Eightfold&#8217;s platform provides global enterprises with a single solution for managing the entire talent lifecycle, including hiring, retaining, and growing a diverse global workforce,&#8221; said Deep Nishar, Senior Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers and who previously worked for nearly six years at LinkedIn. &#8220;We are pleased to partner with Ashutosh and the Eightfold team to support their ambition of transforming how enterprises manage talent and how people build their careers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eightfold will deploy the fresh capital to accelerate its expansion efforts and invest in hiring more data scientists and engineers, Garg said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://osome.com/">Osome</a>, a startup that combines multiple corporate services for SMEs into one “super app,” has raised a $16 million Series A. The round included returning investors Target Global, AltaIR Capital and Phystech Ventures, and new backers S16VC and venture capitalist Peng T. Ong, who joined as an angel investor.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based startup’s last funding round was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/singapore-based-digital-business-assistant-osome-raises-3-million/">$3 million announced in November</a>. Its Series A brings Osome’s total funding since it was founded in 2017 to $24.5 million. It now claims to be used by 6,000 companies in Singapore, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, giving it $9.5 million in annual recurring revenue and 100% year-over-year revenue growth.</p>
<p>Its Series A will be used on international expansion and product integrations. Osome, which employs a total of 200 people, has seen fast adoption by e-commerce companies in particular, and plans to launch more products and apps for the sector over the next 18 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Singapore-based digital business assistant Osome raises $3 million&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/singapore-based-digital-business-assistant-osome-raises-3-million/embed/#?secret=sAhuCxOBjE" data-secret="sAhuCxOBjE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Co-founder and chief executive officer Victor Lysenko told TechCrunch that the company started “looking at the e-commerce segment some time ago, but wanted to be confident that our product can handle the increased complexity and transaction volume of e-commerce businesses before launching marketing. The pandemic has caused the e-commerce industry to grow significantly faster and that was also a factor for us.”</p>
<p>He added that Osome will add integrations with multiple e-commerce platforms and administrative services, with the goal of cutting hours out of the time e-commerce company owners spend on accounting each week.</p>
<p>Osome’s flagship product is online accounting services for SMEs, connecting companies with chartered accountants. It also offers corporate secretary services, including business registration, compliance and taxation. The platform uses machine learning tech to automate many tasks—for example, it categorizes, tags and stores documents, creates management reports and tax returns and files paperwork on time.</p>
<p>Lysenko said entrepreneurs on average spend 68% of their time dealing with back-office tasks, instead of strategizing their company’s goals. Osome is meant to reduce the burden of administrative work on small businesses and demand for its services grew during the pandemic as companies moved more of their operations online.</p>
<p>Singapore makes it relatively easy to incorporate businesses online, so several other startups in the same space are based there. These include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/sleek/">Sleek</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/lanturn-a-singaporean-tech-enabled-corporate-services-provider-raises-3-million-seed-round/">Lanturn</a> and BlueMeg, all focused on automating accounting and other time-consuming tasks for SMEs.</p>
<p>In a statement about the funding, S16VC co-founder Aleks Shamis said, “I’ve done business with small and medium e-commerce in 10 countries and see the same inefficiencies in manual accounting across all of them. It is a real problem that will definitely be solved, and Osome is technologically and traction-wise among the few companies in the world in getting there.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two profound problems face the higher education sector globally &#8212; affordability and relevance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you live in Africa, Europe, or the U.S., a major reason why people don&#8217;t go to university or college or even drop out because they cannot afford tuition fees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, relevance shows the huge gap between what traditional universities teach and what global employers actually look for. It&#8217;s not a secret that universities focus a bit too much on theory.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, there has been the emergence of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alternative credential providers trying to provide students with the necessary skills to earn and make a living. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford University is one of such platforms, and today, it has a closed $10.8 million pre-Series A funding round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubai-based VC Global Ventures led the new round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include Future Africa&#8217;s new thematic fund (focused on education), angel investors, and family offices. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unnamed VCs from 10 countries, including the U.S., U.K., France, Dubai, Switzerland, Qatar, Nigeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, also took part</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, Nexford has raised $15.3 million, following the first tranche of $4.5 million in seed funding raised two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ftarzi">Fadl Al Tarzi</a> launched <a href="https://www.nexford.org/">Nexford University</a> in 2019. The tech-enabled university is filling affordability and relevance gaps by providing access to quality and affordable education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That way, you get the best of both worlds,&#8221; CEO Al Tarzi said to TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You get practical skills that you can put to work immediately or for your future career while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keeping a job</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the whole experience </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is designed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a learning as a service model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford Unversity lets students study at their own pace. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they apply and get admitted into either a degree program or a course program, they choose how fast or slow they want the program to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164258" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164258" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-Headshot_Fadl.jpg?w=680" alt="Nexford University" width="680" height="646" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-Headshot_Fadl.jpg 2362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-Headshot_Fadl.jpg?resize=150,143 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-Headshot_Fadl.jpg?resize=300,285 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-Headshot_Fadl.jpg?resize=768,730 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-Headshot_Fadl.jpg?resize=680,646 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-Headshot_Fadl.jpg?resize=1536,1459 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-Headshot_Fadl.jpg?resize=2048,1946 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-Headshot_Fadl.jpg?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164258" class="wp-caption-text">Fadl Al Tarzi (CEO, Nexford University)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO says whatever students learn on the platform is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> applicable to their jobs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Currently, Nexford offers undergraduate degrees in business administration; 360</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">°</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marketing; AI &amp; automation; building a tech startup; business analytics; business in emerging markets; digital transformation; e-commerce; and product management. Its graduate degrees are business administration, advanced AI, e-commerce, hyperconnectivity, sustainability, and world business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford&#8217;s tuition structure is very different from traditional universities because it&#8217;s modelled monthly. Its accredited degrees cost between $3,000 to $4,000 paid in monthly instalments. In Nigeria, for instance, an MBA costs about $160 a month, while a bachelor degree costs $80 a month. But the catch for the monthly instalment structure means the faster a learner graduates, the less they pay.</span></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s it like learning with Nexford University?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford University doesn&#8217;t offer standardized and theoretical tests or assignments as most traditional universities do. Al Tarzi says the company employs what he calls a competency-based education model where students prove mastery by working on practical projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, a student working on an accounting course will most likely need to create a P&amp;L statement, analyze balance sheets and identify where the error is to correct it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform then gives the student different scenarios showing companies with different revenues and expense levels. The task? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To analyse and extract certain ratios to help make sense of which company is profitable and the other unit economics involved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Nexford plays in the edtech space, Al Tarzi doesn&#8217;t think the company is an edtech company. As a licensed and accredited online university, Nexford has a huge amount of automation across the organization and provides students with support from faculty and career advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After offering degrees, Nexford puts on its placement hats by fixing its graduates with partner employers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a big shortage of jobs in Nigeria, and despite the high unemployment, it&#8217;s actually difficult to find </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> qualified entry-level graduates. So Nexford has carried out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> partnerships where employers sponsor their employees or soon-to-be employees for upskilling and rescaling purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An illustration is with Sterling Bank, a local bank in the country. Most Nigerian banks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have yearly routines where they hire graduates and put them on weeks-long training programs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sterling Bank employs any candidate it feels did great after</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the capital intensive (eight weeks in most cases) programs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what Nexford has done is to partner with Sterling to fund the tuition for high school leavers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When these students go through Nexford&#8217;s programs for the first year, they begin to get part-time placements at Sterling</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Upon graduation, they get a job in the bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That saves Sterling the training cost and our tuition fee is almost equal to the training that they provided for students</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, students start paying back once they get placed, so it&#8217;s a win-win.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164263 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="290" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png 1349w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?resize=768,328 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?resize=680,290 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-151.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford University has learners from 70 countries, with Nigeria its biggest market yet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nexford also has blue-chip partnerships with Microsoft, LinkedIn Learning, and IBM </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to provide access to tools, courses and programmes to improve the learning experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major gains of this learning experience is how it prepares people for remote jobs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford is bullish on its virtual skills grid, where people will get jobs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">remotely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regardless of their location on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Across Sub Saharan Africa by the year 2026, there&#8217;s gonna be a shortage of about 100 million university seats as a result of huge growth in youth population not met by growth and supply. Even if you want to build universities fast, you wouldn&#8217;t be able to meet the demand. And that spirals down to the job market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the local economy will produce enough jobs in Nigeria, for instance. But we want to enable people to get remote jobs across the world and not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have to migrate.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Nexford&#8217;s revenues grew by 300%. This year, the company hopes to triple the size of its enrollment from last year, the CEO said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nexford is big on designing students&#8217; curriculum based on analysis of what their employer needs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Al Tarzi tells me that the company always follow the Big Data approach, asking themselves, &#8220;how do we find out what employers worldwide are looking for and keep our curriculum alive and relevant?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We develop proprietary technology that enables us to analyze job vacancies as well as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other data sources; use AI to understand how those data sets and build a curriculum based on those findings. So, in short, we start with the end in mind,&#8221; he answers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is keen on improving its technology regardless. It wants to analyse skills more accurately and automate more functions to enhance user experience. That&#8217;s what the funding will be used for in addition to fuelling its regional expansion plans (particularly in Asia) and investing in growth and product development. Per the latter,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the online university says it will be launching partner programs with more employers globally to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both placement and upskilling and rescaling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merging both worlds of tech and the traditional university model is no easy feat. The former is about efficiency, user-centricity, product, among others. The latter embodies rigidity and continues to lag behind fast-paced innovation. And while t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here&#8217;s been a boom in edtech, most startups try to circumvent the industry&#8217;s bureaucracy by launching an app or a MOOC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nexford&#8217;s model of running a degree-granting, licensed, accredited, and regulated university is more challenging but in it lies so much opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/eaboyeji">Iyin Aboyeji</a>, Future Africa general partner CEO, understands this. It&#8217;s one reason why the company is the first investment out of Future Africa&#8217;s soon-to-be-launched fund focused on the future of learning and why he believes the company is a game-changer for higher education in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the pandemic, while many universities in Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were shut</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down due to labour disputes, Nexford was already delivering an innovative and affordable new model of online higher education designed for a skills-based economy.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For general partner at Global Ventures <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/noor-sweid-4b5233">Noor Sweid</a>, Nexford University is redressing the mismatch between the supply of talent and the demands of today&#8217;s digital economy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are thrilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to partner with Fadl and the Nexford team on their journey toward expanding access to universal quality higher education in emerging markets,” she said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://yousign.com">Yousign</a> has raised a $36.6 million Series A funding round (€30 million). <a href="https://leadedge.com">Lead Edge Capital</a> is leading the round and eFounders is investing once again in the company. Yousign, as the name suggests, is an e-signature provider that complies with European regulation on digital signatures.</p>
<p>While the company was originally founded in 2013, Yousign teamed up with startup studio <a href="https://www.efounders.com">eFounders</a> in 2019. Following this deal, eFounders has become a key shareholders and a strategic partner.</p>
<p>Things have changed quite a lot since then as the e-signature market has grown tremendously. You may be familiar with DocuSign, Adobe Sign, SignNow, HelloSign and a bunch of other players. But none of them have been designed for the European market from the ground up.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yousign wants to become the European alternative to these American companies. More specifically, the startup thinks it can convince small and medium companies that aren’t using an e-signature solution yet. Instead of asking DocuSign customers to switch, Yousign wants to convert new customers to e-signatures.</p>
<p>“Faced with American giants with large scopes and complex products, we have built a solution that is accessible and easy to use, allowing SMBs to sign their first documents within the hour, and not a month” Yousign co-founder and CEO Luc Pallavidino said in a statement.</p>
<p>Yousign is a certification authority and complies with eIDAS — a European framework for e-signatures. It means that signatures are legally binding and the service archives your documents in partnership with <a href="https://arkhineo.com">Arkhineo</a>.</p>
<p>Like other e-signature services, you can create document templates, approval workflows and reminders. Yousign makes sure the right person is signing the document with strong authentication processes and all events are timestamped. It’s a SaaS product, which means you have to pay a subscription fee to access the service.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Yousign wants to reach 50,000 European SMBs by 2024 — it has 6,000 clients today. That would represent an annual recurring revenue of $85 million (€70 million). In 2020 alone, the company grew drastically from 35 to 120 employees. The startup now plans to hire 150 additional employees over the next 18 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tata Digital, the subsidiary of Tata Sons, said on Thursday it is acquiring a majority stake in digital health startup 1mg, the latest in a series of investments as the salt-to-steel Indian conglomerate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/tata-digital-to-invest-75-million-in-curefit/">enters the digital consumer space</a>.</p>
<p>The firms didn&#8217;t share the financial details of the deal, but a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that 1mg has received over $220 million in primary and secondary investments &#8212; with participation from some existing investors &#8212; and is being valued at around $450 million. Tata Digital has acquired about 55% stake in the Indian startup, the person said, requesting anonymity as the specifics of the deal are private.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Tata Digital declined to comment. 1mg didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to insight firm Tracxn, 1mg had raised $156 million prior to Thursday&#8217;s announcement and was last valued at $242 million. 1mg counts Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Sequoia Capital India among its investors.</p>
<p>1mg is one of the largest players in the health space in India, where it competes with Prosus Ventures-backed PharmEasy, which leads the market. 1mg operates diagnostics labs, has a supply chain that covers over 20,000 Indian zipcodes, and is a major business-to-business distributor of medicines in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>Tata Digital said its investment in 1mg is in line with the giant&#8217;s &#8220;vision of creating a digital ecosystem which addresses the consumer needs across categories in a unified manner.&#8221; The giant, which announced plans to invest in fitness startup CureFit earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tata-group-reaches-agreement-to-buy-majority-stake-in-bigbasket/">acquired a majority stake in online grocer BigBasket</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to join hands with one of India&#8217;s most iconic and respected conglomerates,&#8221; said Prashant Tandon, co-founder and chief executive of 1mg, in a statement. &#8220;This marks a significant milestone in 1mg&#8217;s journey to make high quality healthcare products and services accessible to customers across India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tata, which owns consumer brands including Tata Tea, Tetley, Vitax, Eight O’Clock Coffee, Himalayan Natural Mineral Water, Tata Coffee Grand and Joekels, reaches over 200 million households in India and has an &#8220;unparalleled ability to leverage the Tata brand in consumer products,&#8221; wrote analysts at HDFC Bank last month.</p>

<p>Internet of Things devices are proliferating, making daily tasks more convenient for many people—but that comes at cost. The United Nations expects the amount of e-waste created globally <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/internet/the-internet-of-trash-iot-has-a-looming-ewaste-problem">to reach 52.2 million metric tons</a> this year, and a sizable portion of that are dead batteries.</p>
<p><a href="https://dracula-technologies.com/">Dracula Technologies</a>, a French startup that is currently <a href="https://virtual.computextaipei.com.tw/index">exhibiting virtually at Computex</a>, wants to help with its inkjet-printed organic photovoltaic (OPV, or organic solar cells) technology. Called LAYER (or Light As Your Energetic Response), Dracula Technologies’ OPV modules run indoors on natural or artificial ambient light, and can be used to power low-consumption indoor devices. Because they are printed and not made of silicon, the OPV modules&#8217; shape is more customizable and, unlike many batteries, it does not use rare earths or heavy metals. Instead, the modules are created from carbon-based material.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to being better for the environment, LAYER is also more economical—the company claims it can reduce the total cost of ownership by four times compared to batteries.</p>

<p>Dracula Technologies is currently working with manufacturers, including a partnership with Japanese semiconductor company Renesas Electronics and AND Technology Research (ANDtr) to <a href="https://andtr.com/renesas-electronics-and-dracula-technologies-press-release">create a self-powering, battery-less IoT device</a> that can send messages through BLE to a mobile app.</p>
<p>Dracula Technologies was founded in 2011, after a project in collaboration with the CEA (Commissariat à l&#8217;énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives, or the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission), a public research organization. Chief executive officer Brice Cruchon saw the tech’s commercial potential and after six years of research and development, LAYER was launched through the <a href="https://hello-tomorrow.org/">Hello Tomorrow program</a> for deep tech startups</p>
<p>So far, Dracula Technologies has raised a total of 4.4 million euros (about $5.4 million USD), including a 2 million euros round in 2016 from angel investors for a pilot line, and 2.4 million euros raised last year from MGI Digital and ISRA Cards, which Dracula Technologies is using to increase the production of its photovoltaic modules during its pre-industrialization stage. The company plans to move to its industrial phase in 2024, with the goal of producing millions of modules per year.</p>
<p>MGI Digital, a digital printing and finishing tech company, and ISRA Cards, which makes high-value electronic cards (like licenses or gift and loyalty cards), are Dracula Technologies’ industrial partners. It is also part of the Solar Impulse Foundation’s #1000 Solutions, a guide to green energy solutions that can be implemented on a large scale.</p>
