										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toyota subsidiary Woven Planet Holdings has made its third acquisition in less than a year in its bid to invest in, develop and eventually bring future-of-transportation technologies like automated driving to market.</p>
<p>This time, it&#8217;s Renovo Motors, the automotive operating system developer based in Silicon Valley that made its first big splash in 2015, when it debuted a video of a self-driving DeLorean developed with Stanford doing autonomous doughnuts. Terms of the deal, which has closed, were not disclosed. Renovo, which will maintain its Silicon Valley office, will be integrated into Woven Planet&#8217;s 1,240-person operation.</p>
<p>Woven Planet, which earlier this year acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/toyotas-woven-planet-acquires-hd-mapping-startup-carmera/">mapping startup Carmera</a> and Lyft&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/lyft-sells-self-driving-unit-to-toyotas-woven-planet-for-550m/">autonomous driving unit,</a> Level 5, isn&#8217;t snapping up Renovo for its AV doughnut skills. The company <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is interested in Renovo&#8217;s vehicle operating system and how it might help speed up its own efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Renovo developed an </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">operating system designed to run apps in vehicles related to automated driving, maps and other mobility services that might be delivered to riders. The</span> operating system, called AWare OS, works a lot like how Google’s Android allows app developers to launch services in the smartphone market. It can even be compared, in a way, to Amazon Web Services’ on-demand cloud computing platform. This middleware, which is designed to be flexible without compromising security, provides a platform that other companies can use to deploy software.</p>
<p>With just 30 employees, Renovo was a small player in the booming and now consolidating autonomous vehicle industry. And yet, its operating system did get the attention of a number of AV developers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/31/renovo-os-self-driving-cars-aipod/">such as Voyage</a>, which has since been acquired by Cruise. The company also attracted several investors, including Verizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve become increasingly aware that the IP that Renovo developed was being seen as core to what automotive manufacturers want to do in the future,&#8221; Renovo co-founder and CEO Chris Heiser said in a recent interview. &#8220;As we&#8217;ve built these relationships and tried to understand how do we get to scale — and like, capital S, huge scale — it became increasingly clear to us that we had to find a partner that had the resources and had the backing of an automaker and that had millions and millions of cars to launch on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woven Planet sees Renovo&#8217;s OS as a means to help commercialize its own <a href="https://medium.com/tri-ad-techblog/introducing-arene-c0c3c887b52c">open vehicle development platform,</a> Arene, that it intends to bring to market by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Woven Planet Holdings, which folded in Toyota Research Institute &#8212; Advanced Development Inc. or TRI-AD, also includes an investment arm known as Woven Capital and Woven City, a testing ground for new technologies set in an interconnected smart city prototype. In February, Toyota broke ground at the Higashi-Fuji site in Susono City, Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Woven Capital kicked off off its new $800 million strategic fund by announcing an investment into autonomous delivery vehicle company Nuro.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/uks-whitehat-rebrands-as-multiverse-raises-44m-to-build-tech-apprenticeships-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranding</a> from White Hat and raising $44 million earlier this year, tech apprenticeship startup <a href="http://multiverse.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiverse</a> has raised another round of funding. The company today <a href="https://blog.multiverse.io/multiverse-closes-130m-series-c-apprenticeships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it has closed $130 million in a Series C round.</p>
<p>The funding had been rumored in recent weeks while the round was being closed.  D1 Capital Partners and BOND led this latest investment, and Multiverse is not disclosing who the other investors are. Others that have previously backed the company include General Catalyst (which led the startup&#8217;s last round), GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), Audacious Ventures, Latitude, SemperVirens, Index Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners. D1 is Daniel Sundheim&#8217;s firm, while BOND is the firm co-founded by Mary Meeker, two longtime figures in the world of investment banking and investing in general.</p>
<p>The company has confirmed that its new valuation is $875 million. As a point of reference, PitchBook <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/232702-39/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> at the time of its last round at just under $164 million, while the FT put it at $200 million in the same period. The implication is that it&#8217;s higher in multiples because the company has been expanding: Multiverse says that it has grown four-fold in the last year, and now has worked with some 5,000 people, counting both current apprentices and alumni.</p>
<p>The previous round was raised to help London-founded Multiverse &#8212; the head of the company is the well-connected Euan Blair, son of former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and barrister Cherie Booth Blair &#8212; expand into the US market. Perhaps given the huge hiccup that is the global Covid-19 health pandemic, that office in the end only opened last month, in New York.</p>
<p>The new funding is going to be used to continue that expansion, both in its home market and the US.</p>
<p>Its customer list numbers about 300 &#8212; I&#8217;ll point out that this is the same number it quoted when I covered the last funding round in January &#8212; with Google, Generation USA, and MixPanel and Adyen among its newer clients, and Facebook, Morgan Stanley and the NHS among the existing base.</p>
<p><a href="https://platform.multiverse.io/apprenticeships" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apprenticeships on the platform</a> currently range from roles in data science and adtech (&#8220;programmatic pioneer&#8221; is one) through to administrative and operational roles and they cover placements in tech companies, finance organizations and more, and are both on-site and remote. Prices charged to companies vary “but are broadly around the $15,000 mark,&#8221; I was told by Blair earlier this year. (And to be clear, the individuals applying don’t pay anything, and they will also be paid by the companies providing the apprenticeships.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The job market has changed drastically in the last 18 months, not least because of economic contractions, the changing nature of consumer habits, and the changing face of work in the face of a global public health crisis. These have all had massive reverberations for how people look for work, how they set themselves up for jobs that that they want, or even how they think about jobs &#8212; and the same, of course, goes for employers. Tech jobs are a particularly interesting area because many of them by their nature can be engaged with remotely, using the very digital tools that tech workers are building or helping maintain.</p>
<p>All of this has presented an interesting window of opportunity for Multiverse specifically, and more generally the concept of an apprentice, which sits somewhere between a more standard recent graduate/less experience jobseeker and someone who might still be studying and looking at internships to gain more experience.</p>
<p>“We want to build an outstanding alternative to university and college,” Blair told me earlier this year. Even the name speaks to how the people it targets do not typically fit into the traditional categories of candidates. There are “multiple universes” one can inhabit as a post-18 young adult, Blair said, hence the &#8220;Multiverse&#8221; name (which has nothing to do with &#8220;metaverse&#8221; in case you are wondering). Apprenticeships typically last 1.5 years.</p>
<p>As the world of startups has demonstrated many times, windows of opportunity can indeed be lucrative, but sometimes very challenging to open &#8212; hence why Multiverse has raised this big round so soon after its last raise. (Another could be competition: companies like LinkedIn also have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/linkedin-doubles-down-on-development-with-new-learning-hub-free-courses-and-new-search-fields-for-hybrid-working/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rethinking and repositioning itself</a> in the wider worlds of professional development and job-hunting. Apprenticeships sound like a very obvious area for it to build something.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, investors seem to think that being smaller and very focused will be to Multiverse&#8217;s, and jobseekers&#8217;, advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe <span class="il">Multiverse</span> is expanding access to wage-growth and social mobility for employees from a broad range of backgrounds while creating substantial value for employers,&#8221; said Jeremy Goldstein of D1 Capital Partners, in a statment. &#8220;We are excited to invest and help <span class="il">Multiverse</span> scale its model globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup also has been trying to leverage its place in tapping people who might not fit into more traditional job channels to bring more diversity into the wider talent pool, which has found a willing audience among organizations looking to bring more diversity and inclusiveness into their own ranks. It claims that among the apprentices that it places into roles, 53% are people of color, while 36% are from economically disadvantaged communities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Burro first crossed our path during our 2020 robotics event, when the agtech company competed in our pitch off. The company (which used to go by the decidedly less fun name Augean) appears to be moving up in the world, announcing a $10.9 million Series A raise this week. S2G Ventures and Toyota Ventures led the round, which also featured participation from F-Prime and ADM Capital, who joined existing investors Radicle Growth and ffVC.</p>
<p>The company’s primary offering is an autonomous cart, which can be used to move crops from the field. Burro utilizes what it calls “pop-up autonomy,” which is able to navigate a space without training. The system can be used to augment field hands, which are currently in short supply.</p>

<p>The company already has some 90 robots out in the field, moving table grapes and traveling around 100-300 miles a day, six days a week by its count. This round will be used to scale up production for existing and new customers, with plans to have more than 500 robots in the world during 2021.</p>

<p>“Many autonomy companies beginning in agriculture have focused first on autonomous tractors, autonomous weeding, and harvesting, where they try to comprehensively automate incredibly hard technical tasks, and often struggle to scale into a large market &#8211; we’ve started instead with collaborative people-scale robots that help people by moving heavy things around,” CEO Charlie Andersen said in a release. “The beauty of this approach is that we can scale today around a ubiquitous pain point in the most labor-intensive areas of agriculture, while also allowing our platform to capture data and learn about many environments &#8211; providing the foundation for us to scale to countless other applications.”</p>

<p>Agtech is one of several robotics verticals that have seen accelerated interest during the pandemic, as labor shortages have become more pronounced. Burro has no doubt drawn interest from investors by quickly bringing its technology out for real-world testing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/20/cybersecurity-insurance-startup-coalition-raises-90m-series-c/">Coalition</a>, a San Francisco-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyber-insurance/">cybersecurity insurance</a> company, has raised $205 million in Series E funding, valuing the pre-IPO company at more than $3.5 billion. The round was co-led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/durable-capital-partners/">Durable Capital</a>, T. Rowe Price, and Whale Rock Capital, with participation from the company’s existing investors.</p>
<p>Coalition offers businesses cybersecurity tools and insurance to help manage and mitigate cyber risk to more than 50,000 customers, doubling its customer base in the past year. It&#8217;s also seen a gross written premium run-rate of more than $325 million — an 800% increase over the previous year — because, the company tells TechCrunch, its tech-first approach to insurance underwriting is proving to be a more successful model of risk management. The company said its policyholders experience less than one-third the claim frequency compared to other cyber insurance carriers.</p>
<p>“This is a dramatically different approach and it’s working as we set a new standard for an industry that has been slow to unleash the full power of data,&#8221; Joshua Motta, Coalition&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. &#8220;The pandemic showed that cyber risk is no longer a purely digital risk. Increasingly, a company’s industrial processes are controlled by computers, which means they’re at risk of being attacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coalition’s policy is unique in covering the full spectrum of physical damage that can result from a cyberattack, alongside the financial and intangible damages a company can suffer,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The pandemic, and the massive increase in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattacks/">cyberattacks</a> that followed, has also been a major growth driver for the company. This led to Motta being invited to the White House to a recent meeting on cybersecurity policy.</p>
<p>Coalition said it will use the new funding round — bringing the total amount it raised to more than $500 million — to expand into new insurance lines, to fuel its expansion into new markets, and to increase its headcount; the startup currently has 265 employees, and it’s on track to increase that to 315 employees by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Coalition also tells TechCrunch that this could be its final funding round before the startup prepares to go public.</p>
<p>“These [investors] all have impressive track records investing in long-term value creators in the public markets,” Motta says. “We certainly see Coalition following that path but we’ll make future decisions based on what’s best for our customers and partners amidst evolving market conditions.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the summer of 2019, <a href="https://twitter.com/timigod?lang=en">Timilehin Ajiboye</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">became intrigued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the idea of building a travel app after conversations with a circle of friends.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One friend reached out to Ajiboye asking if he knew of any platform where she could find new, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aesthetically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pleasing places to dine in, visit and take pictures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And then, during a trip to Miami, he and his friends </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sought out beautiful places to eat &#8212; and take photographs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No doubt: These needs are pretty vain. But <a href="https://beacons.ai/backdrop">Backdrop</a> is not unlike other global social media platforms that allow users to take ephemeral photos, flex their lifestyle on disappearing stories or discover millions of personalized short videos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while social media, growing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exponentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past decade, has changed the way we communicate and connect, it has also changed how we travel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 36% of social media users use platforms for travel ideas, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1219412/favorite-sources-of-travel-inspiration-us/">according to Statista</a>; over 60% of these people share photos when traveling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram controls most of this traffic, yet Ajiboye believes that the process of sourcing travel-related information on the platform has become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ridiculously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time-consuming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He argues that massive platforms like Instagram that venture into any content created a need for niche platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Instagram is like an operating system for pictures. Everything is happening on Instagram &#8212; travel, beauty, e-commerce. Same with Pinterest,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch in an interview. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you&#8217;ll find that for some people, they use these platforms for travel and there hasn&#8217;t been any experience created for travel that takes into consideration 2021, which is people like to take pictures in front of places that look great and share with their friends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ajiboye came up with the name Backdrop and reached out to two friends, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/damilolaodufuwa">Damilola Odufuwa</a> and <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/odunayoeweniyi">Odunayo Eweniyi</a>, to build the platform and turn it into a company.</span></p>
<h2>Social media and travel</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s currently no go-to platform to find attractive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> places just for the sake of it. The founders say Backdrop is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> built for this, as well as travel discovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, travelers vacationing in Dubai and seeking trendy places tend to do three things: quiz friends and acquaintances, run a Google search, or punch in a hashtag on Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If you run a Google search or use Instagram, everything comes up, including results irrelevant to your search,&#8221; Odufuwa said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re looking for pink restaurants in Dubai, you might not be able to get that on Instagram, and Backdrop changes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208466" style="width: 274px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208466" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2208466" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Backdrop-Explore.png?w=337" alt="" width="264" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Backdrop-Explore.png 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Backdrop-Explore.png?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Backdrop-Explore.png?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Backdrop-Explore.png?resize=768,1552 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Backdrop-Explore.png?resize=337,680 337w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Backdrop-Explore.png?resize=760,1536 760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Backdrop-Explore.png?resize=1014,2048 1014w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Backdrop-Explore.png?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208466" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Backdrop</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Backdrop, users can discover and share beautiful</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> places to take pictures based on their interests and criteria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders believe that with post-pandemic travel becoming more complex, Backdrop can serve as a travel companion for millennials and Gen Zs, especially those </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obsessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with traveling to pretty places</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The critical information on each backdrop includes opening and closing times, address (linked to Google Maps), cost and entry fee (if any), Wi-Fi availability, pet policy, outdoor seating, wheelchair access, and dress code</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch spoke to a few Backdrop beta users. Depending on their interests, two camps emerged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some enjoy its Collection feature, which allows them to save backdrops, combining the worlds of Google Maps and Pinterest</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others prefer the Explore feature, viewing it as a combination of Google Maps and Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With hashtags, users can find specific places, and the &#8220;Backdrop Near Me&#8221; feature allows them to discover other places they can visit close to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their current Backdrop location</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a photo research team that finds these places across 26 cities globally. They also take pictures and input the necessary information in each backdrop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Backdrop wouldn&#8217;t comment on the number of users in beta, the founders say its research team has collated thousands of pictures from these cities:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amsterdam, Dubai, Istanbul, London, Los Angeles, New York, Seoul, Paris, Tokyo, Cape Town, New Orleans, San Francisco, Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, Marrakech, Fez, Tangier, Rabat, Cancun, Cabo, Tulum, Lagos, Abuja, Madrid and Valencia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, there are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">100 to 300 pictures in each city on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a dedicated team to upload pictures is not scalable in the long run and Backdrop knows this. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company allows users to upload backdrops themselves and input the necessary information on each</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Other users review the posts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before listing on the platform, either by upvotes or downvotes. They can also review others and earn redeemable points for helping build the community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s how we&#8217;re trying to transition from having to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> curate backdrops and letting the community decide the sort of backdrops that make it to the platform,&#8221; Ajiboye said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While there are cases where not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the best photo or content is on top of the search, there&#8217;s a kind of democracy involved in crowdsourcing votes on content or, in our case, backdrops</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From our end, we try to detect if the information is accurate, too, automatically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backdrop plans to add 20 more cities this year and has secured a six-figure family-and-friends round to scale the product. But with scale comes more responsibility, a phrase the three founders have grown accustomed to over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio met over six years ago at a Zikoko, an Africa-focused youth publication, and their careers in tech and digital media branched out from there. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208465" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208465" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2208465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collage.jpg?w=680" alt="Backdrop" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collage.jpg 1173w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collage.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collage.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collage.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collage.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/collage.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Backdrop. Backdrop founders Odunayo Eweniyi (COO), Damilola Odufuwa (CEO), and Timilehin Ajiboye (CTO)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odufuwa, who acts as Backdrop CEO, leads PR for Binance in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is also the co-founder of the Feminist Coalition, a Nigeria-based womens&#8217; rights and equality group, alongside Eweniyi, who is Backdrop&#8217;s COO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eweniyi is also the COO at PiggyVest, one of the most popular fintech platforms in Nigeria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTO Ajiboye is the executive and technical head at crypto-powered remittance product Sendcash and YC-backed cryptocurrency platform Buycoins.</span></p>
<h2>Building a global product</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the founders have handled several ventures, they have primarily </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Nigeria- or Africa-focused. But Backdrop is quite different; the target market is a global one. So I couldn&#8217;t help but ask the founders: Did they feel focused or capable enough to run the company?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Odufuwa answered by saying running a global product isn&#8217;t any different. Because each founder has run</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ventures in quick succession, they will not see any problem adding Backdrop to the mix. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we [millennials and GenZs] are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good at juggling. And though it might come with exhaustion and burnout, you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">learn to juggle and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s life in general. But I know we&#8217;re 100% committed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ajiboye added that while the founders are great teammates and leaders, they will need to build a global team to sustain the company in the long run</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;People have done way more complex things all at the same time, so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will be an issue,&#8221; Ajiboye joked. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media platforms </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be hyper-focused on user growth before making revenue or profits. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backdrop, being one of the few social platforms built by Africans that stands a chance to catch on with a global audience, does not plan to be an exception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should it gain significant traction, the founders have some ideas on how the platform will make revenue, citing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> advertising, bookings, reservations, tourism from private and public partnerships, and revenue from content creators as some examples</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are many opportunities with discovery and content creation around travel,&#8221; Ajiboye said. &#8220;What&#8217;s very important is that a community has to exist and our early users will shape what the platform is. So right now, growth is the priority and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there are different ways money can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.qovery.com">Qovery</a> has raised a $4 million seed funding round. The company integrates directly with your git repository and lets you deploy your code to a public cloud without having to manage the infrastructure yourself.</p>
<p>Qovery isn’t a hosting platform. It’s a service that deploys your application to Amazon Web Services, DigitalOcean or Scaleway. Basically, it acts as an abstraction layer so that you don’t have to think about deployment. It’s a sort of Heroku, but for micro-services and modern cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Crane and Speedinvest are leading today’s funding round, with Techstars and various business angels participating, such as Alexis Le-Quoc (co-founder and CTO at Datadog) and Ott Kaukver (CTO at Checkout.com, formerly CTO at Twilio).</p>
<p>The company’s vision is quite clear. Developers should spend more time coding and less time managing the cloud infrastructure. If you’re using GitHub or GitLab, you can connect your repository with Qovery directly. You then basically authorize Qovery to manage your AWS account for you.</p>
<p>Qovery also lets you create multiple environments. For instance, you may want to separate your production environment from your staging environment.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company will expand the engineering team and build sales and marketing teams. Qovery also promises that support for Google Cloud Platform is coming really soon. It should be live by the end of the year.</p>
<p>“When building a product on top of a PaaS, developers can bring their products to market faster, but they compromise on flexibility and often outgrow those platforms at some point. With Qovery developers keep full access to the power and flexibility of building on top of IaaS, can deploy into their own cloud infra accounts and all of that is as easy as working with a PaaS platform,” Dominik Tobschall from Speedinvest said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And this is key to understanding Qovery’s unique positioning in the market. Qovery isn’t a platform-as-a-service provider. You can see your application in your AWS console directly. It doesn’t try to hide your cloud infrastructure behind a different product offering.</p>
<p>For instance, I could imagine small startups using Qovery and then moving to their own custom-made Terraform cloud configuration. Or companies could keep using Qovery as the team improves the product if they don’t see the needs for something else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.swan.io">Swan</a> has raised an $18.7 million Series A funding round (€16 million) led by Accel. The company provides a banking-as-a-service platform for other products and services.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/embedded-finance-might-represent-fintechs-future/">Embedded finance</a> has been an important trend for the past few years in fintech. Companies that operate in this space provide financial services to other companies. Those clients act as a distribution channel for financial services with the embedded finance company acting as the backbone for all things finance.</p>
<p>This way, some companies that don’t want to run financial services can still offer financial services. And other companies can specialize in API-based products that unlock some new features for their clients.</p>
<p>Swan partners with SaaS companies, marketplaces and even other fintech startups so that they can offer white-labeled banking features. For instance, you can leverage Swan’s API to generate accounts and cards using API calls.</p>
<p>Existing investors Creandum and Bpifrance also participated in today’s funding round. Some of Swan’s clients include Agicap, Alma, Expensya, Fintecture, Mon Bel Appart, Pennylane and Ride.</p>
<p>When it comes to account creation, each account comes with its own IBAN. End customers can access those accounts using a Swan-designed web banking interface. Swan clients can choose to design their own interface on top of Swan’s data.</p>
<p>When it comes to cards, Swan lets you generate both virtual and physical cards. They work with Apple Pay and Google Pay. Swan customers can limit some features, such as ATM withdrawals, or they can let their customers control their cards directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has an e-money license and can offer services across the European Economic Area. It also handles regulatory requirements, such as identity verification and fraud detection. Solving these pain points alone is an important selling point as Swan customers don’t have to handle the regulatory requirements themselves.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand to Germany with a new office in early 2022. Swan will compete with Berlin-based banking-as-a-service company <a href="https://www.solarisbank.com/en/">Solarisbank</a>. But Swan also plans to let developers start using the company’s APIs directly with a self-service model.</p>
<p>“Our ambition for this funding round is to provide banking features with local flavor, specialized for a multitude of local EU markets: Ideal in the Netherlands, Ibans starting with DE in Germany, Capital deposits accounts in France, and much more!” co-founder and CEO Nicolas Benady said in a statement.</p>
<p>As you may have noticed, fintech has become a busy vertical for tech startups. With its B2B2C strategy, Swan doesn’t have to create a financial super app to become the main financial touch point with millions of users. And chances are many people are already using Swan services without realizing it.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Dance launches its e-bike subscription service in Berlin&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/dance-launches-its-e-bike-subscription-service-in-berlin/embed/#?secret=ObGykIkiAB" data-secret="ObGykIkiAB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As a reminder, Dance has designed its own e-bike called the Dance One. It features a carbon belt, hydraulic discs, an integrated smartphone mount and a detachable battery with an expected range of 55 km.</p>
<p>Customers don’t buy the bike directly. Instead, you can subscribe for €79 per month (around $93 at today’s exchange rate). After that, it’s a no-fuss experience. If you have a flat tire or another issue with your bike, Dance can send a mechanic to fix it for you.</p>
<p>There are no long-term commitments, which means that you can rent a Dance bike for a couple of months or several years. It can be a great offering for people who don’t bike regularly already. This way, they can see if they feel like riding a bike over the long run before buying their own bike.</p>
<p>Now that the bike design is ready, the startup has to roll out its service. It’s just the beginning as there are “hundreds” of Dance e-bikes in the streets of Berlin right now.</p>
<p>But today’s funding round will be helpful as the company plans to double the size of its team with new hires in operations and engineering. Dance will expand to more cities across Europe starting in 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is extending its computer science program, Future Engineer, to India, making the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market the fifth market where the firm offers the childhood-to-career community program.</p>
<p>The company said at a virtual conference on Tuesday that it will offer several educational materials, scholarships, internships, and mentors to teach computer science courses &#8212; and the areas it encompasses such as robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning &#8212; to students in India and also provide teachers with resources.</p>
<p>Through Future Engineer, the company partners with players such as Code.org to bring CS education opportunities to underserved and underrepresented children and young adults. Amazon said the program is primarily focused on students in grades six to 12.</p>
<p>&#8220;While a million students enroll in CS engineering courses annually in India, students from underserved and underrepresented communities contribute relatively small numbers. There are several reasons &#8211; low exposure to CS-related career opportunities, lack of inspirational role models in their community, and language barriers to access interesting curriculum formats. Also, government schools have limited resources to impart CS education,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Amazon expects Future Engineer &#8212; which in India it said has been contextualized for the Indian teacher and student community and is being made available in several regional languages &#8212; to over 100,000 students in the country in more than 900 government schools across seven states within a year.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported in December that the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/amazon-computer-science-education-program-future-engineer-in-india/">planning to launch the program</a> in the world&#8217;s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p>“Students from underserved communities in India face disproportionate barriers to education, especially in the field of computer science. We are thrilled to bring the Amazon Future Engineer initiative to India, as we believe that all young people, irrespective of their backgrounds, should have the right exposure and accessibility to quality computer science education,&#8221; said Amit Agarwal, Global Senior VP and Country Head at Amazon India, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We aim to bring the CS curriculum closer to these students in the languages of their comfort and choice, empower them with right skills and tools to be able to expand their career outlook. We hope students emerge more confident and skilled to be responsible creators of technology solutions and build a better future for themselves, and communities around them.”</p>
<p>The American e-commerce giant, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested more than $6.5 billion in India</a> so far, has been exploring the education space in the country for a few years. Two years ago, it launched JEE Ready, an app aimed at helping students who are preparing for entry into India’s prestigious technology institutes. JEE Ready, which has since been rebranded as <a href="https://academy.amazon.in/">Amazon Academy</a>, offers free online classes and analyzes students’ performance in mock tests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Capital Float, an Amazon-backed startup that offers its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/22/capital-float-walnut/">buy now, pay later service</a> on many popular online platforms in India including that of the e-commerce firm, said on Tuesday it has raised $50 million in a new investment following a strong growth in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Lightrock India led the new investment in the Bangalore-based startup, which brings the seven-year-old firm’s all-time raise to over $600 million (more than half of which is in debt). Existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Creation Investments as well as high-profile entrepreneurs David Vélez of Nubank, Kunal Shah of CRED and Amrish Rau of Pine Labs also participated in the new round.</p>
<p>Capital Float reaches customers through partnerships with other firms. It’s a lending partner for many popular online platforms including Amazon India, online learning service Unacademy, airline Spicejet, direct-to-consumers lifestyle and electronics brand Boat and travel booking firm MakeMyTrip. Their customers can make their purchases via a loan at the time of check out, explained Sashank Rishyasringa, co-founder of the startup, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup also has partnerships with payments firm Razorpay to reach small and medium-sized businesses and with Walnut to offer personal finance to customers.</p>
<p>Capital Float has amassed over 2.5 million customers. These customers, who make over 2 million purchases a month, are using the service to finance over $271 million a year, the startup said. Most of the startup’s focus over the year has been in the online space, said Rishyasringa.</p>
<p>“Our customer base has more than quadrupled in the last 12 months, and our collection efficiency was still more than 95% during this period when many other firms were witnessing a drop,” he said.</p>

<p>The buy now, pay later market remains at a nascent stage in India, where only a fraction of the population has a credit card. But a handful of startups including Capital Float, ZestMoney and LazyPay are beginning to show traction in the market.</p>
<p>The low penetration of credit cards in India has meant that very few people in the nation have a traditional credit score that banks heavily rely on to establish one’s credit worthiness before issuing them a loan. Moreover, small loans don’t generate lucrative returns for banks, giving them less incentive to write such cheques.</p>
<p>Half of Capital Float&#8217;s user base today doesn&#8217;t have a credit card, said Rishyasringa. Capital Float, unlike many other buy now, pay later services, is a fully regulated entity. This means that the firm has to report to the credit bureaus about users&#8217; transactions, thereby helping them with building their credit score profiles.</p>
<p>The startup underwrites each customer by using a range of signals. The underwriting takes place &#8220;within two clicks and five seconds,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>“Capital Float has solved the unique triumvirate of customer experience, risk management, and merchant partnerships that lies at the heart of unlocking the BNPL opportunity in India. In addition to its strong technology platform, it has built a sophisticated underwriting and collections capability, along with an ethical lending playbook, that makes the model very compelling,&#8221; said Saleem Asaria, Partner at Lightrock India, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have also been consistently impressed with the tenacity and execution focus of the team through a full credit cycle. We are excited to work with the team to build a highly scalable, differentiated, and sustainable business that will positively impact the lives of millions of customers in India through digital credit and financial products.”</p>
<p>The fresh capital, Rishyasringa said, will help the startup meet the surging growth it has seen in recent months. He attributed much of this growth to the pandemic, but also noted that there are some underlying long-term changes in consumer behavior that has helped the startup make larger inroads.</p>
<p>The startup, which finances the loans through partnership with banks such as Kotak and YBL, plans to also broaden its partner, he said.</p>
<p>“More importantly, we see an exponential growth opportunity ahead from this point on. By solving for affordability as well as convenience, in a fully-regulated format, we believe that our BNPL approach can responsibly expand access to credit to over 100 million customers who are starting to transact online. We are privileged to have the support of our investors in pursuing this vision, and are excited to work in partnership to build out a world-class digital financial institution for India,&#8221; said Rishyasringa and Capital Float&#8217;s other co-founder &#8212; Gaurav Hinduja &#8212; said in a joint statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For many financial institutions in Southeast Asia, verifying new customers takes a week or two, said the founders of <a href="https://verihubs.com/">Verihubs</a>. The startup cuts that time down to as little as five seconds, using AI-based identity authentication technology and APIs that let companies continue verifying returning customers through SMS, WhatsApp or flash calls.</p>
<p>Verihubs announced it has raised $2.8 million in seed funding for its goal of becoming &#8220;the one-stop for verification in Southeast Asia.&#8221; The round led by Insignia Venture Partners, with participation from CCV (Central Capital Ventura, the investment arm of Bank Central Asia, the largest privately-owned bank in Indonesia), and Armand Ventures. The round also include angel investors from notable Southeast Asian startups like Shipper co-founder Budi Handoko; Payfazz co-founders Jefriyanto and Ricky Winata; Gotrade co-founder Rohit Mulani; Bukuwarung founder Chinmay Chauhan; and Modalku ex-chief product officer Pramodh Rai.</p>
<p>The startup recently <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/verihubs">finished taking part in Y Combinator’s summer 2021 batch</a> and says it is the first YC-backed AI startup from Indonesia.</p>
<p>Based in Jakarta, Verihubs was founded in 2019 by Rick Firnando, who has more than 9 years of experience in the B2B industry, and Williem Williem, an AI researcher who holds a PhD in computer vision from South Korea’s Inha University. The company currently has 46 customers, including major banks and fintechs, and the founders say it is on track to hit 100 customers soon. While most of its current clients are in the financial space, Verihubs technology can also be used for e-commerce, rental marketplaces and hospitality (one of its clients is a hotel that uses Verihubs for its check-in process).</p>
<p>Before adopting Verihubs, many of its clients were still verifying customers manually, said Firnando. Verihubs serves as an end-to-end verification solution, “because integrating with multiple vendors is painful for developers to do,” he added. That is why it enables clients to perform KYC (know your customer), offers phone number verification using WhatsApp or SMS and also verifies customers’ financial data.</p>
<p>When end users log onto an app that uses Verihubs for the first time, they are prompted to take a selfie and then upload a photo of a government-issued photo ID. Then Verihubs AI-based technology compares the two photos to see if they match, and also cross-references the ID with telecom credit scores and Indonesian government databases, including criminal records.</p>
<p>Verihubs serves two kinds of end users—those who have traditional bank accounts and “unbanked” people. The startup’s new investment from Central Capital Ventura will help it develop its services for users with bank accounts, since it will be able to partner with BCA to access their customers’ data. For unbanked users, Firnando said Verihubs is working closely with Payfazz, which lets customers deposit money with local agents to use for online payments, and BukuWarung, a bookkeeping app for SMEs, to access transaction data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup’s product pipeline also includes building its own credit scores, based on data like transactions and account balances. Verihubs is currently focused on Indonesia, with plans to expand into other Southeast Asia markets eventually.</p>
<p>“For the ID verification system, we found that there is already a product-market fit in Indonesia, but we would like to expand into new products,” Firnando said. “We consolidate financial data from multiple sources, not only for banks, but also unbanked populations. And we’re also exploring expanding into new markets, like the Philippines and Vietnam.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unless you&#8217;ve been in a cave over the last week, you&#8217;ve likely read a review or some discussion about <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609711/the-contrarian-by-max-chafkin/">T<em>he Contrarian</em></a>, a new book about billionaire investor Peter Thiel by longtime Bloomberg Businessweek features editor and tech reporter Max Chafkin.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t surprising. Thiel has become an increasingly powerful figure in the U.S., and Chafkin is an engrossing storyteller who poured 15 years of reporting into the book and who leaned on relationships with &#8220;hundreds of sources,&#8221; he writes in its acknowledgements.</p>
<p>To learn more, we talked with Chafkin last week in what proved to be a lively discussion that covered how much Thiel (who talked with Chafkin off the record) revealed of his personal life; why the &#8220;Trump thing was partly ideological, but it was partly a trade &#8212; an insight that Trump was undervalued,&#8221; says Chafkin; and why Thiel&#8217;s beliefs are &#8220;extremely inconsistent,&#8221; according to Chafkin&#8217;s reporting. We also discussed Thiel&#8217;s relationship with Mark Zuckerberg, who accepted one of Facebook&#8217;s first checks from Thiel and who has been bound, for good and bad, to Thiel since.</p>
<p>You can hear that 30-minute-long <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/max-chafkin-on-the-inexorable-rise-of-peter-thiel/id1498270180?i=1000536561904">interview here</a>. In the meantime, we&#8217;re pulling out a part of that conversation centering on Zuckerberg because we find Zuckerberg&#8217;s relationship with Thiel to be particularly fascinating and important, given the impact of Facebook on American society and humankind more broadly. We&#8217;ve edited this excerpt lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You talk about Thiel&#8217;s biggest and most important bet really being Facebook and suggest in the book that he used his position as a board member since 2005 to persuade Mark Zuckerberg to be more allowing of an anything-goes type stance, even misinformation. You also suggest there has been friction between Thiel and Zuckerberg for some time, especially as Thiel has come to embrace Trumpism. Do you anticipate that Thiel will be a Facebook board member for much longer? Do you think he has been sidelined in any way?</strong></p>
<p>MC: There&#8217;s an anecdote in the book: When Facebook went public, its stock crashed and Thiel sold the stock pretty quickly, but of course he stayed on the board [and in the book] I talk about this meeting they had at the Facebook campus to kind of pump people up, because when you&#8217;re working in a company and the stock is going down, I understand that it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s most depressing thing. Everybody every day is losing money. The press is beating you up. They were getting sued by firefighters and teachers. It was just an endless parade of bad news. So they had all these speakers come in to try to pick up the troops. And Peter Thiel gave a talk. And during the talk, he said, &#8216;My generation was promised flying cars. Instead we got Facebook.&#8217; Normally he attacks Twitter [with that language]. He says, &#8216;We were promised flying cars, but we got 140 characters,&#8217; but he made it Facebook in this case, and if you&#8217;re sitting in a crowd, or if you&#8217;re Mark Zuckerberg, it&#8217;s like, &#8216;Oh, so the longest-serving board member, mentor, guiding light of my business philosophy, just kind of got up there and told me I sucked.&#8217;</p>
<p>I do think that Zuckerberg actually kind of respects that about Peter, right? When you&#8217;re Mark Zuckerberg, it&#8217;s very hard to get honest feedback. No one&#8217;s gonna ever tell you that you suck except maybe Peter Thiel. But as you say, Thiel has really kind of been tiptoeing up to the line a lot over the last few years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>[Thiel] has often talked about tech monopoly and tech power, and he singles out Google, which . . . maybe takes the heat off of Facebook, but it doesn&#8217;t it doesn&#8217;t help that much, because Facebook and Google are very similar companies, and if you&#8217;re going to regulate one, you might conceivably regulate the other. I&#8217;m not sure Zuckerberg is thrilled with that.</p>
<p>Thiel has at various times embraced this kind of right wing activist project in Silicon Valley. You have [conservative activist] James O&#8217;Keefe and others who are intent on exposing what they see as the hypocrisy of of Facebook, Google, Apple &#8212; all the big tech companies &#8212; and Thiel has subtly embraced those.</p>
<p>But he&#8217;s also increasingly embracing them in public. Right now, Thiel has two candidates running in the U.S. Senate races. They&#8217;re both running in Republican primaries: Blake Masters in Arizona, and JD Vance in Ohio, and Thiel has donated ten million bucks to super PACs supporting each of these candidates. These guys are constantly attacking Facebook, and not just attacking Facebook on an intellectual level or raising questions. They&#8217;re making almost personal attacks against Mark Zuckerberg. There&#8217;s a JD Vance ad [funded by Thiel], where it&#8217;s these dark tones, and it&#8217;s like, &#8216;There&#8217;s a contingent of elites in this country who are out of touch,&#8217; and there it is &#8212; there&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg face. I mean, if I&#8217;m Mark Zuckerberg, God, that must be just a continual source of a headache.</p>
<p>There was one instance [in 2017] where Zuckerberg asked if <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-luminary-peter-thiel-parts-ways-with-silicon-valley-1518696120">Thiel thought he should resign</a>, and Thiel did not and Zuckerberg didn&#8217;t fire him, so there has at least been some tension. [As for whether] Thiel&#8217;s value has diminished, that&#8217;s a really astute question because with Biden in charge, with the Democrats in power controlling the presidency and both houses of Congress, Thiel&#8217;s connection to the right is less valuable. That said, there&#8217;s a very good chance that Republicans will retake the Senate in 2022. And there&#8217;s a chance that that some of those Senators will be very, very close to Peter Thiel, so that could drastically increase his value.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mention in the book that a lot of people who are close to Thiel and admire him are also terrified of him. Despite the fact that Mark Zuckerberg is probably the most powerful person in the world, I wonder if your sense of things is that he&#8217;s scared of Thiel.</strong></p>
<p>MC: I think Zuckerberg could fire Thiel. I mean, Mark Zuckerberg is a formidable guy. He&#8217;s worth a lot of money. He could afford a war with Peter Thiel, and he could afford the backlash. But I think there&#8217;s a question about whether he&#8217;d want to, because right now, the reason Thiel is able to get away with what he&#8217;s able to get away with, with respect to both serving on the board and being this public critic, has to do with the fact that there would be a price to pay if Mark Zuckerberg fired him, and the price would be it would be a huge freaking story.</p>
<p>Thiel had been such an important ally to Mark Zuckerberg during the Trump presidency. There have been these running memes in conservative circles that Facebook is systematically discriminating against right wing points of view, [that it&#8217;s] a liberal company staffed by liberal employees who hate Donald Trump, and that as a result, it is putting its thumb on the scale and advancing the interests of the left. . . [But] Zuckerberg had an awesome response to that, which is &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;ve got this board member. He&#8217;s not just a Republican. He&#8217;s not just some kind of middle-of-the-road conservative like George Bush guy or something. He is Peter Freaking Thiel. He&#8217;s the guy who&#8217;s too crazy for Steve Bannon. He is a dyed-in-the-wool Trumpist.&#8217; And that gives Facebook a really, really powerful argument.</p>
<p>When somebody like Josh Hawley, who has taken money from Peter Thiel, or Ted Cruz, another person who has taken money from Peter Thiel, comes along and attacks Facebook . . . I think if [Thiel] left, especially if he was fired &#8212; if that was a story that came out &#8212; it would be open season.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an existential issue for Mark Zuckerberg. But I think it might be more comfortable to keep his friend and board member Peter Thiel, despite the fact that they might have some profound differences of opinion on the value of Facebook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian food delivery startup Swiggy is in talks to raise over $500 million in a new financing round that could value it at over $10 billion, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Atlanta-headquartered Invesco is in talks to lead &#8212; or co-lead &#8212; the new financing round in the Bangalore-based startup, which counts SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Falcon Edge Capital, and Prosus Ventures among its existing investors, sources added.</p>
<p>A deal has not finalized yet so the terms may change, one of them said. Swiggy had no comment on Monday. Indian news outlet CapTable <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/09/swiggy-zomato-foodelivery-valuation-grofers-funding/">first reported</a> about the fundraise talks.</p>
<p>The new fundraise talks come less than three months after Swiggy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-raises-1-25-billion-led-by-softbank-and-prosus/">finalized a $1.25 billion funding round</a> at a post-money valuation of $5.5 billion. The startup&#8217;s chief rival in India, Zomato, had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">a stellar debut on Indian stock exchanges this year</a> that paved the way for Indian consumer tech startups to explore public markets. Zomato&#8217;s market cap has surged to $14.5 billion on stock exchanges, up from $5.4 billion valuation it had attained in private markets earlier this year.</p>
<p>Swiggy, like its older rival Zomato, was severely hit by the pandemic. But it has recovered strongly in recent quarters, the startup said in July. The value of orders it was processing that month was 30% higher than those in the pre-COVID times, it said.</p>
<p>Amazon also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/">entered the food delivery space in India</a> last year, but, as a Zomato executive mentioned in a public forum this year, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/amazon-expands-its-food-delivery-service-across-bangalore/">yet to make inroads</a> in this category. Amazon&#8217;s food delivery service is currently only available in Bangalore.</p>
<p>At stake is India&#8217;s food services market, which is expected to reach $97 billion by March of 2026, analysts at Bernstein wrote in a report to clients this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2208927" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208927" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208927 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="474" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg?resize=768,356 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg?resize=680,315 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-food-delivery-bernstein.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2208927" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Bernstein</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;India food services market is large and expected to reach $97 billion by FY25. Organized food service is growing faster and expected to reach 55% market share by FY25. We expect online penetration to expand to 20% by FY25 and market size to reach $20 billion growing at 46% CAGR. Significant part of the growth will be driven by new customer acquisition and penetration into smaller markets. Zomato had 10 million monthly transacting users (MTU) in FY20, expected to increase 5x by FY25 to ~50 million,&#8221; they wrote.</p>
<p>Swiggy&#8217;s recent bet &#8212; the expansion into quick grocery delivery &#8212; has also gained traction at a time when rivals in the space (Grofers and BigBasket) have either not seen such traction or have yet to aggressively explore the space. Zomato, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/zomatos-100-million-investment-to-turn-grofers-into-a-unicorn/">invested about $100 million in Grofers</a> earlier this year, this month shut down a pilot program where it was testing grocery deliveries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Ford Motor Company announced an investment of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/"> $30 billion toward electrification by 2025.</a> On Monday, the automaker unveiled some specifics for that plan. Ford and its battery joint venture partner, SK Innovation, will be<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/ford-sk-to-spend-11-4b-to-build-two-us-manufacturing-campuses-dedicated-to-evs-and-batteries/"> investing $11.4 billion</a> in the two new campuses it plans to build in Kentucky and Tennessee to produce the next generation of electric F-Series trucks and the batteries to power both Ford and Lincoln vehicles.</p>
<p>Alongside this investment, Ford has also outlined existing plants that it has repurposed to accommodate manufacturing for electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at where Ford is now and how its electrification footprint will change in the coming years.</p>
<h3>Blue Oval City in Stanton, Tennessee</h3>
<p>In May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/ford-and-sk-innovation-announce-battery-manufacturing-joint-venture-blueovalsk/">Ford and SK Innovation signed a memorandum of understanding</a> to establish a joint venture to domestically manufacture batteries for electric vehicles. The joint venture, BlueOvalSK, aims to produce around 60 GWh of energy annually starting in 2025.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Now BlueOvalSK is spending $5.6 billion on a mega-campus in Stanton called Blue Oval City, which is expected to create around 6,000 new jobs and a new model for vehicle and battery manufacturing. The site is also close to Ford&#8217;s battery cell assembly and e-motor plant in Rossville, Tennessee.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Blue Oval City will become a vertically integrated ecosystem for Ford to assemble an expanded lineup of electric F-Series vehicles and will include a BlueOvalSK battery plant, key suppliers and recycling,&#8221; said the company in a statement. &#8220;</span>Blue Oval City will be among the largest auto manufacturing campuses in U.S. history. Like the iconic Rouge complex in Michigan did a century earlier, Blue Oval City will usher in a new era for American manufacturing.&#8221;</p>
<h3>BlueOvalSK battery manufacturing campus in Glendale, Kentucky</h3>
<p>Ford and SK Innovation announced on Monday an additional $5.8 billion spend on a battery manufacturing campus to open in Glendale in 2025. The 1,500-acre facility will bring 5,000 new jobs to Kentucky, and it&#8217;s well-placed to supply Ford&#8217;s Louisville assembly plant, which currently produces the Ford Escape hybrid and plug-in hybrid and the Lincoln Corsair plug-in hybrid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both Blue Oval City and BlueOvalSK battery manufacturing campus are expected to be capable of producing up to 43 GWh each, or a total of 86 GWh annually, in order to power Ford&#8217;s next generation of electric vehicles.</p>
<h3>Ford Ion Park in Romulus, Michigan</h3>
<p>Only 30 minutes&#8217; drive from where it all began, Ford aims to build its Ford Ion Park, a battery R&amp;D facility where the automaker will house up to 200 battery technology experts and purchasing and finance leaders to help develop and manufacture lithium-ion and solid-state battery cells. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/ford-to-open-new-lab-to-develop-next-gen-lithium-ion-and-solid-state-batteries/">Ion Park represents $100 million of a total $185 million investment</a> into building higher-volume battery cells at lower costs.</p>
<p>Ford will refurbish an existing 270,000-square-foot facility to include pilot-scale equipment for electrode, cell and array design and manufacturing engineering and innovation, <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/07/27/ford-romulus-mich-ford-ion-park.html">according to the company</a>. A nearby batteries benchmarking test lab in Allen Park will support Ion Park as it tests cell construction and chemistries. Ion Park will also be close to Ford&#8217;s product development center in Dearborn, and its 1,100-acre Dearborn truck plant, which currently produces the F-150 hybrid and the Raptor.</p>
<h3>Existing facilities in Michigan</h3>
<p>Ford also has plans to utilize its existing plants around the country to aid its push for electrification. In Michigan, the company has identified its Rouge Complex, the Livonia Transmission Plant, the Rawsonville Components Plant and the Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center.</p>
<p>Ford is building an Electric Vehicle Center as part of its historic Rouge Complex in Dearborn, which is conveniently located close to the Truck Plant. This center will house the production of the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck. A spokesperson for Ford told TechCrunch the Rouge plant has started pre-production for test vehicle there, but has not yet begun mass production for commercial sales.</p>
<p>The Livonia Transmission Plant and Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Centers help produce Ford&#8217;s eMotor, and its Rawsonville Components Plant currently makes PHEV and FHEV battery packs alongside other components needed for ICE vehicles.</p>
<h3>Ford&#8217;s electrification in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri</h3>

<p>Ford has also outlined existing assembly and transmission plants in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri for electrification production. In Ohio, Ford has identified the Cleveland and Lima Engine Plants and the Sharonville Transmission Plant, which currently<a href="https://corporate.ford.com/operations/locations/global-plants/flat-rock-assembly-plant.html"> all seem to still produce</a> ICE engines or transmissions. A Ford spokesperson said these plants are all producing components for electrified vehicles, but not all-electric vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The decarbonization of the planet will be the next major disruption of the 21st century, according to SOSV managing general partner Sean O&#8217;Sullivan and Carmichael Roberts of Breakthrough Energy Ventures.</p>
<p>A disruption of such magnitude will bring about changes that will touch every industry and corner of daily life, and as a result, a complex web of challenges and resistance. It will also deliver unprecedented opportunity for entrepreneurs — and the investors backing them — who can turn their climate tech ideas into commercialized products and services, whether that&#8217;s plant-based foods, carbon capture, electric vehicles or battery recycling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difficult thing here is that we have to change everything,&#8221; O&#8217;Sullivan said while on the TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 virtual stage. &#8220;Climate tech is not just one thing that needs to be changed. We have 100 areas, 1,000 different areas that need to be reinvented and industries that need to be reconstructed.&#8221;</p>
<p>This opportunity has helped climate tech become one of the hottest sectors to invest in. But that doesn&#8217;t mean success is guaranteed. Unlike other sectors, climate tech crosses into nearly every industry, including transportation, energy, agriculture, consumer goods, food and beverage, and packaging.</p>
<p>For investors, the initial challenge is vetting the startups, along with their technology and business plan, to determine if it&#8217;s really climate tech or just window dressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a big and broad category that encompasses anything and everything that could lower overall carbon,&#8221; Robert noted.</p>
<h2>Are people ready for climate tech?</h2>
<p>Forces in entrenched industries can threaten progress even after climate tech startups successfully navigate fundraising and begin to scale. As O&#8217;Sullivan noted, people are inherently resistant to change.</p>
<p>However, both investors have seen more openness.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you listen to people today, they&#8217;re trying to figure out how to transition, blend, add. I see a lot more of &#8216;How do we embrace the transition?&#8217; And even further, &#8216;How do we not fear it?&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company and battery manufacturer SK Innovation plan to spend $11.4 billion to build two massive campuses in Tennessee and Kentucky that will produce batteries as well as the next generation of electric F-Series trucks — a project the companies said will create 11,000 new jobs.</p>
<p>Facilities on the two campuses are designed to cover the entire ecosystem of building an electric vehicle<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> from battery cell production and recycling to a supplier park and an assembly plant. </span>Ford is contributing $7 billion to the project, the largest single manufacturing investment in its 118-year history. The investment is part of Ford&#8217;s previously announced plan to put $30 billion toward electric vehicles by 2025.</p>
<p>The automaker also said it will spend $525 million over the next five years on high-tech job training across the United States, starting in Texas. The investment will focus on training auto technicians to support Ford&#8217;s coming onslaught of electric and connected vehicles.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s &#8220;mega campus&#8221; plans — the first facilities that the automaker has constructed in a generation — are meant to support its growing portfolio of EVs, including the Mustang Mach-E, the Ford E-Transit cargo van and the upcoming F-150 Lightning pickup truck, which has already received more than 150,000 pre-orders from customers. It&#8217;s also part of the company&#8217;s strategy to drive down battery costs to the $80 per kilowatt-hour pack level.</p>
<p>&#8220;The timing of these investments is very important because we see a critical mass for a transition to battery electric vehicles right on the horizon,&#8221; Lisa Drake, Ford&#8217;s chief operating officer in North America, said in a media briefing Monday. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve already seen evidence of that in the industry and now from our own recent product launches.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ford is bullish on the demand for EVs. The company predicts that one-third of the full-size pickup segment will be fully electric by 2030, Drake noted.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2208886" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blue-Oval-City_GIF.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2208886" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2208886 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Blue-Oval-City_GIF.gif" alt="" width="960" height="540" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2208886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ford</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Monday&#8217;s announcement follows a string of planned investments by Ford, including an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/">injection of $250 million</a> and 450 new jobs to increase production capacity of its upcoming F-150 Lightning to 80,000 all-electric trucks annually. Those funds and jobs will be spread out across its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center and Rawsonville Components Plant, Ford said.</p>
<p>It also comes less than a week since Ford announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/ford-partners-with-battery-recycling-and-materials-startup-redwood-materials-amid-ev-push/">partner with Redwood Materials</a> to create a closed loop system that will cover recycling production scrap and EVs at the end of their life as well as supplying the automaker with raw battery materials. Securing a supply of batteries &#8212; or the materials to make them &#8212; has prompted the automotive industry to partner with cell manufacturers and increasingly turn to companies like Redwood Materials.</p>
<p>Drake provided more details about that partnership Monday, noting that Redwood Materials will set up a recycling facility on its so-called Blue Oval City campus near Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<h2>Tennessee campus</h2>
<p>Once completed. the $5.6 billion campus in Stanton, Tennessee will rival the size and population of a small village. The 3,600-acre campus, or nearly 6 square miles, will be designed as a closed loop manufacturing center. This means that materials used in production can be reused to make new EVs.</p>
<p>The campus will have a battery production facility operated in partnership with SK, a supplier park and an assembly plant dedicated to electric F-Series trucks. The battery manufacturing facility will be able to produce 43 gigawatt hours of cell capacity. Ford said the assembly plant will be designed to be carbon neutral from the start of production in 2025.</p>
<h2>Kentucky campus</h2>
<p>Ford said it will build twin battery plants on the campus located in the central Kentucky town of Glendale. Batteries produced at the plants will be used in a new lineup of Ford and Lincoln electric vehicles later this decade. Production of the lithium-ion batteries is expected to begin in 2025.</p>
<p>The 1,500-acre battery campus, which Ford is calling BlueOvalSK Battery Park, will cost about $5.8 billion and employ 5,000 people. The twin battery plants will be capable of producing up to 43 gigawatt hours each for a total of 86 gigawatt hours annually. Adding in the third battery cell plant in Tennessee will push the total capacity up to 129 GWh, according to Yoosuk Kim, executive vice president and global head of marketing at SK.</p>
<p>In all, that&#8217;s enough capacity to power over 1 million electric vehicles, Drake said.</p>
<p>Ford has previously said that its global plans for battery electric vehicle calls for at least 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell capacity by 2030. That is roughly 10 plants’ worth of capacity. Ford has previously said that 140 GWh will be required in North America, with the balance dedicated to other regions, including Europe and China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The proliferation of affordable and fast mobile data allowed hundreds of millions of Indians to come online for the first time in the past decade. But there are scores of areas in the South Asian nation’s economy that remain largely offline. One of those is factories. There are about 150,000 factories in India, but the vast majority of them lack digital means to connect and sell their products to retailers.</p>
<p>About six years ago, a team of four people (Siddharth Vij, Chaitanya Rathi, Siddharth Rastogi and Shubham Agarwal) &#8212; all of whom had either personal or family background in the manufacturing business &#8212; came together to tackle this challenge.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, they announced that their effort &#8212; the startup <a href="https://www.bijnis.com">Bijnis</a> &#8212; continues to make inroads in the market and has won the trust of several investors.</p>
<p>Bijnis has raised $30 million in a Series B financing round led by Westbridge Capital, they announced. The new funding also saw participation from existing investors including Sequoia India, InfoEdge, Waterbridge Ventures and Matrix Partners India.</p>
<p>The New Delhi-headquartered startup operates an eponymous mobile app that Vij, in an interview with TechCrunch, described as an “operating system for factories.”</p>
<p>The Bijnis app helps factory operators generate demand from buyers and other retailers alike and also helps them procure supplies. It also offers manufacturers with logistics and payments services &#8212; through partnerships with several popular players in the industry.</p>
<p>“The problem is that these manufacturers spend the vast majority of their time running factories. So they rely on wholesalers and other agents for buying and selling. These players don’t share the identity to the buyers as this is how they get to squeeze a lot of money from the manufacturers,” he explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bijnis is trying to remove the traditional agents from the equation to help manufacturers considerably improve their profits &#8212; and also aggressively expand by discovering new customers. One of the ways it is doing so is by helping these businesses establish a digital presence so that anyone can find them online, he said.</p>

<p>“The founding team has very strong category understanding given their family background in manufacturing and that has enabled them to build a compelling proposition for manufacturers and retailers in the fashion and lifestyle categories,&#8221; said Sandeep Singhal, partner at Westbridge Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bijnis has carved a niche for itself as the B2B platform of choice in these categories and we are excited to be partners as they transform the ecosystem for these categories in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 5,000 factories operating in fashion, footwear and lifestyle categories are now using the Bijnis app, said Vij, adding that the startup has so far focused more on ensuring that the factories that come to the platform are able to generate enough demand rather than trying to court as many manufacturers as possible. The platform has also onboarded over 100,000 retailers.</p>
<p>But the new fund, the startup said, will help it win more manufacturers and retailers as increasingly more businesses are becoming aware of Bijnis’ offerings. The startup, which employs over 200 people, also plans to broaden its product offerings, he said.</p>
<p>“Traditional supply chains in lifestyle categories in India continue to be extremely unorganised and fragmented. Small and medium manufacturers are the backbone of these supply chains, representing a significant part of India’s manufacturing economy, which is at the brink of massive transformation driven by rapid digitisation across layers,” said Shraeyansh Thakur, vice president at Sequoia India, in a statement.</p>
<p>“The team is very excited about Bijnis’s vision of building an operating system for manufacturing in this segment and look forward to partnering them on this mission.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Live shopping — the seamless and simultaneous combination of online shopping, livestreaming and social media — has been taking North America by storm since October 2019. Though booming to take up <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/its-showtime-how-live-commerce-is-transforming-the-shopping-experience">over 13%</a> of all e-commerce sales in China, the North American set is still new to this innovation, where influencers transform star power to selling power in moving millions of dollars of perfume, produce and even seats on a <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/news-bites/article/3078136/chinas-live-streaming-sales-queen-sold-rocket-launch-service">rocket launcher</a>.</p>
<p>In Canada, cosmetics brand Urban Decay introduced a deeper meaning to “see now, buy now” through its <a href="https://brainstation.io/magazine/loreal-leans-into-livestream-shopping-experiences">first use of live shopping</a> in October 2019. Since this first foray into the physical-digital wild west, live shopping is set to become an <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/its-showtime-how-live-commerce-is-transforming-the-shopping-experience">$11 billion industry</a> in the United States by the end of this year.</p>
<p>While “live shopping” has been the buzzword on every brand marketer’s lips, adoption comes with a lot of questions. One of the most pressing questions we’ve seen circling around emails, webinars and routine Zoom calls is in deciding who the face of these live-shopping events should be, and how a new industry standard for selection, payment and expertise can be implemented.</p>
<p>As director of marketing and communications at a live-shopping startup in North America, I’ve watched the continent’s adopters soar to success &#8212; or learn big lessons.</p>
<p>After watching the influencer market rise to its present-day success, I want to break down how brands should be selecting, compensating and coaching their influencer hosts, as well as outline a few key terms industry players should keep note of.</p>
<h2>Start with influencers on day one</h2>
<p>Knix, the woman-founded Canadian intimates brand, has a model that thrives on its customer community &#8212; and ambassadors that bring it to life. The brand pierced through a $46 billion lingerie market to usher in a new era for leakproof undergarments, activewear and loungewear, designed around real feedback from real consumers.</p>
<p>A huge pivot came when the brand shifted entirely from retail sales to direct-to-consumer in 2016, focusing on connecting and communicating with customers online. Knix has also implemented a robust influencer affiliate strategy, seeding product and providing exclusive 10% off discount codes to communities close to their influencer affiliates.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Knix also became the first intimates brand to launch with <a href="https://www.livescale.tv/">Livescale</a>, using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScT1dUrDx4g">live shopping</a> to add extra excitement to its buzz-worthy swimwear launch. Hosted by influencer Sarah Nicole Landry, real Knix customers and Knix founder Joanna Griffiths, the first event exceeded expectations, placing overall sales conversion well above live-shopping’s average, and certainly for a first-time event.</p>
<p>The live-shopping experience was the first to blend social media strategies with the expertise of the Knix brand team, showcasing online polls, gamification features and direct paths to purchase without ever leaving the brand’s social channels, website and online newsletter.</p>
<p>The secret? In part, the organic community culture the brand has worked for years to build — topped off with the selection of an influencer host who has known the brand for years and can speak directly to its merits without a second thought.</p>
<h2>Expertise is more crucial than following</h2>
<p>Yes, live-shopping events with celebrity hosts may make the news — but that doesn’t mean they always make the strongest sales.</p>
<p>A well-organized script with a passionate spokesperson is more important than budget-busting hosts, flashy names and buzzy PR tactics, our data show. The TL;DR? Let your host’s authentic connection to their audience shine brighter than anything else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1-H4NaxYs4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Mostly friends and sometimes family have encouraged me to tell stories about my days in the comedy, music, and tech businesses. And for all of this time I&#8217;ve been reluctant. However, with the Pandemic and the impending birth of my first grandchild, I&#8217;ve reconsidered. My wife&#8217;s passion for genealogy has reminded us that stories get lost fast. People die, forget, become estranged as they lose track of the family tree. It takes real effort to rebuild those connections as time goes on. Our kids don&#8217;t care about any of this now, but later they will. And the genealogy of friendship is the story of our times, the things we find important and the friends we choose to share. For the past few months I’ve started work on a book. From time to time, I&#8217;ll include some of that work here.</p>
<p>The second season of The Morning Show arrived on Apple TV+, just as our subscription to the service flipped from free with a new iPhone purchase a year ago to $4.99 a month. The first season did pretty well with its blend of inside baseball about the the broadcast TV news business. The production values were strong, reminiscent of the West Wing treatment of Washington beltway politics. The MeToo story line featured A-List performances by Jennifer Anniston, Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, and a complicated turn by Billy Crudup. Not bad for $4.99 but even with the surprise sleeper soccer hit Ted Lasso barely enough to keep afloat in the Netflix/Disney+ struggle for streaming leadership. And there is Apple&#8217;s stake in this amid the challenges of competing with Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and the rest of the tech giants.</p>
<p>For me, Apple TV+ has crossed over from a question mark to a must have, much like CNN when it debuted in 1980, and HBO, which grew out of the fledgling Z Channel we enjoyed in a Malibu house David Sanborn was renting that same year. Dave had arrived in town to play on a Pure Prairie League record being produced at The Band&#8217;s Shangri-La recording studio on a hill overlooking the Pacific. I was house sitting the League&#8217;s Malibu beach house over the holidays when Dave showed up at the front door unexpectedly.</p>
<p>At this point I&#8217;d known Sanborn since 1973, when he played on the soundtrack for the Firesign Theatre&#8217;s Proctor and Bergman film TV Or Not TV. I&#8217;d produced the TV Or Not TV record and directed a stage version of the show on a West Coast tour that ended with a performance at a Columbia Records promotional event in Los Angeles. Invited guests included George Harrison, who greeted the three of us with the catchphrase from the Firesign&#8217;s first album: &#8220;Civilization Ho.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the Pure Prairie League session, Dave decided to rent another house down the street on Broad Beach. The house quickly became a rallying point for characters like Gary Busey, Richard Manuel of the Band, and Sanborn associate Marcus Miller who wrote much of the material for Dave&#8217;s records. He would fly in from touring with Miles Davis and work up the new tunes on a PortaStudio and MiniMoog I had set up in the living room. Eventually Sanborn invited me to move out of my small room at Shangri-La and into the beach house. This is where the Z Channel came in.</p>
<p>This was the first cut at premium television. Each month the Z Channel would show several films rotating throughout the week and multiple times per day. Busey, who had first surfaced on a local Tulsa TV station with late night B-movie comedy cut-ins with Gaillard Sartain, was a stone cold genius at riffing off of whatever was on TV. And the Z Channel turned this into an intense ritual where repeated viewings of films like Spielberg&#8217;s 1942 would take on such hilarious undertones that the only way to escape Busey&#8217;s comedy stylings was to leave the building doubled over in laughter. To casual observers, of which there were none, this suggested a new paradigm shift as improv met the Hollywood windowing system — and produced HBO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Out of HBO grew streaming television, as original productions like The Sopranos and Game of Thrones led to the binge production model that Netflix rode to the top of the charts. Over the past several years this tsunami of economic restructuring led to the unbundling of the television networks and the realignment of studio production around the relentless demands of streaming and subscriptions. Pay TV became Pay Media, Data became the competitive coin of the realm. And the Pandemic mandated the underlying principles of a new economy we are still struggling to understand even as we vote for it with our feet and behavior.</p>
<p>After 15 months at home, we finally took advantage of the beginning of summer to travel by car to our bungalow in South Carolina. Our children were born and raised there until we moved to the Bay Area as tech publishing realigned and the valley bubble crashed. Software became a service, and mobile became the dominant platform. Blogs and podcasting morphed into streaming and social with the current investments in the creator economy — newsletters and live audio.</p>
<p>These efforts have not gone unnoticed by the remaining media giants. Substack&#8217;s year-long investment in proving a subscription basis for writers and influencers has reached some combination of yes, it&#8217;s possible and no, it&#8217;s very hard to scale. On the pro side, Kara Swisher is one of the significant contributors moving her newsletter behind the paywall of the New York Times, and bolstering Twitter Spaces with a frequent live audio show. The fact that you can&#8217;t find these shows after the fact will likely be solved by a record/replay feature Twitter is working on. Once you can&#8217;t distinguish live audio from a podcast, the next step is not distinguishing podcasts from streaming programming. This evolution is behind Rachel Maddow&#8217;s moves to straddle her daily show and her podcast-becomes-book properties. CNBC&#8217;s Jim Cramer is going there too, as I noted on this edition of the Gang:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jim Cramer, the fabulous analyst and the Mad Money guy [adds Brent Leary]. He&#8217;s signed a new deal. This is kind of like Rachel Maddow 2.0 or 3.0. He&#8217;s doing something called CNBC Investor Club, and basically he&#8217;s delving into the creator economy. These media on camera editor types are slowly becoming engaged in creating product.</p></blockquote>
<p>Frank Radice:</p>
<blockquote><p>He doesn&#8217;t jump into something like that unless he sees a real opening to make money. Think of what he was doing even before he went to CNBC. And he&#8217;s not a stupid man. I think it&#8217;s very interesting that he will be able to on CNBC and probably on his new ventures, make his opinions public as long as they put a rejoinder at the end, saying this is not an opinion of CNBC, it&#8217;s just Jim Cramer&#8217;s opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brent Leary jokes about Cramer dipping into the 30% pool that the Epic lawsuit frees up for new Club members, but however the move shakes out, we appear to be on the way from cable (CNN) to PayTV (Z Channel) to the subscription+ economy. What Netflix wrought and Amazon, Disney, Hulu, HBO Max, and Paramount+ chased is being tested by Apple TV+ of all things. Apple is doing things a little different this time, undercutting its AppleTV device with streaming dongles like Amazon Firestick and platform deals with smartTV heavyweights like Roku. The AppleTV hardware is top of the line, but in price not exclusivity. The kicker is that AppleTV+ is bargain-priced but exclusive in execution.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got HBO pinned down as a cable premium service folded into HBO Max fighting off the disappearing theatrical window. Apple&#8217;s original-only strategy seemed overmatched by Netflix&#8217;s volume game, but the Pandemic knocked down production to the point where originals had to be acquired from Europe and Scandinavia to keep the pipeline open. Well-appointed binge blockbusters like The Crown and so-called limited series like The Queen&#8217;s Gambit came from the HBO playbook, but they were few and far between for nightlight viewers struggling to keep up with subtitles and mediocre dubbing.</p>
<p>Instead we&#8217;re in the AppleTV+ equation. With the same methodical and relentless blend of hardware and software Apple uses to dominate the mobile margins, AppleTV+ extends the platform with a product designed to wipe out the broadcast linear markets. For the first time, the Emmys were not so much dominated by the streamers as ghosting the network TV shows in nominations. CBS, long a bastion for comedies, broadcast the Emmys without a single nomination, and gave the spotlight instead to Hacks, a funny HBO Max original developed not for cable but streaming direct. We&#8217;re not in Kansas, anymore.</p>
<p>Where we are is watching Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, and scifi epic Foundation. Not enough to satisfy the void created by the collapse of network and cable TV, but more than a harbinger of things to come. When CNN debuted, people wondered why anyone would watch news 24 hours a day. Now they&#8217;re wondering that again, with the mute button on 24/7 and notifications telling you what&#8217;s shaking. Production is shifting from green screens to interactive LED screens that matte actors into backgrounds they can see as they perform. Projects deemed unfilmable are no longer so. Blackberry, meet the iPhone.</p>
<p>AppleTV+ has the aura of a linear broadcast network spiced with a tech platform. Apple&#8217;s hardware/software overlapping release schedule shifts between short range customer-facing innovations like this year&#8217;s iPhone 13 camera advances and long-range efforts to move from third party data and user tracking to a first party transaction data set. The new phone&#8217;s ability to use additional mapping to do professional-level rack focusing while and after recording augurs for more and more features shifting into software manipulation on more powerful system hardware. AppleTV+ takes advantage of a hole in the market between streaming and traditional broadcast and cable to build out the same mix of quality and innovation lock-in its physical products offer.</p>
