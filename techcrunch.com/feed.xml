										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers are facing further pressure to step in and do something about lackadaisical enforcement of the bloc&#8217;s flagship data protection regime after the European Parliament voted yesterday to back a call urging the Commission to start an infringement proceeding against Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) for not &#8220;properly enforcing&#8221; the regulation.</p>
<p>The Commission and the DPC have been contacted for comment on the parliament&#8217;s call.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">Last summer</a> the Commission&#8217;s own two-year review of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) highlighted a lack of uniformly vigorous enforcement &#8212; but commissioners were keener to point out the positives, lauding the regulation as a &#8220;global reference point&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But it&#8217;s now nearly three years since the regulation begun being applied and criticism over weak enforcement is getting harder for the EU&#8217;s executive to ignore.</p>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0256_EN.pdf">resolution</a> &#8212; which, while non-legally binding, fires a strong political message across the Commission&#8217;s bow &#8212; singles out the DPC for specific criticism given its outsized role in enforcement of the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It&#8217;s the lead supervisory authority for complaints brought against the many big tech companies which choose to site their regional headquarters in the country (on account of its corporate-friendly tax system).</span></p>
<p>The text of the resolution expresses &#8220;deep concern&#8221; over the DPC&#8217;s failure to reach a decision on a number of complaints against breaches of the GDPR filed the day it came into application, on May 25, 2018 &#8212; including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">against Facebook and Google</a> &#8212; and criticises the Irish data watchdog for interpreting ‘without delay’ in Article 60(3) of the GDPR &#8220;contrary to the legislators’ intention – as longer than a matter of months&#8221;, as they put it.</p>
<p>To date the DPC has only reached a final decision on one cross-border GDPR case &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">against Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>The parliament also says it&#8217;s &#8220;concerned about the lack of tech specialists working for the DPC and their use of outdated systems&#8221; (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/brave-accuses-european-governments-of-gdpr-resourcing-failure/">Brave also flagged last year</a>) &#8212; as well as criticizing the watchdog&#8217;s handling of a complaint originally brought by privacy campaigner Max Schrems years before the GDPR came into application, which relates to the clash between EU privacy rights and US surveillance laws, and which still hasn&#8217;t resulted in a decision.</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s approach to handling Schrems&#8217; 2013 complaint led to a 2018 referral to the CJEU &#8212; which in turn led to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">landmark Schrems II judgement last summer</a> invalidating the flagship EU-US data transfer arrangement, Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>That ruling did not outlaw alternative data transfer mechanisms but made it clear that EU DPAs have an obligation to step in and suspend data transfers if European&#8217;s information is being taken to a third country that does not have essentially equivalent protections to those they have under EU law &#8212; thereby putting the ball back in the DPC&#8217;s court on the Schrems complaint.</p>
<p>The Irish regulator then sent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facebook-told-it-may-have-to-suspend-eu-data-transfers-after-schrems-ii-ruling/">a preliminary order to Facebook to suspend its data transfers</a> and the tech giant responded by filing for a judicial review of the DPC&#8217;s processes. However the Irish High Court rejected Facebook&#8217;s petition <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/facebook-loses-last-ditch-attempt-to-derail-dpc-decision-on-its-eu-us-data-flows/">last week</a>. And a stay on the DPC&#8217;s investigation was lifted yesterday &#8212; so the DPC&#8217;s process of reaching a decision on the Facebook data flows complaint has started moving again.</p>
<p>A final decision could still take several months more, though &#8212; as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/">we&#8217;ve reported before</a> &#8212; as the DPC&#8217;s draft decision will also need to be put to the other EU DPAs for review and the chance to object.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s EU-US data transfers face their final countdown&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/facebooks-eu-us-data-transfers-face-their-final-countdown/embed/#?secret=L4DBdUgUEl" data-secret="L4DBdUgUEl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s resolution states that it &#8220;is worried that supervisory authorities have not taken proactive steps under Article 61 and 66 of the GDPR to force the DPC to comply with its obligations under the GDPR&#8221;, and &#8212; in more general remarks on the enforcement of GDPR around international data transfers &#8212; it states that it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is concerned about the insufficient level of enforcement of the GDPR, particularly in the area of international transfers; expresses concerns at the lack of prioritisation and overall scrutiny by national supervisory authorities with regard to personal data transfers to third countries, despite the significant CJEU case law developments over the past five years; deplores the absence of meaningful decisions and corrective measures in this regard, and urges the EDPB [European Data Protection Board] and national supervisory authorities to include personal data transfers as part of their audit, compliance and enforcement strategies; points out that harmonised binding administrative procedures on the representation of data subjects and admissibility are needed to provide legal certainty and deal with crossborder complaints;</p></blockquote>
<p>The knotty, multi-year saga of Schrems&#8217; Facebook data-flows complaint, as played out via the procedural twists of the DPC and Facebook&#8217;s lawyers&#8217; delaying tactics, illustrates the multi-layered legal, political and commercial complexities bound up with data flows out of the EU (post-Snowden&#8217;s 2013 revelations of US mass surveillance programs) &#8212; not to mention the staggering challenge for EU data subjects to actually exercise the rights they have on paper. But these intersecting issues around international data flows do seem to be finally coming to a head, in the wake of the Schrems II CJEU ruling.</p>
<p>The clock is now ticking for the issuing of major data suspension orders by EU data protection agencies, with Facebook&#8217;s business first in the firing line.</p>
<p>Other US-based services that are &#8212; similarly &#8212; subject to the US&#8217; FISA regime (and also move EU users data over the pond for processing; and whose businesses are such they cannot shield user data via &#8216;zero access&#8217; encryption architecture) are equally at risk of receiving an order to shut down their EU-US data-pipes. Or else having to shift data processing for these users inside the EU.</p>
<p>US-based services aren&#8217;t the only ones facing increasing legal uncertainty, either.</p>
<p>The UK, post-Brexit, is also classed as a third country (in EU law terms). And in a separate <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0262_EN.html">resolution</a> today the parliament adopted a text on the UK adequacy agreement, granted earlier this year by the Commission, which raises objections to the arrangement &#8212; including by flagging a lack of GDPR enforcement in the UK as problematic.</p>
<p>On that front the parliament highlights how adtech complaints filed with the ICO have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">failed to yield a decision</a>. (It writes that it&#8217;s concerned &#8220;non-enforcement is a structural problem&#8221; in the UK &#8212; which it suggests has left &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a large number of data protection law breaches&#8230; [un]remedied&#8221;.)</span></p>
<p>It also calls out the UK&#8217;s surveillance regime, questioning its compatibility with the CJEU&#8217;s requirements for essential equivalence &#8212; while also raising concerns about the risk that the UK could undermine protections on EU citizens data via onward transfers to jurisdictions the EU does not have an adequacy agreement with, among other objections.</p>
<p>The Commission put a four year lifespan on the UK&#8217;s adequacy deal &#8212; meaning there will be another major review ahead of any continuation of the arrangement in 2025.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a far cry from the &#8216;hands-off&#8217; fifteen years the EU-US &#8216;Safe Harbor&#8217; agreement stood for, before a Schrems challenge finally led to the CJEU striking it down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/europes-top-court-strikes-down-safe-harbor-data-transfer-agreement-with-u-s/">back in 2015</a>. So the takeaway here is that data deals that allow for people&#8217;s information to leave Europe aren&#8217;t going to be allowed to stand unchecked for years; close scrutiny and legal accountability are now firmly up front &#8212; and will remain in the frame going forward.</p>
<p>The global nature of the Internet and the ease with which data can digitally flow across borders of course brings huge benefits for businesses &#8212; but the resulting interplay between different legal regimes is leading to increasing levels of legal uncertainty for companies seeking to take people&#8217;s data across borders.</p>
<p>In the EU&#8217;s case, the issue is that data protection is regulated within the bloc and these laws require that protection stays with people&#8217;s information, no matter where it goes. So if the data flows to countries that do not offer the same safeguards &#8212; be that the US or indeed China or India (or even the UK) &#8212; then that risk is that it can&#8217;t, legally, be taken there.</p>
<p>How to resolve this clash, between data protection laws based on individual privacy rights and data access mandates driven by national security priorities, has no easy answers.</p>
<p>For the US, and for the transatlantic data flows between the EU and the US, the Commission has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/no-quick-fix-for-transatlantic-data-transfers-says-ec/">warned there will be no quick fix</a> this time &#8212; as happened when it slapped a sticking plaster atop the invalidated Safe Harbor, hailing a new &#8216;Privacy Shield&#8217; regime; only for the CJEU to blast that out of the water for much the same reasons a few years later. (The parliament resolution is particularly withering in its assessment of the Commission&#8217;s historic missteps there.)</p>
<p>For a fix to stick, major reform of US surveillance law is going to be needed. And the Commission appears to have accepted that&#8217;s not going to come overnight, so it seems to be trying to brace businesses for turbulence&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">On EU-US transfers,  I am in close contact with <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> authorities to find future-proof solutions.

<p>&mdash; Didier Reynders (@dreynders) <a href="https://twitter.com/dreynders/status/1395354545081962502?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s resolution on Schrems II also makes it clear that it expects DPAs to step in and cut off risky data flows &#8212; with MEPs writing that &#8220;if no arrangement with the US is swiftly found which guarantees an essentially equivalent and therefore adequate level of protection to that provided by the GDPR and the Charter, that these transfers will be suspended until the situation is resolved&#8221;.</p>
<p>So if DPAs fail to do this &#8212; and if Ireland keeps dragging its feet on closing out the Schrems complaint &#8212; they should expect more resolutions to be blasted at them from the parliament.</p>
<p>MEPs emphasize the need for any future EU-US data transfer agreement &#8220;to address the problems identified by the Court ruling in a sustainable manner&#8221; &#8212; pointing out that &#8220;no contract between companies can provide protection from indiscriminate access by intelligence authorities to the content of electronic communications, nor can any contract between companies provide sufficient legal remedies against mass surveillance&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This requires a reform of US surveillance laws and practices with a view to ensuring that access of US security authorities to data transferred from the EU is limited to what is necessary and proportionate, and that European data subjects have access to effective judicial redress before US courts,&#8221; the parliament adds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still true that businesses may be able to legally move EU personal data out of the bloc. Even, potentially, to the US &#8212; depending on the type of business; the data itself; and additional safeguards that could be applied.</p>
<p>However for data-mining companies like Facebook &#8212; which are subject to FISA and whose businesses rely on accessing people&#8217;s data &#8212; then achieving essential equivalence with EU privacy protections looks, well, essentially impossible.</p>
<p>And while the parliament hasn&#8217;t made an explicit call in the resolution for Facebook&#8217;s EU data flows to be cut off that is the clear implication of it urging infringement proceedings against the DPC (and deploring &#8220;the absence of meaningful decisions and corrective measures&#8221; in the area of international transfers).</p>
<p>The parliament says it wants to see &#8220;solid mechanisms compliant with the CJEU judgement&#8221; set out &#8212; for the benefit of businesses with the chance to legally move data out of the EU &#8212; saying, for example, that the<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Commission&#8217;s proposal for a template for Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) should &#8220;duly take into account all the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/europe-puts-out-advice-on-fixing-international-data-transfers-thats-cold-comfort-for-facebook/">relevant recommendations of the EDPB</a>&#8220;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also says it supports the </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">creation of a tool box of supplementary measures for such businesses to choose from &#8212; in areas like security and data protection certification; encryption safeguards; and pseudonymisation &#8212; so long as the measures included are accepted by regulators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It also wants to see publicly available resources on the relevant legislation of the EU’s main trading partners to help businesses that have the possibility of being able to legally move data out of the bloc get guidance to help them do so with compliance.</span></p>
<p>The overarching message here is that businesses should buckle up for disruption of cross-border data flows &#8212; and tool up for compliance, where possible.</p>
<p>In another segment of the resolution, for example, the parliament calls on the Commission to &#8220;analyse the situation of cloud providers falling under section 702 of the FISA who transfers data using SCCs&#8221; &#8212; going on to suggest that support for European alternatives to US cloud providers may be needed to plug &#8220;gaps in the protection of data of European citizens transferred to the United States&#8221; and &#8220;reduce the dependence of the Union in storage capacities vis-à-vis third countries and to strengthen the Union’s strategic autonomy in terms of data management and protection&#8221;.</p>

<p>There’s latent demand for life insurance currently unaddressed by much of the financial services industry, and embedded finance can be the solution. It’s imperative for companies to consider product lines and partnerships to expand markets, create new revenue streams and provide added value to their customers.</p>

<p>Connecting consumers with products they need through channels they already know and trust is both a massive revenue opportunity and a social good, providing financial resilience to families at a time when they need it most.</p>
<h2>Why bundle life insurance?</h2>
<p>The concept of digitally bundling financial products in a packaged offering to a customer is certainly not new — but it is for the life insurance space.</p>
<p>Embedded finance uses technology and operations infrastructure to offer products and services through entities that may not be financial institutions at all. Think of embedded finance like on-demand shopping; customers benefit from both the transaction (buying financial protection for their families) and the convenience it provides (from whatever platform they are currently engaging with).</p>
<p>Similar to how <a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/shopping-on-amazon-saves-you-over-75-hours-a-year-jeff-bezos/story/436816.html">Amazon saves shoppers 75 hours a year</a>, bundling life insurance gives consumers back time in their day and can improve their financial health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snap yesterday announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest iteration of its Spectacles augmented reality glasses</a>, and today the company revealed a bit more news: it is also acquiring the startup that supplied the technology that helps power them. The Snapchat parent is snapping up <a href="https://enhancedworld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WaveOptics</a>, an AR startup that makes the waveguides and projectors used in AR glasses. These overlay virtual images on top of the views of the real world someone wearing the glasses can see, and Snap worked with WaveOptics to build its latest version of Spectacles.</p>
<p>The deal was first reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447150/snap-waveoptics-acquisition-500m-spectacles-waveguides" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a>, and a spokesperson for Snap directly confirmed the details to TechCrunch. Snap is paying more than $500 million for the startup, in a cash-and-stock deal. The first half of that will be coming in the form of stock when the deal officially closes, and the remainder will be payable in cash or stock in two years.</p>
<p>This is a big leap for WaveOptics, which had raised around $65 million in funding from investors that included Bosch, Octopus Ventures and a host of individuals, including Stan Boland (veteran entrepreneur in the U.K., most recently at FiveAI) and Ambarish Mitra (the co-founder of early AR startup Blippar). PitchBook estimates that its most recent valuation <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/107674-03/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was only around $105 million</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>WaveOptics was founded in Oxford, and it&#8217;s not clear where the team will be based after the deal is closed &#8212; we have asked.</p>

<p>We have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/waveoptics-which-makes-waveguide-based-optics-tech-for-ar-nabs-16m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covering the company since its earliest days</a>, when it displayed some very interesting, early, and ahead-of-its-time technology: waveguides based on hologram physics and photonic crystals. The important and key thing is that its tech drastically compresses size and load of the hardware needed to process and display images, meaning a much wider and more flexible range of form factors for AR hardware based on WaveOptics tech.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether WaveOptics will continue to work with other parties post-deal, but it seems that one obvious advantage for Snap would be making the startup&#8217;s technology exclusive to itself.</p>
<p>Snap has been on something of an acquisition march in recent times &#8212; it&#8217;s made at least three other purchases of startups since January, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fit Analytics</a> for an AR-fuelled move into e-commerce, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/snap-has-acquired-pixel8earth-a-3d-mapping-developer-for-7-6m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixel8Earth</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/snap-acquires-streetcred/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StreetCred</a> for its mapping tools.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>This deal, however, marks Snap&#8217;s biggest acquisition to date in terms of valuation. That is not only a mark of the premium price that foundational artificial intelligence tech continues to command &#8212; in addition to the team of scientists that built WaveOptics, it also has 12 filed and in-progress patents &#8212; but also Snap&#8217;s financial and, frankly, existential commitment to having a seat at the table when it comes not just to social apps that use AR, but hardware, and being at the centre of not just using the tech, but setting the pace and agenda for how and where that will play out.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s been a tenacious and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/28/why-snapchat-spectacles-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not always rewarding place</a> for it to be, but the company &#8212; which has long described itself as a &#8220;camera company&#8221; &#8212; has kept hardware in the mix as an essential component for its future strategy.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This week was good fun not only because we had the whole team together to record, but also because we are still basking in the <em>endless glory</em> of our winning a Webby earlier this week. Frankly we are still shocked. But happy-shocked, like when you get a new toy and it is covered in static electricity.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, we had a packed show with much, much left on the floor as we tried to shoehorn the week into our time slot. Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>The world of connections: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fave-with-2-2-million-seed-looks-to-connect-creators-with-their-fandoms/">Fave raised $2.2 million</a> to connect fandoms, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/somewhere-good-seed-round/">Somewhere Good raised $3.75 million</a> to build feedless micro-communities, and both Spokn (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2154482&amp;&amp;preview=true">$4 million</a>) and Spot (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/spot-meetings-seed/">$5 million</a>) are hoping to use the spoken word to connect companies and their staffs. Honestly we think that the overall connection-community world is super exciting.</li>
<li>Piano, one of those startups we actually have the luck of using, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/piano-raises-88m-for-analytics-subscription-and-personalization-tools-for-publishers-adds-linkedin-as-investor/">raised $88 million for analytics</a>, subscription, and personalization tools. We get into why the round makes sense, and why one investor stood out more than the others.</li>
<li>Corporate media: Coinbase is <a href="https://www.axios.com/coinbase-media-editor-crypto-682b8dca-11dd-4efc-93ef-ecb50ecdda35.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;utm_source=twitter">building out a media-ish org</a> (Alex wrote about it <a href="https://alexwrites.substack.com/p/news-media-marketing-and-power">here on his personal blog</a>; <a href="https://www.scrawler.co/p/on-media-and-content-marketing">Scrawler.co has more on the matter</a>), and with <a href="https://www.axios.com/theskimm-bankers-sale-acquisition-f1be39c5-f29b-4ae8-93ba-558569bdc414.html">TheSkimm hoping to find a corporate home</a> and The Hustle <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/hubspot-acquires-media-startup-the-hustle/">doing the same</a>, we had to dig into the matter. Our take is that content marketing is a response to expensive social advertising. And that it&#8217;s fine. And that it is not news.</li>
<li>Shoutout Forbes and<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/media/forbes-union/index.html"> its new union effort</a>. Well done.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/uptrust-raises-2m-to-fight-the-billions-of-dollars-wasted-on-useless-mass-incarceration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uptrust raised $2M, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which let us talk about the venture-sized opportunity in fighting the billions of dollars wasted on useless mass incarceration.</span></li>
<li>And then we chatted about the public markets. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fast-growth-pushes-an-unprofitable-no-code-startup-into-the-public-markets-inside-monday-coms-ipo-filing/">Monday.com&#8217;s IPO is filed</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/inside-marqetas-fascinating-fintech-ipo/">Marqeta&#8217;s IPO is filed</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/can-squarespace-dodge-the-direct-listing-value-trap/">Squarespace&#8217;s direct listing is done</a>, and more. It&#8217;s hectic out there for late-stage startups.</li>
</ul>
<p>The show flew by, much like our days recently, simply because it was so fun and jam-packed with news. And we got to make jokes about our listeners and Monday.com PR timing, so what else could we ask for? Talk soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As decentralized currencies have taken off in recent months, there&#8217;s been renewed attention around DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, as a means of bringing together groups of investors who can deploy capital as a unit while voting collectively on those investments. In the spirit of blockchain, they aim to bring greater transparency to investment decision-making.</p>
<p>A number of high-profile DAOs have launched in recent months as crypto mania came to a fervor. <a href="https://www.syndicateprotocol.org/syndicate/komorebi">Komorebi Collective</a>, launching today, is a new organization founded by women in the blockchain space that will be making investments exclusively in &#8220;exceptional female and non-binary crypto founders,&#8221; founding member Manasi Vora tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The group is comprised of a number of core team members largely assembled from the crypto nonprofit <a href="https://she256.org/">she256</a> and organization <a href="https://blockchaingirls.org/">Women in Blockchain</a>, including <a href="https://twitter.com/manasilvora">Vora</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wvaeu">Eva Wu</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kristiehuang">Kristie Huang</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/medhakothari">Medha Kothari</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah">Kinjal Shah</a> who will collectively do most of the heavy-lifting behind finding and presenting investments to the group. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Other hand-selected members who committed a minimum of $5,000 USD will likely have a lighter commitment.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Each investment will be voted on by all the collective&#8217;s key signers, some 36 in total, the majority of which are female.</p>
<p>&#8220;DAOs level the hierarchy of a venture fund by ensuring everyone is going to have a seat at the table,&#8221; says Shah, who is also an investor at crypto VC firm Blockchain Capital. &#8220;We are very careful in approaching the backers that are really mission-aligned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other members of the DAO include firms like Kleiner Perkins, Mechanism Capital, Dragonfly Capital, IDEO CoLab Ventures and Stacks Accelerator alongside a number of individuals and founders who work at firms like Twitter, Coinbase, Skynet Labs, Celo Labs and Gitcoin.</p>
<p>The organization itself is built on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Syndicate-411691f0a88b4e909b46796965ee11c1">Syndicate Protocol</a>, a project that shares some of Komorebi Collective&#8217;s backers.</p>
<p>The group hopes the structure of their organization will be able to take a mission-driven approach that improves diversity in the crypto space while proving the sustainability of the DAO model. Despite an explosion in startup investments in the past year, women-led startups received just 2.3% of venture dollars invested in 2020, a study in <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020#:~:text=This%20wasn't%20just%20part,comes%20after%20years%20of%20increases.">HBR</a> found.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s so much more room to grow when it comes to female founders getting funding and I want to be part of the solution,&#8221; Shah tells TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Indian government has expressed strong objection to Twitter for classifying certain tweets by Indian politicians as &#8220;manipulated media,&#8221; according to a notice leaked to journalists Friday.</p>
<p>The notice comes two days after Twitter <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/twitter-labels-sambit-patras-tweet-cong-toolkit-manipulated-media-149257">labeled a tweet from Sambit Patra</a>, the spokesperson of India&#8217;s ruling party BJP, as &#8220;manipulated media.&#8221; In the tweet, Patra had claimed that Congress, the leading opposition party in India, was using a so-called &#8220;toolkit&#8221; to derail the Indian government&#8217;s efforts against the coronavirus pandemic. Alt News, a leading fact-checking organization in India, <a href="https://www.altnews.in/covid-toolkit-attributed-to-congress-created-on-forged-letterhead/">debunked Patra&#8217;s claim</a>.</p>
<p>The notice didn&#8217;t mention any politician by name nor did it identify any tweets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the notice, the Indian government said Twitter chose to designate tweets as &#8220;manipulated&#8221; &#8220;prejudicially&#8221; even though an investigation hadn&#8217;t been conducted, and also &#8220;asked&#8221; Twitter to remove such tags in the interest of &#8220;fairness and equity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s action, the Indian government said, dilutes its credibility as a &#8220;neutral and unbiased&#8221; platform as well as puts a &#8220;question mark on the status of Twitter as an &#8216;Intermediary.'&#8221; Twitter, Facebook, and any other social media firm with a certain size &#8212; over a few million users &#8212; are identified as an &#8220;intermediary&#8221; in India, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">a recently unveiled law,</a> which provisions some of the world&#8217;s toughest rules for internet companies.</p>
<p>A spokesperson of Twitter &#8212; which has labeled several politicians&#8217; tweets over the years to provide more context or correction, citing news media and independent fact checkers or its own technology, in many markets &#8212; told TechCrunch that the company had no comment.</p>
<p>The new notice underscores the dilemma Twitter faces in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, where it has amassed over 100 million users and has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">backed local startups</a>.</p>
<p>The Jack Dorsey-led company has had to grappled several tough situations in India this year. After briefly complying with a New Delhi order early this year, the company faced heat from the government for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">restoring accounts that had posted tweets critical of the Indian government&#8217;s policy</a> or the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>The two faced off again publicly last month after New Delhi ordered Twitter and Facebook to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/india-orders-twitter-to-take-down-tweets-critical-of-its-coronavirus-handling/">take down posts</a> that were critical of the government&#8217;s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tanihub.com/">TaniHub Group</a>, an Indonesian startup that helps farmers get better prices and more customers for their crops, has raised a $65.5 million Series B. The funding was led by MDI Ventures, the investment arm of Telkom Group, one of Indonesia’s largest telecoms, with participation from Add Ventures, BRI Ventures, Flourish Ventures, Intudo Ventures, Openspace Ventures, Tenaya Capital, UOB Venture Management and Vertex Ventures.</p>
<p>Openspace and Intudo are returning investors from TaniHub’s $10 million Series A, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/tanigroup-raises-10-million/">announced in May 2019</a>. The new funding brings its total raised to about $94 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, TaniHub now has more than 45,000 farmers and 350,000 buyers (including businesses and consumers) in its network. The company helps farmers earn more for their crops by streamlining distribution channels so there are less middlemen between farms and the restaurants, grocery stores, vendors and other businesses that buy their products. It does this through three units: TaniHub, TaniSupply and TaniFund.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TaniHub is its B2B e-commerce platform, which connects farmers directly to customers. Then orders are fulfilled through TaniSupply, the company’s logistics platform, which currently operates six warehousing and processing facilities where harvests can be washed, sorted and packed within an hour, before being delivered to buyers by TaniHub’s own couriers or third-party logistics providers.</p>
<p>Finally, TaniFund is a fintech platform that provides loans to farmers they can use while growing crops and pay off by selling through TaniHub. Co-founder and chief executive officer Eka Pamitra told TechCrunch its credit scoring system is based on three years of performance, the company’s agriculture value chain expertise and partnerships with financial institutions.</p>
<p>“More than 100 data points are considered when doing the credit risk assessment. For example, for cultivation financing products, TaniFund tailors each credit scoring based on agriculture risks and market risk of each commodity, on top of the typical borrower E-KYC scoring and process,” he explained. “Beyond credit scoring, having TaniSupply and TaniHub as a standby buyer within the ecosystem also helps to mitigate risk of each loan.  TaniFund aims to further boost its credit scoring system with smarter data processing and better machine learning models.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Agritech startup TaniGroup raises $10M to help Indonesia&#8217;s farmers grow&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/tanigroup-raises-10-million/embed/#?secret=EXAtHibUzA" data-secret="EXAtHibUzA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pamitra said TaniHub will use its new funding to build the upstream and midstream parts of its supply chain—in other words, new cultivation areas, processing, packing centers and warehouses. The company will also expand its coverage beyond Java and Bali to source and sell locally, and continue improving its supply-demand forecast model to help farmers plans crop cultivation and timing, with the goal of reducing price fluctuations and maintaining a consistent supply. Pamitra added that TaniHub will also explore precision farming technology.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, TaniHub has started exporting several types of fruits and spices to the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and South Korea. This year, it plans to focus on expanding within Indonesia because the F&amp;B (food and beverage) market there is worth $137 billion and the Indonesian agriculture sector is still highly fragmented, Pamitra said.</p>
<p>Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, TaniHub says it was able to grow its revenue 600% year-on-year in 2020 as demand for online groceries increased.</p>
<p>“We postponed our branch expansion plan and focused on increasing the seven existing warehouses’ since there was a surge of demand on the B2C segment and the process of onboarding farmers. This benefited us since the adoption of purchasing fresh groceries online increased significantly, and the willingness of farmers to work with us became remarkably high because the local traditional markets were closed due to lockdowns,” Pamitra said. “Since COVID-19, the eagerness of provincial governments to open communications for TaniHub to work with local farmers and SMEs in their region has been quite impactful.”</p>
<p>TaniHub is now working with several Indonesian government agencies, including the Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, to onboard more farmers, F&amp;B businesses and increase exports.</p>
<p>In a press statement, MDI Ventures director of portfolio management Sandhy Widyasthana said, “TaniHub Group has an important role in transforming the agriculture sector and has proven that its presence can deliver positive impact on the quality of life of farmers. We hope our investment can help them continue their work and expand their coverage to more and more farming communities in Indonesia.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Farmers and food businesses, like restaurants, deal with the same issue: a fragmented supply chain. <a href="http://secai-marche.co.jp/">Secai Marche</a> wants to streamline agricultural logistics, making fulfillment more cost-efficient and enabling food businesses to bundle products from different farmers into the same order. The company is headquartered in Japan, with operations in Malaysia, and plans to expand into Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. This week, it announced 150 million JPY (about $1.4 million USD) in pre-Series A funding from Rakuten Ventures and Beyond Next Ventures to build a B2B logistics platform for farmers that sell to restaurants, hotels and other F&amp;B (food and beverage) businesses.</p>
<p>This round brings Secai Marche’s total raised to about $3 million. The capital will be used to expand its fulfillment infrastructure, including a network of warehouses and cold chain logistics, hire more people for its engineering team, and sales and marketing.</p>
<p>Secai Marche was founded in 2018 by Ami Sugiyama and Shusaku Hayakawa, and currently serves 130 farmers and more than 300 F&amp;B businesses. Before launching the startup, Sugiyama spent four years working in Southeast Asia, including managing restaurants and cafes in Malaysia. During that time, she started to import green tea from Japan, intending to sell it directly to customers in Malaysia. But she realized supply chain inefficiencies not only made it hard to meet demand, but also ensure quality for all kinds of ingredients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Hayakawa was operating a farm in Japan and working on agriculture control systems that predicted weather and crop growth to help farmers maintain consistent quality.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Alibaba rival Pinduoduo is investing in agritech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/embed/#?secret=OLaXpMnwP4" data-secret="OLaXpMnwP4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Both Sugiyama and Hayakawa ended up at consulting firm Deloitte, researching how to create a more efficient supply chain for Japanese agricultural exports to Singaporean F&amp;B businesses. Policies implemented by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s administration <a href="https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2021/03/12/challenges-in-boosting-japans-agricultural-exports">aim to increase Japanese agricultural exports</a> from 922.3 billion JPY (about $8.5 billion) in 2020 to 2 trillion JPY (about $18.5 billion) by 2025, and 5 trillion JPY (about $46.1 billion) in 2030.</p>
<p>Seche Marche’s goal is to make it easier for farmers to sell their crops to F&amp;B businesses domestically or overseas.</p>
<p>“We found that not only farmers in Japan, but also all farmers in Southeast Asia have the same problem in terms of the current supply chain,” Sugiyama told TechCrunch. “So we left Deloitte and started our own business to connect not only farmers in Japan, but farmers in all Asian countries.”</p>
<p>Secai Marche’s logistics management tech is what differentiates it from other wholesaler platforms. It uses an AI-based algorithm to predict demand based on consumption trends, seasonal products and farmer recommendations, said Hayakawa. Secai Marche runs its own warehouse network, but mostly relies on third-party logistics providers for fulfillment, and its platform assigns orders to the most efficient transportation method.</p>
<p>This allows F&amp;B businesses to consolidate orders from farmers, so they can order smaller batches from different places without spending more money. About 30% of Secai Marche’s products are shipped to other countries, while the rest are sold domestically.</p>
<p>Secai Marche is reaching out to farmers who want to increase their customer base. About 30% of its products currently come from Japanese farms, 50% from Malaysia and the rest from other ASEAN countries. Sugiyama and Hayakawa said the COVID-19 pandemic affected Secai Marche’s expansion plans because it originally planned to enter Singapore this year, but had to slow down since they were unable to travel and meet with farmers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many farmers have started selling directly to consumers through social media like Instagram or Facebook, and have approached Secai Marche for help with fulfillment, logistics, repacking and quality control.</p>

<p>Founded in June 2020, Mio now claims hundreds of agents, or resellers. They are primarily women aged 25 to 35 years old who live in smaller cities or rural areas. Most join Mio because they want to supplement their household income, which is usually below $350, Huynh and Venturra investment associate Valerie Vu told TechCrunch in an email.</p>
<p>The social commerce model works for them because they are part of tight-knit communities that are already used to making group orders together. On average, Mio claims that its resellers make about $200 to $300, earning a 10% commission on each order, and additional commissions based on the monthly performance of resellers they referred to the platform.</p>
<p>Mio is among a crop of social commerce startups across Asia that leverage the buying power of areas where major e-commerce players haven’t reached dominance yet. For example, lower tier cities f<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/the-incredible-rise-of-pinduoduo/">ueled Pinduoduo’s meteoric rise in China</a>, while Meesho has built a distribution network in 5,000 Indian cities. Other examples of social commerce areas focused on smaller cities and rural areas include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/super-an-indonesian-hyperlocal-social-commerce-startup-raises-28m-led-by-softbank-ventures-asia/">“hyperlocal” startup Super</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/indonesian-social-commerce-app-kitabeli-gets-10m-led-by-go-ventures/">KitaBeli</a>, both in Indonesia, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/resellee-wants-to-become-the-pinduoduo-of-southeast-asia/">Resellee in the Philippines</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Super, an Indonesian hyperlocal social commerce startup, raises $28M led by SoftBank Ventures Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/super-an-indonesian-hyperlocal-social-commerce-startup-raises-28m-led-by-softbank-ventures-asia/embed/#?secret=vBDN0GRU3B" data-secret="vBDN0GRU3B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Social commerce companies typically don’t require resellers to carry inventory. Instead, resellers pick what items they want to market to their buyers. In Mio’s case, most of their resellers’ customers are friends, family members and neighbors, and they promote group orders through social media platforms like Facebook, TikTok, Instagram or Zalo, Vietnam’s most popular messaging app. Then they place and manage orders through Mio’s reseller app.</p>
<p>To address delivery challenges, Mio is building an in-house logistics and fulfillment system, including a new distribution center in Thu Duc that can distribute goods to all of Ho Chi Minh and the surrounding five cities in Binh Dong and Dong Nai provinces. Vu and Huynh said Mio can process up to tens of thousands of daily order units at the center. Mio is also able to perform next-day deliveries for orders that are made prior to 8PM.</p>
<p>To lower logistics costs and ensure quick delivery times, Mio limits the number of products in its inventory. The company currently focuses on grocery staples, including fresh produce and poultry, and plans to add FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) and household appliances, too, especially white-label goods that have a higher profit margin.</p>
<p>Mio’s new funding will be used on its distribution center, and hiring for its tech and product teams. The startup plans to add more personalization options for product categories and resellers, so they can build their own brand identities.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Telemedicine has faced an uphill battle to become more relevant in the U.S., with challenges like meeting HIPPA compliance requirements and insurance companies unwilling to pay for virtual visits.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Telemedicine, in its original form of the phone call, has been around for decades. For people in remote or rural areas without easy access to in-person care, consulting a doctor over the phone has often been the go-to approach. But for a large swath of the world used to taking half a day off work just for a 15-30 minute doctor’s appointment, it may seem like telemedicine was invented only last year. That&#8217;s mostly because it wasn’t until 2020 that telemedicine, in its myriad forms, debuted into the mainstream consciousness.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It’s impossible to predict how healthcare institutions will operate post-pandemic, but with so many people now accustomed to telemedicine, startups that provide services around virtual care continue to be poised for success.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Telemedicine has faced an uphill battle to become more relevant in the U.S., with challenges such as meeting HIPAA compliance requirements and insurance companies unwilling to pay for virtual visits. But when COVID-19 began raging across the globe and people had to stay home, both the insurance and healthcare industries were forced to adapt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been said that there are decades where nothing happens, and then there are weeks when decades happen,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.startuphealth.com/">StartUp Health</a> co-founders Steven Krein and Unity Stoakes in the company’s 2020 year-end report. That statement couldn&#8217;t be truer for telemedicine: Around $3.1 billion in funding flowed into the sector in 2020 — about three times what we saw in 2019, according to the <a href="https://www.startuphealth.com/insights-reports">report</a>. A health tech fund and insights company, StartUp Health counts Alphabet, Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz as some of its co-investors.</p>
<p>Now that people see the benefits and conveniences of &#8220;dialing a doc&#8221; from the kitchen table, healthcare has changed forever. It’s impossible to predict how healthcare institutions will operate post-pandemic, but with so many people now accustomed to telemedicine, startups that provide services around virtual care continue to be poised for success.</p>
<h2>The state of telemedicine</h2>
<p>Major players in the field now look at the state of healthcare as, &#8220;before COVID and after COVID,&#8221; Stoakes told Extra Crunch. &#8220;In the post-pandemic world, there’s a significant transformation that’s occurred,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s all accelerated; the customers have shown up. There’s more capital than ever and consumers and physicians have adapted quickly,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In the U.S., healthcare is first and foremost a business, so while there are treatment approaches that have long been proven to improve patient outcomes, if they didn’t make sense financially, they weren’t instituted at scale. Telemedicine is a great example of this.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/telemedicine-and-its-role-in-revolutionizing-healthcare-delivery">2017 study by the American Journal of Accountable Care</a> showed that telemedicine can be quite useful for managing healthcare. &#8220;The use of telemedicine has been shown to allow for better long-term care management and patient satisfaction; it also offers a new means to locate health information and communicate with practitioners (e.g., via e-mail and interactive chats or video conferences), thereby increasing convenience for the patient and reducing the amount of potential travel required for both physician and patient,” the study reads.</p>
<p>But as we&#8217;ve seen, it took a global healthcare emergency to drive widespread adoption of virtual healthcare in the U.S. Now that investors recognize the potential, they are increasingly pouring money into startups that promise to take telemedicine to the next level. Some of the investors backing these newer companies include StartUp Health, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, Alphabet, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/11246-23/investor/profile">Kaiser Permanente Ventures</a>, U.S. Venture Partners, Maveron, First Round Capital, DreamIt Ventures, Human Ventures and Tusk Venture Partners.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>It’s Thursday, everyone, and the technology and startup worlds were a mixed bag today. We learned about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/so-long-internet-explorer-and-your-decades-of-security-bugs/">final death of Internet Explorer</a> (RIP), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-announces-its-latest-generation-of-its-spectacles-a-streamlined-device-for-experience-the-world-in-ar/">new AR glasses from Snap</a>, fresh <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/new-cryptocurrency-irs-rules-2023-crypto/">cryptocurrency rules for the United States</a>, and even took the time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/robotics-roundup-12/">to look into</a> all the pizza-robot startups. Hell, Ford even made the cut with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">new electric truck</a> that I secretly covet (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-can-power-your-home-in-an-outage/">it can power your house if the grid goes down!</a>).</p>
<p>As always, we’ve collected the three key stories for the day below and then have a rapid-fire breakdown of startup and Big Tech news to follow. Let’s go! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer financial technology is <em>so</em> hot:</strong> With Berlin-based investing app Trade Republic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/berlins-trade-republic-nabs-900m-led-by-sequoia-at-a-5b-valuation-to-take-its-neo-broker-app-across-europe/">raising $900 million</a> and Robinhood’s partial, first-quarter results <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/robinhoods-epic-q1-growth-explains-its-fundraising-boom/">looking strong</a>, your Twitter feed may feel all fintech, all the time. And with good reason, as startups in the niche are seeing huge customer demand, which is, in turn, making investors both public and private salivate.</li>
<li><strong>E-commerce roll-ups are raising jillions: </strong>The world is moving toward e-commerce at a rapid clip, which is leading to a host of startups raising piles of cash to buy, and consolidate brands that sell on popular digital platforms. It’s an arms race to own your wallet, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/">Factory14 just put together $200 million</a> for its own effort. (More <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/">here</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/">here</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Governments are not thrilled with cryptocurrencies:</strong> On the heels of news concerning fresh crackdowns on Bitcoin and friends in China, the United States is looking “to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/new-cryptocurrency-irs-rules-2023-crypto/">put new requirements in place</a> that would make it easier for the government to see how money is moving around, including digital currencies,” Taylor reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>The startup world is awash in capital these days, so we cannot get to all the latest venture capital rounds in one bloc. Here, however, are a few favorites from the day:</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/eanos-stella-wu-is-not-your-typical-construction-tech-startup-founder/"><strong>Eano raises $6M for its home renovation software</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Home renovations are hard because most of us are not trained project managers. Eano wants to make the process simpler for both homeowners and the folks hired to do the renovation work. Thank god.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/workrise-once-known-as-rigup-raises-300m-at-a-2-9b-valuation/"><strong>Workrise raises $300M for its workforce management platform</strong></a><strong>:</strong> With <a href="https://t.co/4ShhCP5Eqc">Procore’s IPO going well today</a>, and Workrise raising $300 million at roughly the same time, it appears to be a great time to build products for less sexy markets. Workrise, for example, “connects skilled laborers with infrastructure and energy companies looking to staff and manage projects efficiently.” With Franklin Templeton now an investor, it looks like it’s headed for an IPO in not too much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/pitch-a-platform-for-making-and-sharing-presentations-raises-85m-on-a-600m-valuation/"><strong>Pitch raises $85M to help folks build shareable presentations</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The push to build and fund software that may fit neatly into a remote or hybrid-work world continues today, with Pitch announcing a huge round at a $600 million valuation for what Ingrid describes as the “ability for people to create, collaborate on and share presentations with each other through an online-based interface.” Frankly that sounds cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/maven-series-a-a16z/"><strong>Maven raises $20M for its cohort-based professional classes</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The education technology VC rush continues, with Andreessen Horowitz leading a $20 million round into Maven, which Natasha reports “helps professionals teach cohort-based classes.” Notably Maven raised money via equity crowdfunding earlier in its life.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/chile-based-kredito-raises-4m-to-help-businesses-get-loans/"><strong>Kredito raises $4M to get loans for LatAm small businesses</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The fintech lending boom that has impacted consumers (BNPL and the like) and business is not stopping at the borders of the United States. Kredito is testament to that fact, putting together a new round to help get SMBs in Latin America access to credit.</p>
<h2>Chasing hype is human nature: The tyranny of startup trends</h2>
<p>The fear of missing out (FOMO) spreads faster than wildfire and often overwhelms rational decision-making.</p>
<p>In the VC community, investors look for lessons from disruptive startups they can use to identify other potential winners. But hype leads to bad decision-making, rushed due diligence and wishful thinking.</p>
<p>When and if those startups actually do well, &#8220;irrational FOMO takes over&#8221; because the initial assessment was based on bad information, says Victor Echevarria, a partner at Jackson Square Ventures. &#8220;Trends are addictive; to remain disciplined and avoid hype is to deny our innate instincts.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s natural for investors to follow the crowd, but in the race to the bottom, FOMO can be high-octane fuel.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today’s Big Tech news comes from Microsoft, Google, Twitter and Snap. And TikTok. Enjoy:</p>
<p><strong>Twitter’s epic product run continues:</strong> The product news parade from Twitter continued today, with the social media company announcing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-to-revamp-user-profiles-with-about-tab-support-for-pronouns-confirmed-status-and-more/">revamp to user profiles</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-opens-account-verification-applications-to-the-public-under-new-guidelines/">restarting of its verification process</a>. Between a rapid-fire rollout of its Clubhouse-competing Spaces product, or its media push with Revue and subscriptions, Twitter has been on a roll.</p>
<p><strong>Google didn’t learn from Microsoft’s retail experiment:</strong> Big Search is following Redmond into the IRL retail game that the latter company already gave up on. Which is a bummer as I kinda dug Microsoft stores. Regardless, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/google-is-opening-a-retail-store-in-new-york-this-summer/">read all about Google’s impending meatspace storefront here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft lays Internet Explorer to rest: </strong>The death date of Internet Explorer has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/so-long-internet-explorer-and-your-decades-of-security-bugs/">been fixed for June, 2022</a>. So you have that long to fool around with the venerable, if comedically aged internet browser. Few will miss Internet Explorer, but it was a pretty key product in the rise of the web. Kinda like Yahoo. Even if Yahoo will ride <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/verizon-buys-yahoo-for-4-83-billion/">again</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/oath-officially-becomes-verizon-media-group-on-january-8/">again</a>). <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">Again</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TikTok builds out way-late anti-bullying tooling: </strong>As the founder of its parent company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/zhang-yiming-steps-down-bytedance-ceo/">steps down</a> amidst a Chinese government crackdown on that country’s tech industry, TikTok is rolling out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/tiktok-rolls-out-tools-to-bulk-delete-and-report-comments-block-users/">some long-awaited features</a> that should make its service a bit better to use. At long last.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Procore is thus being valued like a high-growth, high-margin software company, but it is not one that anticipates a rapid ramp to profitability.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Watching construction tech software company Procore go public today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/as-procore-looks-to-nearly-double-its-private-valuation-the-ipo-market-shows-signs-of-life/">after pricing above its range</a> makes the IPO slowdown look like the deceleration that wasn’t.</p>
<p>Investors quickly bid up the company&#8217;s value in trading, giving Procore a higher valuation than it might have anticipated, along with a boost of confidence for the IPO market in general.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Construction tech may not be as glamorous as space travel, but it’s a massive industry that&#8217;s fraught with inefficiencies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Procore initially set an IPO range of $60 to $65 per share before pricing at $67 per share last night. Its debut was worth gross proceeds north of $600 million and a fully diluted<a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/81944/Construction-software-provider-Procore-Technologies-prices-IPO-above-the-ra"> valuation of $9.6 billion</a>. As of early afternoon today, shares were trading at a solid $85.25.</p>
<p>In light of Procore’s debut, TechCrunch is digging quickly into the company’s new valuation and its resulting revenue multiples.</p>
<p>Following, we have notes from a chat we had with CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/tooeyprocore">Tooey Courtemanche</a> regarding his company’s debut, what it intends to do with its new capital and how it expects its partner platform to evolve and mature.</p>
<p>First, the numbers.</p>
<h2>Procore’s new price</h2>
<p>Starting with Procore’s $9.6 billion, fully diluted valuation that it set in its IPO pricing, the company is richly valued. It generated revenues of $113.9 million in Q1 2021, putting it on a run-rate of $455.8 million. As you can calculate, that valued the company at around 20x its run rate; more precisely, at 21.2x.</p>
<p>But if we do some modest extrapolation of the company’s current value in light of its trading appreciation, Procore is now worth around $12.3 billion on a fully diluted basis. That gives it a run-rate multiple of around 27x.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It doesn&#8217;t feel like a week goes by at the moment that another startup doesn&#8217;t emerge armed with a huge wallet of cash to pursue a strategy of consolidating and then scaling promising brands that have built a business selling on marketplaces like Amazon&#8217;s. In the latest development, a startup called <a href="https://factory14.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factory14</a> is coming out of stealth mode in Europe with $200 million in funding to snap up smaller businesses and help them grow through better economies of scale.</p>
<p>Along with this, factory14 is also announcing its latest acquisition to underscore its acquisition strategy: it&#8217;s acquired <a href="https://www.probiketool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pro Bike Tool</a>, a popular D2C seller of its own-brand bike accessories and tools, for an undisclosed sum. The company, which is now fully owned by factory14, has kept the original founders on to lead the smaller company.</p>
<p>This is factory14&#8217;s fourth acquisition since launching earlier this year, and the company said that its focus on acquiring marketplace sellers that are already seeing success and some scale means that it is already profitable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup &#8212; based in Luxembourg (with offices in Madrid, London, Shanghai and Taipei) &#8212; is describing this funding injection as a seed round, but in fact the majority of it is coming in the form of debt to acquire companies. Dmg Ventures (the VC arm of the Daily Mail Group) and DN Capital co-led the equity-based seed funding, with VentureFriends and unnamed individuals in the tech world also participating. Victory Park Capital, meanwhile, provided the credit facility and also participated in the equity consortium.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Founded by former Carousell and Fave execs, Rainforest gets $36M to consolidate Asia-Pacific Amazon Marketplace brands&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/embed/#?secret=4Ov1XayRH3" data-secret="4Ov1XayRH3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>CEO Guilherme Steinbruch, an alum of Global Founders Capital (the investment firm co-founded by the Samwer brothers of Rocket Internet fame, among others), co-founded factory14 with Marcos Ramírez (COO) and Gianluca Cocco (CBO) &#8212; who have respectively worked at e-commerce giants like Amazon and Delivery Hero.</p>
<p>Steinbruch himself also has an interesting background. He hails from Brazil and is a member of the <a href="https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/acuris-live/Steinbruch%20Shareholder%20Profile%202%20November_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">powerful industrial family</a> that controls a major steel producer, a leading textile producer and a bank (Steinbruch said that factory14 has no connection to these, and is not an investor in the startup).</p>
<p>He said that the idea for founding factory14 in Europe came out of his interest in e-commerce and specifically the traction that Thrasio, one of the U.S. based pioneers of the roll-up space, was seeing for the model.</p>
<p>The Marketplace on Amazon is a massive business. <a href="https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One estimate</a> puts the number of third-party sellers at 5 million, with more than 1 million sellers joining the platform in 2020 alone. Thrasio, meanwhile, has in the past <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated to me</a> that there are probably 50,000 businesses selling on Amazon via FBA making $1 million or more per year in revenues.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the latter category that is the target for factory14, Steinbruch told me. Its belief is that focusing on more successful businesses will mean a better hit rate on finding companies that have already built more solid supply chains, branding and overall quality. Being willing to pay a little more for these sellers, he said, will help it compete against what has become a very crowded field.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&#8220;There are many players, there is no denying it,&#8221; he said, adding that their research has (so far) found more than 50 roll-up players going for the same general opportunities that it is.</p>
<p>But in the process of planning out how factory14 might differentiate itself in that mix, Steinbruch said it found some distinct differences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some are looking for volume, and are willing to buy up many companies as cheaply as possible. But we took the decision to focus only on high-quality assets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We knew we would have to pay higher multiples for a brand growing 200% a year, but when we started targeting these we were surprised to find there was less competition for these assets rather than for the smaller ones. That was a good surprise. It means that, yes, we have competition but we’ve managed to be pretty successful anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even among the bigger retailers selling on Amazon using the e-commerce giant&#8217;s distribution and fulfillment platform, there are reasons why the consolidators have started to circle beyond just wanting to jump on a good thing. The system has within it a lot of work that is repeatable across many different companies, specifically in areas like analytics, supply chain management, marketing and more: building a framework that could handle those processes for many at once makes sense. There is also the fact that in many cases, marketplace sellers may have found themselves sitting on successful businesses but unable to source the investment (or the will) to scale them to the next step.</p>
<p>All the same, the mix of competitors hoping to scoop them up is a pretty formidable one, and the point of differentiation between them all may not in itself be as distinct as factory14 (or any of them) hopes.</p>
<p>Just today, another ambitious player in this space, <a href="https://heyday.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heyday</a> out of San Francisco, announced a further $70 million in equity funding led by General Catalyst. It, too, is raising large amounts of debt and eyeing up more innovative ways of accommodating the most interesting companies selling on Amazon in a bid for more quality and success.</p>
<p>&#8220;The top 1.5% of marketplace sellers are doing $1 million in revenues, and we believe there may be some that cross the $1 billion threshold eventually,&#8221; Heyday CEO and co-founder Sebastian Rymarz told me last week. To woo the best of them in the current market, as part of its ambition to become the &#8220;P&amp;G&#8221; of the 21st century, it too is taking a very open-ended approach, he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0unoFTKlpl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/">Berlin&#8217;s Razor Group raises $400M to buy and scale Amazon Marketplace merchants</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Berlin&#8217;s Razor Group raises $400M to buy and scale Amazon Marketplace merchants&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/embed/#?secret=0unoFTKlpl" data-secret="0unoFTKlpl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We have some come to Heyday, or we bring in our own brand managers. Sometimes it&#8217;s a matter of some ongoing participation and interest, growth equity where we buy some now and will buy more of your business over time. We are still defining that and that is fine, we are comfortable with that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about unique partnerships that we’re forming to accelerate their businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Closer to home in more ways than one, Berlin&#8217;s Razor Group &#8212; funded by Steinbruch&#8217;s former colleagues from GFC, and founded by ex-Rocket Internet people &#8212; earlier this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $400 million</a>. Thrasio itself has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very large rounds</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapid succession</a> totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in the last year, and is also profitable. Others in the same area that have also raised huge war chests include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroes</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>; Latin America&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> (with its backers including Razor’s CEO) and an emerging group out of Asia including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainforest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una Brands</a>.</p>
<p>Even with all of this, there will be opportunities, these entrepreneurs believe, to bring together more disparate smaller e-commerce retailers to help them better leverage marketing, supply chains, analytics and wider business expertise to grow for the longer term, leveraging the marketplace model that has come to dominate how many shop online today.</p>
<p>Factory14 said it expects to have $20 million in &#8220;trailing twelve months&#8221; EBITDA by the end of 2021 and expects to double its team to 80 by that point too.</p>

<p>For as long as Amazon and its marketplace model remain, it seems investors will come with their checkbooks, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;E-commerce is undergoing structural changes which are enabling thousands of exciting new brands to be born every day,” said Manuel Lopo de Carvalho, CEO at dmg ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Factory14 can provide these brands with the tools, capital and expertise that enable them to play in the big leagues.”</p>
<p>Ian Marsh, principal at DN Capital, said that the VC did its homework before backing the startup, too. “We had discussions with most aggregators and were immediately impressed by factory14’s differentiated vision focused on strong consumer brands and the world-class team they have put together with top tier private equity investors combined with seasoned e-commerce executive and former Amazonians. We are excited to work with Guilherme, Marcos, Gianluca and the rest of the factory14 team to create brands that inspire consumers around the world.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The global tech sector is booming, and as technologies like cloud and AI accelerate their growth, the demand for tech talent outpaces supply globally. Specifically, the U.S. tech sector has seen unprecedented growth in recent years, with four tech firms reaching a $1 trillion market cap by the beginning of 2020 &#8212; all of which have seen double-digit growth since achieving a 13-digit valuation pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>One of the major factors in the growth and adoption of tech in the U.S. is the increasing focus on software as a service and broader digital transformations across industry sectors, which have accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, there is an insatiable appetite for quality tech talent in the U.S., with <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/home.htm">projections</a> showing an 11% increase by 2029 from 2019 numbers, which amounts to over half a million new jobs.</p>
<p>Given that the U.S. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/14/6732">produces</a> only about 65,000 computer science graduates, there is a vast deficit in the tech talent market, which materialized as over <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-got-talent-just-not-enough-in-it-11571168626?mod=hp_featst_pos1">900,000 unfilled IT and related positions</a> in 2019 alone. The problem is so vast that more than 80% of U.S. employers stated that recruiting for tech talent is a top business challenge, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/supply-of-analytics-workers-set-to-double-11556663406?mod=article_inline">survey</a> by top HR consulting firm Robert Half.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Demand increasing for Mexican tech talent</h2>
<p>Mexico’s tech talent can help to fill the gaps left in a hypercompetitive U.S. market for tech workers. Unlike the U.S., <a href="https://www.ivemsa.com/industries/it-industry-in-mexico/">20% of Mexican college graduates have relevant engineering degrees</a>, amounting to over 110,000 per year, far surpassing the U.S. in technical talent. Investors and tech firms have noticed and are increasing operations in Mexico.</p>

			20% of Mexican college graduates have relevant engineering degrees, amounting to over 110,000 per year, far surpassing the U.S. in technical talent.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Some have referred to the cities of Monterrey and Guadalajara as the “Silicon Valley of Latin America,” and while their tech sectors are also seeing tremendous growth, the pace falls short of Mexico’s talent production, leading to a surplus of highly trained and capable individuals in the tech sector. The cost of higher education in Mexico is far less than in the U.S., so we’re likely to see that talent surplus grow in the coming years.</p>
<p>Under current conditions, the U.S. has an incredible opportunity to capitalize on the surplus of tech talent in Mexico. Because tech jobs are more scarce than in the U.S., the cost of talent in Mexico is considerably less than in the U.S. or in Canada. In general, <a href="https://convertkit.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/documents/109149/2222545/Mexico_s_Tech_Salary_Report_-_Jun_2019.pdf?ck_subscriber_id=1259576897">talent in Mexico can be two to three times cheaper than in the U.S.</a> while still delivering outstanding quality and specialized experience.</p>
<p>More so than other Latin American countries, Mexico has the experience and economy to support a robust tech talent export ecosystem. In fact, <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/mexico-city-latin-americas-future-tech-hub">Mexico City’s concentrated market</a> is larger than the sum total of every other Spanish-speaking country in Latin America. Specifically, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2017/11/01/moving-toward-a-knowledge-based-economy-improving-competitiveness-in-mexicos-information-technology-industry">Mexico’s IT outsourcing industry has been growing at an annual rate of 10%-15%</a> and is now considered the third-largest exporter of IT services.</p>
<p>What’s more, the U.S./Mexico relationship is seeing a refresh after several tumultuous years. With <a href="https://www.trade.gov/knowledge-product/exporting-mexico-market-overview#:~:text=Mexico%20ranked%20number%20one%20among,value%20of%20USD%20614.5%20billion.">Mexico ranked No. 1 among U.S. trade partners</a>, the political and economic mechanisms for investments and partnerships are in place. Technology leaders such as <a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=1600815">Cisco</a> and <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/intel-to-invest-177m-in-guadalajara-design-center/#">Intel</a> have already set up shop in Mexico, demonstrating confidence in the country’s ability to support tech and economic growth.</p>
<h2>The benefits of proximity</h2>
<p>Mexico provides a number of benefits that make drawing from its talent surplus easier and more efficient. For one, Mexico’s time zones align with those in the U.S., enabling real-time collaboration at times that work best for both parties. Compare this to the time difference in India, which is over 12 hours ahead of California’s Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Beyond the time difference, there are also many cultural similarities that make working with Mexico the clear choice for IT outsourcing. For example, the U.S. is home to more than 41 million native Spanish speakers, and plus over 12 million bilingual Spanish speakers, making <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44201444#:~:text=How%20many%20Spanish%20speakers%20are,world%2C%20ahead%20of%20Spain%20itself.">the U.S. the second-largest Spanish-speaking country</a> after Mexico. While difficult to quantify, the number of consumer and cultural exports from Mexico to the U.S. also helps to build familiarity and solidarity between the two countries, which can only improve an already healthy relationship.</p>
<h2>New geopolitical considerations favor U.S.-Mexico ties</h2>
<p>The steady progression of America’s tech sector is now seen as a strategic priority at the federal level. Meanwhile, public and private sector decision-makers are more interested than ever in conducting business under favorable trade treaty terms with friendly governments amid a new climate of geopolitical uncertainty.</p>
<p>As the U.S. tech sector continues its explosive growth, technology companies in the U.S. will need to seek alternative means to supplement its in-demand tech workforce. Rather than turning to countries undergoing increased regulatory scrutiny, or distant talent bases requiring significant business travel, business leaders are looking to geographically close, diplomatically friendly nations. U.S. companies are finding Mexico’s status as a key business partner and strategic ally to be a massive value driver.</p>
<p>By 2030, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/higher-technology-investment-and-digital-accessibility-to-position-mexico-as-an-innovation-hub-by-2025-300993540.html">the middle-class population in Mexico is expected to reach 95 million</a>, placing it in the top 10 countries with the highest share of global middle-class consumption. As the middle class rises, so will companies to meet their consumer needs, and, as such, Mexico’s own tech sector will grow and require significantly more tech talent, reducing or potentially eliminating Mexico’s talent surplus.</p>
<p>This is evidenced by the uptick in Mexico-based technology companies, such as Mexican used-car startup <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-kavak/mexican-used-car-startup-kavak-hits-4-billion-valuation-idUSKBN2BU0FH">Kavak</a>, which recently hit a $4 billion valuation. Amid an exciting backdrop of skyrocketing tech valuations and potential, the U.S. tech sector should look to Mexico as a key growth market and technology partner. The time is now for the U.S. to tap into the surplus of quality tech talent in Mexico.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple last month unveiled its plans for paid podcast subscriptions in a newly redesigned Apple Podcasts app. Now, it&#8217;s introducing a new program that will help podcast creators grow their subscriber base: affiliate marketing. The company&#8217;s &#8220;Apple Services Performance Partner Program,&#8221; which already exists to help market other Apple services like Apple TV, Apple News and Apple Books, is today <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/979-affiliate-program-for-podcasts">expanding</a> to include paid podcasts.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/support/979-affiliate-program-for-podcasts">new program</a> &#8212; &#8220;Apple Services Performance Partner Program for Apple Podcasts&#8221; (whew!) &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">will be open to anyone, though the company believes it will make the most sense for publishers and creators who already have an audience and a number of marketing channels where they can share these new affiliate links. When users convert by clicking through one of the links and subscribe to a premium podcast, the partner will receive a one-time commission at 50% of the podcast subscription price, after the subscriber accumulates their first month of paid service.</span></p>
<p>So, for example, if a paid podcast was charging subscribers $5 per month, the commission would be $2.50. This commission would apply for every new subscriber that signed up through the affiliate channel, and there&#8217;s no cap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Podcast creators can also use the affiliate links to promote their <em>own</em> paid programs, which would allow them to generate incremental revenue.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple unveils podcast subscriptions and a redesigned Apple Podcasts app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/embed/#?secret=w4bw4GhRuS" data-secret="w4bw4GhRuS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While anyone can <a href="https://partners.applemediaservices.com/vip/c639e75256bc44e1e0b3769b370e3bd6c3d553df8e9bfbe9f77fb3fd5329c43c">apply to join the affiliate program</a>, there is an approval process involved. This is mainly about keeping spammers out of the program, and ensuring that those signing up do have at least some marketing channels where they can distribute the links. The sign-up form asks for specific criteria &#8212; like how many channels are available and how the partner intends to use them to promote the affiliate links, among other things.</p>
<p>The program will be made available to anyone in the 170 countries and regions where paid podcasts subscriptions are being made available.</p>
<p>Once approved and signed in, affiliate partners will gain access to an online dashboard where they can create links (i.e. shortened URLs) much like any other affiliate program. They can also create multiple URLs for an individual podcast to make it easier to track how well different channels are performing. The URLs can be posted on their own, tied to a &#8220;Listen on Apple Podcasts&#8221; badge, or can be made available as a QR code. The latter may make more sense when live events return, as it could be printed on signage or in flyers that were distributed during a live taping, for example. It also could be used in other sorts of advertising, including both print and digital.</p>
<p>Though premium podcasts already existed, until more recently that often involved paying a podcaster directly to access a private RSS feed. Smaller services like Stitcher also used subscriptions to provide paying customers with a series of perks, like ad-free listening and exclusive content. The new efforts by both Apple and Spotify are focused on wooing creators to their platforms, where they&#8217;ll take a cut of the subscription revenues. Spotify is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">waiving its 5% fee</a> for the first two years, while Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">is employing its usual model</a> of 30% in year 1 that drops to 15% in year two.</p>
<p>While people can begin to <a href="https://partners.applemediaservices.com/vip/c639e75256bc44e1e0b3769b370e3bd6c3d553df8e9bfbe9f77fb3fd5329c43c">enroll</a> in the new affiliate program starting today, paid podcasts aren&#8217;t actually launching until later this month, <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/878-subscriptions">per Apple</a>. When they do, those enrolled in the affiliate program will be able to create links and begin earning commissions on subscriptions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.baincapitalventures.com/">Bain Capital Ventures</a> (BCV), the venture arm of the 37-year-old private equity firm Bain Capital, announced this morning that it has $1.3 billion more smackers to invest across two funds, a $950 million fund for seed and Series A deals and a $350 million fund for growth-stage opportunities. That amount is up slightly from late 2018, when the outfit announced<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/bain-capital-ventures-has-a-fresh-1b-to-invest-in-startups/"> $1 billion</a> across two funds.</p>
<p>While the outfit is backed by all the usual suspects, including endowments and pension funds, it&#8217;s worth noting that around $130 million of that capital comes from investors and other employees inside of Bain, whose contributions typically make up 10% of a fund. (Investors at other firms like Sequoia are big investors in their funds, too.)</p>
<p>More important, of course, is where the capital will be spent. According to partners Sarah Smith and Aaref Hilaly, the focus remains very much on enterprise startups, where the team likes to jump in early and build up a big position. (Some of its biggest bets in terms of dollars invested right now include the text message marketing company Attentive, currently valued at <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2020/09/23/attentive-messaging-marketing-startup-series-d-billion-valuation/?sh=795b16b056c0">$2.2 billion</a>, and the in-memory database company Redis Labs, valued at <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/redis-labs-surpasses-2b-valuation-with-latest-funding-round/">$2 billion</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Interestingly, BCV is also investing directly in a lot of emerging managers, 50 of whom BCV has already backed in order improve the diversity of ideas and startups that it gets to see at the earliest stages.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all part of the firm&#8217;s continuing evolution, says the outfit, which got its start in 2001 on the East Coast and was designed initially to fund Series B and older companies but today funds mostly West Coast- and, to a smaller degree, New York-based startups that are just getting off the ground.</p>
<p>To underscore the shift, says Hilaly, BCV wrote checks to 42 companies last year and 37 of them were either seed-stage or Series A-stage startups and the &#8220;vast majority were pre-revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if competition at the later-stage drove the firm to seek out more nascent deals, Hilaly notes that competition at every stage is intense right now and argues that BCV&#8217;s current team composition &#8212; Hilaly spent seven years at Sequoia and earlier founded a company himself; Smith spent a collective seven years at Quora and Facebook, for example &#8212; makes it most impactful at the company formation stage, when founders are still getting the fundamentals down.</p>
<p>As for why the organization needs such a massive fund to back such young companies, it&#8217;s a reflection of the changing market, both partners suggest. Not only do firms need to be able to provide the capital that entrepreneurs need to grow at a faster clip than ever before, but it&#8217;s becoming increasingly important for venture outfits to support the ecosystem &#8212; including as a competitive edge.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gdAW20yPK2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/a-peek-inside-sequoia-capitals-low-flying-wide-reaching-scout-program/">A peek inside Sequoia Capital&#8217;s low-flying, wide-reaching scout program</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A peek inside Sequoia Capital&#8217;s low-flying, wide-reaching scout program&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/a-peek-inside-sequoia-capitals-low-flying-wide-reaching-scout-program/embed/#?secret=gdAW20yPK2" data-secret="gdAW20yPK2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For some firms, that support comes in the form of scout programs that empower operators and founders to write checks to friends who are starting companies.</p>
<p>For BCV, it means committing an undisclosed but &#8220;material&#8221; amount of capital to emerging seed-fund managers. So far among the managers it has backed is Bobby Goodlatte of Form Capital of Miami, with whom we talked recently (see below); Maren Bannon of London-based January Ventures; Ryan Hoover of Weekend Fund; Scribble Ventures, run in part by husband-and-wife duo Elizabeth and Kevin Weil; and Noemis Ventures in New York.</p>
<p>Smith says that BCV is &#8220;really excited about this program because it&#8217;s great for founders, who have more choice than ever as they&#8217;re getting started. It&#8217;s also helping on-ramp a broader group of investors into the venture ecosystem, which is something I&#8217;m personally passionate about as I care about diversity of thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those newer funds &#8212; 17% of which are run by Black general partners and 21% of which are run by women &#8212; also help BCV to stay atop the latest enterprise trends, she adds, saying that in addition to checks, BCV helps make limited partner introductions for managers to help get them off the ground. (BCV does not ask for any information rights beyond what the firms&#8217; other limited partners receive.)</p>

<p>As for where BCV will be funneling the rest of its new capital, Smith says that BCV has always been &#8212; and remains &#8212; thesis driven, and that much of what interests the firm right now is application software infrastructure, health tech investing, e-commerce-enabled enterprise tech and fintech, including crypto, which has become a growing area of intrigue.</p>
<p>Some of the firm&#8217;s related deals include the crypto lending startup BlockFi and Digital Currency Group, the parent company behind the popular Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. BCV has also invested in &#8220;a few tokens,&#8221; says Hilaly, &#8220;but that&#8217;s not the major focus,&#8221; he adds.</p>

<p>In the meantime, BCV &#8212; which is writing checks as small as several hundred thousand dollars to upwards of $100 million in companies &#8212; is also keeping an eye on the trends that continue to reshape the venture industry, including, right now, ever bigger and faster deals.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unprecedented,&#8221; observes Hilaly of what&#8217;s happening in the market, even while he&#8217;s not surprised by it. &#8220;My general feeling is that venture is not so unlike startups, and every firm has to just reinvent itself every five or 10 years because the ecosystem around it is changing so much.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can complain about competition,&#8221; he continues, &#8220;but the reality is competition just forces you to be better.&#8221; Certainly, he says, &#8220;You have to you have to be on your game to a greater extent than ever before.&#8221; Otherwise, there&#8217;s &#8220;just no way a sensible founder would pick you.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a pre-recorded <a href="https://www.snappartnersummit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Partner Summit</a> where Snap took users through a whole set of new tools for Snapchat users, creators and companies, Snap also threw in a &#8220;one more thing&#8221; at the end that shows the company, after a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/28/why-snapchat-spectacles-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rocky start several years ago</a>, is definitely not giving up on its hardware ambitions anytime soon.</p>
<p>Snap announced the latest generation of its Spectacles, a streamlined 60s-style design in black that is the company&#8217;s biggest play yet in merging some of the work it has been building in augmented reality technology to a specific device tailored to work with it.</p>
<p>Evan Spiegel, Snap&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, described the Spectacles as the company&#8217;s &#8220;first pair of glasses that bring augmented reality to life,&#8221; and if you ever owned or tried out earlier versions of the glasses, it sounds like these are just more intuitive and seamless.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fourth generation of these glasses will operate 30 minutes at a time, he said, and will feature dual 3D waveguide displays, and a 26.3-degree diagonal field of view for an immersive lens experience that &#8220;feels like they&#8217;re naturally overlaid on the world in front of you.&#8221; The glasses pack a lot of brightness to make them as usable inside and outside, and they come with built-in microphones, stereo speakers and touchpad controls. They are also relatively light at 134 grams.</p>
<p>Snap seems to be marketing the device for creators on the Snap platform rather than consumers toward whom the company has previously geared its hardware. Snap&#8217;s release embodies the strategy others have taken of building augmented reality tech in public even as the underlying tech is not quite ready for a mass market release.</p>

<p>The hardware itself is less capable than earlier releases from AR startups like Magic Leap, but Snap seems to have opted to sacrifice functionality for form factor, delivering a device that is less helmet-like than other augmented reality headsets.</p>
<p>Spiegel said that the glasses will feature the company&#8217;s new spatial engine, &#8220;which leverages six degrees of freedom, hand and surface tracking realistic ground digital objects in the physical world,&#8221; with 15 millisecond motion to photon latency for more responsiveness. The glasses are also integrated with Snap&#8217;s Lens Studio so that creators can build custom lenses for the devices. It&#8217;s rolled out the glasses already to a small group of early users, so expect to see these ship pre-populated with a range of lenses and other customizations.</p>
<p>Snap has long banked on augmented reality as a major opportunity but is still an underdog in the space given the size of its massive competitors.</p>
<p>The AR-capable Spectacles arrive ahead of Facebook&#8217;s upcoming smart glasses, which the company has partnered with Ray Ban to produce. Those glasses are not expected to include built-in displays and will instead rely heavily on other forms of input. Apple has also long been rumored to be working on augmented reality glasses and reportedly has thousands of employees working to build them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Biden&#8217;s vision for an empowered, expanded IRS is poised to have a big impact on cryptocurrency trading.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/The-American-Families-Plan-Tax-Compliance-Agenda.pdf">new report from the U.S. Treasury Department</a>, the administration wants to put new requirements in place that would make it easier for the government to see how money is moving around, including digital currencies. The report notes that cryptocurrencies pose a &#8220;significant detection problem&#8221; and are used regularly by top earners who wish to evade taxes.</p>
<p>The proposed changes would create new reporting requirements built on the framework of existing 1099-INT forms that taxpayers currently use to report interest earned. Cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians would be required to report more information on the &#8220;gross inflows and outflows&#8221; of money moving through their accounts. Businesses would also be required to report cryptocurrency transactions above $10,000 under the new reporting requirements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Although cryptocurrency is a small share of current business transactions, such comprehensive reporting is necessary to minimize the incentives and opportunity to shift income out of the new information reporting regime,&#8221; the report states.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department notes that wealthy tax filers are often able to escape paying fair taxes through complex schemes that the IRS currently doesn&#8217;t have the resources to disrupt. According to the report, the IRS collects 99% of taxes due on wages, but that number is estimated to be as low as 45% on non-labor income, a discrepancy that hugely benefits high earners with &#8220;less visible&#8221; income sources. The Treasury calls virtual currency, which has some reporting requirements but still operates mostly out of sight in regulatory grey areas, a particular challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;These opportunities are particularly available for those in the top end of the income distribution who can avoid taxes through sophisticated strategies such as offshoring, creating complex partnership structures, or moving taxable assets into the crypto economy,&#8221; the Treasury report states.</p>
<p>The report details a multiyear effort to bolster IRS enforcement that would bring in as much as $700 billion in tax revenue over the next 10 years. The proposed changes, if implemented, would go into effect starting in 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.portside.co/">Portside</a>, an aviation startup that is building a platform for managing the backend of a corporate flight department, charter operation, government fleet and fractional ownership operation, today announced that it has raised a $17 million funding round led by Tiger Global Management, with participation from existing investors I2BF Global Ventures and SOMA Capital.</p>
<p>The idea behind Portside, which was founded in 2018, is that it lets business aviation companies and flight departments manage everything from flight operations to maintenance, crew and staff scheduling, expense management for crew members and staff, and financial data to help them operate <a href="https://www.portside.co/platform/">more efficiently</a>. It&#8217;s basically everything you need to run your flight department in a single solution, but it also <a href="https://www.portside.co/integrations/">integrates</a> with virtually all of the existing scheduling, accounting, expense management and maintenance tools a flight department or fractional ownership operation is likely using today.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2155530" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/portside.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2155530" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2155530" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/portside.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="497" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/portside.jpg 1241w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/portside.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/portside.jpg?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/portside.jpg?resize=768,373 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/portside.jpg?resize=680,330 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/portside.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2155530" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Portside</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the COVID pandemic put a halt to most forms of private aviation early on, that market saw a quick rebound. Portside says it saw its revenue grow almost 300% in 2020 and that it added more than 50 aircraft operators in multiple countries to its user base.</p>
<p>&#8220;This infusion of new capital will be used to accelerate investment in product innovation, support further engagement with large enterprise customers and grow our global engineering and customer success teams,&#8221; said <span class="xn-person">Alek Vernitsky</span>, co-founder and CEO of Portside. &#8220;We appreciate the strong support we have received from both our existing and new investors in this round. They have collectively demonstrated their confidence in our strategy and intentional approach to cloud-based digital transformation of the global business aviation industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Portside is not alone in this market. Companies like <a href="https://www.fl3xx.com/">Fl3xx</a>, for example, offer similar solutions for flight departments and at the lower end, tools like <a href="https://www.flightcircle.com/">Flight Circle</a> offer a subset of these features for general aviation clubs and partnerships.</p>
<p>“Portside has progressed rapidly since inception and is entering the next stage of fulfilling its vision of becoming the undisputed leader in cloud-based solutions for business aviation,” stated John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global Management. &#8220;In our view, Portside represents the future of the industry, and we are pleased to partner with a company we believe will continue to create significant value for many years to come.&#8221;</p>
