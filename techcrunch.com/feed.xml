										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/patreon-and-acast-partner-for-patron-only-podcast-distribution/">partnering with Patreon last year</a> to support patron-only podcasts, <a href="https://www.acast.com/en">Acast</a> has developed a full suite of subscription tools called Acast+.</p>
<p>The company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/acast-access/">experimented with paywalled podcasts</a> beyond Patreon in the past, but Acast+ appears to be its most comprehensive offering yet. Podcasters who run ads from Acast will be able to introduce a variety of other paid options, such as ad-free streams, exclusive episodes and early access to content.</p>
<p>Listeners will be able to access this content from the podcast players of their choice, including Apple Podcasts and Google Podcasts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In exchange, Acast will take a cut of subscription revenue — Vice President of Product Matt MacDonald described this as &#8220;part of the overall package of using Acast,&#8221; with podcasters benefiting from having the full monetization experience managed within Acast. That means they can upload and manage access to all their content from a single system (rather than having separate paid and free feeds) while also getting the &#8220;full revenue picture&#8221; of both their advertising income and subscription income.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wypxVUZ5bR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/acast-acquires-radiopublic/">Acast acquires podcasting startup RadioPublic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Acast acquires podcasting startup RadioPublic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/acast-acquires-radiopublic/embed/#?secret=wypxVUZ5bR" data-secret="wypxVUZ5bR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>MacDonald said it&#8217;s also crucial that Acast is supporting subscription access across podcast players, rather than creating a listening app or destination of its own.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;That’s a really clear distinction,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to make sure the podcaster’s listeners are their listeners. We&#8217;re just giving them a financial tool to help them build a relationship with the listeners that are supporting their show.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acast co-founder Johan Billgren also noted that podcasters can customize the experience down to the names of the subscription tiers and even what subscribers are called. He also said that after the launch of Acast+, the company will continue working with Patreon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to give the most options to the creator,&#8221; Billgren said. &#8220;They are in charge of their relationship, and if Patreon is the best option for them, we want to give them that option.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131603" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131603" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2131603" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?w=680" alt="Acast+" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg 13578w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=2048,1153 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Acast.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131603" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Acast</p></div></p>
<p>More broadly, he suggested that Acast+ reflects &#8220;a big shift&#8221; as podcasts go from from being &#8220;completely free and ad-funded&#8221; to a pursuing a broader range of business models.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the financial relationship is an expression of the overall relationship,&#8221; MacDonald added. (Listener relationship-building was also a theme in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/acast-acquires-radiopublic/">Acast&#8217;s acquisition of RadioPublic last month</a>.) But certainly the financial side is important: &#8220;There are a number of times that I’ve heard podcasters say, &#8216;If I could make just a little bit more money, I could squeak out another episode.&#8217; We&#8217;re giving them the financial pathways to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Acast+ is currently in beta testing and <a href="https://www.acast.com/en/beta">accepting signups</a> from interested podcasters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IBM has installed a couple of its own Quantum System One machines across the world in recent years, but today it announced its first private-sector U.S. deployment thanks to a new ten-year partnership with the Cleveland Clinic. This not only marks IBM&#8217;s first U.S. install of one of its quantum computers outside of its own facilities, but also the first time a healthcare institute purchases and houses a quantum computer. And thanks to this deal, Cleveland will also get access to IBM&#8217;s upcoming next-gen 1,000+ qubit quantum system.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still in the very early days of commercializing quantum computing and for most current users, having access to a system over the cloud is sufficient for the experiments they are running. But increasingly, we are seeing research institutes and even some commercial users who are looking to install on-premises quantum computers to have full access to a dedicated machine.</p>
<p>This new deal is part of a larger partnership between IBM and the Cleveland Clinic, which also involves IBM&#8217;s hybrid cloud portfolio for high-performance computing and its AI tools. The partnership also forms the foundation of Cleveland Clinic&#8217;s new Center for Pathogen Research &amp; Human Health, which is supported by <a href="https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2021/01/25/through-a-500-million-partnership-with-the-state-of-ohio-jobsohio-and-ohio-development-services-agency-cleveland-clinic-forms-global-center-for-pathogen-research-human-health/">$500 million</a> in investments from the State of Ohio, Jobs Ohio and <span class="il">Cleveland</span> Clinic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re announcing here is the first &#8212; I&#8217;m going to call them private sector or nonprofit &#8212; but still, it&#8217;s the first sort of non-government organization that is going to have not only fully dedicated systems, but what is really, really remarkable is our commitment for the decades,&#8221; Dario Gil, IBM&#8217;s SVP and Director of IBM Research, told me. &#8220;In a way, they are partnering with us for the entire roadmap. So it&#8217;s not only taking receipt and getting access to a fleet of quantum computers and the next-generation quantum computer for next year. They&#8217;re also the first ones who are signing up and says, &#8216;I want the first 1,000+ qubit system.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that it takes a very forward-looking organization to invest heavily in quantum computing today. It&#8217;s one thing for a nation-state to start working with this nascent technology, given the potential it has in a wide variety of fields, but it&#8217;s another for a non-profit to make a similar bet. &#8220;The level of ambition is really, really high on their end because they&#8217;re thinking about the future,&#8221; Gil said of the Cleveland Clinic&#8217;s leadership.</p>
<p>Gil noted that as part of the overall deal, Cleveland Clinic&#8217;s researchers will also get access to IBM&#8217;s entire quantum portfolio in the cloud. IBM will maintain and support the on-premises quantum computer and they will remain IBM-owned machines, similar to its deals with government research labs in Japan and Germany, he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maintaining it and supporting it is really critical,&#8221; Gil said about why that&#8217;s the case. &#8220;And they need us and our expertise to be able to do that. And also, you know, we do it because it&#8217;s like one of the most sensitive technologies that we have in IBM. So we are exquisitely focused on maintaining the security and safety for the machines.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the overall deal, IBM and Cleveland Clinic will also work on building skills among Cleveland Clinic&#8217;s researchers in quantum computing, but also AI and high-performance computing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through this innovative collaboration, we have a unique opportunity to bring the future to life,&#8221; said Tom Mihaljevic, M.D., President and CEO of <span class="il">Cleveland</span> Clinic. &#8220;These new computing technologies will revolutionize discovery in the life sciences and ultimately improve people’s lives. The Discovery Accelerator will enable our renowned teams to build a forward-looking digital infrastructure and transform medicine, while training the workforce of the future and growing our economy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is announcing a handful of major updates to Google Maps today that range from bringing its Live View AR directions indoors to adding weather data to its maps, but the most tantalizing news &#8212; which in typical Google fashion doesn&#8217;t have an ETA just yet &#8212; is that Google plans to bring a vastly improved 3D layer to Google maps.</p>
<p>Using photogrammetry, the same technology that also allows Microsoft&#8217;s Flight Simulator to render large swaths of the world in detail, Google is also building a model of the world for its Maps service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to continue to improve that technology that helps us fuse together the billions of aerials, StreetView and satellite images that we have to really help us move from that flat 2D map to a more accurate 3D model than we&#8217;ve ever had. And be able to do that more quickly. And to bring more detail to it than we&#8217;ve ever been able to do before,&#8221; Dane Glasgow, Google&#8217;s VP for Geo Product Experience, said in a press event ahead of today&#8217;s announcement. He noted that this 3D layer will allow the company to visualize all its data in new and interesting ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2131509" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Google-Maps-3D.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131509" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2131509" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Google-Maps-3D.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131509" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>How exactly this will play out in reality remains to be seen, but Glasgow showed off a new 3D route preview, for example, with all of the typically mapping data overlayed on top of the 3D map.</p>
<p>Glasgow also noted that this technology will allow Google to parse out small features like stoplights and building addresses, which in turn will result in better directions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also think that the 3D imagery will allow us to visualize a lot of new information and data overlaid on top, you know, everything from helpful information like traffic or accidents, transit delays, crowdedness &#8212; there&#8217;s lots of potential here to bring new information,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131510" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Indoor-Live-View-2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131510" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2131510" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Indoor-Live-View-2.gif" alt="" width="350" height="620" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131510" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>As for the more immediate future, Google announced a handful of new features today that are all going to roll out in the coming months. Indoor Live View is the flashiest of these. Google&#8217;s existing <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/new-sense-direction-live-view/">AR Live View walking directions</a> currently only work outdoors, but thanks to some advances in its technology to recognize where exactly you are (even without a good GPS signal), the company is now able to bring this indoors. This feature is already live in some malls in the U.S. in <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago, Long Island, Los Angeles, Newark, San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle, but in the coming months, it&#8217;ll come to select airports, malls and transit stations in Tokyo and Zurich as well (just in time for vaccines to arrive and travel to &#8212; maybe &#8212; rebound). Because Google is able to locate you by comparing the images around you to its database, it can also tell what floor you are on and hence guide you to your gate at the Zurich airport, for example (though in my experience, there are few places with better signage than airports&#8230;).</span></p>
<p>Also new are layers for weather data (but not weather radar) and air quality in Google Maps. The weather layer will be available globally on Android and iOS in the coming months, with the air quality layer only launching for Australia, India and the U.S. at first.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131513" style="width: 359px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131513" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2131513" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png" alt="" width="349" height="619" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png 1127w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=85,150 85w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=768,1363 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=866,1536 866w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Air-Quality-Layer.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2131513" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Talking about air quality, Google Maps will also get a new eco-friendly routing option that lets you pick the driving route that produces the least CO2 (coming to Android and iOS later this year), and it will finally feature support for low emission zones, a feature of many a European City. Low emission zones on Google Maps will launch in June in Germany, France, Spain and the UK on Android and iOS. More countries will follow later.</p>
<p>And to bring this all together, Google will update its directions interface to show you all of the possible modes of transportations and routing options, prioritized based on your own preferences, as well as based on what&#8217;s popular in the city you are in (think he subway in NYC or bike-sharing in Portland).</p>
<p>Also new are more integrated options for curbside grocery pickups in partnership with Instacart and Albertsons, if that&#8217;s your thing.</p>
<p>And there you have it. As is so often the case with Google&#8217;s announcement, the most exciting new features the company showed off don&#8217;t have an ETA and may never launch, but until then you can hold yourself over by getting your weather forecasts on Google Maps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Staffbase.com">Staffbase</a>, which provides an intranet-style internal communications platform for companies, has raised a $145 million (€122 million) financing round led by General Atlantic, a growth equity firm. Existing investors Insight Partners and e.ventures also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Started in Chemnitz in Germany in 2014, Staffbase has managed to onboard over 1,000 clients including Adidas, Audi, BHP, Deutsche Post DHL, Groupon, Hitachi, Ikea, Johns Hopkins University, McKesson, Paulaner, Suncor, Viessmann, and Volvo, among others.</p>
<p>In early March this year, the company merged with Bananatag, the Canadian provider of internal communications solutions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has of course accelerated the adoption of digital tools for companies, so Staffbase is reaping the benefits of that shift. The company&#8217;s main competitors include Dynamic Signal (raised $114.8M) and Social Chorus (raised $47M). In the category of intranets, competitors include Simpplr (raised $29.1M) and Unily (raised $68M).</p>
<p>Staffbase claims its advantages are that it brings together mobile employee apps and intranets into one platform, as well as integrating with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, as well as the messaging platform Slack.</p>
<p>Dr. Martin Böhringer, co-founder and CEO of Staffbase, said in a statement: “We provide managers and communications specialists at enterprise companies with the leading digital platform for successful employee communications – a platform that we are expanding very rapidly. The partnership with General Atlantic will further help us achieve this and accelerate our growth, especially in North America.”</p>
<p>Dr. Christian Figge, managing director at General Atlantic, said: “Staffbase is a global pioneer and has developed software that specifically addresses the employee experience, supporting enterprises in transforming internal communications and engagement… Staffbase is a prime example of the quality of entrepreneurship and range of innovative companies with global ambitions emerging out of Germany.”</p>
<p>Staffbase has a workforce of 450 employees throughout 11 locations, including offices in London, New York, Vancouver, Amsterdam, and Berlin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European satellite and communications startup, <a href="https://hiber.global/">Hiber BV</a> has secured €26 million in EU and private investment to expand its IoT satellite network.  The funding comes from the European Innovation Council Fund (EIC Fund), the EU’s innovation agency, which has a €278 million Innovation Fund. The EIC co-invested with an innovation credit provided by the Dutch government and existing shareholders. Other investors include Finch Capital, Netherlands Enterprise Agency and Hartenlust Group. Hiber’s satellite constellation tracks and monitors machines and devices in harder-to-reach places.</p>
<p>At the same time co-founder of Hiber, Laurens Groenendijk, is to step aside as managing director to turn his attention to “other investment initiatives” the company said in a statement. Steven Kroonsberg joins as CFO. Roel Jansen joins as CCO. Groenendijk has been Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer at Treatwell as well as a serial investor.</p>
<p>Coen Janssen, Chief Strategy Officer and co-founder of Hiber, commented: “The €26 million funding is fantastic validation for Hiber’s success and a major boost for the European ‘New Space’ sector. It is a key step in realizing our aim of making the Internet of Things really simple and available for everyone in remote and developing regions of the world.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In particular, because it can reach out-of-the-way areas, Hiber&#8217;s network may be able to reduce losses in food production and leakages from oil wells.</p>
<p>Nicklas Bergman, European Innovation Council Fund Committee Member, commented: “I am glad to announce the EIC Fund support to this highly innovative company aiming at creating a European champion in the satellite Internet of Things sector. This equity financing will help Hiber to enable affordable and ubiquitous connectivity for the IoT solutions.”</p>
<p>Elia Montanari, Head of Management and Control at the European Space Agency, commented: “This major success has been supported at European level by collaboration of major EU bodies (EIC, EIB, ESA) fostering the Space Value Chain”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many work teams, especially stores and restaurants, rely on manual spreadsheets to ensure their operations are running smoothly. Based in Singapore, <a href="https://hellonimbly.com/">Nimbly</a> develops software that automates more of that process. Its features include digital checklists, inventory management and field audits that can be accessed through a mobile app. The startup announced today it has raised $4.6 million in pre-Series A funding, led by Insignia Ventures Partners, with participation from Sovereign’s Capital and Saison Capital.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 by Daniel Hazman and Jonathan Keith, Nimbly is currently used by more than one hundred organizations in seven countries, including Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and the United States. Most of Nimbly’s users are in the retail or food and beverage industries, and include KFC, Kopi Kenangan, 7-Eleven and Under Armour. Some clients also come from the fast-moving consumer goods and agriculture sectors, like Cargill and Wilmar.</p>
<p>The new funding brings its total raised to $5.7 million and will be used for Nimbly’s Southeast Asia expansion, including a new partnership with restaurant operator Express Food Group, and adding products like more analytics, mystery shopper and employee training.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Nimbly is designed to replace spreadsheets, emails and messaging apps by combining their functionalities into one app. This includes checklists, audits and live video to ensure that standard operating procedures are followed across all locations. For example, restaurants may use Nimbly to see if food safety and hygiene standards are being followed. FMCG companies can use it to track inventory at stores and share information about how their sales and promotions compare to competitors, while use cases for agriculture include verifying that suppliers are following sustainability measure at their farms.</p>
<p>In a statement, Insignia Venture Partners founding managing partner Yinglan Tan said, “SaaS enterprise is an emerging vertical in Southeast Asia with more businesses of all sizes and across industries seeking to transition and even upgrade their capabilities to software tools. That makes us very excited to have partnered with Daniel, Jonathan and their team at Nimbly as they lead this space in building software stack capable of serving the operational needs of companies first in Southeast Asia, and then globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vienna-based GoStudent, which connects students to tutors on a virtual learning platform, has raised a €70M Series B funding round led by new US investor Coatue. Coatue has been making &#8216;raids&#8217; into the European startup scene for the past year or so. It was joined by existing investors Left Lane Capital and DN Capital. This brings the total amount raised to €83.3M.</p>
<p>GoStudent competes with offline players like Schülerhilfe in Germany and Acadomia in France, which focus on small-classes in learning centers. By doing it online, GoStudent can introduce cost savings for users. It also competes where tutors advertise in traditional marketplaces like classified ads. The offering is similar to Chinese players like Zhangmen, VIPKid, TAL Education.</p>
<p>The investment will be used for growth and expansion into international markets such as Turkey and Greece. GoStudent is aiming for 15 countries across Europe and to grow its team to +800 employees and +10,000 tutors. It claims that over 250,000 tutoring sessions are booked every month on its platforms.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.finchcapital.com/">Finch Capital</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/finch-capital-launches-third-fund/">the early-stage fintech VC</a> with a presence in London and Amsterdam, is acquiring Wirecard Turkey, a subsidiary of Wirecard, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/house-of-wirecard-insolvency/">disgraced fintech out of Germany</a>. The acquisition, for which terms remain undisclosed and is still subject to regulatory approval, sees Finch create a new Ireland-registered entity called Nomu Pay.</p>
<p>After facing a huge accounting scandal and failing to make payments on its own loans, Wirecard went into insolvency last year. Since then, various parts of its business have been bought, including one of its largest assets, Wirecard Solutions, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/28/railsbank-wirecard/">acquired by the U.K.&#8217;s Railsbank</a>.</p>

<p>Finch&#8217;s managing partner Radboud Vlaar tells me Noma Pay’s larger plan is to invest in payments infrastructure in Turkey and the Middle East region. He says that more details will be provided on the new entity&#8217;s strategy and branding once the deal has formally closed.</p>
<p>Explains Vlaar: &#8220;We see tremendous  growth opportunities to further enhance payments for Turkey&#8217;s 80 million inhabitants. We are excited to team up with Wirecard Turkey under the leadership of its CEO Serkan Yasin and we continue to actively look for further M&amp;A opportunities in the region to accelerate its growth and development&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wirecard Turkey (Wirecard Ödeme ve Elektronik Para Hizmetleri A.Ş.) was established in Turkey in July 2008 and started its operations the following year as the country&#8217;s first &#8220;direct carrier billing&#8221; service provider. In 2014, it was wholly acquired by Wirecard Issuing &amp; Acquiring Gmbh, which is a subsidiary of Wirecard AG.</p>
<p>Today, the Turkish company provides various payment services, namely: direct carrier billing, credit card acquiring, and e-money. It has contracts with all three GSM operators and the majority of banks in Turkey, and more than 1,200 merchants.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is great talent in Turkey to build a leading next generation payments company,&#8221; adds Vlaar.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Men’s health and wellbeing startup <a href="https://www.manual.co/">Manual</a> has raised a $30m Series A round from US-based Sonoma Brands and Waldencast, and Manual’s existing European investors Felix Capital and Cherry Ventures. FJ Labs and the GISEV Family Office also participated in the round. The cash will be used for product development and international expansion. Manual provides diagnostics, treatments and ongoing care and plans to expand across Europe, Asia and Latin America. The company has already expanded to Brazil.</p>
<p>Manual is competing with Numan (raised $13M), also from the UK (Manual launched a month earlier than them). In the US it is competing with Ro (raised $876.1M) and Hims (listed). All these brands tend to focus on issues like vitamins and erectile dysfunction, with the, often common refrain of, ‘normalizing’ the idea that men should look after themselves better, across a number of fronts and removing stigma’s around sexual health. It performs blood tests and other tests to analyze heart health, gut health, testosterone, sleep, energy, and immunity. They are pushing at a large market, as men historically avoid doctors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131723" style="width: 779px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131723" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wellbeing-Flow.jpg" alt="Manual app" width="769" height="344" class="size-full wp-image-2131723" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wellbeing-Flow.jpg 769w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wellbeing-Flow.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wellbeing-Flow.jpg?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wellbeing-Flow.jpg?resize=680,304 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wellbeing-Flow.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131723" class="wp-caption-text">Manual app</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>George Pallis, CEO and Founder, previously led marketing at Wise and Deliveroo. In a statement he said: “We’ve been encouraged to see men of all ages increasingly turning to Manual to solve multiple health problems, with almost half of our customers seeking help for more than one issue. It’s clear that a health concern may have more than one cause, and we can provide customers with the ability to treat their health in a more holistic way. Using different treatments to understand and improve their wellbeing.”</p>
<p>Speaking to during an interview Pallis added: “We built our own teleconsultation product and have different applications for the blood test offering. When you get your results we will offer a clinician, we&#8217;ll walk you through all the data and the learnings. We offer tools where people can monitor their progress and have regular check-ins with our medical team.”</p>
<p>Antoine Nussenbaum, co-Founder and partner of Felix Capital, commented: “There is still much work to be done to remove the taboo when it comes to men looking after their wellbeing and talking openly about health concerns. But we’re starting to see a shift happen amongst consumers.”</p>
<p>Kevin Murphy, Managing Director of Sonoma Brands, commented: “Manual exists to empower men to take better care of themselves and to live fuller lives by doing so. George and his team have the clarity of vision and the skill to make Manual a leader in this exciting and important area.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African-focused talent recruitment and outsourcing company</span><a href="http://talentql.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentQL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today announced that it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been accepted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Techstars Toronto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company will join nine other startups in the accelerator&#8217;s class of 2021. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This comes two weeks after Nigerian bus-booking platform Plentywaka <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/nigerias-plentywaka-gets-backing-from-techstars-plans-expansion-to-canada/">announced its participation</a> in the program as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentQL </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last November by serial entrepreneurs</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adewaleyusuf/?ppe=1"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Adewale Yusuf</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/opeawo"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Opeyemi Awoyemi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/hacksultan"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Akintunde Sultan.</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before TalentQL, Yusuf co-founded Nigeria-based tech media publication Techpoint Africa; Awoyemi co-founded online recruitment site Jobberman; and Sultan founded nonprofit tech accelerator DevCareer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a &#8220;talent pool&#8221; developers join before passing through different assessments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the engineers pass the assessments, they can join the company&#8217;s &#8220;talent network&#8221; to access opportunities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic accelerated the need for international companies to seek cheaper and remote talent around the world. TalentQL is hoping to tap into what it thinks is a gold mine. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO Yusuf, the company, which is also U.S.-based, wants to decentralize access and democratize opportunity for Africa&#8217;s top tech talents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of its local clients, TalentQL </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> assists with recruitment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other model entails hiring vetted engineers for international companies, managing them, and providing tax and health insurance services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re coming to the market to support the talent with health insurance, some tools to work with and a community to be part of. These are some of the offerings </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sets us apart from other companies,&#8221; Yusuf said to TechCrunch over a phone call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite that, the company has faced the same challenge that has plagued the space &#8212; the lack of senior engineering talent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When most engineers reach that level of expertise, they tend to leave the country to the U.S. and Europe for better opportunities or, better still, launch their own startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s a problem Andela faced in the past, resulting in the layoff of 400 junior developers “due to market demand for more senior engineering talent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yusuf says this is why the company is pursuing a Pan-African and diasporan play (Africans in the U.S. and Europe), hoping to fill in the gap with senior talent from these places</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And to further </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Pan-African ambitions, it is planning to open an office in Kenya in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although TalentQL is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remote, Yusuf says this has to happen to establish the right kind of understanding between on-the-ground recruiters and the engineers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want a situation where when we&#8217;re recruiting from other countries, our technical recruiters are from those countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want them to be able to speak the language of these engineers and understand the culture of their countries,&#8221; the CEO added.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2131725" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2131725" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2131725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TalentQL-11.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="521" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TalentQL-11.jpg 913w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TalentQL-11.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TalentQL-11.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TalentQL-11.jpg?resize=768,589 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TalentQL-11.jpg?resize=680,521 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/TalentQL-11.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2131725" class="wp-caption-text">The TalentQL team</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TalentQL currently has over 100 tech skills available with more than 2,000 developers on its platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These developers cater to clients from the U.S., Europe, Nigeria and Kenya. The CEO says the company is also in talks with some Fortune 500 companies to execute placements for their African expansion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>In addition to the <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/11/17/talentql-raises-300k-pre-seed-zedcrest-capital/">$300,000 pre-seed secured last year</a>, the 6-month-old company will receive a $120,000 investment from Techstars. But<span style="font-weight: 400;"> besides the funding, Techstars&#8217; backing will be crucial in two ways, according to Yusuf. First is how it operates going forward in a crowded tech talent marketplace with the likes of Ethiopia&#8217;s Gebeya and Nigeria&#8217;s Decagon and Semicolon. The other would be helping the company to be a global company, not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an African one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Sunil Sharma, the managing director of Techstars Toronto and an investor in five Nigerian startups, Techstars&#8217; investment in TalentQL gives the accelerator a chance to participate in the burgeoning tech talent space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The rise of Nigeria is more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">widely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appreciated now </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> technology sectors like finance, mobility and e-commerce, where talented Nigerians are not only bringing innovation and disruption but are doing so </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and at scale,&#8221; he said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as intriguing is the opportunity relating to talent itself as Nigerians and Africans across the continent are contributing more to supporting tech companies across the world, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the start</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://everli.com/">Everli</a>, the European marketplace for online grocery shopping that started in Italy but now also operates in Poland, Czech Republic and France, has raised a $100 million in Series C funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by Verlinvest, with participation from new investors Luxor, DN Capital, C4 Ventures, and Convivialité Ventures. FITEC (part of Fondo Italiano d’Investimento), 360 Capital, Innogest, and DIP also followed on.</p>
<p>Everli, formerly called Supermercato24, says it will use the injection of capital to accelerate growth and further expand its international footprint.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2014, Everli lets customers order from local supermarkets for delivery. The company uses gig economy-styled personal shoppers who go into the store and ‘pick’ the products ordered and then deliver them same-day, or for an added cost within an hour. The company charges a delivery fee to consumers, but also generates revenue from fees charged to partnering merchants, and, notably, through advertising.</p>
<p>It has become the delivery partner of some of Europe’s largest grocery brands, offering access to over 300,000 products across the 70 cities it operates in. And, like other online grocery offerings, Everli has benefited from a boost in e-commerce and a reliance on delivery services prompted by the pandemic and country lockdowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everli is focused specifically on the grocery space,&#8221; says Federico Sargenti, CEO at Everli. &#8220;Rather than small baskets, or picking up just the basic essentials, Everli is focused on delivering whatever you need right up to your full weekly shop, with same-day delivery and a one-hour delivery window of your choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that what further differentiates Everli is its strong relationships with retailers, and the use of their existing infrastructure. &#8220;Instead of being tethered and restricted to a radius around our own expensive central warehouses, we are able to operate across a much wider geographical footprint, entering small-to-medium density areas and offering many customers their first opportunity to receive same day groceries, [all] while retaining sustainable unit economics&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sargenti describes Everli as more similar to Instacart than many other European delivery firms, including the new crop of dark stores or those that offer groceries as a secondary service to takeouts. &#8220;[This is] why we’re leading the grocery space in Europe and securing brands like Lidl, Kaufland, and Carrefour,&#8221; adds Sargenti.</p>
<p>In 2020, Everli sales almost quadrupled to $130 million. That growth is happening more and more outside Italy, with its international expansion now responsible for over 20% of orders.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to have played a role in helping many people during these difficult times, but we are only getting started, as this industry will never be the same again,&#8221; says Sargenti in a statement. &#8220;The shift to online delivery is not reversing, and expectations on all sides are only increasing. We have built a model which we believe offers unparalleled value to consumers, through wide access to the retailers and products they love, even in less urban areas, and to retailers, who are now able to affordably compete online and reach a whole new consumer base&#8221;.</p>
<p>Adds Simone Sallustio, Executive Director at Verlinvest: “Everli combines its tech &amp; data excellence with the grocery retail experience of its partners and this combination provides it with the perfect position to cement itself as the European e-grocery market leader, delivering the best experience to consumers, value to retail partners, and digital activation to brands&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you develop software for a large enterprise company, chances are you&#8217;ve heard of <a href="https://www.tricentis.com/">Tricentis</a>. If you don&#8217;t develop software for a large enterprise company, chances are you haven&#8217;t. The software testing company with a focus on modern cloud and enterprise applications was founded in Austria in 2007 and grew from a small consulting firm to a major player in this field, with customers like Allianz, BMW, Starbucks, Deutsche Bank, Toyota and UBS. In 2017, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/23/insight-ventures-invests-165-million-in-automated-testing-startup-tricentis/">raised</a> a $165 million Series B round led by Insight Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Today, Tricentis announced that it has acquired <a href="https://www.neotys.com/">Neotys</a>, a popular performance testing service with a focus on modern enterprise applications and a tests-as-code philosophy. The two companies did not disclose the price of the acquisition. France-based Neotys launched in 2005 and raised about €3 million before the acquisition. Today, it has about 600 customers for its NeoLoad platform. These include BNP Paribas, Dell, Lufthansa, McKesson and TechCrunch&#8217;s own corporate parent, Verizon.</p>
<p>As Tricentis CEO Sandeep Johri noted, testing tools were traditionally script-based, which also meant they were very fragile whenever an application changed. Early on, Tricentis introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricentis_Tosca">a low-code tool</a> that made the automation process both easier and resilient. Now, as even traditional enterprises move to DevOps and release code at a faster speed than ever before, testing is becoming both more important and harder for these companies to implement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;You have to have automation and you cannot have it be fragile, where it breaks, because then you spend as much time fixing the automation as you do testing the software,&#8221; Johri said. &#8220;Our core differentiator was the fact that we were a low-code, model-based automation engine. That&#8217;s what allowed us to go from $6 million in recurring revenue eight years ago to $200 million this year.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;3 new $100M ARR club members and a call for the next generation of growth-stage startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/three-new-100m-arr-club-members-and-a-call-for-the-next-generation-of-growth-stage-startups/embed/#?secret=qsOdnqCSyZ" data-secret="qsOdnqCSyZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tricentis, he added, wants to be the testing platform of choice for large enterprises. &#8220;We want to make sure we do everything that a customer would need, from a testing perspective, end to end. Automation, test management, test data, test case design,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Neotys allows the company to expand this portfolio by adding load and performance testing as well. It&#8217;s one thing to do the standard kind of functional testing that Tricentis already did before launching an update, but once an application goes into production, load and performance testing becomes critical as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you put it into production &#8212; or before you deploy it &#8212; you need to make sure that your application not only works as you expect it, you need to make sure that it can handle the workload and that it has acceptable performance,&#8221; Johri noted. &#8220;That&#8217;s where load and performance testing comes in and that&#8217;s why we acquired Neotys. We have some capability there, but that was primarily focused on the developers. But we needed something that would allow us to do end-to-end performance testing and load testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two companies already had an existing partnership and had integrated their tools before the acquisition &#8212; and many of its customers were already using both tools, too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are looking forward to joining Tricentis, the industry leader in continuous testing,&#8221; said Thibaud Bussière, president and co-founder at Neotys. &#8220;Today’s Agile and DevOps teams are looking for ways to be more strategic and eliminate manual tasks and implement automated solutions to work more efficiently and effectively. As part of Tricentis, we’ll be able to eliminate laborious testing tasks to allow teams to focus on high-value analysis and performance engineering.&#8221;</p>
<p>NeoLoad will continue to exist as a stand-alone product, but users will likely see deeper integrations with Tricentis&#8217; existing tools over time, include <a href="https://documentation.tricentis.com/tricentis-analytics/130/en/content/tricentis_analytics/analytics_intro.htm">Tricentis Analytics</a>, for example.</p>
<p>Johri tells me that he considers Tricentis one of the &#8220;best kept secrets in Silicon Valley&#8221; because the company not only started out in Europe (even though its headquarters is now in Silicon Valley) but also because it hasn&#8217;t raised a lot of venture rounds over the years. But that&#8217;s very much in line with Johri&#8217;s philosophy of building a company.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of Silicon Valley tends to pay attention only when you raise money,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;I actually think every time you raise money, you&#8217;re diluting yourself and everybody else. So if you can succeed without raising too much money, that&#8217;s the best thing. We feel pretty good that we have been very capital efficient and now we&#8217;re recognized as a leader in the category &#8212; which is a huge category with $30 billion spend in the category. So we&#8217;re feeling pretty good about it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During every economic boom, there are startup investors who appear on the scene from new corners. Some churn out; others earn the respect of the old guard over time.</p>
<p>Jake Paul would be happy to be in the latter camp. Then again, the 24-year-old didn&#8217;t become a social media star by being conventional. Little wonder that Paul is now jumping into venture capital with an outfit that&#8217;s branded the <a href="https://angel.co/v/back/anti-fund">Anti Fund</a>. Newly formed with serial entrepreneur Geoffrey Woo, the endeavor is traditional in some ways but has a decidedly different point of view, say the two.</p>
<p>Some of the basics: Anti Fund is not a discrete pool of capital but is instead using AngelList&#8217;s Rolling Funds platform, which enables investors to raise money through a quarterly subscription from interested backers. Among those who&#8217;ve already committed capital are Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Why choose a rolling fund instead of a traditional fund? For one thing, Paul and Woo were drawn to its Rule 506(c) structure, which allows issuers to broadly solicit an offering. Because Anti Fund plans to focus largely on consumer-focused opportunities and next-generation creator platforms in particular, it wants to be &#8220;able to promote and advertise our fund,&#8221; says Woo, who most recently founded a nutrition-based <a href="https://hvmn.com/">food and beverage company</a> and earlier in his career <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/11/groupon-acquires-realtime-location-aware-service-glassmap-to-help-you-find-deals/">sold a company</a> to Groupon.</p>
<p>Paul relatedly wants to ensure his fans can get involved if they like. &#8220;I have followers are different reasons, and they want to be involved in what I&#8217;m doing. If they&#8217;re involved in our fund, then that&#8217;s more people rooting for us and our portfolio companies to win. We almost create this army that&#8217;s pushing all of these companies forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for check sizes, Anti Fund plans to invest between $100,000 and $1 million in one to two startups every quarter. The goal, says Paul, is to be the &#8220;biggest rolling fund on AngelList,&#8221; investing &#8220;around $10 million to $20 million a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anti Fund is just the newest effort to come from the world of social media influencers. As we reported <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/mrbeasts-management-company-night-media-has-a-new-venture-fund-thats-backed-by-creators/">earlier this month</a>, the management company of another YouTube star, MrBeast, has dived into the world of venture capital with a $20 million fund it assembled with commitments from social media creators. Dispo, a photo-sharing app cofounded by YouTube star David Dobrik also attracted <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-david-dobriks-retro-photo-app-dispo-raises-20-million-0a056861-6ea2-46d2-92af-eda697eb179b.html">widespread attention</a> and funding earlier this year.</p>
<p>A new startup called <a href="https://getjuice.com/">Creative Juice</a> just raised funding, too, to provide <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mrbeast-explains-his-plans-to-help-youtube-creators-raise-equity-finance">equity-based financing</a> to YouTube creators. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is among its investors. (It make a lot of sense, suggests Woo, who says that Anti Fund believes firmly that &#8220;individuals will become their own media channels.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/style/byte-vine-short-video-apps.html">10 years</a> into the influencer phenomenon, the trend isn&#8217;t surprising. &#8220;I think a lot of creators with newfound wealth &#8212; a lot of YouTubers or Instagram models &#8212; don&#8217;t necessarily know what to do with their money,&#8221; says Paul, who has already diversified into boxing, making his professional boxing debut last year. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to lead the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Paul nor Woo is new to startup investing. Woo has invested in roughly 20 startups on his own, including Paribus, an email widget that saved consumers money and that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/capital-one-acquires-online-price-tracker-paribus/">acquired</a> by Capital One. Paul, meanwhile, previously cofounded another small venture outfit called <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/investor/tgz-capital">TGZ Capital</a> that he says participated in the funding rounds of 15 startups.</p>
<p>One of these is <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.getquip.com/">Quip</a>, a seven-year-old oral care company that has raised $62 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. Another company backed by Paul is <a href="https://www.triller.co/">Triller</a>, a social video app that briefly became the most-downloaded free app in the App Store <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andreabossi/2020/08/03/triller-jumps-to-no-1-on-the-app-store-overtakes-tiktok-as-drama-continues/?sh=13bf86496d4a">last summer</a> when bigger rival TikTok was facing an uncertain future in the U.S.</p>
<p>Triller has since lost enough of that momentum that talk of going public via a special purpose acquisition vehicle has yet to lead to a tie-up, six months after the company reportedly began <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-triller-m-a-exclusive/exclusive-tiktok-rival-triller-explores-deal-to-go-public-sources-idUSKBN26W0V5">exploring the possibility</a>. Still, as a stakeholder, Paul is keeping it in the headlines, including by providing it with exclusive rights to stream a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/jake-paul-vs-ben-askren-start-date-how-to-watch-online-press-conference-shenanigans">pay-per-view boxing match</a> between himself with former MMA wrestler Ben Asken on April 17.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it&#8217;s because Paul moved from L.A. to Miami to train for the fight that he met Woo, a Californian who visited Miami this past January for what was supposed to be a weekend trip and wound up staying. The two say they happened to hit it off at a tech event and, after establishing they had mutual friends, connected over their interest in performance nutrition, with Paul investing in Woo&#8217;s newest company, HVMN.</p>
<p>Last month, they decided to partner on Anti Fund, too.</p>
<p>Whether the two succeed as business partners will take time to learn. Certainly, they both have a strong work ethic. Woo has started three companies since graduating from Stanford with a computer science degree. Though Paul makes what seems an inordinate amount of money for creating YouTube videos, he has created thousands of them in order to amass his more than 20 million followers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also clear that, as with his social media career, Paul is taking boxing <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a30456685/jake-paul-pro-boxer-interview/">seriously</a>. During his most recent fight, in November, he <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/jake-paul-vs-nate-robinson-fight-results-highlights-paul-scores-scary-knockout-in-second-round/live/">knocked out</a> former NBA player Nate Robinson in the second round. His first boxing match, against fellow YouTuber AnEsonGib in January of last year, also ended in a knockout just minutes into the fight.</p>
<p>Many professional athletes see the fights as mere stunts, given Paul&#8217;s famous made-for-video antics, from a short-lived <a href="https://www.etonline.com/jake-paul-admits-tana-mongeau-marriage-was-fake-gives-julia-rose-relationship-update-exclusive">marriage</a>, to <a href="https://la.curbed.com/2017/7/19/16001358/jake-paul-house-neighbors-youtube">disregarding</a> the concerns of neighbors in West Hollywood, to being charged by police last June for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/04/jake-paul-youtube-riot-looting/">criminal trespass and unlawful assembly</a> connected with the looting of an Arizona mall.</p>
<p>An obvious risk is that the best deal-makers in the world will see Anti Fund as a stunt, too, or else that something that Paul says or does will ruffle feathers. As industry watchers know, investors&#8217; excitement over Dobrik&#8217;s Dispo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/spark-capital-decides-to-sever-all-ties-with-david-dobriks-dispo-app-weeks-after-leading-investment/">dissipated quickly</a> after Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3">first detailed</a> various accusations of misconduct against members of the Dobrik&#8217;s online squad, including an accusation of rape that allegedly took place during a video shoot.</p>
<p>Paul, who finished high school online in order to pursue a career as an influencer, is well aware of the Dobrik scandal. It&#8217;s because he has grown up in plain view, in fact, that he&#8217;s not concerned about something from his past threatening his future.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely [risky to be in my position]. Your life is put on display when you choose to be a celebrity and specifically a vlogger. But because I&#8217;ve lived online, everyone&#8217;s seen everything already,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>He also thinks that &#8220;VCs and people in the business world understand more and more how to work&#8221; with influencers and other celebrities who have enormous followings and are bringing them along as their careers evolve. &#8220;At the end of the day,&#8221; he says of business dealings, &#8220;if someone is a good person and you have a relationship established with them, that&#8217;s what really matters.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://thelivekindlyco.com/">LIVEKINDLY Collective</a>, the shouty parent company behind a family of plant-based food brands, has snagged cash from the global impact investing arm of $103 billion investment firm TPG to close its latest round of funding at $335 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s fundraising shows that investors still have high hopes for plant-based food brands and that despite the money that&#8217;s flowed to companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods &#8212; and the resurgence of older brands in the category like Quorn or Kelloggs&#8217; Morningstar Farms &#8212; there&#8217;s still a healthy appetite among investors for more brands.</p>
<p>LIVEKINDLY was founded by some heavy hitters from the food industry, including Kees Kruythoff, the former president of Unilever North America; Roger Lienhard, the founder of Blue Horizon; and Jodi Monelle, the chief executive and founder of LIVEKINDLY Media. Food industry veterans like Mick Van Ettinger, a former Unilever employee, and Aldo Uva, a former Nestlé employee, round out the team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded as a rollup for a number of different vegetarian and alternative protein food brands, the LIVEKINDLY Collective is now one of the largest plant-based food companies, by funding.</p>
<p>The company said it would use the money to expand into the U.S. and China and to power additional acquisitions, partnerships and investments in plant-based foods.</p>
<p>The company raised money previously from S2G Ventures and Rabo Corporate Investments, the investment arm of the giant Dutch financial services firm, Rabobank.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentally, the founding investors behind LIVEKINDLY believe that the technology has a long way to go before it matures. And it&#8217;s likely that this latest round will be LIVEKINDLY&#8217;s last before an initial public offering of its own. </span></p>

<p>“We are building a global pureplay in plant-based alternatives &#8212; which we believe is the future of food,” said Roger Lienhard, founder and executive chairman of Blue Horizon and founder of LIVEKINDLY Collective. “In just one year, we have raised a significant amount of capital, which testifies to the urgency of our mission and the enormous investment opportunity it represents. We believe the momentum behind plant-based living will continue to grow in both the private and public markets.”</p>
<p>As a result of <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">its investment, Steve Ellis, co-managing partner of The Rise Fund, has joined the LIVEKINDLY Collective board of directors, effective March 1, 2021.</span></p>
<p>“We are excited to work with LIVEKINDLY Collective and its ecosystem of innovative companies and world-class leaders to meet the growing global demand for healthy, plant-based, clean-label options,” said Ellis. “The company’s unique, mission-driven model operates across the entire value chain, from seed to fork, to drive worldwide adoption of plant-based alternatives and create a healthier planet for all.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, a Utah-based software company that provides corporate spend management software, raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/divvy-raises-165m-as-the-spend-management-space-stays-red-hot/">a $165 million round at a $1.6 billion valuation</a>. It followed its competitor <a href="https://www.brex.com/">Brex</a> to unicorn-status as the market for financial services software and corporate payment solutions stayed red-hot in 2021 after a blockbuster 2020.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a>, a competitor to both Divvy and Brex, is looking to raise new capital from Stripe and D1 Capital Partners at a valuation that could top $1 billion. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripe-invests-in-brex-rival-ramp-at-1-6-billion-valuation">first reported the news</a>, which TechCrunch confirmed with a source familiar with the transactions.</p>
<p>Ramp also competes with startups like <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a> and <a href="https://www.teampay.co/">Teampay</a>, each providing software designed to help companies allow, administer and track corporate cash outflows. The startup category is perhaps best known for its concept of providing company cards to startups and other SMBs, though its market has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/corp-card-startup-ramp-launches-expense-management-software/">matured into financial software designed</a> to provide a central node for internal expense controls.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The pace of investment into startup cohorts has been aggressive. Brex <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/brex-brings-on-150m-in-new-cash-in-case-of-an-extended-recession/">raised $150 million</a> after the pandemic set in, while Ramp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">raised several</a> times <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/ramp-is-a-corporate-card-focused-on-helping-you-spend-less/">last year</a> before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/ramp-secures-150m-debt-line-from-goldman-sachs-as-the-corporate-spend-market-grows/">adding a debt facility earlier this year</a> to its financial backstop. Airbase also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/spend-control-focused-airbase-adds-23-5m-to-its-series-a-as-it-posts-quick-growth/">raised last year</a>, sharing growth metrics as 2020 came to a close. Teampay <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/">added $5 million</a> to its 2019-era Series A last year as well.</p>
<p>And in a sign that the model of fintech startups building corporate spend software could prove popular in other markets, a Latin American-focused startup in the space called <a href="https://www.clara.cc/">Clara</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">raised $3.5 million earlier this month</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiss automation and technology company ABB has <a href="https://new.abb.com/news/detail/76179/abb-and-amazon-web-services-steer-fleets-to-an-all-electric-future">announced a collaboration</a> with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create a cloud-based EV fleet management platform that it hopes will hasten the electrification of fleets. The platform, which the company says will help operators maintain business continuity as they switch to electric, will roll out in the second half of 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This announcement comes after a wave of major delivery companies pledged to electrify their fleets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon already has a number of </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/amazon-begins-testing-its-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-in-san-francisco/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rivian-sourced electric delivery vans on the streets of California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to have 10,000 more operational by this year; UPS ordered 10,000 electric vans from Arrival for its fleet; 20% of DHL’s fleet is already electric; and FedEx plans to electrify its entire fleet by 2040. A </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/charging-electric-vehicle-fleets-how-to-seize-the-emerging-opportunity#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 McKinsey report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> predicted commercial and passenger fleets in the U.S. could include as many as eight million EVs by 2030, compared with fewer than 5,000 in 2018. That’s about 10-15% of all fleet vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make EV adoption easier and more scalable for fleets,” Frank Muehlon, president of ABB’s e-mobility division, told TechCrunch. “To power progress, the industry must bring together the best minds and adopt an entrepreneurial approach to product development.” </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABB brings to the table experience in e-mobility solutions, energy management and charging technology, which will combine with AWS’s cloud and software to make a single-view platform that can be tailored to whichever company is using it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies will be able to monitor things like charge planning, EV maintenance status and route optimization based on the time of day, weather and use patterns. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muehlon said they’ll work with customers to explore ways to use existing data from fleets for faster implementation.</span></p>

<p>The platform will be hosted on the AWS cloud, which means that it can scale anywhere AWS is available, which so far includes in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">25 regions globally</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform will be hardware-agnostic, meaning any type of EV or charger can work with it. Integration of software into specific EV fleets will depend on the fleet&#8217;s level of access to third-party asset management systems and onboard EV telematics, but the platform will support a layered feature approach, wherein each layer provides more accurate vehicle data. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muehlon says this makes for a more seamless interface than existing third-party charging management software, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don’t have the technology or the flexibility to work with the total breadth of EV models and charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not only do fleet managers have to contend with the speed of development in charging technology, but they also need real-time vehicle and charging status information, access to charging infrastructures and information for hands-on maintenance,&#8221; said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Muehlon. &#8220;This new real-time EV fleet management solution will set new standards in the world of electric mobility for global fleet operators and help them realize improved operations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This software is aimed at depot and commercial fleets, as well as public infrastructure fleets. Muehlon declined to specify any specific EV operators or customers lined up to use this new technology, but he did say there are “several pilots underway” which will “enable us to ensure that we are developing market-ready solutions for all kinds of fleets.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Oh hello. What’s this then? A Niantic-branded AR headset? Perhaps? John Hanke, CEO of the Pokémon GO developer teased what could be a first-party head-mounted wearable, as the company makes a more aggressive push into augmented reality.</p>
<p>“Exciting to see the progress we’re making to enable new kinds of devices that leverage our platform,” the executive noted in the text accompanying an image of eyeglasses temples sporting the Niantic name in bright orange.</p>
<p>Niantic has been a fairly active investor in the augmented reality hardware space, so there is also the possibility that they&#8217;ve done a branding partnership with a startup on a project, but this cryptic image crop is certainly making it look like they&#8217;re showcasing a device with first-party branding. There&#8217;s also the potential that this is a product in the &#8220;smart glasses&#8221; category that doesn&#8217;t include a display but focuses on building audio or camera functionality into a pair of glasses. Niantic has previously announced that they&#8217;ve been working with Qualcomm to help define their reference design for their XR hardware platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Niantic for additional comment.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; John Hanke (@johnhanke) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnhanke/status/1376624749787242499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Notably, the Twitter teaser also follows Niantic’s posting of a job listing for a Head of AR OS Engineering.</p>
<p>“We are on an ambitious mission to turn the world into an Augmented Reality canvas which games and other applications can paint on top of,” the listing states. “This future is fully realized on AR Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). Niantic’s Engineering Team is seeking an inspirational leader to oversee the engineering direction to help build an AR operating system for HMDs and enable applications for millions of Niantic players.”</p>

<p>The image arrives amid a recent flurry of activity for the one-time Google spin-out. Last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/niantic-announces-partnership-with-nintendo-on-new-augmented-reality-pikmin-title/">the company announced an AR title based on Pikmin</a>, another Nintendo collaboration following its wildly successful Pokémon title. Earlier this month, it showed off a proof-of-concept version of Pokémon GO running on Microsoft’s HoloLens 2.</p>
<p>Niantic&#8217;s AR platform has stayed under wraps for the most part as the company seems to wait for a more active moment in augmented reality development to make a major push. Part of that activity may ultimately be defined by a broader AR hardware ecosystem, and as Apple and Facebook compete to release their own devices, I would imagine that there is some concern among players like Niantic that those early devices will focus on first-party software initially and leave fewer platform opportunities for third-parties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A growing number of companies have emerged over the last few years determined to reduce waste in the electric vehicle battery market. Chief among these is recycling firm Redwood Materials, which has quickly expanded since its launch in 2017 by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel to become the largest lithium-ion battery recycler in North America. Now the firm is teaming up with electric commercial vehicle manufacturer Proterra in a deal that may help boost the domestic battery supply chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the first publicly announced partnership between Redwood and an automaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the agreement, all Proterra batteries will be sent to Redwood’s facilities for recycling in Carson City, Nevada. The two companies entered the agreement in January, but have been in discussion since last summer, when Proterra reached out to learn more about Redwood’s recycling process. That led to a trip out to Redwood’s facilities in Nevada to see if the recycler could process Proterra battery packs.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That went really well,” Proterra CTO Dustin Grace told TechCrunch. Grace worked for Straubel for around nine years at Tesla. “We were super excited to see their operation. From there, we started work on our master supply agreement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proterra has sent around 26,000 pounds of battery material to Nevada for recycling since entering the partnership, though this does not represent the pace of future deliveries. Overall, Redwood receives 60 tons per day, or 20,000 tons of batteries per year.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/embed/#?secret=H8PwT7U0lp" data-secret="H8PwT7U0lp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The batteries that power Proterra’s fleets are designed to last the lifespan of the vehicle, but the company offers a battery leasing program that guarantees replacement after six years &#8212; which means plenty of useful life will remain in the battery, as much as 80-90% charging capacity. To exploit the remainder of this capacity, Proterra has plans to reuse the batteries in second-life applications &#8212; such as in stationary storage systems hooked up to Proterra charging hardware &#8212; before they head to Nevada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First the grading of the battery will occur at Proterra by our remanufacturing engineering team. If the battery is deemed ready for second-life, it will go into one of those applications; if it’s not, it gets recycled,” Grace said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only once all this useful life is exhausted will the batteries be sent to Redwood, where the waste will be reprocessed into valuable raw material. And with the transit EV market poised to reach 50% of all annual sales by 2025, there will be plenty of batteries that will need reprocessing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news comes just weeks after Redwood announced it was teaming up with e-bike manufacturer Specialized to recycle its batteries. Redwood already has arrangements to process scrap from Panasonic’s battery cell production at the Nevada Tesla Gigafactory, and with Amazon to recycle EV batteries and other waste. Through these business-to-business partnerships Redwood aims to develop a circular battery supply chain, supplying the raw materials back to the manufacturer. The company also accepts electronics and batteries</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/recycling-startup-redwood-materials-is-now-accepting-your-old-smartphones/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from everyday consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which can be mailed to Redwood via a mailing address posted on its website.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership is a sign that both companies are thinking large-scale and long-term. A spokesperson for Redwood said in a statement to TechCrunch that the recycler is focused on “developing the solution for a fully closed-loop recycling for EV batteries.” That means finding truly sustainable, long-term sources of materials like cobalt, lithium and copper to eventually move beyond terrestrial mining. And Straubel</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/why-amazon-and-panasonic-are-betting-on-this-battery-recycling-startup/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has been vocal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past about his ambition to grow Redwood into one of the world’s largest battery materials companies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more battery-grade raw materials become available in the United States, Proterra sees an opportunity to eventually expand into domestic battery-cell manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s still early days but we’re trying to set ourselves up for the future state of this market at scale. That’s really the primary benefit of this partnership existing today,” Grace said. “The way we see it, domestic cell production for Proterra is a very, very important part of our roadmap here in the coming years. The idea of generating more battery-grade raw materials on North American soil directly supports the expansion of that battery manufacturing concept within the U.S. So I think this starting now absolutely aids our plans for domestic cell manufacturing in the near future.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another proptech is considering raising capital through the public arena.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.knock.com">Knock</a> confirmed Monday that it is considering going public, although CEO Sean Black did not specify whether the company would do so via a traditional IPO, SPAC merger or direct listing.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We are considering all of our options,&#8221; Black told TechCrunch. &#8220;We pioneered the real estate transaction revolution over five years ago and our priority is to build a war chest to dramatically widen the already cavernous gap between us and any unoriginal knock-offs.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/property-tech-startup-knock-hires-goldman-sachs-to-go-public?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported earlier today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the company had hired Goldman Sachs to advise on such a bid, which Knock also confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Bloomberg, Knock is potentially seeking to raise $400 million to $500 million through an IPO, according to “people familiar with the matter,” at a valuation of about $2 billion. The company declined to comment on valuation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black and Knock COO Jamie Glenn are no strangers to the proptech game, having both been on the founding team of Trulia, which went public in 2012 and was acquired by Zillow for $3.5 billion in 2014. The pair started Knock in 2015, and have since raised over $430 million in venture funding and another $170 million or so in debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock started out as a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> real estate brokerage business until last July, when the company announced a major shift in strategy and said it was becoming a lender. At the time, Knock unveiled its Home Swap program, under which Knock serves as the lender to help a homeowner buy a new home before selling their old house. It previously worked with lending partners but has now become a licensed lender itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the company now offers integrated financing &#8212; the mortgage and an interest-free bridge loan &#8212; with the goal of helping consumers make strong non-contingent offers on a new home before repairing and listing their old home for sale on the open market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that move, Knock eliminated its Home Trade-In program, where it helped consumers buy before selling by using its own money to purchase the new home on behalf of the consumer before prepping and listing the consumer’s old house on the open market. Under that trade-in model, the homeowner used the proceeds from selling their old home to buy the new home from Knock and pay the company back for any repairs it did to prep the house for sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, Black told me that Knock had decided to move away from its trade-in program in part because it was capital-intensive and required the closing of a house to take place twice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It added friction to the experience,” he said. “And now, especially during COVID, it can be inconvenient to try and sell a house at the same time as buying one. This is about making something possible that isn’t possible with any other traditional lender. We’re able to lend some money before an owner’s [old] house is even listed on the market.” </span></p>
<p>To sum up what Knock does today, Black said the company aims to offer a full service technology platform that includes everything &#8220;from pre-funding the homebuyers to make non-contingent offers and win bidding wars, to getting their old home ready for market with our contractor network to selling their old home quickly at the highest price and empowers them to have their own agent working with them in the app through the entire process.&#8221;</p>

<p>Demand for the Home Swap, he added, has &#8220;exceeded all expectations.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knock is headquartered in New York and San Francisco. The company launched the Home Swap in three markets in July 2020, and today it is in 27 markets in nine states, including Texas, California and North Carolina.</span></p>
