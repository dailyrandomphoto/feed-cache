<p>This Falcon 9&#8217;s first stage has already flown four times previously, including during two of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> commercial resupply missions to the International Space Station for NASA, and during a Starlink launch, as well as for SAOCOM 1B, a satellite launch operation for the Argentinian space agency in August.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

SpaceX&#8217;s at-sea launches were introduced to allow for recovery of rocket boosters that didn&#8217;t have enough fuel remaining on board to make it all the way back to land – meaning this NRO mission&#8217;s parameters allow for a &#8216;return to sender&#8217; trip back home.</p>
<p>Typically, when there&#8217;s a longer launch window, SpaceX will aim to launch at the beginning, depending on weather conditions. If that&#8217;s the case today, the stream above should begin at around 8:45 AM EST (15 minutes prior to the opening of the window).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup with a new type of spacecraft propulsion system could make the interplanetary travel seen in Star Trek a reality. <a href="http://magdrivespace.com">Magdrive</a> has just closed a £1.4M seed round led by Founders Fund, an early investor in SpaceX, backed by Luminous Ventures, 7percent Ventures, and Entrepreneur First.</p>
<p>Magdrive is developing a next generation of spacecraft propulsion for small satellites. The startup says its engine’s thrust and efficiency are a &#8220;generational leap&#8221; ahead of any other electrical thrusters, opening up the space industry to completely new types of missions that were not possible before, without resorting to much larger, expensive and heavier chemical thrusters. It says its engine would make fast and affordable interplanetary space travel possible, as well as operations in Very Low Earth orbit. The engine would also make orbital manufacturing far more possible than previously.</p>
<p>Existing electrical solutions are very efficient but have very low thrust. Chemical thrusters have high thrust but lack efficiency and are hazardous and expensive to handle. Magdrive says its engine can deliver both high thrust and high efficiency in one system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2088476" style="width: 407px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088476" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png" alt="Magdrive prototype render" width="397" height="377" class="size-full wp-image-2088476" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png 397w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png?resize=150,142 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png?resize=300,285 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Magdrive-prototype-render.png?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088476" class="wp-caption-text">Magdrive prototype render</p></div></p>
<p>If it works, the Magdrive engine could make spacecraft go faster for longer. This could open up the industry to new space missions, such as a satellite (or X-wing fighter?) that can make multiple, fast maneuvers, without worrying about conserving fuel. In order to do this right now, satellites require a chemical thruster, which requires a significant payload in fuel for launch. A 200kg satellite would require 50kg of hydrazine fuel, which would cost £1,350,000 in launch mass alone.</p>
<p>Co-founder (and Star Trek fan) Dr Thomas Clayson did a PhD in plasma physics, working on advanced electromagnetic fields. He realized this could be a cornerstone for developing a plasma thruster that could achieve the accelerations required for interplanetary space travel. After meeting Mark Stokes, a mechanical engineer at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/imperial-college-london" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="imperial-college-london">Imperial College London <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with similar dreams of space travel, they decided to build a small scale thruster for satellites.</p>
<p>But Magdrive is not alone. Other companies are developing so-called &#8216;Hall Effect Thrusters&#8217;, which is a technology that has existed since the 1960’s. Much of the development is towards miniaturization and mass reduction, but thrust and efficiency remain the same. These companies include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/busek" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="busek">Busek, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Exotrail, Apollo Fusion, Enpusion, Nanoavionics. Meanwhile, large international companies with huge technology portfolios are working on improving chemical propulsion and making it non-toxic to handle, such as Aerojet Rocketdyne and Moog ISP.</p>
<p>They plan to scale up our technology to power larger manned spacecraft (once in orbit) to long-distance destinations such as the Moon and Mars. Our system would present a much more affordable than a chemical or nuclear solution, due to the huge reduction in fuel costs, and because it is reusable.</p>
<p>Andrew J Scott, Founding Partner, 7percent Ventures: “At 7percent we seek founding teams with &#8216;moonshot&#8217; ambitions. With Magdrive this is not just a metaphor: their revolutionary plasma thruster will soon be powering satellites, but in the future could take us to deep space. While the UK&#8217;s expertise in constructing satellites is world-renowned, there has been far less focus on propulsion. In fact, Great Britain is the only country to have successfully developed and then, in the 1970&#8217;s abandoned, an indigenous satellite launch capability, which undoubtedly curbed the UK&#8217;s space sector. So we&#8217;re excited to be backing Magdrive, one of a new generation of British space startups, which has the vision and ambition to become a world-beating company in this burgeoning sector.”</p>
<p>The satellite industry is worth $5 Billion in 2020, predicted to grow to USD$30Billion by 2030, due to the rise in mega-constellations. Some 5,000 satellites are due to be launched in the next two years and 75% of all the companies launching these satellites have already flown something in space.</p>
<p>Magdrive is at the European Space Agency Business Incubation Centre in Harwell, Oxford.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a major upswing in virtual learning &#8212; where some schools have gone (and stayed) remote, and others have incorporated significantly stronger online components, in order to help communities maintain more social distancing. That has in turn led to a surge in the usage of tools to help home learners do their work better, and today, one of them is announcing a growth round that speaks to the opportunity in that market.</p>
<p><a href="https://brainly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brainly</a>, a startup from Poland that has built a popular network for students and their parents to engage with each other for advice and help with homework questions, has raised $80 million, a series D that it will be using both to continue building out the tools that it offers to students as well as to hone in on expansion in some key emerging markets such as Indonesia and Brazil. The news comes on the heels of dramatic growth for the company, which has seen its user base grow from 150 million users in 2019 to 350 million today.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by previous backer Learn Capital, with past investors <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/prosus-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="prosus-ventures">Prosus Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/runa-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="runa-capital">Runa Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> MantaRay, and General Catalyst Partners also participating. The company has now raised some $150 million and while it&#8217;s not disclosing valuation, CEO and co-founder Michał Borkowski confirmed it is &#8220;definitely&#8221; an upround for the company. For more context, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/brainly-a-crowdsourced-homework-helper-for-students-raises-30m-to-expand-in-the-us/">Pitchbook estimates</a> that the company was valued at $180 million in its last round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/brainly-a-crowdsourced-homework-helper-for-students-raises-30m-to-expand-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Series C of $30 million in 2019</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That C round was raised specifically to help <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/brainly-com" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="brainly-com">Brainly <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> grow in the U.S. It currently has some 30 million users in that market, and it happens to be the only one in which Brainly is monetising users. Everywhere else, Brainly is currently free to use. (In the U.S. there are also some formidable competitors, like Chegg, which has <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamBlacker25/status/1339546254922158081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strong traction</a> in the market of helping students with homework, with some 74% of Chegg&#8217;s user spend concentrated in that one single country.)</p>
<p>“Brainly has become one of the world’s largest learning communities, achieving significant organic growth in over 35 countries,” said Vinit Sukhija, Partner at Learn Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2088466" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="471" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png 6500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=1536,1063 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=2048,1418 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/US.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, Brainly was finding an audience with students &#8212; primarily those aged 13-19, said Borkowski &#8212; who were turning to the service to connect with people who could help them with homework when they found themselves at an impasse with, say, a math problem or getting to grips with the sequence of events that led to the revolutions of 1848. The platform is open-ended and is a little like a <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quora" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quora">Quora <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for homework, in that people can find and answer questions they are interested in, as well as ask questions themselves.</p>
<p>That platform, however, took on a whole new dimension of importance with the shift to virtual learning, Borkowski said.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;In the western world, online education wasn’t a big investment area [pre-Covid] and that has changed a lot, with huge adoption by students, parents and teachers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But that big transition, switching from offline to online, has left kids struggling because teachers have so much more to do, so they can&#8217;t engage in the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>So with &#8220;homework&#8221; becoming &#8220;all work&#8221;, that has effectively led to needing more help than ever with home studies. And while many parents have tried to get more involved to make up the difference, &#8220;having parents as teachers has been hard,&#8221; he added. They may have been taught differently from how their kids are learning, or they don&#8217;t remember or know answers.</p>
<p>One thing that Brainly started to see, he said, was that with the pandemic more parents started using the app alongside students, either to work out answers together or to get the help themselves before helping their kids, with a number of these being from parents of kids younger than 13. He said that 15-20% of all new registrations currently are coming from parents.</p>
<p>Brainly up to now has been mainly focused on how to build out more tools for the students &#8212; and now parents &#8212; that use it, and has so far been about organic growth for those communities.</p>
<p>However, there is clearly scope to expand that to more educational stakeholders to better organise what kind of questions are answered and how. Borkowski said that the company has indeed been approached by educators, those building curriculums and others so that answers might tie in better with the kinds of questions that they are most likely to ask of students, although for now the company &#8220;wants to keep the focus on students and parents getting stuck.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of future products, Brainly is looking at ways of bringing in more tutoring, video and AI into the mix. The AI aspect is very interesting and will in fact tie in to wider curriculum coverage based on more localised needs.</p>
<p>For example, if you ask for help with a particular kind of quadratic equation technique, you can then be served lots of same practice questions to help better learn and apply what you&#8217;ve just been learning, and you might even then get suggested related topics that will appear alongside that in a wider mathematics examination. And, you might be offered the chance to meet with a tutor for further help.</p>
<p>Tutoring, he said, is something that Brainly has already been quietly piloting and has run some 150,000 sessions to date. Having such a large user base, Borkowski said, helps the startup run services at scale while still effectively keeping them in test mode.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It will be about looking at what students are studying and how to map that to the curriculum in the country, and what we can do to help with that.&#8221; Borkowski said. &#8220;But it will require a heavy lift and and machine learning to pinpoint students&#8221; for it to work properly, which is one reason it has yet to roll it out more comprehensively, he added.</p>
<p>Tutoring and more personalization are not the only areas where Brainly is actively testing out new services.</p>
<p>The company is also creating more space for adding in video to demonstrate different techniques (which I suspect is especially good for something like mathematics, but equally helpful for, say, an art technique). This is presumably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/brainly-bask/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in part based on a 2018 acquisition the startup made to bring on more video tools</a>, which underscores in some ways how deliberate Brainly&#8217;s expansion strategy has been.</p>
<p>There are &#8220;thousands per week&#8221; being added already, but as with tutoring &#8220;that, for us, is a testing stage,&#8221; added Borkowski. There should be more coming in Q1 about new products, he said.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">In the eight years since Aceable&#8217;s launch, the company has grown from a driver&#8217;s ed test prep service to an online training tool for drivers and real estate agents.</p>
<p>Only four years ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/23/drivers-ed-app-aceable-raises-4-million-for-national-expansion/">Aceable was raising $4 million in financing</a>, from investors including Floodgate Capital and Silverton Partners.</p>

<p>Now, with another $50 million in the bank and over $100 million in total capital raised, Aceable is looking to grow the number of certifications it offers &#8212; with a special focus on professional development.</p>
<p>The company said that it would look to grow both organically and inorganically (which is an inelegant way of saying that it&#8217;s likely to go shopping for potential acquisitions).</p>
<p>Re-skilling and up-skilling are set to become buzzwords again as Americans who were laid off because of the inadequate support small businesses received from Congress in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak begin looking for new work.</p>
<p>EdTech has seen a huge boost during the pandemic, with millions of Americans turning to online classes to learn new skills or trades or hone existing skillsets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Changing or growing your career can create new opportunities to reach your life goals. Our vision is to make it accessible to anyone to gain a skill and a certification capable of setting you on the path of a well-paid career that you love,&#8221; said <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/blake-garrett" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="blake-garrett">Blake Garrett, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Aceable&#8217;s founder and chief executive. &#8220;We see <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hggc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hggc">HGGC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as a strategic, long-term financial partner that embraces and accelerates our vision to create unparalleled education experiences that make it accessible for people to change their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other startups have also landed tens of millions of dollars to capture this newfound interest in reskilling or upskilling. In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/degreed-lands-new-cash-for-upskilling-in-a-down-market/">Degreed raised $32 million for its own spin on the edtech market</a>. But there&#8217;s still some question over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/reskilling-upskilling-future-of-edtech/">who benefits from these new platforms</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AAUyKZ1gtB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/reskilling-upskilling-future-of-edtech/">Who really benefits from reskilling?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Who really benefits from reskilling?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/reskilling-upskilling-future-of-edtech/embed/#?secret=AAUyKZ1gtB" data-secret="AAUyKZ1gtB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that Aceable could exist along a continuum with some of these other platforms, or serve communities that aren&#8217;t addressed by the current options on the market.</p>
<p>As the company notes, one in four working professionals takes license and certification training a year &#8212; and these classes are often the gatekeeper to greater financial success.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are big believers in Aceable&#8217;s mission and their long track record of success in developing mobile-first education technology,&#8221; said John Block, Partner at HGGC. &#8220;Our investment reinforces our confidence in the team and will allow Aceable to grow to the next level while helping people achieve the life they want through continuing education.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aceable now counts more than 2,200 hours of educational content on its platform, which have been used to train 13 million students across 36 states. The company was first spun up from the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Capital Factory accelerator program and has raised its cash from investors including Sageview Capital, Silverton Partners, Floodgate Fund, Next Coast Venture Partners, Wildcat VC, Nextgen Partners and now HGGC.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://photoroom.com">PhotoRoom</a> is launching its app on Android today. The company has been working on a utility photography app that lets you remove the background from a photo, swaps it for another background and tweaks your photo.</p>
<p>And it’s been working well on iOS already as the company attended Y Combinator, doubled its annual recurring revenue to $2 million and raised a $1.2 million seed round.</p>
<p>In particular, influencers and people reselling clothes and fashion items have been relying on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/photoroom" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="photoroom">PhotoRoom <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. They use their phone as their main creativity platform. Like other professional photography apps, the startup relies on subscriptions to generate revenue ($9.49 per month or $46.99 per year).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PhotoRoom relies on machine learning to identify objects and separate them from the rest of the photo. This way, you can manipulate a specific part of your photo.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088173" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088173" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png" alt="" width="1024" height="619" class="size-full wp-image-2088173" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png 1420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=768,464 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Android-Model-Story.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088173" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PhotoRoom</p></div></p>
<p>When the startup raised its seed round after Y Combinator, it chose to raise from Nicolas Wittenborn’s Adjacent fund, Liquid2 Ventures as well as two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>A group of business angels focused on machine learning, such as Yann LeCun (Chief AI Scientist at Facebook), Zehan Wang (Head of Twitter Machine Learning Cortex, co-founder of Magic Poney), Nicolas Pinto (Perceptio founder), etc.</li>
<li>And another group of business angels focused on mobile subscriptions, such as Holger Seim (Blinkist), Jacob Eiting (RevenueCat), John Bonten (advisor for Calm and Spotify) and Eric Setton (Tango).</li>
</ul>
<p>With this funding round, the company plans to grow the team from 3 to 8 persons and work on its deep learning algorithm. If you want to learn more about PhotoRoom, feel free to read my take on the product:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://betterdairy.co.uk/">Better Dairy</a>, a U.K. startup developing animal-free dairy that was founded out of Entrepreneur First (EF), has picked up £1.6 million in seed funding. The London-based company is currently in the R&amp;D stages of developing products that are &#8220;molecularly identical&#8221; to traditional dairy without using animals as part of the production process.</p>
<p>This seed round was led by Happiness Capital, alongside a number of other investors in the space. They include CPT Capital, Stray Dog Capital and Veg Capital, in addition to various unnamed angel investors. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/better-dairy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="better-dairy">Better Dairy <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says it will use the funds to accelerate its R&amp;D efforts with the aim of commercialising its first products by early 2022.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Jevan Nagarajah (CEO) and Dr. Christopher Reynolds (CTO), both alumni of Imperial College London but who paired up during EF’s company builder program, Better Dairy is using advancements in technology to address the hugely unsustainable dairy market. Nagarajah has plenty of tech company experience, including stints at Rocket Internet, SumUp, and Ritua, as well as founding early ‘dark kitchen’ startup ShareDining. Meanwhile, Reynolds holds a PhD and a number of post-doctorates across bioinformatics and synthetic biology, and has a degree in natural sciences spanning chemistry and biochemistry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nagarajah says animal-based dairy farming is “hugely unsustainable,” noting that it emits the equivalent of over 1.7 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year and it takes 650 litres of water to produce just 1 litre of milk. “Dairy products themselves contain several unwanted pollutants such as growth hormones and antibiotics by virtue of the process of milking mothering cows and are thus not the most suitable for human consumption,” he adds.</p>
<p>However, although plant based alternatives are gaining popularity, Nagarajah argues that they are not a complete solution, often lacking in flavour, texture and nutritional profile. And while they might be able to capture market share, he doesn’t believe plant based alternatives to dairy will be successful in “radically” disrupting the existing $700 billion dairy industry and supply chain. That’s where Better Dairy comes in.</p>
<p>“We are instead using yeast fermentation and biology to produce products that are molecularly identical to traditional dairy,” he explains. “We follow a process very similar to beer brewing but the end result in our case is large vats of dairy instead of beer. This production process, while seemingly futuristic, is actually already being used to produce several enzymes for food production, for example rennet, as well as to produce numerous medical products such as insulin, so we are just building on this”.</p>
<p>Better Dairy is still early on in its R&amp;D process, but has already managed to produce its first dairy samples in the lab. The first challenge was to manipulate yeast to produce initial dairy proof of concepts. “Following this, we believe we have identified a clear path to get us to commercially viable products,” says Nagarajah. “While some of our milestones are box ticking exercises, for example the scaling up of our manufacturing capabilities, the major challenges we need to overcome revolve around the optimisation of our end to end production process”.</p>
<p>That’s because, explains the Better Dairy co-founder, dairy is a relatively low cost good. To realistically disrupt the existing dairy market, the startup will need to achieve a certain level of efficiency otherwise it risks succeeding in producing better dairy but will still fail overall due to prohibitively high pricing.</p>
<p>“We are initially focused on dairy proteins with the view of extending our range to fats over time,” says Nagarajah. “The main dairy proteins whey and casein have many structural and nutritional benefits and are used as ingredients across thousands of food products. They are crucial in providing the texture of dairy products like cheese but are also used heavily in soups and ready meals, baked goods and pastries, chocolates and sweets and also pasta and bread. They even find their way into products like beef burgers and chicken nuggets to bolster protein content and add texture.</p>
<p>“While our intention was initially to enable a wave of better dairy products, our ambitions have grown to target the disruption of the entire dairy supply chain across dairy and non-dairy categories. Our vision is to create a world where humans are vegan without even realising it”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a>, the London fintech that aims to become the one-stop shop globally for businesses that want to let customers pay via recurring bank payments, has raised $95 million in Series F funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/12/14/gocardless-secures-billion-dollar-valuation-raising-95m/">According to The Telegraph newspaper</a>, this gives the company much coveted unicorn status. However, I understand the round values GoCardless at just over $970 million, meaning that the 2011-founded fintech is perhaps best described as a soonicorn (presuming these things are important to you).</p>
<p>The latest fundraise was led by Bain Capital Ventures, and follows 46% year-on-year growth for GoCardless as it benefits from an increase in e-commerce and online payments generally during the pandemic. It brings the total raised by the company to-date to $240 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GoCardless says it will use the funding to accelerate its open banking strategy, which will see it combine open banking-enabled bank-to-bank payments with the global bank debit payments network it has already built out. “For the first time, merchants will be able to access the best of both worlds for recurring payments: Instant open banking payments will provide visibility and speed, while bank debit maximises cash flow and minimises churn by pulling funds automatically from payers &#8211; all at a lower cost than cards,” pitches the fintech.</p>
<p>In addition &#8212; and noteworthy &#8212; GoCardless says it will also expand its offering into the “adjacent e-commerce market” to launch a simple and secure way of making open banking-enabled bank-to-bank payments as a lower-cost alternative to cards.</p>
<p>The company has always pitched direct debits as a much better recurring payments method, especially for subscription commerce and regular B2B payments. That’s because, amongst other things, debit and credit cards expire, breaking any subsequent recurring payments. By adding bank-to-bank payments to its stack, GoCardless is continuing to push up against the card network duopoly of Visa and Mastercard.</p>
<p>“We think the magic is in the combination of open banking payments and our existing direct debit platform,” co-founder and CEO Hiroki Takeuchi tells me, when asked why GoCardless is entering the soon to be commoditized space of open banking payments.</p>
<p>“They are really complimentary as open banking is faster and more secure but direct debit is more flexible and more reliable. The combination will create something entirely new and unique that will not only make our product better for our existing customers but also enable us to go after new markets”.</p>
<p>He says that GoCardless already has the required FCA permissions to do open banking payments, and new products are actively under development. Debut products will be launching in the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>“We have been following open banking very closely but we felt it wasn’t reliable enough or slick enough for payments until quite recently,” adds Takeuchi. “This has been changing and we think now is the perfect time to focus on open banking payments”.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of open banking is that the U.K. regulator is currently consulting with the industry on plans to make recurring payments possible via open banking, meaning that they could be used instead of direct debits. Arguably, GoCardless’ biggest moat is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/goamerica/">the global recurring payments network</a> it has built, and so I put it to Takeuchi that open banking is both an opportunity and a threat to GoCardless.</p>
<p>“We don&#8217;t worry about this &#8211; we are agnostic to the rails we build on,” he says, pushing back. “What we care about is getting money from one bank account to another as efficiently as possible. In fact, we processed the first (and I think maybe the only) variable recurring payment via open banking last year as part of a test we worked on with the open banking team.</p>
<p>“If open banking offers rails that replicate direct debit then we will adopt those. The reality is that the payment itself is only a small part of the overall value we provide for our merchants &#8212; there are a lot of other basics such as reconciliation, refunds, international settlement, FX etc. that are really important &#8212; so we are confident that there is still a lot for us to do”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are over 600 million internet users in India, but only a fraction of this population is fluent in English. Most online services and much of the content on the web currently, however, are available exclusively in English.</p>
<p>This language barrier continues to contribute to a digital divide in the world’s second largest internet market that has limited hundreds of millions of users’ rendition of the world wide web to a select few websites and services.</p>
<p>So it comes as no surprise that American tech giants, which are counting on emerging markets such as India to continue their growth. are increasingly attempting to make the web and their services accessible to more people.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Case in point: A feature that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> provides to quickly translate the content of a web page from English to Indian languages has been used more than 17 billion times by users in India in the past year.</p>
<p>Google, which has so far led this effort, on Thursday unveiled some of its new efforts. The company &#8212; which counts India as its biggest market by users, and this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">committed to invest more than $10 billion in the country</a> over the coming years &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">said it plans to invest more in machine learning and AI efforts at Google&#8217;s research center in India and make its AI models accessible to everyone across the ecosystem. The company </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">also plans to partner with local startups that are serving users in local languages, and &#8220;drastically&#8221; improve the experience of Google products and services for Indian language users.</span></p>
<p>On that last part, the company today announced a range of changes it is rolling out across some of its services to make them speak more local languages and unveiled a whole new approach it’s taking to translate languages.</p>
<h2>Product changes</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2088428" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1.gif" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></p>
<p>Users will now be able to see search results to their queries in Tamil, Telugu, Bangla, and Marathi, in addition to English and Hindi that are currently available. The addition comes four years after Google added the Hindi tab to the search page in India. The company said the volume of search queries in Hindi grew more than 10 times after the introduction of this tab. If someone prefers to see their query in Tamil, for instance, now they will be able to set Tamil tab next to English and quickly toggle between the two.</p>
<p>Getting search results in a local language is helpful, but often people want to make their queries in those languages as well. Google says it has found that typing in non-English language is another challenge users face today. “As a result, many users search in English even if they really would prefer to see results in a local language they understand,” the company said.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, Search will start to show relevant content in supported Indian languages where appropriate even if the local language query is typed in English. The feature, which the company plans to roll out over the next month, supports five Indian languages: Hindi, Bangla, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical alignnone size-full wp-image-2088426" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image.gif" alt="" width="300" height="583" /></p>
<p>Google is also making it easier for users to quickly change the preferred language in which they see results in an app without altering the device’s language settings. The feature, which is currently available in Discover and Google Assistant, will now roll out in Maps. Maps supports 9 Indian languages.</p>
<p>Similarly, Google Lens’s Homework feature, which allows users to take a picture of a math or science problem and then delivers its answer and walks students through the steps on how to get there, now supports Hindi language. India is the biggest market for Google Lens, said Nidhi Gupta, Senior Product Manager at Google India, at the event.</p>
<p>Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst at consultancy firm Convergence Catalyst, said the new feature of Google Lens could pose a threat to some Indian startups such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/two-year-old-indian-edtech-startup-doubtnut-raises-15m/">Sequoia Capital-backed Doubtnut</a> that operates in a similar space.</p>
<h2>MuRIL</h2>
<p>Google executives also detailed a new language AI model, which they are calling <a href="https://tfhub.dev/google/MuRIL/1">Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages</a> (MuRIL), that delivers more efficiency and accuracy in handling transliteration, spelling variations and mixed languages and other nuances of languages. MuRIL provides support for transliterated text when writing Hindi using Roman script, which was something missing from previous models of its kind, said Partha Talukdar, Research Scientist at Google Research India, at a virtual event Thursday.</p>
<p>The company said it trained the new model with articles on Wikipedia and texts from a dataset called Common Crawl. It also trained it on transliterated text from, among other sources, Wikipedia (fed through Google&#8217;s existing neural machine translation models). The result is that MuRIL handles Indian languages better than previous, more general language models and can contend with letters and words that have been transliterated &#8212; that is, Google is using the closest corresponding letters of a different alphabet or script.</p>
<p>Talukdar noted that the previous model Google relied on proved unscalable as the company had to build model for each language separately. &#8220;Building such language specific modeling for each and every task is not resource efficient as we often don&#8217;t have training data for tasks like this,&#8221; he said. MuRIL significantly outperforms the earlier model &#8212; by 10% on native text and 27% on transliterated text. MuRIL, which was developed by Google executives in India and is being in use for about a year, is now open source.</p>

<p>One of the many tasks MuRIL is good at, is determining the sentiment of the sentence. For example, “Achha hua account bandh nahi hua” would previously be interpreted as having a negative meaning, but MuRIL correctly identifies this as a positive statement, said Talukdar. Or take the ability to classify a person versus a place: ‘Shirdi ke sai baba’ would previously be interpreted as a place, which is wrong, but MuRIL correctly interprets it as a person.</p>

<p><a href="https://waresix.com/">Waresix</a>, one of Indonesia’s largest logistics startups, has acquired <a href="https://trukita.com/">Trukita</a>, a company that focuses on the &#8220;first mile.&#8221; The term refers to the part of the supply chain where goods are transported from ports to warehouses.</p>
<p>Both Waresix and Trukita operate by connecting businesses to shippers and warehouses, and the acquisition will enable them to lower customer costs. While Waresix&#8217;s platform digitizes all parts of the supply and logistics chain, its current focus is on mid-mile logistics services, or transportation from warehouses to distributors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Trukita has an extended network of over 10,000 trucks, and the combination of the two companies means it is &#8220;now one of the largest logistics technology providers in Indonesia,&#8221; said co-founder and chief executive officer Andree Susanto.</p>

<p>Waresix, which recently announced it <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/indonesian-logistics-tech-startup-waresix-closes-cus100-million-fundraising-301126991.html">raised $100 million</a> in funding over the past year from investors like EV Growth, Jungle Ventures and SoftBank Ventures Asia, works with more than 375 warehouses and 40,000 trucks across Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country. It currently serves about 100 cities.</p>
<p>Indonesia’s geography creates unique challenges for logistics companies, especially those operating outside of major cities. It is an archipelago made up of more than 17,500 islands, of which 6,000 are inhabited. This means supply chains often span ships, trucks and several warehouses before goods make it to their final destination. The high costs of logistics has a sizable impact on Indonesia’s economy and the <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/09/28/govt-to-proceed-with-logistics-system-reform-amid-high-costs.html">government is currently engaged in an initiative </a>to develop more infrastructure, integrate databases and simplify export-import licensing.</p>
<p>Indonesia’s complicated logistics landscape has given rise to startups like Waresix, Kargo and Ritase, which focus on removing middlemen, managing shipments in real-time and using data analytics to uncover inefficiencies in the supply chain.</p>
<p>Trukita was founded in 2017, and its investors include Astra International, EverHaüs and Plug and Play.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">No one likes having to go to the automotive repair shop. There&#8217;s little transparency into what happens after a car is dropped off, invoices are often little more than a series of illegible bullet points, and the ordeal can feel chaotic.</p>
<p><a href="https://autoleap.com/">AutoLeap</a>, a six-month-old, Toronto-based startup that quietly raised $5 million in seed funding in September, thinks its team can figure out how to repair that broken experience by bringing car repair shops into the 21st century at long last. Its big idea is to help such shops organize their operations, schedule jobs, order parts, conduct digital inspections, and invoice customers in a transparent and seamless way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first to try to modernize the car repair process. Among other startups, a five-year-old, Seattle-based outfit, Wrench, has already raised <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/wrench-raises-20m-ratchet-growth-tech-powered-car-repair-platform/">$40 million</a> toward that end, while another entrant, <a href="https://www.repairsmith.com/">RepairSmith</a>, a two-year-old, L.A.-based car repair and maintenance service, is backed by Daimler.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, with a global automotive repair market that&#8217;s currently valued at $700 billion, there&#8217;s clearly room for more than one player and one approach, and AutoLeap has a few things going for it.</p>
<p>For starters, it has an investor base with some useful connections. Threshold Ventures, which led AutoLeap&#8217;s seed round, has ties to the automotive world, including through its bet on the car-selling platform <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shiftcars" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shiftcars">Shift, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2020/10/16/586738.htm">went public</a> in October via a reverse merger.</p>
<p>AutoLeap &#8212; whose other venture investors include Maple VC, Liquid2 Ventures, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/global-founders-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="global-founders-capital">Global Founders Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Codename Ventures &#8212; is also backed by some notable individuals that hold sway in the world that AutoLeap is entering. Among them: Shift cofounder George Arison, former General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner, and former senior Bridgestone exec Ned Aguilar.</p>
<p>More importantly, AutoLeap&#8217;s founders worked together once before to reinvigorate a stodgy business. Before launching AutoLeap, co-CEOs Rameez Ansari and Steve Lau spent four years as the co-CEOs of <a href="https://fieldedge.com/">FieldEdge</a>, a SaaS company that helps contractors to run their small businesses.</p>
<p>They two &#8212; college friends who&#8217;d met at the University of Toronto &#8212; didn&#8217;t start the company. Rather, after Lau nabbed an MBA from Wharton and Ansari nabbed his from Stanford, they joined forces to acquire and grow a neglected business after raising a so-called <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/centers-initiatives/ces/research/search-funds">search fund</a>. (If you aren&#8217;t familiar, it&#8217;s vehicle that&#8217;s backed by individual investors who bet on a team to find a company to buy, run it for some period of time, then sell it for far more money.)</p>
<p>It was a productive experience for all involved. After spending $20 million to acquire FieldEdge, whose software had already been around for 30 years, Lau and Ansari so dramatically improved the company&#8217;s offerings that they were able to charge seven times what the company had previously collected for its products, says Lau. Then they<a href="https://www.adventinternational.com/advent-international-acquires-merges-clearent-fieldedge-create-integrated-payments-leader/"> sold</a> it to the private equity firm Advent in 2018 for &#8220;north of $100 million,&#8221; says Lau.</p>
<p>It was a solid exit. Minus that $20 million investment, the team kept 30% of the remaining proceeds from FieldEdge&#8217;s sale, with the rest going to the search fund&#8217;s investors.</p>
<p>Even so, says Lau, he and Ansari might have kept going if not for rival <a href="https://www.servicetitan.com/">ServiceTitan</a>, which &#8220;went crazy on the fundraising front.&#8221; (The seven-year-old company has raised $400 million altogether from investors.)</p>
<p>Between ServiceTitan&#8217;s daunting war chest and &#8220;given this was a first exit for us,&#8221; Lau says, &#8220;we transitioned out instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, neither Lau nor Ansari wants to repeat the scenario with AutoLeap. Indeed, though Lau says the company is &#8220;heads down&#8221; and &#8220;not in any discussions&#8221; with investors now that it has secured seed funding, one imagines it won&#8217;t take long for that to change.</p>
<p>What investors would be funding essentially is a burgeoning software platform that aims to kill off paper flyers, crumbling fax machines, and sheaves of invoices &#8212; if only it can convince car repair shops to slow down long enough to try its software.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t a no-brainer that they will, admits Lau. &#8220;It&#8217;s a material onboarding effort, because you become the lifeblood of their business.&#8221; The sales process also requires convincing the shops to share their existing data and take the time required to be trained on how to use it.</p>
<p>Lau isn&#8217;t dissuaded, plainly. He says the time to onboard a new customer is one to two weeks and that &#8220;once they start seeing value, they get that &#8216;aha&#8217; type of moment.&#8221; In fact, he says that <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">AutoLeap is already working with a handful of shops, including several in Toronto, one in Las Vegas, and another in Boston.</span></p>
<p>As for its expansion plans, Lau says that some of the company&#8217;s seed funding will go toward digital marketing, but it&#8217;s also relying heavily on word of mouth. It helps, he says, that garages are often clustered in a geographic area, which he believes will enable AutoLeap to spread quickly.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t &#8220;a lot of data&#8221; to support that assumption, offers Lau. But if AutoLeap has its way, there will be soon enough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s embattled coffee delivery startup Luckin has reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay a $180 million penalty to settle charges that it overstated its revenues, expenses, and losses by the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The announcement by the market regulator <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-luckin-coffee-to-pay-180-million-to-settle-accounting-fraud-claims-11608157731">arrived</a> Wednesday evening, months after short-seller Muddy Waters first reported the alleged fraud early this year. In response to the allegations, Luckin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/luckin-coffees-board-initiates-investigation-into-300m-potential-fraud/">said</a> in April it would launch an internal probe. In June, the SEC said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/luckin-coffee-will-unluckinly-delist-from-nasdaq-following-fraud-allegations/">would delist Luckin</a>, and in July, Luckin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/after-grinding-investigation-luckin-coffee-confirms-300-million-revenue-fraud/">admitted</a> it did cook its books.</p>
<p>The fiasco came only a year after Luckin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/chinas-luckin-coffee-raises-up-to-651m-in-upsized-us-ipo/">raised $651 million</a> through its first time sale on Nasdaq. The company was founded in October 2017, making it one of the fastest companies to go from a startup to a public company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which aspired to take a piece of Starbucks&#8217; sizable market share in China, allegedly fabricated more than $300 million in sales between at least April 2019 through January 2020, said the SEC announcement. Certain employees were found attempting to conceal the fraud by inflating the firm&#8217;s expenses by more than $190 million, &#8220;creating a fake operations database, and altering accounting and bank records to reflect the false sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckin neither admitted or denied these claims, which were filed in a court in the Southern District of New York. The settlement is subject to court approval and the transfer of funds to security holders will<span id="textmarker_16" class="textmarker textmarker_16"> need approval by Chinese authorities.</span></p>
<p>In September, China&#8217;s market regulator <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-coffee-investigation-fine/china-fines-luckin-coffee-and-linked-firms-a-total-of-9-million-idUSKCN26D07G">fined Luckin and 45 companies involved in Luckin&#8217;s frauds</a> a total of $9 million after an investigation revealed the coffee company faked its numbers.</p>
<p>Despite the fraudulent scandal, Luckin claims business is still as usual. Operations of the firm and its stores are currently &#8220;stable and normal,&#8221; said the company in a notice on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luckin will continue to cooperate with regulators and prioritize compliance. In the meantime, our management and staff will continue to ensure the firm&#8217;s stable operation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Short-sellers have been going after U.S.-listed Chinese firms this year. A <a href="https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/iq-netflix-of-china-good-luckin/">report</a> from Wolfpack Research accused iQiyi, a major Chinese video streaming service backed by Baidu, of inflating its numbers, a claim that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/14/iqiyi-sec-investigation-into-fraud-allegations-shares-plunge.html">triggered an SEC probe</a>. GSX Techedu, a Chinese after-school tutoring company, was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-probes-chinas-gsx-techedu-after-short-sellers-pleas-11599046396">under a similar SEC investigation</a> after short-seller Citron Research said the company fabricated sales numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there are challenges in our ability to effectively hold foreign issuers and their officers and directors accountable to the same extent as U.S. issuers and persons, we will continue to use all our available resources to protect investors when foreign issuers violate the federal securities laws,&#8221; said Stephanie Avakian, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, in the regulator&#8217;s announcement on Luckin.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French fintech startup <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> has extended its Series B round. <a href="https://accel.com">Accel</a> is leading the extension with all major existing shareholders also participating. Lydia first raised $45 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mobile-payment-app-lydia-raises-45-million-round-led-by-tencent/">in January 2020</a> — Tencent led that investment. The startup is now raising another $86 million, which means that Lydia has raised $131 million in total as part of its Series B round.</p>
<p>While <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lydia" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lydia">Lydia <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> wouldn’t discuss the valuation of the round, its co-founder and CEO Cyril Chiche gave me a hint. “The value of the company has really significantly increased between the two parts of the B round,” he told me.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Amit Jhawar is heading this investment for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/accel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="accel">Accel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. He joined Accel as a venture partner <a href="https://accel.com/noteworthy/welcoming-amit-jhawar-to-accel-as-a-venture-partner">in July</a> and he’s going to join Lydia’s board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jhawar joined payments company Braintree in 2011 as COO and CFO. Shortly after, Braintree acquired peer-to-peer payment app Venmo. “When we acquired Venmo it was only 15 people. They had just released their mobile app in April of 2012,” Jhawar told me in a phone interview.</p>
<p>PayPal later acquired Braintree and Venmo — Jhawar stuck around until early 2020 to scale Venmo to the huge fintech consumer app that 52 million people use in the U.S. Jhawar believes that peer-to-peer payments represent the beginning of a long-term consumer relationship.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mobile payment app Lydia raises $45 million round led by Tencent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/mobile-payment-app-lydia-raises-45-million-round-led-by-tencent/embed/#?secret=llx2VwNqiO" data-secret="llx2VwNqiO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“You know that P2P is successful when they leave money in their account because they’re going to come back,” he said.</p>
<p>Back in 2014, when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/24/lydia-is-a-fee-free-payment-app-thats-like-venmo-for-france/">I first covered Lydia</a>, I called it the Venmo for France — they had only raised €600,000 back then. It seems like Jhawar agrees with that take. Since then, Lydia has grown quite a lot and has expanded beyond peer-to-peer payments in various ways.</p>
<p>With Lydia, you can send money to another user in just a few seconds. You don’t have to enter an account number in your banking app — as long as you know their phone number, they’ll receive your payment.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kfbluqjU39"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/lydia-partners-with-tink-to-improve-open-banking-features/">Lydia partners with Tink to improve open banking features</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lydia partners with Tink to improve open banking features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/lydia-partners-with-tink-to-improve-open-banking-features/embed/#?secret=kfbluqjU39" data-secret="kfbluqjU39" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>If you have money in your account, you can choose to spend it directly using a Visa debit card. Lydia lets you generate a virtual card that works with Apple Pay and Google Pay — you can also order a plastic card.</p>
<p>Lydia also supports direct deposit as you get your own IBAN in the app. You can also create money pots and send a link to other users, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/lydia-partners-with-tink-to-improve-open-banking-features/">view your bank accounts</a> in Lydia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/lydia-lets-you-donate-to-hospitals-and-charities/">donate</a> money to hospitals and charities, get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/05/lydia-expands-credit-offering-in-partnership-with-younited-credit/">a credit line</a>, etc.</p>
<p>But there’s one killer feature that stands out over the rest. Bank accounts tend to be monolithic and don’t reflect how you use money. “If you look at banks today, they call the main account a checking account. It’s outdated by design,” CEO Cyril Chiche said.</p>
<p>Lydia has created flexible sub-accounts that you can use in many different ways. You can create a second sub-account and set some money aside for your bills. You can create a third one and share it with a few friends because you’re going on a vacation together.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Hs3ZOQJkiI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/05/lydia-expands-credit-offering-in-partnership-with-younited-credit/">Lydia expands credit offering in partnership with Younited Credit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lydia expands credit offering in partnership with Younited Credit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/05/lydia-expands-credit-offering-in-partnership-with-younited-credit/embed/#?secret=Hs3ZOQJkiI" data-secret="Hs3ZOQJkiI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>You can move money from one account to another by swiping your finger across the account grid. As you can have multiple contributors and you can change the account associated with your debit card, it means that money flows more naturally. It feels like using a messaging app, not a financial app.</p>
<p>And it’s been working well in France. The company now has more than 4 million users. Transactions have doubled over the past year, which means that usage is accelerating.</p>
<p>“Lydia has the largest P2P network in Europe outside of PayPal and has the potential to grow all across Europe with a mobile-first, customer-focused solution. This will bring demand for incremental consumer financial products and high merchant interest to accept the payment,” Jhawar told me in an email.</p>
<p>And 2020 has been a busy year for Lydia. The company has just released a complete redesign to better position the app as a super app for financial services. All the interactions and all the main tabs have been changed.</p>
<p>Lydia also re-launched its premium offering with two new premium plans that offer you higher limits over the free plan and an insurance package for the most expensive offer. Those plans are more in line with what the app offers today and should contribute to the company’s bottom line. “The next step is bringing Lydia to profitability and it’s something that has always been important for us,” Chiche said in a recent interview.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SGVTghCPsA"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/lydia-lets-you-donate-to-hospitals-and-charities/">Lydia lets you donate to hospitals and charities</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lydia lets you donate to hospitals and charities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/lydia-lets-you-donate-to-hospitals-and-charities/embed/#?secret=SGVTghCPsA" data-secret="SGVTghCPsA" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Behind the scenes, Lydia has also upgraded many core features, such as migrating cards to a new infrastructure, adding alerts to account aggregation, supporting instant SEPA transfers to bank accounts, etc.</p>
<p>In 2021, the company plans to build on top of that new foundation with more financial products. “We’re going to try every single product — credit, savings, investment,” Chiche said.</p>
<p>The company is also slowly expanding to more countries. But it wants to offer a product that feels like a local product with a local card and a local IBAN to increase acceptance rates. Lydia is starting with Portugal.</p>

This is your Daily Crunch for December 16, 2020.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Facebook escalates Apple criticism</strong></p>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">took a big swing</a> at Apple&#8217;s upcoming app tracking restrictions today with full-page ads in the print editions of The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post that argued the social networking giant is &#8220;standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, while Facebook will obviously be affected by Apple&#8217;s change (apps will have to ask users for permission before it can track their IDFA identifier, which will presumably lead to a steep drop in ad targeting), the company said that small businesses relying on targeted ad campaigns will be hurt even more.</p>
<p>And while the two campaigns are very different, it&#8217;s worth noting that another initiative against Apple is also gaining steam, with major U.S. news publishers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/major-u-s-news-publishers-join-the-coalition-for-app-fairness-advocacy-group-to-fight-the-apple-tax/">joining the Coalition for App Fairness</a>, a group fighting app store fees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It took an unusually long time, but <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hbo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hbo">HBO <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Max is set to launch on Roku devices tomorrow.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roku" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roku">Roku <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> users make up a <a href="https://www.whattowatch.com/news/rokus-earnings">massive </a>chunk of the cord-cutting market, so the absence of an HBO Max app for Roku nearly seven months after the service launched was pretty glaring. We&#8217;d been wondering where the Max app was for months, its launch seemingly tied up over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/hbo-max-reached-4-1m-subscribers-in-first-month-despite-lack-of-distribution-on-roku-and-fire-tv/">matter of where and how customers could subscribe</a>.</p>
<p>With &#8220;Wonder Woman 1984&#8221; set to debut on Max in just a few weeks, one can assume there was tremendous pressure all around to get the deal done. As part of the deal, Roku users will be able to sign up for HBO Max using Roku&#8217;s built-in payment system, Roku Pay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This news comes about a month after HBO Max filled a similar gap by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/hbo-max-arrives-on-amazon-fire-tv-devices/">finally launching on Amazon Fire devices</a>, and days after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/warner-bros-hbo-max-simultaneous-release/">announcement of a mega deal</a> that will see all 2021 Warner Bros. films launch on HBO Max on the same day they hit theaters.</p>
<p>With this launch, HBO Max will have most of the key bases covered, with support on iOS, Android, Chromecast, Roku, Amazon&#8217;s Fire devices, PC/Mac and all of the modern gaming consoles minus the Switch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[An IPO? A shoe-reselling marketplace? Sure! At the numbers we know about it, why not?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, TechCrunch reported that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/stockx-raises-275m-series-e-valuing-the-retailer-at-2-8b/">consumer reseller marketplace StockX</a> raised $275 million at a valuation of approximately $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>Selling a tenth of your company for north of a quarter-billion may be somewhat common among late-stage software startups with tremendous growth, but one known for its market share in the sneaker resale niche? Don&#8217;t laugh, the round actually makes pretty OK sense. And given the growth that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stockx" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stockx">StockX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has managed, it could have a path to the public markets in under a year.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Don&#8217;t laugh, the round actually makes pretty OK sense.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In our piece covering the funding round, <a href="https://twitter.com/mjburnsy?lang=en">Matt Burns</a> wrote that StockX saw its nondomestic sales rise 260% in Q3 compared to the year-ago period, recording half of its 13 million transactions in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t really enough to get my head around the round, so I went hunting. Here&#8217;s a grip of other, dated growth metrics that help us put the new funding into proper context:</p>
<ul>
<li> In mid-2019, when StockX became a unicorn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/technology/trading-sneakers-stockx.html">after raising $110 million</a>, it reported $100 million or more in monthly gross merchandise volume. It had around 800 employees at the time.</li>
<li>As part of that deal, a former eBay exec and former NYSE executive vice president of the New York Stock Exchange took over as CEO and took a board seat. The man in question, Scott Cutler, remains the company&#8217;s chief executive.</li>
<li>StockX claimed more than $1 billion in gross merchandise volume <a href="https://stockx.com/news/year-in-review-2019/">in 2019</a> (the company supports streetwear and luxury resales as well as sneakers). The company closed out 2019 with around 1,000 employees.</li>
<li>In mid-2020, StockX released <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stockx-releases-mid-year-marketplace-momentum-report-pointing-to-accelerated-growth-amidst-pandemic-surpasses-2-5-billion-in-gross-merchandise-value-301092276.html">a midyear report</a> &#8212; née &#8220;corporate brag sheet&#8221; &#8212; saying that it had surpassed $2.5 billion in gross merchandise volume, and 10 million trades, half of which had been recorded in the last year.</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand if those numbers are impressive or not, we&#8217;ll need to convert gross merchandise result into revenue. So, we&#8217;ll need to better understand StockX&#8217;s fee structure.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot can change in a year. Especially this year. For <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boston-dynamics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boston-dynamics">Boston Dynamics, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the past 12 months have brought a number of radical changes traditionally not seen at 30-year-old businesses of its size. It’s a list that includes the first new CEO in the company’s history, wide availability of its first commercial product and, most recently, being acquired by its third owner in seven years.</p>
<p>Of course, no one has ever accused Boston Dynamics of being traditional.</p>
<p>Last week, the Waltham, Massachusetts-based robotics pioneer confirmed earlier rumors that it was being acquired by Hyundai. The South Korean tech giant will be taking an 80% stake in the company, leaving the other 20% or so to its former owner, Softbank Group. The deal, which values the 300-person company at $1.1 billion, is expected to close next June.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hyundai buys controlling interest in Boston Dynamics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/hyundai-buys-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics/embed/#?secret=3XIIOCW6Kd" data-secret="3XIIOCW6Kd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We grew from 100 people to 300 people under SoftBank,” CEO Robert Playter tells TechCrunch. “That took investment. It took encouragement from them to launch a product, launch the products that we had in mind. It was critical. So our mission, which they started us down the path of, is to launch multiple robot products that include mobility, manipulation and vision. And they really gave us power and afterburners to pursue that mission.”</p>
<p>Playter, a longtime Boston Dynamics employee, waves away unfavorable optics around the company’s quick transitions between owners. Each owner served its function for the company’s bottom line &#8212; Google offered resources for exploration, SoftBank compelled it to productize and Hyundai will deliver the sort of engineering and manufacturing know-how required to scale up its products.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2064174" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2064174" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2064174" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BOSTON-DYNAMICS-ARM-CLIP-CONSOLIDATED.2020-10-21-13_04_24.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2064174" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boston Dynamics</p></div></p>
<p>“Ultimately [SoftBank is] an investment company, and we always expected there to be some kind of an exit,” says Playter. “The question was always when, and when is the right timing? So this isn&#8217;t really a surprise to us. And I think they saw and we saw that the time was right as our product launch grew to get a different kind of partner.”</p>
<p>The executive adds that the nature of the company’s interactions with SoftBank were ultimately limited under regulatory restrictions placed on the acquisition by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). “Getting through CFIUS will be a closing condition on the Hyundai deal,” he explains.</p>
<p>While SoftBank’s ownership of the company was seen as, at very least, aggressively nudging the company in the direction of commercialization after decades of operating as a research firm, the executive tells TechCrunch that Hyundai largely approved of the company’s existing roadmap. The past two years have certainly brought some profound changes for the company, but Boston Dynamics is still a fairly lean organization, and as such is designed to take a measured approach to the market.</p>

<p>Of the 300 or so employees, between 100 to 120 are currently focused on its first commercial product, Spot. Many of the company’s recent hires are focused on areas like sales, customer service and quality control &#8212; relatively unfamiliar terrain for an organization that went more than a quarter-century without releasing its first product. The team focused on its logistics robot, Handle, is significantly smaller, but growing, and will “match or exceed Spot over the course of the next year,” he adds. Handle is, after all, Boston Dynamics’ commercial launch. The company is set to unveil the commercialized version of the box-lifting machine in April. Pilot programs similar to those offered for Spot will follow and sales of the product will start at some point the following year.</p>
<p>The company has already begun to test “proof of concept” models with select partners in real-world warehouses. “These are systems for development that we&#8217;re taking onto customer sites to do proof of concept tests,” says Playter. “We&#8217;re taking learnings from that to improve the design. In parallel work, we&#8217;re designing the for-manufacture version of that robot right now. And first versions of that new generation will come online next summer.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1885677" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/atlas-gymnastics-boston-dynamics.gif" alt="atlas gymnastics boston dynamics" width="960" height="533" /></p>
<p>Fulfilment and logistics have already been a hot category for robotics for a number of years, but interest has only grown amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Handle represents a decidedly different to-market approach than Spot, in that respect. A large part of the quadrupedal robot’s pilot program was working with customers and partners to determine which categories had the highest demand for the advanced robotics technology. Demand for Spot hasn’t been huge, but it’s been steady, with the company selling more than 400 units in the first 15 months.</p>
<p>In-demand applications include deployment in dangerous scenarios like a BP oil rig and a National Grid electric plant. Other more surprising use cases have arisen, as well. Late last year, the ACLU raised concern around video of a Spot robot featured in police training drills, which debuted at our Robotics event back in April. This October, a Spot was seen at a crime scene in Brooklyn. Playter confirmed that the NYPD is one of the company’s customers.</p>
<p>“They have a Spot and were using it, I think, to maintain a safe standoff distance when somebody (a potentially armed suspect) was barricading themselves,” he explains. “So I think getting a camera in and potentially communicating, de-escalating a potentially dangerous situation was the goal there.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="534GD0MLv6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/boston-dynamics-appoints-its-first-ever-new-ceo/">Boston Dynamics appoints its first-ever new CEO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Boston Dynamics appoints its first-ever new CEO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/boston-dynamics-appoints-its-first-ever-new-ceo/embed/#?secret=534GD0MLv6" data-secret="534GD0MLv6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“One of the intended purposes of Spot is to enhance the safety of our customers by removing or providing the opportunity to remove a person from a dangerous environment,” Playter adds. “And that includes public safety officials like the police. And in particular, the Massachusetts State Police have been interested in using Spot in a classic mobile robot application, investigating suspicious packages or potential bombs. So I think these are great applications of robotics and something that we support.”</p>
<p>The next year will also see Boston Dynamics continuing to expand Spot’s available markets. Under the Hyundai banner, the company will likely continue the pace of releases set by Spot and Handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think something like a robot every couple of years is a pace that we could manage. From clean sheet, we can build a new robot in under a year,&#8221; says Playter. “And then you have to go through an iterative process of refining that concept and starting to understand market fit. And so I would look to, I want to stabilize the launch of Spot. There&#8217;s already improvements to Spot that we want to be thinking about. So I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;re going to go build the next generation of Spot or maybe build the next robot for the next market. And that remains to be seen. We don&#8217;t quite have the team that&#8217;s big enough to do that just yet.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1457806" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/boston-dynamics-feb-2017.gif" alt="" width="850" height="408" /></p>
<p>The company’s research wing, which focuses on even more bleeding-edge robots like the humanoid Atlas, will also continue under Hyundai’s watch. The company stopped accepting new defense contracts in 2014, shortly after the Google acquisition, but research continues to be a key part of Boston Dynamics’ work.</p>
<p>“[W]e&#8217;re developing our own R&amp;D work with Atlas internally,” Playter says. “And so we still use that as a platform to build both advanced hardware and software. We have some exciting things that I think will come out in the near future. We&#8217;re going to show you what we&#8217;ve been up to, probably in the classic Boston Dynamics home grown video way. I don&#8217;t think we have a deadline on when that&#8217;s going to come out, but there&#8217;s something in the oven.”</p>
<p>Integrating some of Boston Dynamics’ more advanced research into far out Hyundai concepts like the recently announced Ultimate Mobility Vehicle could also be a good fit. “We think the combination of wheels on legs is really interesting. If you recall, we built the first version of Handle with wheels and legs. And so there&#8217;s some real synergy there, I think. I think they&#8217;re really going to be able to build those vehicles.”</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> SVP of Devices &amp; Services David Limp joined us at TC Sessions: Space today, and he shared some new details about the company&#8217;s Project Kuiper broadband satellite constellation. Limp shared more details on the technical design challenges that the Kuiper team solved with its revolutionary customer terminal, but he also shared more info on the company&#8217;s plans around launching its constellation, which will number 3,236 per the current plan approved by the FCC.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re launch agnostic&#8221; Limp said. &#8220;If you know somebody who has a rocket out there, give us a call. &#8220;One of the reasons we thought the time was right to do a constellation now is because of some of the dynamics happening in the launch industry. Every day, we see a new demonstration of reusability, every day we see new demonstrations of breakthroughs in better engines, whether that&#8217;s Raptor [<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> engine] or BE-4 [Blue Origin&#8217;s].&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of the FCC&#8217;s approval for Amazon&#8217;s constellation requires it to send up around half of its planned total constellation within the next six years, which is a significant volume and will require an aggressive launch pace to achieve. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Starlink, for context, has launched 16 batches of 60 satellites each for its network, with 14 of those happening in 2020 alone. In order to achieve that pace, Limp said that while he hopes Blue Origin (the Jeff Bezos-owned private rocket launch company) can provide some of its launch capacity, they will be looking elsewhere for rides to space as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have to put 3,200-plus things into space, you will need lots of launch capacity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our hope is that it&#8217;s not just one provider, that there will be multiple providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Depending on the final Project Kuiper satellite spec, this could be a huge opportunity for new small satellite launchers coming on board, including companies like Astra, Relativity Space and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/virgin-orbit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="virgin-orbit">Virgin Orbit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> who spoke earlier today at the event on the progress their launch companies are making. It could also be a windfall for existing providers like Rocket Lab &#8212; and even potentially SpaceX. In response to a separate question, Limp noted that he doesn&#8217;t believe Project Kuiper is in direct competition with SpaceX&#8217;s Starlink, since there&#8217;s such a broad addressable market when it comes to connectivity for unserved and underserved customers globally.</p>

<p>Twitter will require users who tweet something that falls in one of those categories to delete the content before being allowed to tweet again. Addressing vaccine misinformation that doesn&#8217;t meet the threshold for removal, Twitter says that it will begin placing warning labels on &#8220;unsubstantiated rumors, disputed claims, as well as incomplete or out-of-context information about vaccines&#8221; starting in early 2021. Those tweets may also be hidden, have their engagement limited and be accompanied by public health information labels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said that it will prioritize removing misinformation with the greatest potential to do harm, and we&#8217;ve asked Twitter if that decision is made based on how much exposure a tweet is getting or the nature of its content. The new policies will be enforced through a hybrid approach of automation and human moderation.</p>
<p>Early in the pandemic, Twitter created a set of new content policies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/">specific to COVID-19 misinformation</a>, which was just beginning to take off. While bogus and potentially harmful misinformation about how the virus was transmitted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/10/coronavirus-5g-covid-19-conspiracy-theory-misinformation/">were the big worries then</a>, the company&#8217;s new policy update will address concerns that online misinformation might lead a significant portion of the population to refuse to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Having granular misinformation policies on the books is useful for future enforcement, but new rules aren&#8217;t worth anything if they aren&#8217;t enforced. We&#8217;ll be following misinformation around the COVID-19 vaccine as it becomes more widely available and keeping an eye out for how Twitter implements its latest effort to give conspiracies less oxygen on the platform.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In November, Californians voted to pass <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/11/17/by-passing-proposition-24-california-voters-up-the-ante-on-federal-privacy-law/">Proposition 24</a>, a ballot measure that imposes new regulations on the collection of data by businesses. As part of the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), individuals will now have the right to opt out of the sharing and sale of their personal information, while companies must “reasonably” minimize data collection to protect user privacy.</p>
<p>For companies like Apple, Facebook, Uber and Google, all of which are headquartered in California, these new requirements may seem like a limitation on their existing data collection capabilities.</p>
<p>Looking more closely, it’s a nuanced story: By not only meeting the demands of these new regulations but exceeding them, companies have an opportunity to differentiate themselves from competitors to grow their bottom line, thanks to new technologies that put data privacy in the hands of consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Take Apple, the world’s most valuable tech company, as an example. When Google and Facebook — two of Apple’s largest competitors — were under fire for exploiting customer data, CEO Tim Cook saw an opportunity to turn privacy into a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>The tech giant rolled out a suite of new privacy-maximizing features, including a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/">Sign In With Apple</a> feature that allows users to securely log in to apps without sharing personal information with the apps’ developers. More recently, the company updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">privacy page</a> to better showcase how its flagship apps are designed with privacy in mind.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			By not only meeting the demands of these new regulations but exceeding them, companies have an opportunity to differentiate themselves from their competition.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>This doubling down on privacy took center stage in the company’s marketing campaigns, too, with “Privacy Matters” becoming the central message of its prime-time air spots and its 10,000+ billboards around the world.</p>
<p>And of course, the company could hardly resist taking the occasional jab at its data-hungry competitors:</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer — if our customer was our product,&#8221; said Cook in an <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/6/17197754/watch-apple-ceo-tim-cook-msnbc">interview with MSNBC</a>. &#8220;We’ve elected not to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple’s commitment to privacy not only puts them in a stronger position to comply with new CPRA regulations. It also sends a strong message to an industry that has profited off of customer data, and an even stronger message to consumers: It’s time to respect personal data.</p>
<h2>The growing demand for privacy</h2>
<p>The prioritization of consumer data privacy comes out of a need to address growing consumer concerns, which have consistently made headlines in recent years. Attention-grabbing stories such as the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, as well as major breaches at companies such as <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement">Equifax</a>, have left consumers wondering whom they can trust and how they can protect themselves. And the research is pretty conclusive — consumers want more out of their businesses and governments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 52% of consumers feel like they can trust businesses, and only 41% worldwide trust their governments (<a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/01/16/edelman-trust-barometer-reveals-lowest-levels-trust">Edelman</a>).</li>
<li>85% of consumers believe businesses should be doing more to actively protect their data (<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-04-15-New-Survey-Finds-Deep-Consumer-Anxiety-over-Data-Privacy-and-Security">IBM</a>).</li>
<li>61% of consumers say their fears of having personal data compromised have increased in the last two years (<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2018/06/consumer-data-privacy-research.html">Salesforce</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s hard to say exactly how this trust crisis will manifest in the global economy, but we’ve already seen several large boycotts, like the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/facebook/2018/09/05/it-turns-out-lots-of-people-actually-did-deletefacebook/">#DeleteFacebook</a> movement, and a staggering <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2018-04-15-New-Survey-Finds-Deep-Consumer-Anxiety-over-Data-Privacy-and-Security">75% of consumers</a> who say they won’t purchase from a company they don’t trust with their data.</p>
<p>And it’s not just Big Tech. From loyalty programs and inventory planning to smart cities and election advertising, it’s hard to overestimate the appetite — and effect — of using data to optimize processes and drive behavioral change.</p>
<p>As we look toward a new data-driven decade, however, we’re starting to realize the cost of this big data arms race: Consumers have lost trust in both the private and public sectors.</p>
<p>Private sector initiatives like Apple’s strengthened commitment to privacy, alongside public policy legislation like the CPRA, have the potential to not only build back consumer trust but to go even further beyond the minimum requirements. Thanks to new technologies like <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/inevitable-return-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a>, companies can transform their data privacy policies, while cutting costs, reducing fraud and improving customer experiences.</p>
<h2>The value of SSI</h2>
<p>Self-sovereign identity (or SSI) leverages a thin layer of distributed ledger technology and a dose of very advanced cryptography to enable companies to prove the identities of their customers, without putting privacy at risk.</p>
<p>At its simplest, SSI is a way of giving consumers more control over their personal information. It offers a way for consumers to digitally store and manage personal information (in the form of <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/gentle-introduction-verifiable-credentials/"> verifiable credentials</a>) that are issued and signed by a trusted authority (like a government, bank or university) in a way that can never be altered, embellished or manipulated. Consumers can then share this information when, where and with whom they wish as a way of proving things about themselves.</p>
<p>While sharing digital records online is nothing new, SSI changes the game in two fundamental ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Organizations can capture the required data, without overcollection. Unlike the physical credentials we carry in our wallets, like driver’s licenses and insurance cards, a digital verifiable credential can be divided into individual attributes, which can be shared separately.</li>
</ol>
<p>The classic example is walking into a bar and showing the bouncer your driver’s license to verify that you are of legal age. The card reveals the necessary data, but it also includes information that the bar has no business knowing — such as your name and address. With verifiable credentials, we can share proof of age without revealing anything else.</p>
<p>For sensitive cases, self-sovereign identity even allows us to cryptographically prove something about ourselves without revealing the actual data. In this case, we could provide a yes/no answer to whether we are of a legal age, without revealing our date of birth.</p>
<p>For individuals, data minimization represents a great stride forward in privacy. For organizations, it’s a way of avoiding the massive liability of storing and securing excess personally identifiable information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Correlation becomes much, much harder. While there are those who say privacy is a myth and our data will all be correlated anyway, self-sovereign identity protects us against many of the leading concerns with other digital identity solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if we look at other tools that give us some level of data portability, like single-sign-on, there is always a concern that a single player in the middle can track what we do online. There’s a reason those Facebook ads are eerily relevant: They know every site and app we have signed into using our Facebook profile.</p>
<p>With SSI, there’s no one player or centralized registry in the middle. Verifiers (those requesting an identity verification) can verify the authenticity cryptographically, meaning they don’t have to “phone home” to the original credential issuer and the credential issuer has no way of knowing when, where or to whom a credential was shared. No correlatable signatures are shared, and your digital identity is truly under your control and for your eyes only.</p>
<p>As a result, the consumer benefits from better privacy and security, while businesses benefit from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced fraud, with better, more accurate data verification at the time of account creation.</li>
<li>Reduced friction, with a dramatically faster sign-up process.</li>
<li>Reduced costs, both from time savings and from smarter KYC compliance (which normally costs large banks $500 million+ each year).</li>
<li>Increased efficiency, with less back-and-forth verifying third-party data.</li>
<li>Better customer experiences, with the ability to create a personalized, omnichannel customer experience without data harvesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it’s not science fiction, either. Several major governments, businesses and NGOs have already launched self-sovereign solutions. These include financial institutions like<a href="https://www.culedger.com/2019/11/culedger-completes-successful-pilot-program-of-mycuid-in-three-u-s-credit-unions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.culedger.com/2019/11/culedger-completes-successful-pilot-program-of-mycuid-in-three-u-s-credit-unions/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608228216191000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQv0di96-a7QwLmUef8suYqh0eQA"> UNIFY, Desert Financial and TruWest</a>, healthcare organizations like <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/can-blockchain-heal-ails-healthcare-lumedic-launches-new-quest-digital-identity-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.geekwire.com/2020/can-blockchain-heal-ails-healthcare-lumedic-launches-new-quest-digital-identity-standards/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608228216191000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEtxsfq0S5ZO7E77fqT-ScVE0toXQ">Providence Health</a> and the NHS, and telecom and travel giants like<a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/koreas-lg-cns-partners-with-evernym-for-decentralized-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ledgerinsights.com/koreas-lg-cns-partners-with-evernym-for-decentralized-identity/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1608228216191000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEg_yxFlnimWxbTVzifYaQ7AcZGg"> LG</a> and the International Air Transport Association.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how soon the technology will become ubiquitous, but it is clear that privacy is quickly emerging as the next competitive battleground. Newly passed regulations like CPRA codify the measures companies need to take, but it’s consumer expectations that will drive long-term shifts within the companies themselves.</p>
<p>For those ahead of the curve, there will be significant cost savings and growth — especially as customers start to shift their loyalty toward those businesses that respect and protect their privacy. For everyone else, it will be a major wake-up call as consumers demand to take back their data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few young software companies have had as great a year as San Diego-based <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/clickup" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="clickup">ClickUp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. The company, which makes business productivity tools for task management, goals and docs, raised its first bit of outside funding in mid-2020.</p>
<p>Just six months later, it has reached a $1 billion valuation after doubling its customer base and revenue increased ninefold as businesses embraced remote work.</p>
<p>The new funding and valuation after just a few months of hefty growth show just how closely investors are watching the productivity software space. I spoke with ClickUp CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/zeb-brian-evans" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="zeb-brian-evans">Zeb Evans <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> yesterday to get his insights on the challenges of hypergrowth and why it made sense to say &#8220;yes&#8221; to the check.</p>
<p><em>This interview has edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TechCrunch: This has been an awfully busy year for your team. What&#8217;s happened since we talked about your Series A?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zeb Evans:</strong> The last time we chatted with you, we were at an inflection point where we had seen a lot of growth pre-COVID and then post-COVID we saw that growth continue. So we just really kept up those growth rates and really increased in some areas. Last time we chatted we had about 100,000 teams and now we&#8217;re over double that with over 200,000 teams that use our software. I think we were at about a million users and now we&#8217;re well over two million users that use the product as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087772" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087772" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2087772 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zebevans_headshot.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zebevans_headshot.jpg 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zebevans_headshot.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zebevans_headshot.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zebevans_headshot.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zebevans_headshot.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zebevans_headshot.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/zebevans_headshot.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087772" class="wp-caption-text">CEO Zeb Evans. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> ClickUp</p></div></p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s interesting, so it sounds like you&#8217;ve found a sweet spot in terms of team size?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, our number of users per team ends up being around 10 people or a little bit more than that. And that&#8217;s really stayed true from six months ago to today.</p>
<p><strong><em>How has your own team&#8217;s size changed?</em></strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re right around 200 people right now, so we&#8217;ve definitely more than doubled since the last time that we talked, and we&#8217;re going to double again hopefully in the next quarter so we&#8217;ve got an aggressive hiring plan to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Cool, so you&#8217;ve doubled your user base in six months as well as your team. How has your team adjusted to scaling so quickly?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good question. I think that the biggest thing that we&#8217;ve always focused on is shipping a new version of ClickUp every week. That is our differentiation. We&#8217;ve kind of created these iterative cycles called natural product market fit and it&#8217;s been hard to keep up with that. I mean, we&#8217;ve done it but as you scale, you know you have many more users and more considerations to take into every feature that you change and feature that you develop.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s been like the biggest thing we&#8217;ve been focused on and listening to that community that that is ever-growing every week. Obviously hiring is always top of mind also, and we haven&#8217;t done that as fast as we&#8217;d like to. But we&#8217;re making improvements there and we&#8217;re getting there.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of startups raised opportunistic rounds during what&#8217;s seemed to be a very hot market, at what point did you think that it might make sense to raise even more money after closing that Series A?</strong></p>
<p>So, our Series A was our first outside capital and we didn&#8217;t really know what that would do at the time. What we saw when we raised that fund was that we were able to really accelerate our vision and our product. We&#8217;ve used these resources very efficiently and we saw great unit economics come out of that. And also as you mentioned, it&#8217;s certainly a good time and a great market to be in — the productivity market is just the hottest right now. So it was kind of a trifecta of that but the real reason to raise was certainly to be able to continue that product growth and the acceleration of scaling that comes with raising money.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
