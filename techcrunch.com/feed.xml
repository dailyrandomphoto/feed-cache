										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year has been one of financial hardship for billions, and among the specific hardships is the elementary one of paying for utilities, taxes, and other government fees — the systems for which are rarely set up for easy or flexible payment. <a href="https://home.promise-pay.com/">Promise</a> aims to change that by integrating with official payment systems and offering more forgiving terms for fees and debts people can&#8217;t handle all at once, and has raised $20M to do so.</p>
<p>When every penny is going towards rent and food, it can be hard to muster the cash to pay an irregular bill like water or electricity. They&#8217;re less to be shut off on short notice than a mobile plan, so it&#8217;s safer to kick the can down the road&#8230; until a few  bills add up and suddenly a family is looking at hundreds of dollars of unpaid bills and no way to split them up or pay over time. Same with tickets and other fees and fines.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder of Promise, Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins, explained that this (among other places) is where current systems fall down. Unlike buying a TV or piece of furniture, where payment plans may be offered in a single click during online checkout, there frequently is no such option for municipal ticket payment sites or utilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have found that people struggling to pay their bills want to pay and will pay at extremely high rates if you offer them reminders, accessible payment options and flexibility. The systems are the problem — they are not designed for people who don’t always have a surplus of money in their bank accounts,&#8221; she told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;They assume for example that if someone makes their first payment at 10 PM on the 15th, they will have the same amount of money the next month on the 15th at 10 PM,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;These systems do not recognize that most people are struggling with their basic needs. Payments may need to be weekly or split up into multiple payment types.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even those that do offer plans still see many failures to pay, due at least partly to a lack of flexibility on their part, said Ellis-Lamkins — failure to make a payment can lead to the whole plan being cancelled. Furthermore, it may be difficult to get enrolled in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some cities offer payment plans but you have to go in person to sign up, complete a multiple page form, show proof of income, and meet restrictive criteria,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have been able to work with our partners to use self-certification to ease the process as opposed to providing tax returns or other documentation. Currently, we have over a 90 percent repayment rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Promise acts as a sort of middleman, integrating lightly with the agency or utility, which in turn makes anyone owing money aware of the possibility of the different payment system. It&#8217;s similar to how you might see various payment options, including installments, when making a purchase at an online shop.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115397" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115397" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2115397" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png" alt="Mobile and computer screens showing payment interfaces with optiosn to pay over time." width="1024" height="654" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png 1764w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=1536,980 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/promise-pay.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2115397" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Promise</p></div></p>
<p>The user enrolls in a payment plan (the service is mobile-friendly since that&#8217;s the only form of internet many people have) and Promise handles that end of it, with reminders, receipts, and processing, passing on the money to the agency as it comes in — the company doesn&#8217;t cover the cost up front and collect on its own terms. Essentially it&#8217;s a bolt-on flexible payment mechanism that specializes in government agencies and other public-facing fee collectors.</p>
<p>Promise makes money by subscription fees (i.e. SaaS) and/or through transaction fees, whichever makes more sense for the given customer. As you might imagine, it makes more sense for a utility to pay a couple bucks to be more sure of collecting $500, than to take its chance on getting none of that $500, or having to resort to more heavyhanded and expensive debt collection methods.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is not a big problem (and consequently not a big market), Ellis-Lamkins noted a recent study from the California Water Boards showing that there are 1.6 million people with a total of $1 billion in water debt in the state — one in eight households is in arrears to an average of $500.</p>
<p>Those numbers are likely worse than normal given the immense financial pressure that the pandemic has placed on nearly all households — but like payment plans in other circumstances, households of many incomes and types find their own reason to take advantage of such systems. And pretty much anyone who&#8217;s had to deal with an obtusely designed utility payment site would welcome an alternative.</p>
<p>The new round brings the company&#8217;s total raised to over $30M, counting $10M it raised immediately after leaving Y Combinator in 2018. The funding comes from existing investors Kapor capital, XYZ, Bronze, First Round, YC, Village, and others.</p>

<p>This feels even more important now after the absolute disaster that was 2020. Consumers and clients alike just want to be able to count on brands and not stress over whether they’re making the right decision.</p>
<p>Marketers seem to know this. When we teamed up with Semrush to <a href="https://blog.frac.tl/2021-data-backed-digital-marketing-predictions">explore keyword search data in 2020 related to marketing goals</a>, brand awareness and authority showed steady upward trends.</p>

<p>If you’re one of these marketers, I have some strategies you can use to improve your brand’s authority this year. It can’t happen overnight, but you can start implementing these strategies now to see results over time.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			I have some strategies you can use to improve your brand’s authority this year.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Strategy #1: Get media coverage</h2>
<p>Media coverage can build the authority of your brand in a few ways.</p>
<p>For one, it’s hard for people to trust you if they don’t know you exist. Of course, you can pay for ads or kill it on social to get your name out there, but media coverage has other benefits, as well.</p>
<p>When reputable publications and websites reference your brand and link to your site, they’re sending a signal that they trust what you have to say. It’s third-party confirmation that you know what you’re talking about and/or have something to offer.</p>
<p>For example, for our client Stoneside, we surveyed folks to see how many <a href="https://www.stoneside.com/resources/articles/plant-love">purchased and cared for houseplants in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The report got coverage on <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/houseplant-popularity-blooms-during-pandemic-5077405">TreeHugger</a> and <a href="https://www.simplemost.com/trendiest-houseplants-2021/">Simplemost</a>, but it also served as great context for other articles, like <a href="https://hellogiggles.com/lifestyle/best-houseplants/">HelloGiggles</a> and <a href="https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca/news/article/the-ultimate-guide-to-caring-for-houseplants-in-the-winter">The Weather Network</a>.</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2114554" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114554" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114554" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weathernetwork.jpeg?w=680" alt="weather network screen shoit" width="680" height="288" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weathernetwork.jpeg 1256w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weathernetwork.jpeg?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weathernetwork.jpeg?resize=300,127 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weathernetwork.jpeg?resize=768,325 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weathernetwork.jpeg?resize=680,288 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/weathernetwork.jpeg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114554" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fractl</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, getting media coverage isn’t easy. You need newsworthy content or an expert opinion to contribute, and you need to know how to pitch it to writers.</p>
<h3>Small budget options</h3>
<p>Are there industry blogs you can write a guest post for? Are there peers in your industry who are looking for quotes for their content? Start building connections with other industry experts. Cite their work in your content and build a rapport.</p>
<p>For example, I sometimes work with marketing tool brands like Semrush and BuzzSumo because those brands align well with Fractl, as we all work in the same industry.</p>
<p>You can also sign up for <a href="https://www.helpareporter.com/">HARO</a>, in which journalists post requests to speak to particular types of experts. However, it’s not often you’ll see relevant requests, and even then it’s a toss up whether they’ll reach out to you specifically.</p>
<h3>Larger budget options</h3>
<p>If you can afford it, a combination of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/earn-the-best-backlinks-with-high-quality-content-and-digital-pr/">content marketing and digital PR </a>is the way to go. If you have resources internally — marketing folks who are savvy with data analysis and content creation — you can start by seeing if you have any internal data that would be interesting to a wider audience.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearpod, the Miami-based edtech company, is being acquired by Renaissance Holding Corp., a group that develops education technology. While <a href="https://nearpod.com">Nearpod</a> isn’t announcing the news until later this month, the information leaked to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/renaissance-holding-corp-moodys-affirms-200706199.html">Yahoo! Finance</a> yesterday, and a source inside the company confirmed the sale with TechCrunch this morning. The acquisition price and further details have yet to be disclosed.</p>
<p>Nearpod offers an edtech platform that K-12 teachers use in the classroom to create interactive slides filled with videos, quizzes, questions and other activities. Students can use any device to participate in the lessons in real time; there is also a student-paced learning mode. In response to the pandemic, Nearpod now also offers remote learning.</p>
<p>It’s been a busy year for Nearpod. The company, which was founded in 2012 by three Argentinian entrepreneurs, is now led by Pep Carrera, who was brought on in early 2020 just as the pandemic gained traction. The company has raised more than $30 million in venture capital according to Crunchbase, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/01/nearpod-raises-21-million-to-turn-mobile-devices-into-a-teaching-tool-rather-than-classroom-distraction/">we last profiled the startup in 2017 when it raised its Series B</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nearpod raises $21 million to turn mobile devices into a teaching tool rather than classroom distraction&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/01/nearpod-raises-21-million-to-turn-mobile-devices-into-a-teaching-tool-rather-than-classroom-distraction/embed/#?secret=hk99PfmTdl" data-secret="hk99PfmTdl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a previous interview, Carrera told me “My first day on the job, I’m driving to the office [near Dania Beach] and talking to the management team on the phone, and we decided that we needed to close the office due to the pandemic. This was in March.” Nearpod currently employees about 250 employees, most of whom are at their Dania Beach HQ.</p>
<p>While the pandemic has posed many questions around remote work, under the leadership of Carrera, Nearpod has seen explosive growth in 2020. While Nearpod was primarily designed to be used in the classroom, the team was able to turn it into a remote-learning platform, too, making it a forerunner in K-12 distance education.</p>
<p>Nearpod is used in all 50 states, and in more than 1,800 school districts. In 2020 alone, the company grew by about 50% with more than 1 million teachers using the product, and 2-3 million students online per day. In a December 2020 interview, Carrera told me that all the money being generated right now is being put back into the company to propel its growth, which has been organic. Nearpod spends very little ad dollars on marketing. The real marketing, he said, is by word of mouth.</p>

Photo via Nearpod.</p></div></p>
<p>Prior to joining Nearpod, Carrera was president of ProQuest Books, where he led a team focused on providing innovative software that made efficient and impactful the acquisition, management and delivery of books to academic learners, researchers and librarians. Prior to ProQuest, as president and COO, Carrera grew by 10x (over six years) VitalSource Technologies, the digital learning division of Ingram Conte Group, serving more than 20 million learners per year globally.</p>
<p>M&amp;A activity in edtech has accelerated as VCs have splurged funding into the space. As my colleague Natasha Mascarenhas wrote recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/booming-edtech-ma-activity-brings-consolidation-to-a-fragmented-sector/">edtech M&amp;A is leading to mass consolidation in the space</a>. Nearpod joins a number of other edtech companies like Symbolab and Woot Math that have exited in recent months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just because there are no shortcuts to startup success doesn’t mean you have to reinvent the wheel. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=1weekleftebpost&amp;display=true">TechCrunch Early Stage 2021</a>, a virtual bootcamp experience in two distinct parts, you’ll learn from leading experts across the startup spectrum — including prominent founders ready to share their personal experiences and hard-won advice to help you avoid costly missteps.</p>
<p>Early-bird pricing for passes to TC Early Stage part one (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=1weekleftebpost&amp;display=true">April 1-2</a>) — or dual-event passes (TC Early Stage part 2 takes place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=1weekleftebpost&amp;display=true">July 8-9</a>) — remains in effect for just one more week.

<p>While both TC Early Stage bootcamps focus on startups in the very early innings, each event will feature different topics, content and experts. You’ll learn or strengthen the core entrepreneurial skillsets every startup founder needs to master — legal issues, fundraising, marketing, growth, product-market fit, tech stack, recruiting, pitch deck teardowns and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What’s more, you’ll learn from the best of the best. Here are just two of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=1weekleftebpost#6db46596-2ca9-43aa-bbb6-9a7aab71bf62">featured speakers</a> ready to download serious knowledge in April.

<li><strong>Neal Sáles-Griffin:</strong> Managing girector of Techstars Chicago and a venture partner for MATH, Neal is an entrepreneur, investor and teacher. In 2011, he co-founded the first beginner-focused, in-person coding bootcamp. He is active in nonprofit and civic engagement across Chicago and in 2018 he ran for mayor. Neal has an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University, where he is an Adjunct Professor teaching entrepreneurship.</li>
</ul>
<p>We love highlighting the best startups, and we’re devoting day two to that noble cause in the form of an TC Early Stage Pitch-Off! We’re looking for 10 founders who will pitch live onstage for five minutes followed by a five-minute Q&amp;A with a panel of prominent VC judges. The top three founders pitch yet again to a new set of judges — and engage in a more intensive Q&amp;A. Talk about awesome exposure!</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Financial institutions are falling behind the tech curve in delivering on the convenience consumers demand, leaving the door wide open for Big Tech companies like Apple, Amazon and Google to become our bankers. In November, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-pay-gpay-plex-digital-wallet-checking-account-citi-2020-11">Google redesigned its contactless payments service Google Pay</a>, merging the services of traditional banks with the seamless, convenient experience users expect from the likes of Big Tech.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch.</p>
<p>Despite the elaborate smoke and mirrors that Google has put up, one fact remains: Google is an advertising company with ads representing<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/"> 71% of its revenue sources in 2019</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			What happens when an advertising company now wants to be our bank?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>One must ask: What happens when an advertising company — armed with the terabytes of data points it has harvested from our personal emails, location data, song preferences and shopping lists — now wants to be our bank? The answer is potentially unsettling, especially considering the extraordinary neglect Big Tech has shown for user privacy, as seen<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/29/apple-google-facebook-amazon-congress-hearing/"> here</a>. And<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-demands-social-media-operations-data-from-big-tech-companies-11607980188"> here</a>. And <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-republican-state-attorneys-ad-practices-2020-12">here</a>.</p>
<p>As the marketplace is poked by yet another technocrat tentacle, this time in the heart of financial services, traditional banks that consumers and businesses once relied on find themselves at a crossroads. To retain market share, these institutions will need to continue investing in fintech so they can level up with convenience and personalization provided by new competitors while preserving trust and transparency.</p>
<h2>Traditional banks miss the digital mark</h2>
<p>Fintech holds the potential to fundamentally transform the financial services industry, enabling financial institutions (FIs) to operate more efficiently and deliver superb user experiences (UX).</p>
<p>But there’s a digital gap holding FIs back, especially small community banks and credit unions. Many have long struggled to compete with the deep pockets of national banks and the tech savvy of neo and challenger banks, like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/varo-will-use-funding-to-complete-regulatory-chartering-process-2020-6">Varo</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/monzo-raised-77-million-funding-sees-strong-paid-account-growth-2020-12">Monzo</a>. After investing more than $1 trillion in new technology from 2016 through 2019, the majority of banks globally have yet to see any financial boost from digital transformation programs, according to <a href="https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/only-half-of-banks-globally-are-making-significant-advancements-in-digital-transformation-resulting-in-lower-market-valuations-accenture-report-finds.htm">Accenture</a>.</p>
<p>Never before has this gap been more prevalent than amid the pandemic as customers migrated online en masse. In April 2020 alone, there was a 200% uptick in new mobile banking registrations and total mobile banking traffic jumped 85%, according<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/27/coronavirus-crisis-mobile-banking-surge-is-a-shift-likely-to-stick.html"> to Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)</a>.</p>
<h2>Data is the grand prize for Big Tech, not revenue from financial services</h2>
<p>Naturally, Big Tech players have recognized the opportunity to foray into financial services and flex their innovation muscles, giving banks and credit unions a strenuous run for their money. Consumers looking to digitize their finances must heed caution before they break up with traditional banks and run into the arms of Big Tech.</p>
<p>It’s important to bear in mind that the venture into payments and financial services is multipronged for Big Tech players. For example, in-house payments capabilities would not just provide companies focused on retail and commerce an additional revenue stream; it promises them more power and control over the shopping process.</p>
<p>Regulations in the U.S. might restrain this invasion to an extent, or at least limit a company’s ability to directly profit. Because let’s face it: the Big Tech players certainly aren’t asking for the regulatory &#8220;baggage&#8221; that comes with a bank charter.</p>
<p>But tech companies don’t need to profit directly from offerings like payments and wealth management, so long as they can hoard data. Gleaning insights on users’ spending patterns offers companies significant ROI in the long term, informing them how a user spends their money, if they have a mortgage, what credit cards they have, who they bank with, who they transact with, etc.</p>
<p>Financial behavior also potentially includes highly personal purchases, such as medications, insurance policies and even <a href="http://howtobemarried.us/2017/01/02/how-google-and-facebook-ruined-my-marriage-proposal/">engagement rings</a>.</p>
<p>With this laser sharp view into consumers’ wallets, imagine how much more valuable and domineering Google’s advertising platform will become.</p>
<h2>Banks must lead the charge in ethical data</h2>
<p>When it comes to the digitization of financial services, the old adage “with great power comes great responsibility” rings true.</p>
<p>Customer data is an incredible tool, allowing banks to cater to all consumers wherever they fall on the financial spectrum. For example, by analyzing a customers’ spending habits, a bank can offer tailored solutions that help them save, invest or spend money more wisely.</p>
<p>However, what if being a customer of these services means you’re then inundated with ads that respond directly to your searches and purchases? Or, even more insidiously, what if your bank now knows you so well that they can create a persona for you and proactively predict your needs and desires before even you can? That’s what the future looks like if you’re a customer of the Bank of Google.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to use customer data to refine product offerings. It must be done in a way that ensures security and privacy. By using data to personalize services, rather than bolster revenue behind the scenes, banks can distinguish a deeper understanding of consumer needs and gain trust.</p>
<p>Trust could become the weapon that banks use to defend their throne, especially as consumers become more aware of how their data is being used and they rebel against it. A <a href="https://www.idx.us/knowledge-center/ponemon-privacy-security-2020">Ponemon study on privacy and security</a> found that 86% of adults said they are &#8220;very concerned&#8221; about how Facebook and Google use their personal information.</p>
<p>In an environment where data collection is necessary but contentious, the main competitive advantage for banks lies in trust and transparency. A report from<a href="https://www.ncipher.com/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/ncipher-survey-reveals-americans-trust-banks-most-their-personal"> nCipher Security</a> found that consumers still overwhelmingly trust banks with their personal information more than they do other industries. At the same time, trust is waning for technology, with 36% of consumers reportedly less comfortable sharing information now than a year ago, according to<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/consumer-intelligence-series/trusted-tech.html"> PwC.</a></p>
<p>Banks are in a prime position to lead the charge on ethical data strategy and the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, while still delivering what consumers need. Doing so will give them a leg up on collecting data over Big Tech in the long term.</p>
<h2>Looking toward a customer-centric, win-win future</h2>
<p>The financial services industry has reached a pivotal crossroads, with consumers being given the choice to leave traditional banks and hand over their personal data to Big Tech conglomerates so they can enjoy digital experiences, greater convenience and personalization.</p>
<p>But banks can still win back consumers if they take a customer-centric approach to digitization.</p>
<p>While Big Tech collects consumer data to support their advertising revenue, banks can win the hearts of consumers by collecting data to drive personalization and superior UXs. This is especially true for local community banks and credit unions, as their high-touch approach to services has always been their core differentiator. By delivering personalized interactions while ensuring the data collection is secure and transparent, banks can regain market share and win the hearts of customers again.</p>
<p>Big Tech has written the playbook for what not to do with our data, while also laying the framework for how to build exceptional experiences. Even if a bank lacks the technology expertise or the deep-pocket funding of Facebook, Google or Apple, it can partner with responsible fintechs that understand the delicate balance between ethical data usage and superior UXs.</p>
<p>When done right, everybody wins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech now has less stringent and extreme transportation requirements than when it debuted. Originally, the mRNA-based vaccine had to be maintained at ultra-low temperatures throughout the transportation chain in order to remain viable &#8212; between -76°F and -112°F. New stability data collected by Pfizer and BioNTech, which has been submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review, allow it to be stored at temps between 5°F and -13°F &#8212; ranges available in standard medical freezers found in most clinics and care facilities.</p>
<p>The vaccine should remain stable for up to two weeks at that temperature, which vastly improves the flexibility of its options for transportation and last-mile storage in preparation for administration to patients. To date, the vaccine has relied largely on existing &#8220;cold-chain&#8221; infrastructure to be in place in order for it to be able to reach the areas where it&#8217;s being used to inoculate patients. That limitation hasn&#8217;t been in place for Moderna&#8217;s vaccine, which is stable at even higher, standard refrigerator temperatures for up to a month.</p>
<p>This development is just one example of how work continues on the vaccines that are already being deployed under emergency approvals by health regulators across the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. Pfizer and BioNTech say they&#8217;re working on bringing those storage temp requirements down even further, so they could potentially approach the standard set by the Moderna jab.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Taken together with another fresh development, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/single-dose-of-pfizer-vaccine-is-85-effective-israeli-study-shows-11613723218">study results from Israeli researchers</a> that found just one shot of the ordinarily two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could be as high as 85% effective on its own, this is a major development for global inoculation programs. The new requirements open up participation to a whole host of potential new players in supporting delivery and distribution &#8212; including ride-hailing and on-demand delivery players with large networks like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/amazon-offers-biden-resources-for-covid-19-vaccine-rollout/">Amazon, which has offered President Biden&#8217;s administration its support</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/uber-and-moderna-partner-on-covid-19-vaccine-access-and-information/">Uber, which is already teamed up with Moderna on vaccine education programs</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EfOTbvQ37M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/amazon-offers-biden-resources-for-covid-19-vaccine-rollout/">Amazon offers Biden resources for COVID-19 vaccine rollout</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon offers Biden resources for COVID-19 vaccine rollout&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/amazon-offers-biden-resources-for-covid-19-vaccine-rollout/embed/#?secret=EfOTbvQ37M" data-secret="EfOTbvQ37M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This also opens the door for participation from a range of startups and smaller companies in both the logistics and the care delivery space that don&#8217;t have the scale or the specialized equipment to be able to offer extreme &#8220;cold-chain&#8221; storage. Technical barriers have been a blocker for some who have been looking for ways to assist, but lacked the necessary hardware and expertise to do so effectively.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Transportation is important to basically all people and is a real mess, so it will likely continue to be a hot topic and a source of investor interest for years to come."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic didn&#8217;t just upend the transportation industry. It laid bare its weaknesses, and conversely, uncovered potential opportunities.</p>
<p>Electric bikes sales spiked as public transit ridership evaporated. The public, and investors, began to recognize the utility of autonomous sidewalk delivery bots, which had once been viewed as mere novelties; the rising popularity of on-demand delivery prompted major retailers like Walmart to put more resources toward meeting consumers&#8217; needs and was one of the driving forces behind Uber&#8217;s decision to dump nearly every business unit and acquire Postmates.</p>
<p>The upshot? The transformation isn&#8217;t over. Following up on our May of 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/6-leading-mobility-vcs-discuss-the-road-ahead/">survey of the sector</a> and about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/7-top-mobility-vcs-discuss-covid-19-strategies-and-trends/">the impact of COVID-19 in particular</a>, TechCrunch spoke with 10 investors about the state of mobility, which trends they’re most excited about and what they’re looking for in their next investments. They see opportunities within software, particularly around mobility-as-a-service ventures and fleet management, continued demand for delivery and the push for electrification and batteries as well as the financial instrument — SPACs — that so many startups turned to in 2020. But there&#8217;s a lot more; they even see tailwinds for eVTOLs.</p>

<h2><strong>Clara Brenner, </strong><span class="s1">co-founder and </span><strong>managing partner, Urban Innovation Fund</strong></h2>
<p><strong> COVID-19 disrupted virtually every sector of the transportation industry. E-bike demand spiked, shared scooters initially struggled with some rebounding, ridership dwindled in ride-hailing and plummeted in public transit as consumers turned to cars and other alternatives. Meanwhile, demand for delivery skyrocketed and the autonomous vehicle industry went through a consolidation. What sectors will recover in 2021 and where are the new and unlikely opportunities to invest?</strong></p>
<p>COVID has exposed how rickety, insolvent and inequitable transit is in the U.S. Tools that empower cities to get compensated for private enterprise monetizing public infrastructure, and that ensure more equitable mobility access are exciting to me. Companies like Ride Report that help cities wrap their arms around all of the various public and private transit happening on their streets are exciting to me.</p>
<p><strong> What are the remaining opportunities for new startups, now that the autonomous vehicle industry is maturing with unprecedented consolidation, billion-dollar funding rounds and even a few low-volume commercial operations kicking off?</strong></p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles still have a long way to go, and there is still lots of room for new startups to make their mark on this space. In particular, we&#8217;ve been interested to see new entrants working on software tools to facilitate regulation and parking.</p>
<p><strong> What are the overlooked areas that you want to invest in, now that legacy automakers are shifting their portfolios to electric and new EV manufacturers are preparing to start production?</strong></p>
<p>We are very interested in the emerging fleet management space &#8212; and this is reflected in a number of our recent investments, including Electriphi (software to help fleets transition to electric) and Kyte (activating underutilized fleets to deliver a magical car rental experience). There are so many efficiencies that come from the fleet model for transportation &#8212; we think this will be an increasingly important area in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong> What is the fundraising model of success for transportation startups of the future? Do you expect early-stage funding in this sector to stay hot indefinitely? Do you see SPACs as the path to liquidity long term for a large number of startups in this sector?</strong></p>
<p>Transportation is important to basically all people and is a real mess, so it will likely continue to be a hot topic and a source of investor interest for years to come. However, for capital intensive transportation companies, the rounds have gotten so huge and expensive that they often make little sense for early-stage funders to participate in (they get diluted down hugely). Not that this seems to be dissuading many investors at the moment.</p>
<p>At the Urban Innovation Fund, we are spending a lot of time looking at software tools that enable larger hardware systems to work more efficiently. In terms of longer-term liquidity, SPACs represent a good option for many companies. That said, consolidation/mergers seems the most logical outcome for most companies in the transportation space &#8212; where strategic partnerships and integrations represent critical competitive advantages.</p>
<p><strong> What do you want to see from the Biden administration to accelerate innovation in the transportation sector?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see the Biden administration invest in our urban public transit systems &#8212; we know those systems can work beautifully. This may not accelerate &#8220;innovation,&#8221; but it will accelerate progress. This is a fundamental confusion in the VC space &#8212; innovation does not always equal progress.</p>

Meanwhile, demand for delivery skyrocketed, and the autonomous vehicle industry went through consolidation. What sectors will recover in 2021, and where are the new and unlikely opportunities to invest?</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much all aspects of transportation will show recovery in 2021 with the population&#8217;s strong desire to get closer to normal, daily infections dropping, better mask compliance and increased vaccinations. The slowest will be commute-to-work use cases where the &#8220;new normal&#8221; for many will be 50%-100% fewer trips to the office on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Personal above shared movement: The psychological aftermath of the pandemic will persist for some time; people do and will continue to prefer more distance from others. This will lead to an acceleration of personal e-mobility solutions, both outright purchase and subscription models, including scooters and e-bikes (Unagi, where we are investors), asset-sharing models where riders aren&#8217;t in close proximity to strangers (GetAround, Turo, Lime, Bird), and single-ridership Ubers and Lyfts over UberPools and the like.</p>
<p>E-commerce supply chain: E-commerce has experienced a step-function in demand that will persist. Many shippers, trucking companies, manufacturers, distributors, etc., are still poorly connected, inefficient, and managed with paper and manual labor. The entire supply chain is ripe for Amazon-like efficiency and clarity; this will be driven by factory/warehouse level automation, robotics, best-of-breed fulfillment, and logistics software like our investments in Alloy, Fox Robotics and ShipBob.</p>
<p>Local delivery: Instacart, DoorDash, UberEats, etc. have brought local delivery mainstream. This trend will continue, and the larger incumbents will be working hard to get their act together for streamlining fulfillment rather than let the delivery fleets capture all of the upsides. Here companies like AnyCart that streamline ordering for grocery and recipes can partner versus compete with large grocery chains to deliver a compelling user experience and more reasonable prices.</p>
<p><strong> What are the remaining opportunities for new startups, now that the autonomous vehicle industry is maturing with unprecedented consolidation, billion-dollar funding rounds and even a few low-volume commercial operations kicking off?</strong></p>
<p>Until there is a teleporter, opportunities will always exist to make transportation better, faster and cheaper for a given distance. The big levers coming are:</p>
<p>Electric propulsion (on ground and air) yields a much lower cost per mile with lower opex motors and lower cost of recharge versus burning fuel. Opportunities exist here mostly for component companies making better batteries, motors and quiet propellers.</p>
<p>Better asset utilization: More efficient routing of vehicles (via routing software), higher capacity utilization (via more efficient marketplaces), and less downtime (through better scheduling and optimization algorithms) bring prices down.</p>
<p>Autonomy: Drivers are a big part of both the cost structure of transportation and also accidents. Human-level autonomy is still several years off, but we see lots of opportunity for autonomy in constrained environments (vehicles moving in repetitive patterns with few obstacles) and through the air.</p>
<p><strong> What are the overlooked areas that you want to invest in? Now that legacy automakers are shifting their portfolios to electric, and new EV manufacturers are preparing to start production, what are the overlooked areas that you want to invest in?</strong></p>
<p>We believe there are many transportation options beyond the car. Electric scooters, bikes, eVTOLs and others will keep growing in popularity for both utility and fun.</p>
<p><strong> What is the fundraising model of success for transportation startups of the future? Do you expect early-stage funding in this sector to stay hot indefinitely? Do you see SPACs as the path to liquidity long term for a large number of startups in this sector?</strong></p>
<p>Transportation will be a perennial sector of opportunity given how large a piece of consumer spend it occupies. Till the late 2000s, Silicon Valley barely touched transportation; this has, of course, changed dramatically since that period, particularly with the rise of Tesla.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s often quite capital intensive, though. Proving solid unit economics at a small scale before scaling will become more of a mandate given the machinations in the shared scooter market and how it showed that rapid growth doesn&#8217;t solve all woes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to see better debt financing for electric vehicle companies. With their much lower operating costs and the low-interest macro environments, we find ourselves in, if there were large pools of clean transportation debt capital that could get more vehicles in consumers&#8217; lives via modest monthly fees that would go a long way in accelerating adoption. For example, Unagi all-access subscription offers a beautiful personal scooter for $30-$40 per month with great ROI given the usage patterns and reliability. If the debt markets line up to finance these at scale, it could be a nice win-win.</p>
<p>SPACs prove to be a good option for companies with high R&amp;D costs and a long horizon to reach traditional IPO milestones (i.e., &gt;$100 million ARR). Some of these projects aren&#8217;t going to work out, though and retail investors will be left holding the bag when the stocks crater. This will be the kickstarter &#8220;failed launch&#8221; phenomenon at a much larger scale, and there will be some nasty fallout.</p>
<p>Corporate venture capital, mainly industrial and automative focused companies, are getting more aggressive as the industry recognizes their need to adapt.</p>
<p><strong> What do you want to see from the Biden administration to accelerate innovation in the transportation sector?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to see aggressive policies to further the acceleration of clean technology. Aside from the obvious environmental imperative to reduce carbon emissions, it makes good economic sense. Some examples would be personal and corporate tax credits for investing in anything that offers lower environmental impact. Electric vehicles of all sorts (scooters, bikes, cars, boats, etc.), installing solar for home and utility plants, using EVs for materials handling, etc.</p>
<p>Make the U.S. the testing ground for AVs by making regulation more favorable relative to competitors like Europe and China both on the ground and in the air.</p>
<p>Own the future of lithium-ion extraction and manufacturing. This is the &#8220;white oil&#8221; of our generation.</p>
<p>Aggressive funding of R&amp;D initiatives at universities and commercial research labs that have a shot at changing the cost equations for batteries, motors, propellers, the power grid, etc. that can improve the fundamental building blocks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Borrowing a term from the casino trade, these whales generate the bulk of the company's revenue stream.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday&#8217;s House Financial Services Committee hearing about GameStop and Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/robinhood-goes-to-congress/">wasn&#8217;t great</a>. Reuters has a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-robinhood-risks/analysis-robinhood-ceos-u-s-lawmaker-grilling-spotlights-brokers-hidden-risks-idUSKBN2AJ16V">good summary</a> of one its few interesting bits, a scrap between the elected inquisitors and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev regarding whether his firm had to raise additional capital to continue operations during the GameStop saga; TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">has reported</a> on the matter since its inception, though learning a little bit more was useful.</p>
<p>Lawmakers also managed to extract an interesting, if expected data point: The company generates <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1362514532829171722">more than half of its revenues</a> from payment for order flow (PFOF), a controversial practice in which Robinhood is paid by market makers for executing customer trades.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Those skeptical of PFOF contend that the setup effectively transforms users of neotrading services that monetize their order volume into the product being sold, leaving retail investors susceptible to poor trade execution pricing. Robinhood has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">gotten into trouble</a> regarding trade pricing in the past. But those who don&#8217;t find PFOF to be an inherent issue contend that it allows for low-cost consumer access to the equities markets. That&#8217;s fair enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Regardless of where you land between &#8212; or even <em>on </em>&#8212; those two poles is immaterial. PFOF doesn&#8217;t appear to be in material danger of being regulated out of existence, and Robinhood&#8217;s use of the business model <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/">allowed it to generate huge growth in 2020</a>. For perspective, Robinhood&#8217;s PFOF revenues rose from a little over $90 million in Q1 2020 to around $220 million in Q4.</p>
<p>How many users did it take to generate those PFOF sums? Tenev also told Congress in his <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-tenevv-20210218.pdf">written testimony</a> that Robinhood has more than 13 million &#8220;customers,&#8221; though we lack clarity on precisely who counts as a customer. But those millions do not monetize equally. Some of those 13 million users are more lucrative than others.</p>
<p>To understand that, let&#8217;s start with working to learn what fraction of Robinhood users trade options. Here&#8217;s Tenev, via his testimony:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A]s of the end of 2020, about 13% of Robinhood customers traded basic options contracts (e.g., puts and calls), and only about 2% traded multileg options. Less than 3% of funded accounts were margin-enabled.</p></blockquote>
<p>This, combined with the fact that Tenev allowed that PFOF incomes comprise the majority of its revenue, comes to an interesting conclusion: A somewhat small fraction of Robinhood&#8217;s users are responsible for the vast bulk of its incomes. We can tell that is the case by recalling that when we examine PFOF data, Robinhood&#8217;s revenues from trades in S&amp;P 500 stocks are modest, its incomes from trades involving non-S&amp;P 500 stocks a bit larger, and its incomes from options&#8217; order flow comprised the majority of the revenue reported in recent periods.</p>
<p>For example, in the months of October, November and December, TechCrunch calculates that Robinhood&#8217;s PFOF revenues were around 67%, 64% and 63% options-derived, respectively.</p>
<p>For reference, 13% of 13 million is <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=13+percent+of+13+million">1.69 million</a>. That&#8217;s the number of Robinhood users we estimate have traded options. The multileg options number is a far smaller <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2+percent+of+13+million">260,000 users</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 2019, the majority of venture firms — 65% — still did not have a single female partner or GP at their firm, according to </span><a href="https://medium.com/allraise/more-women-became-vc-partners-than-ever-before-in-2019-39cc6cb86955"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So naturally, anytime we hear of a new female-led fund, our ears perk up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based</span><a href="https://www.avidventures.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Avid Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced the launch of its $68 million debut venture capital fund. Addie Lerner &#8212; who was previously an investor with General Catalyst, General Atlantic and Goldman Sachs &#8212; founded Avid in 2020 with the goal of taking a hands-on approach to working with founders of early-stage startups in the United States, Europe and Israel.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe investing in a founder’s company is a privilege to be earned,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tali Vogelstein &#8212; a former investor at Bessemer Venture Partners &#8212; joined the firm as a founding investor soon after its launch and the pair were able to raise the capital in 10 months’ time during the 2020 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The newly formed firm has an impressive list of LPs backing its debut effort. Schusterman Family Investments and the George Kaiser Family Foundation are its anchor LPs. Institutional investors include Foundry Group, General Catalyst, 14W, Slow Ventures and LocalGlobe/Latitude through its Basecamp initiative that backs emerging managers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avid also has the support of 50 founders, entrepreneurs and investors as LPs &#8212; 40% of whom are female &#8212; including Mirror founder Brynn Putnam; Getty Images co-founder Jonathan Klein; founding partner of Acrew Capital Theresia Gouw and others.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Female-founded startups landed more deals globally in 2019 than ever before&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/female-founded-startups-landed-more-deals-globally-in-2019-than-ever-before/embed/#?secret=OQNj7HoWDD" data-secret="OQNj7HoWDD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avid invests at the Series A and B stages, and so far has invested in Alloy, Nova Credit, Rapyd, Staircase, Nava and The Wing. Three of those companies have female founders &#8212; something Lerner said happened &#8220;quite naturally.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Diversity can happen and should happen more organically as opposed to quotas or mandates,&#8221; she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In making those deals, Avid partnered with top-tier firms such as Kleiner Perkins, Canapi Ventures, Zigg Capital and Thrive Capital. In general, Avid intentionally does not lead its first investments in startups, with its first checks typically being in the $500,000 to $1 million range. It preserves most of its capital for follow-on investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We like to position ourselves to earn the right to write a bigger check in a future round,” Lerner told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Rapyd, Avid organized an SPV (special-purpose vehicle) to invest in the unicorn’s recent Series D. Lerner had previously backed the company’s Series B round while at General Catalyst and remains a board observer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to founding Avid, Lerner had helped deploy more than $450 million across 18 investments in software, fintech (Rapyd &amp; Monzo) and consumer internet companies spanning North America, Europe and Israel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to sectors, Avid is particularly focused on backing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">early-stage fintech, consumer internet and software companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm intends to invest in about 20 startups over a three-to-four year period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to take our time, so we can be as hands-on as we want to be,” Lerner said. “We’re not looking to back 80 companies. Our goal is to drive outstanding returns for our LPs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm views itself as an extension of its portfolio companies’ teams, serving as their “Outsourced Strategic CFO.” Lerner and Vogelstein also aim to provide the companies they work with strategic growth modeling, unit economics analysis, talent recruiting, customer introductions and business development support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We strive to build deep relationships early on and to prove our value well ahead of a prospective investment,” Lerner said. Avid takes its team’s prior data-driven experience to employ “a metrics-driven approach” so that a startup can “deeply understand” their unit economics. It also “gets in the trenches” alongside founders to help grow a company.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ed Zimmerman, chair of Lowenstein Sandler LLP’s tech group in New York and adjunct professor of VC at Columbia Business School, is an Avid investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told TechCrunch that because of his role in the venture community, he is often counsel to a company or fund and will run into former students in deals. Feedback from numerous people in his network point to Lerner being “extraordinarily thoughtful about deals,” with one entrepreneur describing her as “one of the smartest people she has met in a decade-plus in venture.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve seen it myself in deals and then I’ve seen founders turn down very well branded funds to work with Addie,” Zimmerman added, noting they are impressed both by her intellect and integrity. “&#8230;Addie will find and win and be invited into great deals because she makes an indelible impression on the people who’ve worked with her and the data is remarkably consistent.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.sailpoint.com/">SailPoint</a>, an identity management company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/17/identity-solutions-business-sailpoint-up-9-following-ipo/">went public in 2017</a>, announced it was going to be acquiring <a href="http://intello.io">Intello</a>, an early-stage SaaS management startup. The two companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>SailPoint believes that by helping its customers locate all of the SaaS tools being used inside a company, it can help IT make the company safer. Part of the problem is that it&#8217;s so easy for employees to deploy SaaS tools without IT&#8217;s knowledge, and Intello gives them more visibility and control.</p>
<p>In fact, the term &#8220;shadow IT&#8221; developed over the last decade to describe this ability to deploy software outside of the purview of IT pros. With a tool like Intello, they can now find all of the SaaS tools and point the employees to sanctioned ones, while shutting down services the security pros might not want folks using.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Grady Summers, EVP of product at SailPoint, says that this problem has become even more pronounced during the pandemic as many companies have gone remote, making it even more challenging for IT to understand what SaaS tools employees might be using.</p>

<p>&#8220;This has led to a sharp rise in ungoverned SaaS sprawl and unprotected data that is being stored and shared within these apps. With little to no visibility into what shadow access exists within their organization, IT teams are further challenged to protect from the cyber risks that have increased over the past year,&#8221; Summers explained in a statement. He believes that with Intello in the fold, it will help root out that unsanctioned usage and make companies safer, while also helping them understand their SaaS spend better.</p>
<p>Intello has always seen itself as a way to increase security and compliance and has partnered in the past with other identity management tools like Okta and OneLogin. The company was founded in 2017 and raised $5.8 million according to Crunchbase data. That included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/saas-management-startup-intello-scores-2-5-million-extended-seed/">a $2.5 million extended seed</a> in May 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new study underway at Toronto&#8217;s University Health Network (UHN), a group of working research hospitals in the city, could shift our approach to treatment in an area of growing concern in human health. The study, led by Dr. Heather Ross, will investigate whether the Apple Watch can provide early warnings about potentially worsening health for patients following incidents of heart failure.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.uhn.ca/corporate/News/PressReleases/Pages/UHN_launches_study_to_explore_how_Apple_Watch_can_help_with_early_identification_of_worsening_heart_failure.aspx">study</a>, which is aiming to eventually span around 200 patients, and which already has a number of participants enrolled spanning ages from 25 to 90, and various demographics, will use the Apple Watch Series 6 and its onboard sensors to monitor signals, including heart rate, blood oxygen, general activity levels, overall performance during a six-minute walk test and more. Researchers led by Ross will compare this data to measurements taken from the more formal clinical tests currently used by physicians to monitor the recovery of heart failure patients during routine, periodic check-ups.</p>
<p>The hope is that Ross and her team will be able to identify correlations between signs they&#8217;re seeing from the Apple Watch data, and the information gathered from the proven medical diagnostic and monitoring equipment. If they can verify that the Apple Watch accurately reflects what&#8217;s happening with a heart failure patient&#8217;s health, it has tremendous potential for treatment and care.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the U.S., there are about six-and-a-half million adults with heart failure,&#8221; Ross told me in an interview. &#8220;About one in five people in North America over the age of 40 will develop heart failure. And the average life expectancy [following heart failure] is still measured at around 2.1 years, at a tremendous impact to quality of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stats point to heart failure as a &#8220;growing epidemic,&#8221; says Ross, at a cost of some &#8220;$30 billion a year at present in the U.S.&#8221; to the healthcare system. A significant portion of that cost can come from the care required when conditions worsen due to preventable causes &#8212; ones that can be avoided by changes in patient behavior, if only implemented at the right time. Ross told me that currently, the paradigm of care for heat failure patients is &#8220;episodic&#8221; &#8212; meaning it happens in three- or six-month intervals, when patients go into a physician&#8217;s office or clinic for a bevy of tests using expensive equipment that must be monitored by a trained professional, like a nurse practitioner.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about the paradigm to a certain degree, we&#8217;ve kind of got it backwards,&#8221; Ross said. &#8220;So in our thinking, the idea really is how do we provide a continuous-style monitoring of patients in a relatively unobtrusive way that will allow us to detect a change in a patient status before they end up actually coming into hospital. So this is where the opportunity with Apple is tremendous.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A closer look at the new Apple Watches&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/a-closer-look-at-the-new-apple-watches/embed/#?secret=uELBQhMm83" data-secret="uELBQhMm83" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Ross said that current estimates suggest nearly 50% of hospitalizations could be avoided altogether through steps taken by patients, including better self-care, like adhering to prescribed medicinal regimens, accurate symptom monitoring, monitoring dietary intake and more. Apple Vice President of Health Dr. Sumbul Desai echoed the sentiment that proactivity is one of the key ingredients to better standards of care, and better long-term outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of health, in the world of medicine, has been focused on reactive responses to situations,&#8221; she said in an interview. &#8220;The idea to get a little more proactive in the way we think about our own health is really empowering and we’re really excited about where that could take us. We think starting with these studies to really ground us in the science is critical but, really, the potential for it is something that we look forward to tackling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Desai, has led Apple&#8217;s Health initiatives for just under four years, and also spent much of her career prior to that at Stanford (where she remains an associate professor) working on both the academic and clinical side. She knows first-hand the value of continuous care, and said that this study is representative of the potential the company sees in Apple Watch&#8217;s role in the daily health of individuals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to have that snapshot of an individual as they’re living their everyday life is extremely useful,&#8221; she said. &#8220;As a physician, part of your conversation is &#8216;tell me what’s going on when you’re not in the clinic.&#8217; To be able to have some of that data at your fingertips and have that part of your conversation really enhances your engagement with your patients as well. We believe that can provide insight in ways that has not been done before and we’re really excited to see what more we’re learning in this specific realm but we&#8217;re already hearing from both users and physicians how valuable that is.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mount Sinai study finds Apple Watch can predict COVID-19 diagnosis up to a week before testing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mount-sinai-study-finds-apple-watch-can-predict-covid-19-diagnosis-up-to-a-week-before-testing/embed/#?secret=RjTaGPbbrJ" data-secret="RjTaGPbbrJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Both Ross and Desai highlighted the value of Apple Watch as a consumer-friendly device that&#8217;s easy to set up and learn, and that serves a number of different purposes beyond health and fitness, as being key ingredients to its potential in a continuous care paradigm.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really believe that people should be able to play a more active role in managing their well-being and Apple Watch in particular, we find to be — and are really proud of — a powerful health and wellness tool because the same device that you can connect with loved ones and check messages also supports safety, motivates you to stay healthy by moving more and provides important information on your overall wellness,&#8221; Desai said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a powerful healthcare tool bundled into a device that people just love for all the reasons Sumbul has said,&#8221; Ross added. &#8220;But this is a powerful diagnostic tool, too. So it is that consumer platform that I think will make this potentially an unstoppable tool, if we can evaluate it properly, which we&#8217;re doing in this partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study, which is targeting 200 participants as mentioned, and enrolling more every day, will span three months of active monitoring, followed by a two-year follow up to investigate the data collected relative to patient outcomes. All data collected is stored in a fully encrypted form (Ross pointed to Apple&#8217;s privacy track record as another benefit of having it as a partner) and anyone taking part can opt-out at any point during the course of the research.</p>
<p>Even once the results are in, it&#8217;ll just be the first step in a larger process of validation, but Ross said that the hope is ultimately &#8220;to improve access and equitable care,&#8221; by changing the fundamental approach to how we think about heart failure and treatment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://podimo.com/">Podimo</a>, the Copenhagen-founded subscription service for short form audio stories and podcasts, has raised an additional €11.2 million in funding.</p>
<p>The round is led by Chr. Augustinus investment fund, and comes just eight months after announcing its €15 million Series A. Existing investors and the Spanish VC Aldea Opportunity Fund also participated.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Podimo is a podcast and short-form audio platform which offers personalized recommendations to listeners, while offering creators a share of revenue via premium subscriptions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Premium members gain access to more than 600 shows that are exclusive to Podimo and membership fees are shared directly with the podcast creators they listen to each month. The service is currently live in Germany, Denmark and various Spanish-speaking markets.</p>
<p>Co-founded by Morten Strunge, who has a track record in subscription media products via audio books service Mofibo (which he sold to Storytel), more broadly, Podimo is hoping to capitalise on the rise in consumption in podcasts. The startup’s other founders are Nikolaj Koppel, Andreas Sachse, Sverre Dueholm and Eva Lægdsgaard.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Podimo raises €6M to become Europe&#8217;s &#8216;Netflix for podcasts&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/podimo/embed/#?secret=QFNS8hSmW3" data-secret="QFNS8hSmW3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Our dream is to address two challenges in the developing podcast industry,&#8221; explains Strunge. &#8220;The first is discoverability, where we intelligently match listeners to the content they love. And the second is monetization, where we provide a new stream of revenue for creators, allowing them to focus on creating and invest into great storytelling&#8221;.</p>
<p>By offering a freemium model, where a paid version provides unlimited listening and features, Strunge believes there is an opportunity to work closely with podcast creators to strengthen the podcast ecosystem and make it less reliant on advertising revenue.</p>
<p>“We want to become the preferred partner for creators, by both working closely with their content, curate and match it with each individual user, but also by offering a superior monetisation model,” he said when Podimo announced its Series A. The hope is that a more robust revenue stream will enable new content producers to enter the market and allow existing ones to earn more. In turn, that would provide the financial headroom to invest even more time and effort into high-quality content.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen strong traction on our podcast and short-form audio subscription service&#8230; and now more than 50% of our growth comes from our international markets,&#8221; Strunge tells me. &#8220;Our exclusive catalogue has grown to more than 600 exclusive productions, and our vision of building out revenue streams to creators of short form content really seems to be getting traction&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Podcast advertising company <a href="https://www.acast.com/en">Acast</a> is announcing that it has acquired <a href="https://radiopublic.com">RadioPublic</a>, the startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/prx-spins-out-radiopublic/">spun out of public radio marketplace PRX</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>At first, RadioPublic&#8217;s main product was a mobile app for podcast listening, and it still supports the app. But co-founder and Chief Product Officer Matt MacDonald said that over time, the team&#8217;s focus shifted to products for podcasters, specifically its Listener Relationship Management Platform, which includes an embeddable web player, custom websites called <a href="https://podcasters.radiopublic.com/website">Podsites</a> and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a whole roadmap of things we wanted to build, but we recognized that at our scale, we could be better served by partnering up with bigger organizations,&#8221; MacDonald said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And ultimately, they decided Acast made sense as not just a partner, but an owner. Acast&#8217;s business still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/will-podcast-ad-revenue-bounce-back-after-covid-19/">revolves around podcast advertising</a>, but it&#8217;s also expanded with new tools like <a href="https://www.acast.com/en/hosting">the Acast Open hosting platform</a>, and it says it now hosts 20,000 podcasts, collectively reaching 300 million monthly listeners.</p>

<p>“The acquisition of RadioPublic is fundamentally a partnership of values,&#8221; said Acast&#8217;s chief business and strategy officer Leandro Saucedo in a statement. &#8220;We both firmly believe in the open ecosystem of podcasting and have a shared commitment to aid listener discovery and support all creators. We’re impressed by what RadioPublic has achieved and we believe that now — as podcasting is gaining more momentum than ever before — is the ideal time to bring RadioPublic’s talented team and company missions into the Acast fold.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but Acast says it will not affect RadioPublic operationally.</p>
<p>MacDonald and his co-founder/CTO Chris Quamme Rhoden are both joining Acast (CEO <a href="https://current.org/2020/09/radiopublic-ceo-jake-shapiro-joins-apple-podcasts/">Jake Shapiro departed last fall</a> to lead creator partnerships for Apple Podcasts), and although they&#8217;ll be working to integrate RadioPublic features into the Acast platform, MacDonald said the startup will continue to support its own products and mobile apps for &#8220;the foreseeable future.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that as RadioPublic works with Acast, the team will remain focused on &#8220;strengthening and deepening that relationship, that bond, that affinity between the podcaster and the listener.&#8221; In his view, that&#8217;s where RadioPublic&#8217;s opportunity lies, even as big platforms like Spotify invest in podcasting.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do we enable you, as the creator, to control the relationship you have with your audience?&#8221; MacDonald said. &#8220;We believe that a podcast&#8217;s listeners are the podcast’s listeners. They are not the platform&#8217;s customers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unlike incubators and accelerators, company builders are organizations that tend to develop startups from scratch mainly based on their own ideas and resources. In the process, they bring together tech enthusiasts &#8212; designers, developers, marketers &#8212; who likely meet each other for the first time to work on a startup.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.antler.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antler</span></a> is one such organization. But it runs a mixed model where it also acts as an early-stage venture capital firm. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps founders build complementary co-founding teams, and provides support with deep business model validation and a global platform for scaling their businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To date, Antler has invested in and helped build more than 250 companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of these companies, 40% have at least one female co-founder, and the founders represent more than 70 nationalities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017 by serial entrepreneur <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/magnusgrimeland#:~:text=Magnus%20Grimeland%20is%20the%20Chief,the%20world's%20most%20exceptional%20people.&amp;text=As%20Co%2DFounder%20and%20Regional,in%20Southeast%20Asia%20(SEA).">Magnus Grimeland</a> and a team of experienced entrepreneurs, investors and company builders worldwide, Antler has raised more than $75 million to help entrepreneurs spread across nine of the world&#8217;s major entrepreneurial hubs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They include Amsterdam, Berlin, London, Nairobi, New York, Oslo, Singapore, Stockholm and Sydney.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antler&#8217;s only office in Africa <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2019/05/14/global-startup-generator-antler-launches-operations-in-kenya/">is in Nairobi</a>, and it is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">run</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and led by women.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marie-nielsen-1716652/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marie Nielsen,</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">founder of a paper recycling company in Ethiopia called Penda Paper Recycling, is a partner at the firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was an associate partner at Mckinsey &amp; Company responsible for opening their Addis Ababa office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melalite/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Melalite Ayenew</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is the firm&#8217;s tech partner. Her experience includes Oracle, Bain &amp; Company and Princeton Consultants.</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/selamkebede/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Selam Kebede</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the firm&#8217;s director and leads operations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before joining Antler, she worked for a couple of VCs and entrepreneurship support organizations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Turning professionals to founders</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other locations around the world, Antler East Africa runs two cohorts in a year. The firm is particular about adopting a people-first approach, and they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bring together professionals with, on average, 10 years of experience in their respective industries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These professionals who become founders ideate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, iterate and create solutions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based on insights they have gathered or problems observed during the course of their past professional experience in their respective industries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After six months of incubation, the firm invests in the teams they can help further. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the pre-seed stage, Antler cuts $100,000 checks for a 10-20% equity in each selected team. But for Antler East Africa, the stake is exactly 20%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our process is very hands-on; by working with the co-founders over several months, we get the opportunity to help shape the business models and perform extensive due diligence before investing,&#8221; Nielsen said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The due diligence Nielsen talks about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is supported by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the global Antler platform, where they pull upon its network of more than 400 experts across technologies and industries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the pre-seed investments, Antler East Africa claims to continue to support the teams as they hit the ground running and start raising funds from follow-on investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayenew adds that the firm is also exploring the opportunity to invest in pre-existing, early-stage startups developed outside its program, but early enough for them to come in and still provide value </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the monetary investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that Nairobi is Antler&#8217;s only office in Africa, the team looks out for founders working on pan-African problems and solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has attracted founders from more than 15 African countries, which plays a large role in maintaining its cohorts&#8217; outlook to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">organically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pan-African</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, Antler East Africa has invested in a broad range of technology companies in the B2B, B2C and direct-to-consumer space, ranging from emerging sectors like robotics and AI to sectors such as health tech, fintech and proptech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From its last two cohorts, Antler East Africa has invested in six startups. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.trycooked.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a subscription-based meal kit provider</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooked operates with weekly and monthly subscriptions and delivers products to its customers on pre-agreed days of the week</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber has lost a long-running employment tribunal challenge in the U.K.&#8217;s Supreme Court &#8212; with the court dismissing the ride-hailing giant&#8217;s appeal and reaffirming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/uber-loses-another-appeal-against-drivers-rights-in-uk/">earlier rulings</a> that drivers who brought the case are workers, not independent contractors.</p>
<p>The case, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/uber-loses-employment-tribunal-in-the-uk/">dates back to 2016</a>, has major ramifications for Uber&#8217;s business model (and other gig economy platforms) in the U.K. &#8212; and likely regionally, as similar employment rights challenges are ongoing in European courts.</p>
<p>European Union lawmakers are also actively eyeing how to improve conditions for gig workers, so policymakers were already feeling pressure to clarify the law around gig work &#8212; today&#8217;s ruling only increases that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The U.K. Supreme Court judgement can be <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0029-judgment.pdf">found here</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0029-press-summary.pdf">press summary</a> the court said: &#8220;Drivers are in a position of subordination and dependency in relation to Uber such that they have little or no ability to improve their economic position through professional or entrepreneurial skill. In practice the only way in which they can increase their earnings is by working longer hours while constantly meeting Uber’s measures of performance.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8220;A classic form of subordination&#8221;</h2>
<p>The court rejected Uber&#8217;s argument that it merely acted akin to a booking agent for drivers, noting that the company would have no means of performing its contractual obligations to passengers (nor complying with its regulatory obligations as a licensed private hire vehicle operator) &#8212; &#8220;without either employees or subcontractors to perform driving services for it&#8221;.</p>
<p>The court also weighed how Uber&#8217;s business operates in light of U.K. employment law, which provides for a &#8220;worker&#8221; status &#8212; a classification which is neither employed nor self-employed &#8212; considering other case law and the detail of the drivers&#8217; relationship with Uber in coming to its interpretation of the legislation.</p>
<p>Its conclusion is that &#8220;the transportation service performed by drivers and offered to passengers through the Uber app is very tightly defined and controlled by Uber&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although free to choose when and where they worked, at times when they are working drivers work for and under contracts with Uber (and, specifically, Uber London),&#8221; the court wrote, noting its agreement with the earlier tribunal ruling Uber also lost.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WIlfs2YHBI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">Uber lobbies for &#8216;Prop 22&#8217;-style gig work standards in the EU</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber lobbies for &#8216;Prop 22&#8217;-style gig work standards in the EU&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/embed/#?secret=WIlfs2YHBI" data-secret="WIlfs2YHBI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the judgement the court has emphasized a number of aspects of that ruling as important &#8212; namely (emphasis ours): <strong>Pay/</strong><b>remuneration</b> (since Uber drivers are not free to set the price of rides); the <strong>contractual terms</strong> of the performance of the service (again, drivers are not free to set these; Uber does); and <strong>Uber&#8217;s control over service provision</strong>, such as via the use of algorithmic management of logged-in drivers and through ownership of the technology infrastructure. The court also flagged how Uber restricts communications between driver and passenger to a bare (and even &#8220;stark&#8221;) minimum.</p>
<p>In a discussion of how Uber uses driver ratings as another tool of control, the court also noted that driver ratings are not disclosed to passengers (i.e. to help them inform/choose their choice of driver) &#8212; but are exclusively for Uber&#8217;s use; &#8220;purely as an internal tool for managing performance and as a basis for making termination decisions where customer feedback shows that drivers are not meeting the performance levels set by Uber&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a classic form of subordination that is characteristic of employment relationships,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The court also agreed with the earlier tribunal finding that time spent by the drivers logged into Uber&#8217;s app and on duty in London available to accept a trip can be classed as working time under U.K. law (aka the Working Time Directive and Regulations) &#8212; which has implications for fulfilling the National Minimum Wage.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court appears to have had a harder time with the scenario of how to calculate working time if ride-hailing drivers are logged onto multiple (i.e. competing) apps simultaneously, with the judge writing: &#8220;I have concluded that this question cannot be answered in the abstract.&#8221; However, in the case of Uber, its dominant market share in London has made the question moot for this particular legal challenge.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the Supreme Court&#8217;s dismissal of its appeal, attributed to Jamie Heywood, regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, Uber said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We respect the Court&#8217;s decision which focussed on a small number of drivers who used the Uber app in 2016. Since then we have made some significant changes to our business, guided by drivers every step of the way. These include giving even more control over how they earn and providing new protections like free insurance in case of sickness or injury.  We are committed to doing more and will now consult with every active driver across the UK to understand the changes they want to see.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ride-hailing company emphasized that the worker reclassification that flows from this judgement applies to a specific group of Uber drivers who brought the claim, many of whom it said no longer drive on its app.</p>
<p>It also pointed to factors the court had weighed which it said no longer apply &#8212; saying it has, for instance, changed its app so that drivers do see the trip destination and price; and also claiming that since 2017 there has been no repercussion for rejecting multiple consecutive trips.</p>
<p>Uber added that it would be launching a nationwide consultation with all active U.K. drivers &#8212; seeking views to feed its lobbying on gig-working conditions.</p>
<p>It said it will share the outcome of its process in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In recent days &#8212; and likely in anticipation of this verdict &#8212; the company has kicked off a major <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">lobbying effort</a> in Europe calling for deregulation of platform work.</p>
<p>It argues that without a carve out from employment laws platforms&#8217; hands are tied over how far they can go to offer workers a better deal.</p>
<p>Uber says it&#8217;s pushing for some of the same &#8220;principles&#8221; that featured in the Prop 22 ballot initiative, which ride-hailing giants Uber and Lyft spend hundreds of millions of dollars pushing in California, going on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/prop-22-results/">win a carve out for delivery and transport work</a> from employment reclassification there last year.</p>
<p>However, responding to Uber&#8217;s EU white paper <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/">this week</a>, the academic research group Fairwork accused it of downplaying its ability to make changes to improve working conditions on its platform. It said the tech giant is trying to <span data-contrast="auto">legitimize a lower level of protection for platform workers than most European workers benefit from &#8212; urging lawmakers to focus on expanding and strengthening employment protections, not watering them down.</span></p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruling certainly dials up the risk to Uber of a wave of successful challenges from other U.K. drivers &#8212; increasing its imperative to lobby lawmakers to deregulate platform work. Although, given the U.K. already has a more nuanced classification of employment status than many other markets in Europe, it&#8217;s not clear how much &#8220;favorable travel&#8221; Uber&#8217;s lobbying might achieve in the market (versus on a pan-EU level).</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/good-work-the-taylor-review-of-modern-working-practices">major U.K. government-commissioned review</a> of workplace rights, back in 2017, recommended renaming workers as &#8220;dependent contractors&#8221; &#8212; in a bid to help clarify &#8220;workers&#8221; versus the genuinely self-employed. But the government has yet to take up the suggestion.</p>
<p>It has also been slow to legislate to improve the clarity of employment status tests (as it committed to doing as part of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/uk-outs-plan-to-bolster-gig-economy-workers-rights/">&#8220;Good Work&#8221; plan in 2018</a>) &#8212; but the Supreme Court verdict may be the nudge it was waiting for.</p>
<p>Calls to clarify U.K. employment law by defining self-employment in legislation are following hard on the heels of the verdict. (The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed, for example, said the ruling shows the &#8220;glaring need for clarity&#8221; in the gig economy and U.K. employment law.)</p>
<p>Returning to Uber, the cost of extending workers to all or even a portion of its U.K. drivers would be substantial &#8212; as it would need to cover benefits such as holiday pay, minimum wage (for time spent working with the Uber app active, including waiting, not just when driving after accepting a job) and pension scheme contributions.</p>
<p>Such workforce status changes could also affect its wider tax liabilities &#8212; so the stakes are high.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it could seek to avoid the costs and risk inherent to any major reclassification of its drivers by changing its model to try to remove the risk that drivers could be reclassed as workers &#8212; such as by reducing how much control it applies to how they perform their tasks.</p>
<p>However, the level of change necessary to meet the legal bar may entail a far more radical redrawing of the Uber service than Uber is comfortable with. Not least as Uber has to consider impacts on its business globally.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber could give gig workers a better deal but it&#8217;s lobbying EU to lower standards, says Fairwork&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork/embed/#?secret=gw149O2yws" data-secret="gw149O2yws" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Trying to reconfigure its service to avoid paying employment benefits would also be risky in optics/reputational terms, argues Joe Aiston, a senior associate at the law firm Taylor Wessing. He suggests Uber has sought to pro-actively manage its exposure on this front &#8212; via the white paper it released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">earlier this week</a> &#8212; in which it seeks to reframe the issue of gig workers rights/working conditions by claiming a &#8220;new standard&#8221; is needed for platform work (i.e. as a tactic to avoid the application of existing employment law).</p>
<p>While he points out that any mass reclassification of Uber drivers would significantly increase Uber&#8217;s costs, and any attempt to pass that on to passengers (in the form of higher prices) would knock Uber&#8217;s competitiveness. So there are no easy options for it there either.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing that is for sure is that other businesses engaging individuals as contractors will be looking at this latest decision and seeking to assess the extent to which the concepts considered are applicable to their business model and what changes might be required as a result,&#8221; said Aiston in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many will see the Supreme Court judgement as a victory for gig economy workers &#8212; often seen as under-protected in law &#8212; and those representing them. The reality may not be quite that bright as with improved employment rights come an increased potential for people to be controlled and, for example, restricted from working for competitive businesses; one of the benefits hailed by gig economy businesses is the freedom to choose when to work and for whom,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jilltoh">Jill Toh</a>, a PhD researcher in platform rights at the University of Amsterdam, described the Supreme Court ruling as a &#8220;huge win&#8221; for platform workers, while noting that U.K. employment law&#8217;s &#8220;limb (b) worker&#8221; status is distinct versus employment laws in many other European countries.</p>
<p>Though she also suggested the ruling will have a significant influence on how judges approach ongoing gig worker rights cases in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s significant is that worker organising has to be central to any solution,&#8221; she told TechCrunch. &#8220;Workers need to come together to debate and decide these issues that are directly impacting them. I don’t think our current institutions are really empowering this. Even with the wins (in the Netherlands with Deliveroo and the Italy case), driver sentiment is still mixed on the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>Toh pointed out that data access is a key issue &#8212; and battleground &#8212; to ensuring a better deal for gig workers.</p>
<p>On that front, as it stands, it&#8217;s the platforms that control all the cards &#8212; including as they lobby for deregulation with self-serving talk of &#8220;surveying drivers for feedback&#8221; &#8212; given they are the only entities with an omniscient view of both sides of their marketplaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big part of allowing drivers to debate requires access to data and understanding of algorithmic management,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Legal challenges related to data access and algorithmic management were filed against Uber (and Ola) at the Amsterdam District Court last year, referencing Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation &#8212; including by James Farrar (one of the former Uber drivers who brought the employment tribunal challenge) and the not-for-profit <a href="https://workerinfoexchange.org">Workers Info Exchange</a>, which is pushing to further workers rights via data access.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve covered those data access and algorithmic management challenge cases <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/ubers-robo-firing-of-drivers-targeted-in-latest-european-lawsuit/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/ola-is-facing-a-drivers-legal-challenge-over-data-access-rights-and-algorithmic-management/">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://accountsiq.com/">AccountsIQ</a>, a financial management software (FMS) startup founded by a team of chartered accountants (when accountants want to be entrepreneurs, you know startups are a thing), has raised €5.8 million in funding.</p>
<p>Backing the Dublin-based company, which targets mid-sized businesses that operate multi-entities, is Finch Capital, the fintech focussed VC that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/finch-capital-launches-third-fund/">recently outed its third fund</a>. AccountsIQ says the injection of capital will be used for accelerated growth and recruitment across sales and marketing, customer success and engineering to continue to enhance the product.</p>
<p>Launched in 2008 in Dublin, AccountsIQ&#8217;s cloud-based FMS aims to simplify how multi-entity businesses &#8220;capture, process and report&#8221; their financial results. These include businesses that are expanding via subsidiaries, branches, SPVs or a franchise model &#8212; and specifically those that trade across different locations, currencies and jurisdictions. The idea is to plug a gap in the market that AccountsIQ says exists between low-end products like Xero, QuickBooks and Sage, and much higher-end and more expensive products like NetSuite, Intacct and SAP.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="w2E3qw5yuh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/finch-capital-launches-third-fund/">Finch Capital launches third fund to invest in European fintech at Series A and B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Finch Capital launches third fund to invest in European fintech at Series A and B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/finch-capital-launches-third-fund/embed/#?secret=w2E3qw5yuh" data-secret="w2E3qw5yuh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Managing the finances of multi-entity businesses was difficult prior to the cloud, requiring each entity to prepare accounts and send them in centrally for review and analysis,&#8221; explains AccountsIQ co-founder Tony Connolly. &#8220;Our Cloud solution means that all entities can access simultaneously and collaborate with head office or their accountants to process their own transactions, while providing full consolidation of results in the group base currency to allow easy central reporting and benchmarking of group wide results at the touch of a button&#8221;.</p>
<p>To enable this “one version of the truth,” AccountsIQ has been designed to be able to handle various reporting complexities, such as sub-groups, multiple currencies revaluations and inter-company transactions.</p>
<p>The software also claims to employ &#8220;artificial intelligence&#8221; and an open API strategy to automatically synchronise bank accounts, generate electronic payments, auto-post electronic invoices and integrate front-end systems with easy approval workflow and expense capture via smartphones. Existing integrations include ​TransferMate Global Payments​, TINK, BrightPay, Kefron AP, ​Chaser, Concur​, ​Salesforce​ and ​ISAMs​.</p>
<p>To date, the AccountsIQ software is used by 4,000 companies across various industries, from nonprofits to banks, with clients such as PwC, Linesight Global Construction Group, Asavie Technologies, GP Bullhound and Throgmorton. Broadly speaking, Connolly says the startup&#8217;s target customer is any business where multi-entities are involved, and that require each entity to be accounted for separately but managed centrally. With the acceleration of cross-border e-commerce and macro events like Brexit, that customer profile is evidently expanding.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["I think there is a lot of interesting stuff coming out of Stockholm and accelerating with all recent success stories," said VNV Global's Bjorn von Sivers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the realm of European startup ecosystems, Sweden — largely Stockholm — ranks very close to the behemoths of London, Paris and Berlin. And with 10 million people, the nation certainly punches above its weight, having produced unicorns such as Spotify and Klarna, to name only two.</p>
<p>As a result, the eight investors we surveyed are characteristically bullish about the future, despite a pandemic strategy that became more restrictive in the second half of last year.</p>
<p>Sweden&#8217;s initially laissez-faire approach to controlling COVID-19 might have helped its tech ecosystem ride out the uncertainty. “Sweden is more open and is ahead of the pandemic curve, so more people are coming here than the other way around,” said Jacob Key, founding partner with Luminar Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Several people we spoke to said they saw green shoots regarding revenue growth and retention in their portfolio companies as founders adapted to the pandemic. Areas that are benefitting include digital health and remote work for obvious reasons, but given Sweden&#8217;s strength in fintech and gaming, those sectors are both well positioned to thrive.</p>
<p>As consumers become more desirous of sustainability, responsible shopping, green travel and plant-based food alternatives “will likely contribute to a surge in companies in this space,&#8221; said Sofia Dolfe of Index Ventures.</p>
<p>Oversaturated areas are media/adtech and wellness/fitness apps.</p>
<p>Some of the trends these investors are excited about include deep tech, AI, machine learning, healthcare/medtech, industrial IoT, energy storage and energy-efficient power generation, robotics, intelligent production and additive manufacturing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is a lot of interesting stuff coming out of Stockholm and accelerating with all recent success stories,&#8221; said VNV Global&#8217;s Bjorn von Sivers.</p>

Strong momentum, more and more serial founders and experienced founders, strong broader ecosystem, product and tech-led founders with a global view.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Sweden is more open and is ahead of the pandemic curve so more people coming here than the other way around.</p>

Travel, mobility, nice-to-have SaaS, recruiting. They should focus on work, event, travel 2.0 security, sustainability, e-health and entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Not really. Focus on resourceful execution, digital-first sales, extend runway. Biggest worry is a much cooler investment climate.</p>

Business models with strong network effects. Mobility and micromobility services, Digital health, online marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
SWVL, Babylon Health, Voi Technology.</p>

<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Business models with strong network effects.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
VNV Global has a global mandate. Approximately 10% of the portfolio is Sweden/Stockholm based.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Any consumer service coming out of Stockholm eco system. In the portfolio I would highlight Voi Technology and Fredrik Hjelm (micromobility) and Grace Health founded by Estelle Westling and Thérèse Mannheimer that is building a digital health clinic for women in emerging markets.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
I think there is a lot of interesting stuff coming out of Stockholm and accelerating with all recent success stories. Spotify, iZettle, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
It will probably increase a bit, but not significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
International travel still has a lot of uncertainty and low visibility. Digital health and micromobility is defiantly seeing unprecedented demand.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Not really impacted our strategy. I would say founders think a lot about the funding climate and how to best plan in this lower visibility environment.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, all across the portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The fast recovery in our mobility businesses, which essentially saw activity drop significantly in late March/early April and has rebounded strongly since May</p>
<h2>Ashley Lundström, partner, EQT Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
I’m personally excited about investing in teams solving important problems — the ones that affect disadvantaged populations, society at large, the environment, etc. And the exciting part is that we’re seeing more and more of this — especially from serial entrepreneurs who have built companies, maybe even had good exits and now want to dedicate their skills to meaningful journeys.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
It actually hasn&#8217;t been announced yet as we literally closed a few days ago and it&#8217;s one that our AI platform Motherbrain pointed us to. It’s one of those companies that when you hear about what they’re building you just say, “Oh of course, that’s a no-brainer.” It’s a great example of a product-led company seeing strong organic growth from a global user base and we’re chomping at the bit to start working together. Prior to this, my latest most exciting investment is Anyfin. Anyfin is a prime example of the potential of Stockholm’s second generation teams, coming out of the Swedish unicorns iZettle, Klarna and Spotify. They’re a fintech building financial wellness products for users who need it the most. They’ve started with targeting interest rates head-on via a refinancing product and are launching more products and markets with the Series B funding raising they secured this spring.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
I’m keen to see teams who combine market experience with startup experience. All too often teams are either one or the other and I&#8217;d love to see a team come together where one co-founder says, “I know this problem inside-out because I’ve lived it” and another co-founder who says, “I know how to build and bring ideas to life.” This combo would be really powerful. Over and above that, I’m generally focused on investing in teams solving problems that are shared by huge bases — either consumers or the long tail of B2B. One must in my book is that the product has to be consumer grade. This is obvious for consumer (although not always a given), but it’s something that we’ve become religious about in B2B too.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We’re in the business of exceptions so I find it hard to rule out a category altogether due to competition. That being said, there are always sectors where it’s tricky to envision a winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most, for structural reasons, such as some types of recruiting or staffing, D2Cs or digital health services.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Our strategy is to be local with locals and we invest broadly across Europe and, in specific cases, in the U.S. So, while personally my time&#8217;s spent somewhat weighted toward the Nordics, more than 50% of the companies I work with are outside the Nordic countries. Motherbrain has helped us flatten geographies further, discovering great startups regardless of where they&#8217;re located, and we regularly invest in great teams outside our local ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
There’s a lot of talent for consumer products coming out of the Nordics — particularly fintech in Stockholm (Tink, Anyfin, Brite), gaming in Finland (Small Giant Games, Reworks, Traplight), and a range of products out of Copenhagen including edtech and health tech (Eduflow, Corti). The great engineering talent we have in this region is also producing incredibly strong tech teams — particularly in Finland, such as Varjo, Speechly and Robocorp. We’re even starting to see some interesting activity in quantum computing (e.g., IQM) in the region. There are also some moonshot companies coming out of the Nordics that we&#8217;re excited about long term, such as Solein, Einride, Heart Aerospace and Northvolt.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The Nordic countries continue to punch above their weight and I am confident that this trend will continue — meaning the investment opportunities will be many. As the ecosystems mature, the quality will continue to improve, which also speaks to this trend over time. Historically, downturns have produced strong tech companies, so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if investors are keeping a close eye on the region to make sure they get the chance to back some of the most seasoned entrepreneurs who will most certainly be looking for ways to make the most of the current climate.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I believe we’ll see more remote teams, absolutely. However, I still think the hubs will be strong and important pieces of the ecosystem and I don’t think we’ll see these cities shrinking by material numbers. Though if people leave the most expensive cities, who could blame them? I do, however, think we’ll see a more sharp trend of teams that were fairly local in the past, expanding to new geographies. And what may happen is that in itself will reveal new talent pools, which over the long term could create more hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Tech is in a great position overall because businesses are generally either working on digitization, which is seeing acceleration out of COVID-19 … so tech falls clearly on the right side of that line, or green field modern or even futuristic ideas. Of the latter, of course, some of these ideas are nice-to-haves, which struggle when consumers are facing tough financial situations, but plenty are services that we believe we’ll see working out long term. Of course anything physical, where the team isn’t able to adapt the product quickly, like events or exercise services, will face temporary dips, but if these companies were originally betting on long-term trends, we believe that they’ll still be in good positions going forward.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 hasn’t affected our strategy, but it has helped us keep our eye on the ball in terms of making sure we stick to our strategy and stay mindful of our own runway — funds have that too! The advice to our founders has been the following: (1) Extend the runway so you keep your options open, and then (2) be as aggressive as you possibly can. We&#8217;re encouraging teams to act quickly — both in terms of making internal decisions and in getting products to market to test them out. Our founders’ biggest worries are uncertainties around how long “this” will all last — and our advice here is that they should operate as they always do and not wait for things to change, rather be ultrarelevant in the market you’re in.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes! We’ve got a couple companies who are really well positioned — particularly Wolt (food delivery) and the mobile games companies we’ve backed (Popcore, Reworks, Traplight, etc.). The current climate is especially favorable for these types of companies, and we’ve got great founders at the wheels who have been able to take advantage of the opportunities presented and who have seen tremendous growth as a result.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The efforts by the public sector, including healthcare providers, to accelerate digitization has been refreshing. Sectors who have all too often had plenty of excuses for being slow and conservative have suddenly made big leaps — and they’re proud of themselves for having done so! This gives me hope that there will be new or renewed appetites even as things go back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
The Nordic countries have many great examples of digital tools used by the general public to conduct their everyday lives digitally. I would encourage founders and business leaders to look to these examples and see if there are opportunities to build for other geographies. Scandinavian trendsetting isn’t just for fashion and interior design!</p>
<h2>Ted Persson, partner, EQT Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
My main passion lies in backing ambitious teams solving real problems with real technology. So, pretty deep tech sometimes — the anti-thesis of “yet another B2B SaaS company solving almost the same problem in almost the same way.” I’m also interested in product and design-centric teams using superior UX to democratize something that previously was limited to a privileged few. Currently, I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about and doing research into the future of the creative industries, marketing, product design, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
This spring, I’ve led or been involved in four investments across quantum computing, group collaboration and two in the design and development tooling space. None of these have been announced yet though. The last announced investments were Sonantic and Frontify — both very cool companies.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Edtech is certainly one.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
As we’re looking for outliers, it’s hard to generalize. But I get more excited about companies tying to solve hard problems rather than just piecing together a few APIs (which anyone can do).</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
I personally don’t have a geographical focus and enjoy working with our teams across Europe and the world, but since I live in Sweden, my network is slightly stronger here. Our proprietary AI platform Motherbrain also ensures we find rapidly growing or under-the-radar startups outside of our local ecosystems and networks.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
We’re pretty good at gaming, entertainment, music and fintech in the Nordics. It’s also easier to find really great designers here than in other parts of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Yes, for sure. It&#8217;s too early to tell, but a couple of portfolio companies have given up on their physical offices and a lot of startup people I know are working from across the country. I for sure think this will lead to a more international climate.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
A lot has been written about this already and, just like every other investor, we’ve spent a fair share of the spring mapping this out. All in all, tech is in a good position.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
There&#8217;s been no change in our strategy. There was some initial confusion for obvious reasons and we took a short break to make sure our portfolio was in a good position to endure. Now, we’re back to normal and have made our first investments where we haven’t met the teams physically.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, certainly in a couple of areas, such as food delivery, gaming, remote working and collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
When people around myself, parents, older relatives, all of a sudden embrace digital tools and ways of working fully.</p>
<h2>Sofia Dolfe, principal, Index Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
I love products that give people a strong feeling of community, of belonging to a group of like-minded people, and a sense of being invested in its success. Users are so passionate about the product that they can&#8217;t stop themselves from recommending it to their friends, and their affinity with the brand grows over time. Search for these types of businesses often leads me to consumer businesses and marketplaces that are customer-centric and bring communities together.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
I am interested to hear about new takes on education in a post-COVID world in which people may be more open to challenge the traditional ways of learning.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
I am looking for founders who are inspiring storytellers. So much of building a business is about getting everyone to come along for the ride, from the senior execs joining you, to the customers taking a chance on a young yet unproven business, to investors taking a leap of faith and sharing in your ambition. Founders who are great storytellers, are hungry and dream big from the get-go, and have the humility to know what they don&#8217;t know, will be in my view those who have the best chance at making it big.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Stockholm has historically been at the forefront of both fintech and gaming, and I do think these sectors are well positioned to thrive. Financial services will continue to be transformed, and the modern banking infrastructure in the Nordics makes this an attractive place to start a fintech business. As for gaming, the region has a strong track record and a high concentration of both studios and developer talent, making it a particularly fertile ground for breakout successes. A newer, fast-growing theme in the region is conscious consumption. Stockholm has a long history of eco-friendliness, and the maturity of CSR, responsible shopping, green travel and plant-based food alternatives will likely contribute to a surge in companies in this space. I&#8217;m excited to meet with founders who care deeply about this endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Stockholm has proven itself to be a strong tech hub, and it has many of the necessary ingredients for continued successes. For one, founders think big and global from the start. Sweden has a population of 10 million, and founders creating category-defining companies know that they must enter other markets to dominate. The scale of companies such as King, Spotify and iZettle has also shown that success is within reach and cultivated a sense of courage among aspiring entrepreneurs. Sometimes the world risks underestimating the Swedes because they tend to be understated but as the track record of Sweden shows, they overdeliver.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
A few weeks ago I saw a handwritten note in the entrance of an apartment building in Stockholm. One of the residents was offering to purchase groceries, medication and other essential items to those unwell or at risk in the building. I&#8217;m hopeful that in times of difficulty, we are reminded of the importance of our local communities, of taking responsibility for others, and of how valuable a simple act of kindness can be to building relationships.</p>
<h2>Staffan Helgesson, partner, Creandum</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Transformation of old and large industries such as transportation, construction, real estate, etc. Digital health — we will need to transform current health industry.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Mavenoid. Automating tech support globally. Ex-Palantir founders.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Insurance markets have not yet seen the wave of startups that the general fintech industry has seen.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Crazy ambitious entrepreneurs with their eyes set on disrupting a global market.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Many consumer verticals are tough to penetrate given big tech and related oligopoly. But every time I say that new phenomenal companies emerge. Such as Creandum&#8217;s portfolio company Kahoot that just listed in Oslo for $1.5 billion.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Creandum invests all across EU. No set targets — we just want to find the best entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
If picking one industry we&#8217;re very excited about digital health with Stockholm-based Firstvet and Kry/Livi. (telemedicine for humans and pet owners).</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Stockholm/Nordics is a very sophisticated ecosystem that consistently keep producing global winners on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Great companies will increasingly be built anywhere and we as an industry need to adapt. Those venture firms adapting best and fastest will be the winners going forward. I foresee a second green wave, like in the 70s, where people will move out from cities and/or have a dual-home setup.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Travel and entertainment obviously. But even in these industries there will be winners going forward if they can ride the wave of digitizing (for example, tickets and events).</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s all about access to long-term capital and track record. Creandum&#8217;s strategy has not changed at all.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, especially in digital health.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Closing a fully remote investment. Company called Meditopia — in Turkey of all places :-).</p>
<h2>Tanya Horowitz, partner, Butterfly Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Deep tech, AI, machine learning, healthcare/medtech, industrial IoT and related cloud services and communication solutions, Energy storage and energy-efficient power generation, robotics, intelligent production, and additive manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.uutescientific.com">Uute Scientific</a> has created a natural product containing a specific mixture of microbes, which can be applied to various consumer products. These products decrease the probability of getting immune-mediated diseases, like asthma or Type 1 diabetes and consequently improve quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
In the region (Nordics), would like to see more in energy storage, power generation and energy/carbon reduction technologies. Food tech and agtech are an area to look toward given the world&#8217;s increasing population. Edtech due to the COVID crisis.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We are looking for a strong team with unique tech aimed toward a global market.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Media/adtech unless truly unique seem to be oversaturated; also wellness/fitness apps, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Finland 40%-50%, Sweden 30%+, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Baltics remaining 20%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Industries: Health/medical.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
I think in Finland and the entire Nordics there is ample opportunities to invest in stellar teams and technologies that have a global market. The talent pool and support of the startup ecosystems are top notch.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I do not see startup hubs losing people in the Nordics. I do however see founders coming from geographies outside major cities.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Obvious is retail, restaurants, service industry. Also education (edtech) should be an area to really look into. Online entertainment (OTT), logistics (food, goods delivery), etc.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
It has only affected it slightly, we were lucky that we were almost at the end of our investment period and our portfolio of companies are set for this current fund vintage. We are the leading seed-stage deep tech investor in the Nordics and therefore most of our companies have fared OK.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, some of our portfolio has benefited from the pandemic, while others suffered with customers initially but seem to be recovered now.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
We are raising Butterfly Ventures Fund IV and started before the pandemic hit. While this has slowed us down slightly, our anchor and other LPs are rock solid and we as a team are committed to getting the first close done ASAP to capitalize with that dry powder in early 2021. While my heart goes out to those who have not been so lucky, personally we have been blessed to not have had direct tragedies related to the pandemic … and my son is happy and healthy and that alone gives me hope everyday.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Global LPs should really explore Europe more, especially the Nordics!</p>
<h2>Sanna Westman, principal, Creandum</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Well, we typically say that if you invest in trends you&#8217;re late to the party … but of course there are some macro movements that are exciting and we monitor closely. For me personally digital health is one of those areas, it&#8217;s not new but constantly developing and has of course been further accelerated the past year. Another area that is really interesting are products that help you be a better leader/manager/company. I&#8217;m not sure how to productize this but there&#8217;s a huge opportunity in amplifying leadership. We&#8217;ve seen success with companies giving the individual user superpowers (no-code tools, productivity tools, etc.) but how about helping people scaling themselves and their teams? Remote work has a lot of benefits, but puts new challenges on managers. I also believe we&#8217;ll see more quality companies battling climate change in different ways.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
SafetyWing — on the intersection of social security and remote work.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
There&#8217;s plenty more to do within B2B commerce: marketplaces, e-commerce enablers, new ways of financing, etc. Sure there are companies, but no way near as many (good) ones as it should be.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
A short time to &#8220;Wow.&#8221; Solutions that can give the user an instant value and then continue to add to that value they more they use the product</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Mobility and delivery in general is quite crowded. Also open-banking payment solutions has seen a huge surge.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
The Nordics is along with DACH one of the key focus markets for Creandum, though there&#8217;s no set allocation for any certain geography. We strive to back the best companies regardless of where they&#8217;re located.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Compared to other hubs there is a very high product focus in general, and given that Sweden is a small market the mindset is also international from day one. I think that makes more of a difference than a certain vertical. In terms of exciting companies Kive and Depict are worth keeping eyes on for the very early stages. For the more mature startups Kry and Firstvet are doing great as early enablers of digital health.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Increasingly competitive but also a lot of strong talent.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Even before the pandemic very few startups in Stockholm had 100% of their workforce in one location anyway, a hybrid setup was and continue to be very common.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
As the fund invests with a very long time horizon, +10 years, the short-term impact is not a key concern but of course we think about the long-term effects on e.g., business travel. We tend to look for the opportunities more than the drawbacks though, and there will be opportunities for new companies in industries that have been heavily impacted. It might actually prove to be good timing to disrupt.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Initially we were cautious around runway and worked closely with the portfolio to make sure they could survive for a longer time should revenues decline and funding not be available. Summing up 2020 though, we were fortunate to look back on a year where many companies had overperformed and were able to raise significant up rounds. Great companies are created in all times and were committed to find the best seed and Series A companies.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Definitely. We&#8217;ve seen several examples of V-shaped recovery, with revenues bumping back above pre-COVID levels and continuing on that trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The hustle and optimism among entrepreneurs we meet. The &#8220;impossible is nothing&#8221; attitude is really inspiring.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally?</strong><br />
I&#8217;d say some of the active &#8220;stay in the background&#8221; angels/mentors that are supporting a new generation such as Joachim Hedenius (Kry, CTO) or Johan Crona. And Susanna Campbell/Cristina Stenbeck who have been very active in their joint investments, often finding opportunities the VCs miss.</p>
