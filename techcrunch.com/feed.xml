										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Collaborative software is so hot right now, but the space is also incredibly crowded. It can be hard to rise above the noise, but Coda has managed to do so with $140 million in funding and a valuation topping $600 million.</p>
<p>So it should go without saying that we&#8217;re excited to hear from Coda CEO Shishir Mehrotra and Madrona investor S. Somasegar, who invested in the company&#8217;s Series C round, on an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-madrona-and-coda">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Soma is a managing director at Madrona, responsible for investments in Snowflake, UIPath, Coda, Pulumi, Seekout and more. He invests in a broad array of categories, including machine learning, next-gen cloud infrastructure, future of work, robotic process automation and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before Madrona, Soma spent 27 years at Microsoft as SVP of the Developer Division. He&#8217;s got experience both as an operator and investor and will have plenty of wisdom to impart on the episode.</p>
<p>Mehrotra, for his part, has built a pretty massive business that has not only scaled well, but competes directly with giants like Google. Coda is a collaborative doc/spreadsheet software that looks to take on the G Suite. Before Coda, Mehrotra was an executive at YouTube and, prior to that, held leadership roles at Microsoft working on Windows, Office and SQL Server.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to these two about fundraising for a product like Coda, what attracted Soma to the platform and how they work alongside one another today. We&#8217;ll also have an Extra Crunch Live Pitch-Off, where folks in the audience can come on &#8220;stage&#8221; and pitch their wares. Mehrotra and Soma will give their live feedback and, let&#8217;s face it, make all of us better at pitching in general.</p>
<p>The episode goes down on June 2 at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT and is accessible to anyone. However, only Extra Crunch members can access this episode (and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">entire ECL library</a>) on-demand.

					<description><![CDATA[By generating lots of cash and profit, Doximity hasn't raised a round since 2014.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There was a time when this column was more than a never-ending run of IPO coverage. Then the unicorn liquidity cycle kicked off and it’s been a long run of public offerings ever since. This morning is no exception.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doximity.com/">Doximity</a> <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001516513/000162828021011269/doximity-sx1.htm">filed to go public</a> earlier today. You likely haven’t heard of the company because it exists in the modestly obscure world of telehealth. But it’s a venture-backed startup all the same that raised more than $80 million from investors like Emergence, InterWest Partners, Morgenthaler Ventures and Threshold, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doximity/company_financials">according to Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, Doximity has not fundraised since 2014, a year in which it attracted just under $82 million at a valuation of $355 million, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">per PitchBook data</a>. How has it managed to not raise for so long? By generating lots of cash and profit over the years. Healthtech communications, it turns out, can be a lucrative endeavor.</p>

<p>Doximity is a social network that allows doctors to speak to each other while complying with HIPAA, a federal law that promotes medical privacy. The network, originally defined as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/24/doximity/">LinkedIn for medical professionals</a>, gives doctors a Rolodex for specialists, a newsfeed for healthcare updates, a communication tool to talk to patients, and a job search tool.</p>
<p>In 2017, Doximity claimed that it <a href="https://press.doximity.com/articles/doximity-reaches-70-percent-of-all-us-doctors">reached 70% of all U.S. doctors</a>, more than 800,000 licensed professionals.</p>

<p>Let’s chat briefly about the larger healthtech exit market and then dig into Doximity’s IPO filing and get our heads around how the company managed to avoid private-market dilution for seven years &#8212; and what the company may be worth.</p>
<h2>Healthtech exits</h2>
<p>The global digital health market is estimated to hit <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/22/2196996/0/en/Global-Digital-Health-Market-Size-Will-Grow-to-USD-220-94-Billion-by-2026-Facts-Factors.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CAccording%20to%20the%20research%20report,%25%20from%202019%20to%202026%E2%80%9D.">$221 billion by 2026</a>, underscoring how large an opportunity the sector may present to venture capitalists. But investors aren’t merely just paying attention to estimates; they are seeing a number of exits in digital health (read: liquidity) that are warming up their checkbooks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-state-of-healthcare-q1-2021?utm_campaign=marketing_state-healthcare_q1_2021-03&amp;campaignid=270202443&amp;adgroupid=117808669574&amp;utm_term=digital%20health&amp;utm_campaign=Reports&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_content=adwords-reports-americas&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-298908580986&amp;hsa_grp=117808669574&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_mt=p&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;hsa_ad=504603262549&amp;hsa_acc=5728918340&amp;hsa_kw=digital%20health&amp;hsa_cam=270202443&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwqcKFBhAhEiwAfEr7zQdT0BFLIg3HewliBws-2hV2X2unUNEGFwZr2facbrhdzX_Rj6jWNBoCXEQQAvD_BwE">CB Insights</a> estimates that there were 79 healthcare IPOs and M&amp;A transactions in Q1 2021 alone, a 60% increase from the quarter prior. <a href="https://rockhealth.com/reports/whats-ahead-for-digital-health-in-2021/">Another report</a> says that there were 145 acquisitions of digital health companies in 2020, up from a solid 113 in 2019.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="H9Ipq71LBg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/">Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Should startups build or buy telehealth infrastructure?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/should-startups-build-or-buy-telehealth-infrastructure/embed/#?secret=H9Ipq71LBg" data-secret="H9Ipq71LBg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While still growing, it’s fair to say that those figures describe a healthy exit environment.</p>
<p>The list of deals in the market is rapid-fire. Earlier this year, Everlywell, founded in 2015, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/everlywell-acquires-two-healthcare-companies-and-forms-parent-everly-health/">acquired two healthcare companies</a> to expand its digital health service and distribution. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ro-acquires-modern-fertility-in-a-reportedly-225-million-deal/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Modern Fertility was bought by Ro for north of $225 million</a> in a majority-equity deal. Before you start complaining that it&#8217;s not an IPO, consider this: A less than four-year-old company just got bought for a quarter of a billion dollars by another company that is less than four years old.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/1f003db3-c3b6-4a9b-9bd9-7d4082236cd9?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This week had the whole crew aboard to record: Grace and Chris making us sound good, Danny to provide levity, Natasha to actually recall facts, and Alex to divert us from staying on topic. It&#8217;s teamwork, people &#8211; and our transitions are proof of it.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s good that we had everyone around the virtual table as there was quite a lot to get through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team felt all kinds of ways about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">the Amazon-MGM deal</a>. Some of us are more positive about than the rest, but what gists out from the transaction is that for Amazon, the purchase price is modest and the company is famously playing a supposedly long-game. Let&#8217;s see how James Bond fits into it. Alex receives four points for not bringing up F1 thanks to the Bond-Aston Martin connection.</li>
<li>Turning to the SPAC game, we chatted through the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">Lordstown Motors earnings results</a>, and what we can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/?tpcc=ECTW2020">parse from them regarding blank-check companies</a>, promises, and reality.</li>
<li>After launching last June with just $2 million, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/collab-capital-closes-50-million-debut-fund-for-black-founders/">Collab Capital has closed its debut fund at its target goal</a>: $50 million. The Black-led firm invests exclusively in Black-led startups, and got checks from Apple, PayPal, and Mailchimp to name a few. We talk about this feat, and note a few other Black-led venture capital firms making waves in the industry lately.</li>
<li>We Resolved our transition puns and eventually spoke about the Affirm spin-out, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/affirm-spinout-resolve-raises-60m-for-its-b2b-buy-now-pay-later-platform/">$60 million in a funding round for BNPL for businesses.</a> There&#8217;s bigger questions there around the accessibility and point of BNPL, and if its really re-inventing the wheel or just repackaging it with simpler UX.</li>
<li>Next up, we got into a can of worms about the future of meetings thanks to Rewatch, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/zoom-fatigue-no-more-rewatch-raises-20m-to-index-transcribe-and-store-enterprise-video-content/">a $20 million Series A</a> this week led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup helps other startups create internal, private Youtubes to archive their meetings and any video-based comms. We could only spend a second on this, so if you want our longer thoughts in the form of text, check out our 3 views on the topic on Extra Crunch! <em>(Discount Code: Equity)</em></li>
<li>From there we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/interactio-a-remote-interpretation-platform-grabs-30m-after-seeing-12x-growth-during-covid-19/">had Interactio</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/fireflies-ai-raises-14m-for-its-meeting-transcription-and-automation-service/">and Fireflies.ai</a>, two more startups that are tackling the complexities of meetings in the COVID-19 era, and whatever comes next. Both recently raised new funding, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/kudo-raises-6m-for-its-real-time-translation-and-video-conference-platform/">Alex brought up Kudo</a> to add one more upstart to the mix.</li>
<li>Noom, a weight loss platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/weight-loss-platform-noom-bulks-up-on-540-million-in-new-funding/">bulked up with $540 million in funding</a> after nearly doubling its revenue from 2019 to 2020. The pandemic has made many people gain weight, but we chew into why Noom&#8217;s moment might be right now after a decade in the works.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MotoRefi has raised another $45 million in a round led by Goldman Sachs just five months after investors poured $10 million into the fintech startup to help turbocharge its auto refinancing business.</p>
<p>The startup developed an auto refinancing platform that handles the entire loan process, including finding the best rates, paying off the old lender and re-titling the vehicle. MotoRefi says using its platform saves consumers an average of $100 a month on their car payments, a goal achieved partly because it works directly with lending institutions. The company&#8217;s refinancing tools had seen steady growth until the COVID-19 pandemic popped into in higher gear. CEO Kevin Bennett said MotoRefi is on track to issue $1 billion in loans by the end of the year, a fivefold increase from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Bennett said the short timeline between rounds was driven by investor confidence in its metrics, which have continued on to grow at a fast pace, and the basic economics around the business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We candidly weren&#8217;t planning on raising yet, but they (Goldman Sachs) were comfortable given the relationship we have built and the track record and success of the business, to preempt the round and move that calendar up,&#8221; Bennett said.</p>
<p>MotoRefi&#8217;s platform is available in 46 states and Washington DC with plans to be live in all 50 by the end of the year. The startup has ramped up hiring to help support that growth. By the first quarter of 2021, it had more than doubled its headcount to 187 employees from the same period last year. Its workforce has now popped to 250 employees. The company has hired several senior level executives, opened a new headquarters and partnered with SoFi. Goldman Sach&#8217;s vp of venture capital and growth equity Jade Mandel has joined MotoRefi&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>And Bennett sees plenty of room to grow as consumers seek out ways to rebalance their debts. The auto refinance market in the United States is $40 billion. However, overall auto loan debt is $1.3 trillion. With 40 million auto loans originated every year, MotoRefi is promised a consistent flow of potential new customers.</p>
<p>The fresh injection of capital, which included investor IA Capital as well as returning backers Moderne Ventures, Accomplice, Link Ventures, Motley Fool Ventures and CMFG Ventures, will be used to continue to build out its products and services and hire more people. MotoRefi has raised $60 million since its inception in 2016.</p>
<p>Bennett believes the company is now in self-sustaining position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully, we moved beyond the world where we are raising capital and then raising more capital as we run out of capital,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think we have a great sustainable business and so we, in some sense runway is infinite, and we are building a great profitable business. That&#8217;s not to say that we won&#8217;t ever raise again, but it will be based on strategic considerations, as opposed to out of necessity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://at.cafe">Café</a>, a new French startup founded by two brothers that wants to help companies switch to a hybrid remote-and-office workplace model. Café isn’t a traditional desk-booking tool. Instead, the company helps you see when people in your team are coming to the office so that you can plan when you should go to the office as well.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on workspace, Café focuses on people first. “We decided that we wouldn’t let you book a desk directly,” co-founder and CTO Arthur Lorotte de Banes told me.</p>
<p>When you open the app, you get a simplified calendar view. For each day, you can see your team members divided by groups — people coming to the office, people working from home, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In just a few taps, you can tell your other coworkers what you plan to do. This way, it becomes much easier to schedule meetings, have in-person conversation and more generally hang out with your coworkers. It also makes it easier to find a common day with a specific coworker if you’re working on the same project.</p>
<p>“We interviewed 150 companies and we realized companies faced the same issue after interviewing the first five companies. They all use spreadsheets,” co-founder and CEO Tom Nguyen told me.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158738" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158738" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png" alt="" width="1024" height="698" class="size-full wp-image-2158738" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png 2780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=1536,1046 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=2048,1395 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/on_devices.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158738" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Café</p></div></p>
<p>Using a tool like Café also gives you insights about your office. For instance, you can see the average number of persons in your office depending on the day of the week or the day of the month. Admins can configure a weekly reminder to make sure that everybody fills out information.</p>
<p>In addition to its mobile app and web app, Café integrates with your existing tools. For instance, you can connect your Café account with Slack so that your status on Slack reflects your status in Café. Teammates can hover over your name to know that you’re in the office or you’re at home.</p>
<p>The company is also working on integrations with human resource information systems, such as <a href="https://payfit.com/en/">PayFit</a>, so that your vacation is automatically synchronized with Café.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2158739" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158739" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png" alt="" width="1024" height="698" class="size-full wp-image-2158739" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png 2780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=1536,1046 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=2048,1395 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/plug_and_play_slack.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158739" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Café</p></div></p>
<p>As companies start hashing out a plan to return to the office, Café arrives on the market at the right time. Companies can create custom statuses to fit their specific needs. For instance, a Café customer has created a status so that they know who has the office keys to make sure that the office remains open.</p>
<p>The company raised a $1 million seed round from 122West, Kima Ventures, Jonathan Widawski, Guillaume Lestrade, Jacques-Edouard Sabatier and various business angels who work or have worked for WeWork, Dropbox, Github, Snapchat, Intercom, Stripe, Alan and PayFit.</p>
<p>Like Typeform, Doodle or Slido, Café has chosen a freemium strategy. Teams can sign up for free and start using the product with their immediate coworkers. You don’t need to enter card information to sign up.</p>
<p>If you want to roll it out across the organization with more users, you have to start paying. The startup believes employees will become product advocates for the entire organization. And it seems like the right strategy for a product that is supposed to make employees happier at work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon, in its ever-growing desire to become a super app in India, is testing a new category to persuade users to spend more time on the shopping service: Feature articles.</p>
<p>The American e-commerce giant has quietly launched “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/kindle-dbs/alp/articles">Featured Articles</a>” on its shopping app and website in India that showcases feature articles, commentary and analysis on a wide-range of topics including politics, governance, entertainment, sports, business, finance, health, fitness, books, and food. The articles are sourced from several large local media houses and magazines.</p>
<p>Some of these articles are &#8220;exclusively&#8221; available on Amazon, the company says on the website. To drive engagement, Amazon is also sending notifications to some Kindle users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2158722" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158722" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2158722 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="515" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=768,386 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=680,342 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=1536,772 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/amazon-instant-reads.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158722" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Himanshu Gupta</p></div></p>
<p>The latest addition, which was spotted and shared with TechCrunch by <a href="https://twitter.com/HalfRebel">Himanshu Gupta</a>, comes days after Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/amazon-minitv-free-streaming-service-india/">launched a free video streaming service</a> within the shopping app in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the new feature to TechCrunch, adding, “we remain focused on creating new and engaging experiences for our customers and as part of this endeavour, we have been testing a new service that brings articles on different topics like current affairs, books, business, entertainment, sports and lifestyle amongst others for readers.”</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Amazon has explored integrating some reading material to its shopping service in India. In 2018, Amazon India started to feature some gadget reviews and listicles, sourced from local media houses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://nuwacapital.io/">Nuwa Capital</a>, a venture capital firm based in Dubai and Riyadh, announced the <a href="https://www.menabytes.com/nuwa-capital-first-close/">first close</a> of its $100 million NVFI fund in February</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The close was three-quarters of the target and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in less than a year following the firm&#8217;s launch in February 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to the firm, the second close should</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be concluded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the end of this year or Q1 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by partners <a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/khaledtalhouni">Khaled Talhouni</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAS9shMBvkrmI5B6Dw9eWArXXVBf40VwKCg?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3Bzl1V0LmCR6GUSeqqO6KDTA%3D%3D">Sarah Abu Risheh</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAALH0BkB5TGrtk7e1BXXYMve3LFlsB7HMTE?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_company%3B9c8CGLTiTW%2Bb7lno%2BaCeRA%3D%3D">Stephanie Nour Prince</a>, Nuwa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> targets markets in the Middle East and the wider GCC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://nuwacapital.io/who-we-are/">partners</a> have a track record of investing in Middle Eastern companies &#8212; Careem, Mumzworld, Golden Scent and Nana Direct</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they have also invested in Twiga Foods and AZA, two East African startups.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have cut checks for three companies with this new fund: two Dubai-based companies, Eyewa and Flexxpay, and one Egypt-based company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/egyptian-furniture-marketplace-homzmart-raises-15m-series-a-to-expand-across-mena/">Homzmart</a>. And d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">espite having a strong focus on the Middle East and the GCC, the firm wants to double down on investing in more African startups, particularly in Egypt and East Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke with the partners to discuss their past investments, why they are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Africa and the similarities and differences between the regions they operate in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This interview has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been edited</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for length and clarity.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Why is Nuwa Capital choosing Sub-Saharan Africa as one of its target markets?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Khaled</strong>: I mean, it&#8217;s not our primary market, but it&#8217;s an area of secondary focus for us, which we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> interested in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that there are a lot of learnings from the Middle East that we can take from our experience of investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here that we can use for investing in Africa, particularly in East Africa, especially as the digital adoption increases very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Nuwa Capital invested in Homzmart recently. Are there any other startups Nuwa has invested in or plans to in North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah</strong>: So there is a lot of the deal flow we&#8217;ve seen in North Africa, and we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started in December. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are seeing a lot of companies in Egypt, Morocco, across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> North Africa, and in the coming months, we will be investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggressively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across that geography</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But for now, Homzmart is our only African investment.</span></p>

<p><strong>TC: How do you plan to make the transition in investing in Sub-Saharan Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah</strong>: We have a network in East Africa because, in our previous fund, we did invest in two companies in Kenya. One was Twiga and the other was BitPesa, which is now AZA. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve invested in those, and as part of our due diligence and network that we&#8217;ve built in Africa, that&#8217;s why </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the opportunity is there because we got to see it and understood the market with those two companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: From your perception of how the African market is, how is it different from the GCC?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah</strong>: There are different ways to look at it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Africa is different from the GCC markets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the population sizes, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the purchasing power of people and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies that get a lot of attraction </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on mass volume</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So the success of the company sometimes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on volume. So like a large number of people signing up to a company, for example. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Twiga, for example, it was bridging the gap between farmers and vendors, so they had a large number of farmers, and that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had a lot of power. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s where we see opportunity in Africa &#8212; in the power of the population</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stephanie</strong>: From a VC standpoint, many funds have cropped up in the GCC region in the past couple of years, s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o there&#8217;s a lot more capital flowing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the market. That may not be exactly mirrored yet in East Africa if </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I might</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, I guess what we see from where we are in East Africa is that the capital seems to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be concentrated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around a particular set of founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: What will be the investment strategy for Nuwa Capital in Africa?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah</strong>: We look for companies that fit into our thesis. So I can talk a bit more about the sectors that we invest in. So fintech is a large one that we look at. And then, we have a big focus on SaaS across different industries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like e-commerce and marketplaces, the top of private label angle and private brands selling through e-commerce marketplaces</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then we also have, we also look at something that we call the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digitizing industries, and that&#8217;s companies that are disrupting the traditional industries through technology in education, health tech, agritech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So these are the theses we look at, and that&#8217;s how we drive our investment strategy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ticket sizes and stages, we focus on seed and Series A, and then we could also follow on in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stephanie</strong>: So when it particularly comes to Africa, what we&#8217;ve seen, which is also very interesting for us, is an increase of companies pitching to us in healthcare, in agritech, in different variations of financial services or intersection of fintech and something else</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be very interesting also for us as we move forward, as we start looking a bit more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">intently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Since you are relatively new to African investment, will you be looking to partner or liaise with other VCs based on the continent?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stephanie</strong>: It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;s a very common practice for us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re quite collaborative as a fund, and that&#8217;s also due to the nature of the region where you end up co-investing with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funds, and sometimes they tend to be the same funds that you have a similar mindset with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that happens quite a bit; I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s very likely also to happen with funds we&#8217;ve co-invested with in the past in Africa.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Egypt has been one of the exciting countries in both Africa and the Middle East region. What do you think is going for the market?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Stephanie</strong>: Egypt is one of the primary markets that we focus on. We are seeing a large part of our pipeline coming from Egypt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve also seen a great shift in Egypt over the past few years where the type of entrepreneurs, the type of founders that are coming to us, are more mature and more experienced and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a higher calibre than before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e used to see a lot of earlier-stage companies with inexperienced founders. But today, what we&#8217;re seeing is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">amazing. We are very bullish on the market when it is one of our primary focus markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sarah</strong>: When companies come out of Egypt, their expansion strategy is usually either to the rest of North Africa or East Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some will come to the GCC, while some will stay in Africa, depending on what industry they&#8217;re in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that as we invest more in Egypt and then </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into our East Africa strategy will give us </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good exposure in Africa, and as we grow, our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funds will look more into Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Is there a portion of the fund dedicated to the African market?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Khalid</strong>: I don&#8217;t think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we have a specific percentage, but the continent is part of the major strategy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a significant </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the fund targeted at Egypt but we&#8217;d like to do at least 5-10% of the fund in Africa, excluding Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It depends on the final fund size but we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bullish on Africa.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://getpenfold.com">Penfold</a>, a startup that offers a full stack pension in a smartphone app, has closed a $8.5 million (£6m) funding round, $4M of which was from a crowdfunding campaign. The company is now approved by the FCA to operate a pension itself rather than relying on third parties, and is aimed at freelancers who rarely save.</p>
<p>The round was led by Bridford Group, the Family Office of Jorg Mohaupt, allegedly the only Angel investor in Adyen. Alan Morgan of MMC Ventures also invested.</p>
<p>Penfold says it built the backend infrastructure &#8220;from scratch” Hykin told me. He said legacy providers are built up from &#8220;100s of consolidated schemes” and are often still paper-based and require an army of people to administer. Thus a tech-driven approach means fewer overheads and the ability to make an attractive offer to freelancers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO Pete Hykin told me: &#8220;I was self-employed for two years so had no pension. I tried five times to set one up with Scottish widows, standard life, AJ bell etc. I gave up, as all of them forced you to print something, call them, or speak to an IFA. At a previous company, I set up a workplace pension for 70 staff and none of them engaged. Many left money on the table as a result.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We rebuilt the entire backend of pensions so all processes can happen instantly, quick, flexibly and at a low cost. Then we put an amazing UX on it via a great app and amazing human customer service.” Features include search, track, consolidate old pensions, among others.</p>
<p>Hykin said users download the app, enter bare minimum legal details for KYC, choose one of 5 investment plans based on age/risk appetite, choose how to fund (Recurring Direct Debit, Open banking topup, transfer another pension). Then they receive HMRC 25% top ups until retirement.</p>
<p>A &#8220;Find my pension” tool is possibly the most powerful feature of this startup, where you put in the name of your old employer it tracks down your old pension pot.</p>
<p>Its competitors include traditional providers such as Standard Life, Scottish Widows, Aviva and AJ Bell.</p>
<p>Pensions are definitely heading to apps. PensionBee recently <a href="https://www.altfi.com/article/7823_pensionbee-ipo-fintech-debuts-on-the-london-market-at-365m-valuation">arrived</a> on the London Stock Exchange, for instance. PensionBee also recently announced self-employed offering.</p>
<p>Users will be charged an annual percentage fee on their pension balance (0.75%), but with no other fees. The other founders are Chris Eastwood (Co-Founder and Co-CEO), Stuart Robinson (Co-Founder and CTO).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Landlords have sometimes looked on the tech-enabled spaces of the likes of WeWork and longed to be part of the cool kids &#8211; and attract that new wave of founders. Now a UK startup has come up with a way for Landlords to do this directly.</p>
<p>Founded by Steve Coulson and Lucy Minton in 2018, UK-based <a href="https://www.kittoffices.com/">Kitt</a> has now raised $5 million (£3.6 million) in seed fundraising, taking the total amount raised by the business to $7.5 million. The round was led by Barclay Ventures.</p>
<p>Kitt says it provides a &#8216;fully customizable&#8217; workspace solution to tenants via its landlord partners. It connects landlords with tenants directly, then automates most of the traditional functions usually undertaken by office and building managers. The benefit for landlords is that is reduces void periods up the yield from property.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It now counts companies like Oatly, Nested and PZ Cussons Beauty with their post-COVID office planning.</p>
<p>Spaces are visualized through a VR design process before being built out. Kitt’s mobile app then offers a range of on-demand services to tenants. Spaces get app-based entry systems, remote receptionists and security systems. Landlords can then offer a managed service to tenants, who can contract other suppliers through Kitt’s platform.</p>
<p>On the raise, Founder Lucy Minton said: “We have experienced a 600% growth in revenue since August and we expect this growth to continue as offices navigate and understand the changing needs of their team… With flexibility top of the agenda, collaboration, creativity and innovation will be central to office design in a post-COVID world.&#8221;</p>
<p>She explained: “In short we have built a platform to allow us to operate any space of any size. We work with landlords essentially to repackage their space as a service provider. So from an operating model point of view, we can deliver space remotely into clients&#8217; offices anywhere, and from a product point of view, everything is run through our space app.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investor and former CEO of Axel Springer Digital, Andreas Wiele, added: “By providing a bespoke solution for tenants, they can plan beyond the next six months and navigate their own version of the office of the future. For landlords, Kitt is offering a chance to market space in a new way that enables them to sell offices worth leaving home for.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Fintech and proptech are two sectors that are seeing exploding growth in Latin America, as financial services and real estate are two categories in particular dire need of innovation in a region.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brazil&#8217;s QuintoAndar, which has developed a real estate marketplace focused on rentals and sales, has seen impressive growth in recent years. And today, the São Paulo-based proptech has announced it has closed on $300 million in a Series E round of funding that values it at an impressive $4 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The round is notable for a few reasons. For one, the valuation – high by any standards but especially for a LatAm company – represents an increase of four times from when QuintoAndar raised a $250 million Series D in September 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">It’s also noteworthy who is backing the company. Silicon Valley-based Ribbit Capital led its Series E financing, which also included participation from SoftBank’s LatAm-focused Innovation Fund, LTS, Maverik, Alta Park, an undisclosed US-based asset manager fund with over $2 trillion in AUM, Kaszek Ventures, Dragoneer and Accel partner Kevin Efrusy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having backed the likes of Coinbase, Robinhood and CreditKarma, Ribbit Capital has historically focused on early-stage investments in the fintech space. Its bet on QuintoAndar represents clear faith in what the company is building, as well as its confidence in the startup’s plans to branch out from its current model into a one-stop real estate shop that also offers mortgage, title, insurance and escrow services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The latest round brings QuintoAndar’s total raised since its 2013 inception to $635 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ribbit Capital Partner Nick Huber said Quintoandar has over the years built “a unique and trusted brand in Brazil” for those looking for a place to call home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Whether you are looking to buy or to rent, QuintoAndar can support customers through the entire transaction process: from browsing verified inventory to signing the final contracts,” Huber told TechCrunch. “The ability to serve customers&#8217; needs through each phase of life and to do so from start to finish is a unique capability, both in Brazil and around the world.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">QuintoAndar describes itself as an “end-to-end solution for long-term rentals” that, among other things, connects potential tenants to landlords and vice versa. Last year, it expanded also into connecting a home buyers to sellers.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2158709" style="width: 565px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2158709" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2158709 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ezgif.com-crop.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="555" height="462" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ezgif.com-crop.jpg 713w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ezgif.com-crop.jpg?resize=150,125 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ezgif.com-crop.jpg?resize=300,250 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ezgif.com-crop.jpg?resize=680,566 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ezgif.com-crop.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2158709" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> QuintoAndar</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">TechCrunch spoke with co-founder and CEO Gabriel Braga and he shared details around the growth that has attracted such a bevy of high-profile investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like most other businesses around the world, QuintoAndar braced itself for the worst when the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year – especially considering one core piece of its business is to guarantee rents to the landlords on its platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In the beginning, we were afraid of the implications of the crisis but we were able to honor our commitments,” Braga said. “In retrospect, the pandemic was a big test for our business model and it has validated the strength and defensibility of our binsess on the credit side and reinforced our value proposition to tenants and landlords. So after the initial scary moments, we actually felt even more confident in the business that we are building.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">QuintoAndar describes itself as “a distant market leader” with more than 100,000 rentals under management and about 10,000 new rentals per month. Its rental platform is live in 40 cities across Brazil, while its homebuying marketplace is live in 4. Part of its plans with the new capital is to expand into new markets within Brazil, as well as in Latin America as a whole.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup claims that, in less than a year, QuintoAndar managed to aggregate the largest inventory among digital transactional platforms. It now offers more than 60,000 properties for sale across Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belho Horizonte and Porto Alegre. To give greater context around the company’s growth of that side of its platform: in its first year of operation, QuintoAndar closed more than 1,000 transactions. It has now surpassed the mark of 8,000 transactions in annualized terms, growing between 50% and 100% quarter over quarter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As for the rentals side of its business, Braga said QuintoAndar has more than 100,000 rentals under management and is closing about 10,000 new rentals per month. The company is not profitable as it&#8217;s focused on growth, although it is unit economics are particularly favorable in certain markets such as Sao Paulo, which is financing some of its growth in other cities, according to Braga.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now, the 2,000-person company is looking to begin its global expansion with plans to enter the Mexican market later this year. With that, Braga said QuintoAndar is looking to hire “top-tier” talent from all over.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We want to invest a lot in our product and tech core,” he said. “So we’re trying to bring in more senior people from abroad, on a global basis.”</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Some history</h2>
<p dir="ltr">CEO Braga and CTO André Penha came up with the idea for QuintoAndar after receiving their MBAs at Stanford University. As many startups do, the company was founded out of Braga’s personal “nightmare” of an experience – in this case, of trying to rent an apartment in Sao Paulo.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The search process, he recalls, was difficult as there was not enough information available online and renters were forced to provide a guarantor, or co-signer, from the same city or pay rent insurance, which Braga described as “very expensive.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Overall, I felt it was a very inefficient and fragmented process with no transparency or tech,” Braga told me at the time of the company’s last raise. “There was all this friction and high cost involved, just real tangible problems to solve.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The concept for QuintoAndar (which can be translated literally to “Fifth Floor” in Portuguese) was born.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Little by little, we created a platform that consolidated supply and inventory in a uniform way,” Braga said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company took the search phase online for the first time, according to Braga. It also eliminated the need for tenants to provide a guarantor, thereby saving them money. On the other side, QuintoAndar also works to help protect the landlord with the guarantee that they will get their rent “on time every month,” Braga said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s been interesting watching the company evolve and grow over time, just as it’s been fascinating seeing the region’s startup scene mature and shine in recent years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ENflGD04wl4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Somehow it&#8217;s Bob Dylan&#8217;s 80th birthday this week. Some of you may not think that&#8217;s a big deal, but I do. The fact of his talent pretty much drowns out most other ideas of what to write about, but here&#8217;s to the birthday boy. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>Back then, we wondered why Dylan kept changing, refusing to be pinned down, going electric, photographed at the Wailing Wall, you name it. We sure were hungry for direction, it seemed. Growing up in the Sixties, everything was possible. After Trump, we&#8217;re rethinking that. Crypto is a grift, better than gold, down 50%, up a third. If I wanted to throw money away, just stand on the corner and hand out NFT&#8217;s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As much as this stuff makes my head hurt, it does make it easier to second guess the Discovery/WarnerMedia and Amazon MGM deals. In a nutshell, streaming has shaken the media world into a massive upheaval. The linear TV big three — NBC, CBS, and ABC — have lost control of our TV sets. Netflix has replaced the idea of advertising supported product (Gray&#8217;s Anatomy, This Is Us) with binge drop shows about chess. No advertising, a monthly subscription fee, and oh, by the way, free shipping. That last one is Amazon Prime, which throws in a version of Netflix with everything we get delivered during the pandemic, which is everything. When we get to the vaccinated New Normal, it will still mean everything.</p>
<p>Many acronyms later, the cable networks look like this: you can go through NBCUniversal now known as Comcast for all your TV plus broadband for all your Internet, or dump all that TV and just use broadband to get to the new TV, now known as streaming. Amazon bundled delivery with streaming (Prime) and studio (MGM). Google bundled streaming (YouTube TV) with advertising (search). Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile bundled broadband with cash, and the first two tried to buy up the studios and talent. 5G is the carrier Waterloo, drowning broadband in debt as it overtakes the previous cable/content cartel.</p>
<p>This is an oversimplified and inaccurate picture of where we are about to be. But central to the shakeout is what we do with this puzzle. The speed with which vaccinations are being distributed suggests a timetable for success in restoring the economy and bridging the gap to 5G and a hybrid bundle of delivery and digital restructuring. Here&#8217;s a trick question: if California has already vaccinated 81% of its population, will Gavin Newsom be recalled as Governor? Here&#8217;s another: who will be the winners of the streaming media reboot? Spoiler alert: the answers to both are related.</p>
<p>As we ease our way into the new vaccinated protocols, we start with our families and build out to our colleagues and friends. In effect, we are building a new cohort that speaks to the dynamics of the digital acceleration. A year ago, delivery was a wartime necessity, not an economic choice. Today, the choice of a restaurant or an event will be made based on the intuitive messages sent by the services. If one venue deals with masking and distancing as a transitional choice for its customers, the underlying message is of an evolving strategy based on changing information. Each day we experience more confidence in science and less fear of the unknown is validation of the new cohort we&#8217;re forming.</p>
<p>Do we miss the movie theater experience? Sure, but not enough to forego the play-from-home cohort we&#8217;ve gotten used to the past year. As our confidence grows, even Zoom calls become more productive and a way of planning for the days when we can reconnect in person. In this cohort process, we build muscle for a new normal that draws strength from both virtual and physical worlds.</p>
<p>Now the dynamic of vaccine success kicks in. Every day, week, month that the virus recedes is marked by the accumulation of a new normal: the more things don&#8217;t change, the better things are. Public officials take credit for backing the right horse. Kids go back to school; companies find the right combination of home office, collaboration room Thursdays, and business travel right-sizing. The new normal cohort develops discounts and incentives for its trailblazers and influencers. Special bundles emerge in subscription streaming, blending advertising-supported discounts in return for bigger production budgets. News subscription services provide cohort access to notification streams, replacing repetitive fear-based programming with science-based alerts and business strategy updates.</p>
<p>Answers: No. California is a blue state. And, we will be the winners of the streaming consolidation — as creators remind Hollywood of their power to validate the direction of how we live in the near present. On this episode of the Gang, I mention a new streaming network, Buki, that has emerged to challenge the old alphabet TV networks with a heady brew of ad-supported binge goodness. Brent Leary interrupts to complain that he doesn&#8217;t have Buki. That&#8217;s because I made it up. Buki, keep up the good work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla has enabled the in-car camera in its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to monitor drivers when its Autopilot advanced driver assistance system is being used.</p>
<p>In a software update, Tesla indicated the &#8220;cabin camera above the rearview mirror can now detect and alert driver inattentiveness while Autopilot is engaged.&#8221; Notably, Tesla has a closed loop system for the data, meaning imagery captured by the camera does not leave the car. The system cannot save of transit information unless data sharing is enabled, according to Tesla. The firmware update was cited by a number of Tesla owners,  industry watchers and bloggers who are <a href="https://twitter.com/WholeMarsBlog/status/1398021788894777345?s=20">active on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Tesla has faced criticism for not activating a driver monitoring system within the vehicle even as evidence mounted that owners were misusing the system. Owners have posted dozens of videos on YouTube and TikTok abusing the Autopilot system — some of whom have filmed themselves sitting in the backseat as vehicle drives along the highway. Several fatal crashes involving Tesla vehicles that had Autopilot engaged has put more pressure on the company to act.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Until now, Tesla has not used the camera installed in its vehicles and instead relied on sensors in the steering wheel that measured torque — a method that is supposed to require the driver to keep their hands on the wheel. Drivers have documented and shared on social media how to trick the sensors into thinking a human is holding the wheel.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Delivery was super smooth. Summon and lane departure avoidance disabled for now, increased follow distance, hard cap at 75, requires auto brights or kicks out of AP, cabin camera for driver monitoring.. nothing unexpected yet. <a href="https://t.co/gKIkHSGNI7">pic.twitter.com/gKIkHSGNI7</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kevin Smith (@spleck) <a href="https://twitter.com/spleck/status/1398015162255298560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;Consumer Reports has been calling for camera-based driver monitoring systems for automation systems like Tesla&#8217;s AutoPilot for years,&#8221; Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at CR told TechCrunch. &#8220;Tesla&#8217;s current system of sensing torque on the wheel cannot tell if the driver is looking at the road. If the new system proves effective, it could help prevent distraction and be a major improvement for safety &#8211; potentially saving lives. We hope that other cars are updated soon, and are looking forward to evaluating them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla didn&#8217;t share details about the driver monitoring system — for instance, is it tracking eye gaze or head position — or whether it will be used to allow hands-free driving. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/gm-is-working-on-a-hands-off-advanced-driving-system-for-city-streets/">GM&#8217;s Super Cruise</a> and Ford&#8217;s Blue Cruise advanced driver assistance systems allow for hands-free driving on certain divided highways. Their systems use a combination of map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system that monitors the person behind the wheel, to ensure drivers are paying attention.</p>
<p>Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system branded as Autopilot. For an additional $10,000, owners can buy &#8220;full self-driving,&#8221; or FSD &#8212; a feature that CEO Elon Musk promises will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities. FSD, which has steadily increased in price and capability, has been available as an option for years.</p>
<p>However, Tesla vehicles are not self-driving. FSD includes the parking feature Summon as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes. Once drivers enter a destination into the navigation system, they can enable &#8220;Navigate on Autopilot&#8221; for that trip.</p>
<p>The move comes just a week after Tesla tweeted that its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles bound for North American customers are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/tesla-is-no-longer-using-radar-sensors-in-model-3-and-model-y-vehicles-built-in-north-america/">being built without radar</a>, fulfilling a desire by Musk to only use cameras combined with machine learning to support Autopilot and other active safety features.</p>
<p>Automakers typically use a combination of radar and cameras &#8212; and even lidar &#8212; to provide the sensing required to deliver advanced driver assistance system features like adaptive cruise control, which matches the speed of a car to surrounding traffic, as well as lane keeping and automatic lane changes. Musk has touted the potential of its branded &#8220;Tesla Vision&#8221; system, which only uses cameras and so-called neural net processing to detect and understand what is happening in the environment surrounding the vehicle and then respond appropriately.</p>
<p>The decision to pull radar out of the vehicles has caused some blowback for the company. Consumer Reports no longer lists the Model 3 as a Top Pick and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said it plans to remove the Model 3&#8217;s Top Safety Pick+ designation. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration has said that Model 3 and Model Y vehicles built on or after April 27, 2021 will no longer receive the agency&#8217;s check mark for automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning, lane departure warning and dynamic brake support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As startups and venture capital grow in tandem, fundraising has gone from a formal affair on Sand Hill Road to a process that can happen anywhere from Twitter to Zoom.</p>
<p>While fundraising may no longer require a trip to California, it might depend on whether you got an invite to a private audio app. And while you may not need to be an insider, second-time founders &#8212; largely male and white &#8212; still have a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If your intention is to build a company that you want to own and run indefinitely, and/or to grow more slowly and take fewer risks, traditional venture capital is not right for what you want to build.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The growing complexity of fundraising has the opportunity to make tech either inclusive or exclusive. For new founders looking to raise money, let&#8217;s dismantle the myths about raising your first check and instead focus on how investors and other successful founders describe the nuance needed to secure money.</p>
<h2>What makes my business venture-worthy?</h2>
<p>This question is existential, but it should be at the forefront throughout your journey as a founder. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethyin">Elizabeth Yin</a>, founding partner of Hustle Fund, says startups should be able to hit one of two goals: Reach $100 million ARR by its fifth year or get to $1 billion in valuation in the same time period.</p>
<p>“This is hard to do. And most businesses will never get there &#8212; not for a lack of trying &#8212; but there&#8217;s a lot of luck whether your idea has that much demand that quickly,” she added.</p>
<p>“I think you will know in the first year or two how &#8216;easy&#8217; or &#8216;hard&#8217; it is to get customers and whether you think on that trajectory you can get to $100 million a year in a few years,” Yin said. “And if it&#8217;s really hard, it doesn&#8217;t mean you throw in the towel. … There are many great companies that are not VC-backable where the founders will make a lot of money, but it just means you need to think through where to get your financing. Perhaps it&#8217;s from angels. Perhaps it&#8217;s from revenue-based financing funds. Perhaps it&#8217;s from customer crowdfunding.”</p>
<p>While VC is the flashy gold medal, the rapid growth of emerging fund managers means that a first check can be piecemealed together from a variety of different sources. The options for financing are seemingly endless: syndicates, public crowdfunding, VC firms, accelerators, debt financing, rolling funds, and, for the profitable few, bootstrapping.</p>
<p>“When people go around saying, ‘Do you want to run a VC-backable company?’ that feels weird &#8212; you don&#8217;t necessarily get to pick how fast you can grow &#8212; the market just may or may not be there,” Yin said. “There&#8217;s a lot of luck with that.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lesliefeinzaig">Leslie Feinzaig</a>, founder of Female Founders Collective, said that beyond economics, the hardest part of knowing whether your startup makes sense as a VC-backed business is understanding your own goals as an entrepreneur.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Thursday, May 27. From the home desk, TechCrunch has a few notes to share. First, we’re hosting a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/just-12-hours-left-to-apply-to-startup-battlefield-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">virtual meetup in Pittsburgh</a> as part of our national tour spotlighting neat startup markets. And if you are a super early-stage founder, you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/just-12-hours-left-to-apply-to-startup-battlefield-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">can still apply to take part in the upcoming Battlefield competition at Disrupt</a>. Do it. It’s going to be a blast. See you at both! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lots of people are working on NFTs: </strong>Whether you’re a crypto fan or not, you’ve heard of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. If you have already digested the NBA TopShot hype wave, buckle in, because a lot of folks are still building in the NFT world. That includes Anima, which is bringing AR to NFTs and <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/augmented-reality-nft-platform-anima-gets-backing-from-coinbase/">just raised new capital from Coinbase</a></strong>, and Infinite Objects, which <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/dapper-labs-backs-art-hardware-startup-infinite-objects-in-6-million-seed-raise/">just raised $6 million to help folks bring their NFTs IRL</a></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Europe probes American clouds: </strong>Here at Daily Crunch, we’ve noted a number of government-and-tech stories in recent weeks, none of them positive. Today’s news is another note in that particular theme, with <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/riptari">Natasha</a></strong> reporting that “<strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">Europe’s lead data protection regulator has opened two investigations into EU institutions’ use of cloud services from U.S. cloud giants</a></strong>.”</li>
<li><strong>A window into the economics of fintech: </strong>Also out today was news that Acorns, an American consumer fintech company that helps regular folks save and invest their money, is going public via a blank-check company. We <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/acorns-spac-listing-depicts-a-consumer-fintech-business-with-a-saasy-revenue-mix/">dug into its results</a></strong>, learning that such fintech startups can build great businesses. It’s just expensive to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<p>We have our usual mix of funding rounds below, but first a note on diversity in the venture capital world. Collab Capital this week announced a $50 million fund to invest in Black founders, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/collab-capital-closes-50-million-debut-fund-for-black-founders/">which TechCrunch covered here</a>. And today we wrote about a $250 million growth fund that will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/this-250-million-growth-fund-will-divert-half-its-profits-to-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/">reserve half its profits to donate to historically Black colleges and universities</a>. More of this, please.</p>
<p>Now, the day’s hottest funding rounds:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/breinify-announces-11m-seed-to-bring-data-science-to-the-marketing-team/"><strong>Breinify raises $11M to bring data science to marketing</strong></a><strong>: </strong>A good theme in tech recently has been bringing capabilities previously reserved for the technically trained to teams of nontechnical folks. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/">No-code does this at times</a>, for example. Breinify is doing something related, namely “working to apply data science to personalization, and do it in a way that makes it accessible to nontechnical marketing employees to build more meaningful customer experiences,” according to TechCrunch. For marketing teams currently stuck waiting for the engineering team to get back to them, this will prove more than welcome.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/revenuecat-raises-40m-series-b-for-its-in-app-subscription-platform/"><strong>RevenueCat raises $40M to help developers leverage in-app subscriptions</strong></a><strong>: </strong>RevenueCat now has a huge new check at a $300 million valuation, but more than that, it’s changed its cost structure, offering different tiers of service that are priced not on a per-head basis, but on how much revenue a company is tracking at any given point in time (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/the-future-of-saas-is-on-demand-use-experts-to-drive-growth-and-engagement/">on-demand pricing is hot</a>). RevenueCat, you can math out, costs 0.8% to 1.2% cut of tracked revenue, depending on what sort of functionality a company needs. For anyone building in-app subscriptions and looking for help, RevenueCat wants to be cheap to start and lucrative as its customers scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/between-a-rock-and-a-farm-raise/"><strong>And then there were robots</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bheater">Brian Heater</a> compiled a super great look at the world of robotics startups and their recent fundraising. TerraClear recently raised $25 million for its rock-picking-up tractor-robot. Bowery Farms recently raised $300 million as we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/indoor-farming-company-bowery-raises-300m/">noted</a> here at Daily Crunch, but we failed to mention how “robots, sensors and AI are a big part of [its] vertical farming approach.” Very cool.</p>
<p>Heater has more notes in the posts, but the key takeaway is that not every robot comes from the weird place between Uncanny Valley and Boston Dynamics.</p>
<h2>SaaS needs to take a page out of the crypto playbook</h2>
<p>It seems like a great time to launch a SaaS startup, but the landscape is crowded with well-designed applications that promise &#8220;blazingly fast and delightfully simple&#8221; experiences.</p>
<p>Most of these will fail, but not because of a marketing campaign or server downtime. In most cases, SaaS startups fall victim to what seed-stage investor John Chen of Fika Ventures calls &#8220;the myth of frictionless onboarding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the hype, enterprise companies are always asking us to learn how to use new tools. &#8220;Just like with a new fitness program, participants feel good after completing the workout, but it takes a lot of activation energy to start and hard work to get there,&#8221; says Chen.</p>
<p>Instead of putting the onus on customers to roll up their sleeves, SaaS startups should learn from cryptocurrency culture and find ways to &#8220;incentivize users to do the necessary work to have the right experience.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today we’re mostly talking about Twitter, but before we do, is Ford about to win a chunk of the electric vehicle market? Two years ago I would have scoffed at the notion, but between what feel like strong pre-orders <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">for its electric pickup</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">a huge bet on internal battery R&amp;D, it’s now a question worth asking</a>.</p>
<p>On the Twitter front, there are two things to know. First, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-says-concerned-with-india-intimidation-requests-3-more-months-to-comply-with-new-it-rules/">Twitter is not taking incoming fire from the current Indian government sitting down</a>. And, second, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/twitter-spaces-will-be-available-for-web-including-accessibility-features/">Twitter’s product work has been pretty fast-paced lately</a>, which is more than welcome.</p>
<p>Regarding India, TechCrunch’s Manish Singh reports that “Twitter called the recent visit by police to its Indian offices a form of intimidation and said it was concerned by some of the requirements in New Delhi’s new IT rules.” Good.</p>
<p>Here at Daily Crunch, we called the matter attempted intimidation, so it’s nice to see the company also stating the obvious. And fighting back. The Indian government’s push to censor Twitter smacks of a CCP-style crackdown on speech that the ruling regime deems too true to be read. Down with that sort of thinking.</p>
<p>On the product front, Twitter is rolling out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Clubhouse-competing Spaces product</a> to desktop machines. Normally I’d skip such an incremental Twitter feature, but in this case it fits into the recent rapid-fire product cadence from the social network, which was famously slow for years and years. Then something changed, allowing the company to ship all sorts of products and services. The company’s even moving toward some sort of email newsletter-subscription-audio-tipping product amalgamation that could prove to be very, very interesting to creators.</p>
<p>Who expected to be excited by Twitter’s dev team this year? It’s a nice surprise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Darryl Finkton Jr. is a man on a mission.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He believes there’s enough money in the world to help put an end to poverty. But only if it’s distributed differently than it is today.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, the investor left a career in asset management to launch a $1 billion venture fund aimed at eradicating poverty. It’s an ambitious goal, but Finkton Jr. has a plan. And now he’s raised $200 million as an initial close to help execute that plan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Finkton aims to raise $1 billion with the fund to provide venture capital to entrepreneurs from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds who are working to solve the pressing problems facing their communities. He is managing the fund, and has invested $500,000 of his own capital to launch it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finkton grew up in housing projects in Indianapolis, Indiana, and went to Harvard to study neurobiology. He then attended Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and got involved in economic development before founding a VC firm focused on health tech investments. Most recently, Finkton worked as a partner at a hedge fund.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But his upbringing was never far from his mind, and Finkton knew that he wanted to do more to help people who didn’t have the same opportunities or access as others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In my household, we often struggled to make ends meet and put food on the table. More family members than I care to count have died from the dire circumstances that extreme poverty creates,” Finkton recalls. “Although I was able to overcome obstacles and ultimately graduated from both Harvard and Oxford, I remain intimately aware of the countless difficulties one faces when your next meal is not promised.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">So earlier this year, he left his job as a hedge fund partner to promote the adoption of a universal basic income to end poverty in the U.S. with the help of venture dollars via his EPMT (<a href="https://www.endpovertymaketrillions.com/">End Poverty. Make Trillions.</a>) fund.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All fund profits will be reinvested into helping the country’s poorest communities, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This summer, he plans to lead a 60-day tour of several dozen cities, towns and Native American reservations with “the poorest ZIP codes in America” with the goal of drumming up support for a universal basic income at the federal poverty guidelines (<a href="https://www.endpovertymaketrillions.com/">UBI@FPG</a>).  (He also intends to create a <a href="https://youtu.be/-6IUAiV4F6o">documentary</a> of the process).</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to supporting state and local efforts, Finkton is also pushing for federal legislation guaranteeing a universal basic income at or above the federal poverty guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So far, the EPMT fund has invested in 15 companies, including <a href="https://www.elpidatec.com/">Elpidatec</a>, a telehealth platform aimed at treating opioid addiction; <a href="https://www.commissary.club/">Commissary Club</a>, a job site and social network for people with criminal records; <a href="http://www.snowballwealth.com/">Snowball Wealth</a>, which offers free student loan planning to help people tackle debt; and <a href="https://maials.com/">Maia Life Sciences</a>, which is working to develop evidence-based, culturally informed group interventions for underrepresented and vulnerable populations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finkton believes that the U.S. is spending “trillions” on perpetuating the poverty cycle through various programs such as welfare. Instead, he wants to empower people in poverty to work their way out.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“These programs treat the symptoms of poverty, not the root cause &#8212; which is not having money,” he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finkton maintains that a universal basic income at the federal poverty guidelines (UBI@FPG) can end financial poverty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The economic costs of childhood poverty alone are $1 trillion a year. If we provide UBI@FPG to every American and simply tax back that income for those already well above the federal poverty guideline, the net cost for eradicating poverty drops to below $200 billion,” Finkton maintains. “That is an annual return of $800 billion. Over 10 years, UBI@FPG would generate a return of over $8 trillion, save 1.7 million lives, and lift 34 million Americans out of poverty.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are some who may argue that lower-income populations will just use any money they get to buy drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finkton believes it’s the opposite.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve done a lot of pilots and when someone is so poor, they can’t afford food, clothing or shelter, that’s the first thing they do, when they get money,” he told TechCrunch. “These communities often use drugs as a way to cope,” he said. “Once you give them hope and opportunity, they’re not as depressed and there’s actually less alcohol, drug and tobacco use.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chad Doe, founder and CEO of EPMT portfolio company Maia Life Sciences, tells TechCrunch that his biotech startup aims to initially investigate the potential of psychedelics to help people with substance abuse issues via facilitated group clinical trials. The ultimate goal of the three-year-old Los Angeles-based company is to receive FDA approval so that people with addictions, globally, can have more options. Those clinical trials, he said, will be conducted by mostly women of color and include participants that are not mostly white or of European descent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In many cases, he said, trial participants and investigators “are not representative of the real world.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Doe also believes that more money is spent on surveillance, policing and punishment tactics that disproportionately target and impact people of color, low-income people and non-citizens rather than toward actually helping them emerge from their situations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The War on Drugs is really a war on the poor,” he said. “At Maia, we&#8217;re placing women and underserved populations at the center of the research and development to find effective treatments for substance use disorders.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/">Box</a> executives have been dealing with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">activist investor Starboard Value</a> over the last year, along with fighting through the pandemic like the rest of us. Today <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2021/Box-Reports-Strong-Fiscal-First-Quarter-2022-Financial-Results/">the company reported earnings</a> for the first quarter of its fiscal 2022. Overall, it was a good quarter for the cloud content management company.</p>
<p>The firm reported revenue of $202.4 million, up 10% compared to its year-ago result, numbers that beat Box projections of between $200 million to $201 million. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/box-gears-report-q1-earnings-154003929.html">Yahoo Finance reports</a> the analyst consensus was $200.5 million, so the company also bested street expectations.</p>
<p>The company has faced strong headwinds the past year, in spite of a climate that has been generally favorable to cloud companies like Box. A report like this was badly needed by the company as it faces<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/starboard-value-puts-box-on-notice-that-its-looking-to-take-over-board/"> a board fight with Starboard</a> over its direction and leadership.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie is hoping this report will mark the beginning of a positive trend. “I think you&#8217;ve got a better economic climate right now for IT investment. And then secondarily, I think the trends of hybrid work, and the sort of long-term trends of digital transformation are very much supportive of our strategy,” he told TechCrunch in a post-earnings interview.</p>
<p>While Box <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">acquired e-signature startup SignRequest</a> in February, it won’t actually be incorporating that functionality into the platform until this summer. Levie said that what’s been driving the modest revenue growth <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/21/box-introduces-box-shield-with-increased-security-controls-and-threat-protection/">is Box Shield</a>, the company’s content security product and the platform tools, which enable customers to customize workflows and build applications on top of Box.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wji0qUXXdp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">As activist investors loom, what’s next for Box?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As activist investors loom, what’s next for Box?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/embed/#?secret=wji0qUXXdp" data-secret="wji0qUXXdp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company is also seeing success with large accounts. Levie says that he saw the number of customers spending more than $100,000 with it grow by nearly 50% compared to the year-ago quarter. One of Box&#8217;s growth strategies has been to expand the platform and then upsell additional platform services over time, and those numbers suggest that the effort is working.</p>
<p>While Levie was keeping his M&amp;A cards close to the vest, he did say if the right opportunity came along to fuel additional growth through acquisition, he would definitely give strong consideration to further inorganic growth. “We&#8217;re going to continue to be very thoughtful on M&amp;A. So we will only do M&amp;A that we think is attractive in terms of price and the ability to accelerate our roadmap, or the ability to get into a part of a market that we&#8217;re not currently in,” Levie said.</p>
<h2>A closer look at the financials</h2>
<p>Box managed modest growth acceleration for the quarter, existing only if we consider the company’s results on a sequential basis. In simpler terms, Box’s newly reported 10% growth in the first quarter of its fiscal 2022 was better than the 8% growth it earned during the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2021, but worse than the 13% growth it managed in its year-ago Q1.</p>
<p>With Box, however, instead of judging it by normal rules, we’re hunting in its numbers each quarter for signs of promised acceleration. By that standard, Box met its own goals.</p>
<p>How did investors react? Shares of the company were mixed after-hours, including a sharp dip and recovery in the value of its equity. The street appears to be confused by the results, weighing the report and working out whether its moderately accelerating growth is sufficiently enticing to warrant holding onto its equity, or more perversely if its growth is not expansive enough to fend off external parties hunting for more dramatic changes at the firm.</p>

<p>Sticking to a high-level view of Box’s results, apart from its growth numbers Box has done a good job shaking fluff out of its operations. The company’s operating margins (GAAP and not) improved, and cash generation also picked up.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, Box raised its guidance from “the range of $840 million to $848 million” to “$845 to $853 million.” Is that a lot? No. It’s +$5 million to both the lower and upper-bounds of its targets. But if you squint, the company’s Q4 to Q1 revenue acceleration, and upgraded guidance, could be an early indicator of a return to form.</p>
<p>Levie admitted that 2020 was a tough year for Box. “Obviously, last year was a complicated year in terms of the macro environment, the pandemic, just lots of different variables to deal with…” he said. But the CEO continues to think that his organization is set up for future growth.</p>
<p>Will Box manage to perform well enough to keep activist shareholders content? Levie thinks if he can string together more quarters like this one, he can keep Starboard at bay. “I think when you look at the next three quarters, the ability to guide up on revenue, the ability to guide up on profitability. We think it&#8217;s a very very strong earnings report and we think it shows a lot of the momentum in the business that we have right now.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery startups like <a href="https://gorillas.io/">Gorillas</a> are invading Europe right now, but although on-demand-everything is kinda old-hat in the Bay Area, a new startup thinks it might just be able to do something new.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foodrocket.me/">Food Rocket</a> says it has raised a $2 million investment round from AltaIR Capital, Baring Vostok fund and the Angelsdeck group of business angels, including Philipp Bashyan, of Russia’s Yonder, who has joined as an investor and advisor.</p>
<p>Yes, admittedly, this tiny startup is competing with DoorDash, GoPuff, InstaCart and Amazon Fresh. Maybe let’s not get into that…</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Using the company’s mobile app, users can order fresh groceries, ready-to-eat meals and household goods that will be delivered within 10-15 minutes, says the startup, which will be servicing SoMa, South Park, Mission Bay, Japantown, Hayes Valley and other areas. The company hopes to open 150 &#8220;dark stores&#8221; on the West Coast as part of its infrastructure.</p>
<p>Vitaly Aleksandrov, CEO, and co-founder of Food Rocket, said: “The level of competition in this market in the U.S. is still manageable, which is why we have the opportunity to become leaders in the sphere of fast delivery of basic products and household goods. We aim to replace brick-and-mortar supermarkets and to change consumers’ current habits in regards to grocery shopping.”</p>
<p>What can we say? Good luck?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">First Move Capital, the Boulder-based venture firm that has invested in used car marketplaces Frontier Auto Group and Vroom as well as mobility-as-a-service startup Via, has closed a new $150 million fund that will focus on the automotive and transportation sectors.</p>
<p>Existing strategic investors such as OEMs, dealers, distributors, fleet management, remarketing, insurance and software providers as well as family offices have backed the fund. Proceeds from the round will be exclusively allocated to new investments, the company said Thursday.</p>
<p>FM Capital has already made seven investments from the oversubscribed fund, including autonomous vehicle startup Gatik, cloud-based automotive retail platform Tekion and e-commerce startup Revolution Parts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We hit our hard cap in the max that we could raise, but have deployed a minority of that amount so we&#8217;re still very much, actively investing and will be for the next couple of years,&#8221; Managing Partner Mark Norman said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>FM Capital launched in 2012 with a $40 million fund that invested in auto commerce and dealership technologies as well as other broader retail and enterprise software startups. Its second fund, which more than doubled to $90 million, is when FM Capital became an automotive-focused VC interested in auto commerce, autonomy and sensors, connectivity, electrification and shared mobility. FM Capital typically invests between $5 million to $10 million in companies with what the partners view as &#8220;transformative solutions in transportation&#8221; typically at the Series A stage. FM Capital will sometimes do a later seed round where there&#8217;s commercial traction and revenue, said Norman, who noted that in this new fund the firm has already completed one seed deal out of the seven investments it has made so far.</p>
<p>FM Capital has backed a total of 40 companies based in North America, Europe and Tel Aviv.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility/embed/#?secret=VurGjqRrxL" data-secret="VurGjqRrxL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Looking ahead, Norman sees opportunities stemming from the rising number of EVs and other forms of propulsion besides internal combustion engines.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see there&#8217;s just a huge transformation going on with propulsion, a lot driven, of course, by government mandates around the world,&#8221; Norman said. &#8220;Alternative fuels and distribution and related service infrastructure is going through a ton of flux right now. That&#8217;s everything from the technology going into propulsion in vehicles — that shift from internal combustion to in large part, EVs — and how that affects downstream service infrastructure, how it affects marketplaces like residual values, and how you estimate that and understand what a vehicle is worth over its lifecycle.&#8221;</p>
<p>For instance, Norman pointed to FM Capital&#8217;s latest investment into a startup called Indigo Technologies, which has developed a vehicle platform with an in-wheel motor and suspension that frees up space.</p>
<p>There also continues to be a lot of software opportunities, especially as more vehicles hit the marketplace with embedded connectivity, Norman said. He also noted additional opportunities in enterprise software.</p>
<p>&#8220;What had been a very fragmented retail environment continues to consolidate — whether we&#8217;re talking about car rentals, car dealers or fleet management — and their appetite for centrally driven tools and data is also much higher than that in the past. That&#8217;s real opportunity on the enterprise software side of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plus is applying autonomous driving technology to launch supervised autonomous trucks today in order to dramatically improve safety, efficiency and driver comfort, while addressing critical challenges in long-haul trucking — driver shortage and high turnover, rising fuel costs and reaching sustainability goals. Mass production of our supervised autonomous driving solution, PlusDrive, starts this summer. In the next few years, tens of thousands of heavy trucks powered by PlusDrive will be on the road. Plus’s COO and co-founder Shawn Kerrigan will introduce PlusDrive and our progress of deploying this driver-in solution globally. He will also share our learnings from working together with world-leading OEMs and fleet partners to develop and deploy autonomous trucks at scale.</p>

<p>With remote work becoming the new normal and the mass movement from the city to the Japanese countryside, the trend of private car ownership is growing day by day. During this session, we’ll be hearing from Sae Hyung Jung, serial entrepreneur, founder and CEO of oVice. oVice is an agile communication tool that facilitates hybrid remote and virtual meetups. Most notably, a hope that can trigger a sudden expansion in the Japanese mobility and vehicle infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Regular supply launches keep astronauts aboard the ISS supplied with relatively fresh food, but a flight to Mars won&#8217;t get deliveries. If we&#8217;re going to visit other planets, we&#8217;ll need a fridge that doesn&#8217;t break down in space — and Purdue University researchers are hard at work testing one.</p>
<p>You may think there&#8217;s nothing to prevent a regular refrigerator from working in space. It sucks heat out and puts cold air in. Simple, right? But refrigerators rely on gravity to distribute oil through the compressor system that regulates temperature, so in space these systems don&#8217;t work or break down quickly.</p>
<p>The solution being pursued by Purdue team and partner manufacturer Air Squared is an oil-free version of the traditional fridge that will work regardless of gravity&#8217;s direction or magnitude. It was funded by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/how-to-access-americas-seed-fund-the-3-billion-sbir-program/"> NASA&#8217;s SBIR program</a>, which awards money to promising small businesses and experiments in order to inch them toward mission readiness. (The program is currently on its Phase II extended period award.)</p>

<p>In development for two years, the team at last assembled a flight-ready prototype, and last month was <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q2/to-give-astronauts-better-food,-engineers-test-a-fridge-prototype-in-microgravity.html">finally able to test it in microgravity</a> simulated in a parabolic plane flight.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0pFySXLJJA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Initial results are promising: The fridge worked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that the refrigeration cycles operated continuously in microgravity during the tests without any apparent problems indicates that our design is a very good start,&#8221; said Leon Brendel, a Ph.D. student on the team. &#8220;Our first impression is that microgravity does not alter the cycle in ways that we were not aware of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Short-term microgravity (the prototype was only weightless for 20 seconds at a time) is just a limited test, of course, and it already helped shake out an issue with the device that they&#8217;re working on. But the next test might be a longer-term installation aboard the ISS, the denizens of which would no doubt like to have a working fridge.</p>
<p>While the prospect of cold drinks and frozen (but not freeze-dried) meals is tantalizing, a normal refrigerator could be used for all kinds of scientific work as well. Experiments that need cold environments currently either use complicated, small scale cooling mechanisms or utilize the near-absolute-zero conditions of space. So it&#8217;s no surprise NASA got them aboard the microgravity simulator as part of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/features/a-space-fridge-for-long-duration-missions.html">Flight Opportunities program</a>.</p>
<p>Analysis of the data collected on the flights is ongoing, but the success of this first big test validates both the approach and execution of the space fridge. Next up is figuring out how it might work in the limited space and continuous microgravity of the ISS.</p>
