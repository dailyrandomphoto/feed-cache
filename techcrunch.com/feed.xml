										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fintech </span><a href="https://www.acorns.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acorns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plans to go public later this year, it has named former Twitter and DreamWorks animation exec Rich Sullivan to serve as its new chief financial officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvine, California-based Acorns announced in May its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/acorns-spac-listing-depicts-a-consumer-fintech-business-with-a-saasy-revenue-mix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intent to go public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by merging with publicly traded special purpose acquisition company Pioneer Merger Corp. The SPAC values the fintech company at $2.2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan joins Acorns from Twitter, where he led corporate finance and FP&amp;A. Prior to Twitter, he held executive positions at STX Entertainment and DreamWorks Animation, where he served as the company’s Deputy CFO. Sullivan has also held various roles at AT&amp;T.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188319" style="width: 279px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188319" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188319 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rich-sullivan-headshot.jpeg?w=269" alt="" width="269" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rich-sullivan-headshot.jpeg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rich-sullivan-headshot.jpeg?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rich-sullivan-headshot.jpeg?resize=269,300 269w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/rich-sullivan-headshot.jpeg?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188319" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rich Sullivan / Acorns</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acorns CEO Noah Kerner told TechCrunch that he was drawn to the executive&#8217;s experience in subscriptions, family and in “high-growth” technology as he thought about the consumer fintech’s long-term roadmap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those are obviously all really relevant to what we&#8217;re doing at Acorns,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2012 inception, the company has evolved its offering to also include investment services, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/acorns-scoops-up-pillar-a-fintech-backed-by-kleiner-perkins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debt management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a product aimed at children, Acorns Kids. It has more than 4 million subscribers that have invested nearly $10 billion through its app. The company touts nearly 99% monthly retention, and has the ambitious goal of reaching 10 million subscribers by 2025, according to Kerner. This year, he is projecting 60% to 70% CAGR growth.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Sullivan believes that his experience of more than two decades of working for several public companies in various roles will be valuable to Acorns in the process of going public.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told TechCrunch he was drawn to the company’s “mission-driven approach to put responsible tools of wealth in everyone&#8217;s hands by making investing easy and accessible to a large portion of the market that basically is underserved from the financial services industry, at least in the traditional sense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it&#8217;s uniquely positioned as a high-growth business and also an interesting space that sits at the cross-section of fintech services and social responsibility,” Sullivan added. “As an industry leader with over 4 million subscribers with a really large addressable market, I think Acorns has an opportunity to be one of the most impactful companies in the space.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along that vein, Acorns launched </span><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/financial-professionals/investment-strategies/sustainable?cid=ppc%3AQ221Sustainable%3AMULTI%3ABrand%3APMS%3AUS%3ANA&amp;gclid=69a83feaee6b1690f74c5ef83de5cff8&amp;gclsrc=3p.ds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESG portfolios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also known as sustainable portfolios, that are powered by Blackrock shares. (ESG stands for E</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nvironmental, Social, &amp; Governance)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Kerner said the move was in part driven by customer demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strategy there is really to allow our customers to not just invest in themselves, but also in a better planet,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The role is not a newly created one for the popular saving and investing app. Jasmine Lee has served a dual role as chief operating officer and CFO, and helped prep Acorns for the public market. She will now focus on executing Acorn’s strategic plan and overseeing the day to day operations as COO, the company said.</span></p>

<p class="p3">For sales representatives, commissions are source of motivation—and frustration, too. Commission structures are often complex, and become even more labyrinthine as companies grow. “There is a standard fee, then there’s an implementation fee, there could be a multiplier bonus, there could be accelerators when you reach your quota and get higher quota numbers,” explained Siva Rajamani, the co-founder and chief executive officer of no-code sales commission automation platform <a href="https://www.everstage.com/">Everstage</a>. A lot of this is calculated on spreadsheets by finance teams, so salespeople have limited visibility into how much they are earning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Everstage was created to provide more transparency about sales commissions. Sales representatives and other customer-facing employees get real-time data about their performance. They can also use Everstage to forecast the potential commissions form their deals pipeline, giving them incentive to close more sales. The platform uses a modular system, so as companies grow, they can add more automated commission calculations without having to code anything.</p>
<p class="p3">Founded in 2020, the platform’s early customers include notable SaaS companies like Chargebee, Postman and Lamdatest. Everstage announced today that it has raised a $1.7 million seed round led by<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/3one4-capital-launches-100m-fund-to-back-early-stage-startups-in-india/"> 3One4 Capital</a>. Angel investors included Rippling co-founder Prasanna Sankar; Chargebee co-founders Krish Subramanian and Rajaraman Santhanam; Freshworks chief revenue officer Sidharth Malik; Conga chief technology officer Koti Reddy; <a href="http://Ally.io"><span class="s1">Ally.io</span></a> CEO Vetri Vellore; and RFPIO CEO Ganesh Shankar. The company is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, with an office in Chennai, India.</p>
<p class="p3">Before starting Everstage with Vivek Suriyamoorthy, the startup’s chief technology officer, Rajamani served as the head of business SaaS provider Freshworks’ global revenue operations team, working closely with sales representatives. During his tenure, Freshworks’ annual recurring revenue grew from $30 million a year to $300 million.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Freshworks raises $150M Series H on $3.5B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/freshworks-raises-150m-series-h-on-3-5b-valuation/embed/#?secret=NZYY2SRBRt" data-secret="NZYY2SRBRt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p class="p3">Rajamani told TechCrunch that a lot of early-stage startups put more than 10% of their budget toward commissions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p3">“Commissions obviously motivate and drive performance from these teams, but what started as a way to motivate gradually became a point of distrust because none of these folks had visibility into how they’re getting paid,” he said. “Plans got complex, and pretty much any salesperson you speak to at these companies will say they have their own shadow accounting.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“Shadow accounting” means salespeople keep their own records of the deals they close and calculate commissions by themselves. But the process can be tedious, especially if their calculations don’t match financial teams. This problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, because salespeople can’t walk over to the finance department and ask about the status of their commissions.</p>
<p class="p3">Sometimes this results in high turnover as frustrated salespeople leave for companies that offer them more clarity about their earnings potential.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“People want to chose companies that are very transparent about their commissions process and how their quotas are set, because that’s the only way they can assure themselves they can make money,” Rajamani said. “Otherwise promises made on paper are just on paper.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188518" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188518" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?w=150" alt="A screenshot of Everstage's dashboard for sales representatives, with data about their commissions" width="600" height="386" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png 3168w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=1536,989 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=2048,1319 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Everstage-dashboard-for-sales-reps.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188518" class="wp-caption-text">Everstage&#8217;s dashboard for sales representatives</p></div></p>
<p class="p3">Having visibility also motivates people. Everstage’s gamification features allows salespeople to look at their current quotas and deals pipeline, and forecast how much they can potentially earn, broken down by their commission plans, including deal attainment, implementation fees and multiplier bonuses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">“At the end of the day, incentives and particular criteria, like multiplier bonuses, drive salespeople to close more contracts, or multi-year contracts,” Rajamani said. “If they can see how much more commission they can make if they close a deal as a multi-year contract, then it’s an added incentive.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Everstage is currently works primarily with SaaS companies, but also sees inbound interest from insurance, real estate, pharmaceuticals and biotech. The platform is sector-agnostic and can be customized for different types of commission plans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Rajamani notes that sales commissions management software is not a new area. For example, players like SAP CallidusCloud and Xactly have been around for years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Over the last year, newer sales commissions platforms have also raised, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/captivateiq-raises-46m-for-its-no-code-sales-commissions-platform/CaptivateIQ">CaptivateIQ</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/automating-payments-for-the-corporate-sales-force-leads-to-a-10-million-windfall-for-spiff/">Spiff</a>. This is in part because many high-growth companies have adjusted incentives for their sales team as they work remotely during the pandemic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">There is some overlap between Everstage’s features and its competitors, but its main differentiators are its modular approach and emphasis on gamification. “We want to move away from automating busywork for revenue operations and finance, and move towards the gamification aspect, so the gamification is an additional module,” he said. “Other indicators—quota setting, target setting and overall company targets broken down by percentage, managers, regions—all those are also there.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">In a statement about the funding, 3One4 Capital Anurag Ramdasan said, “As customer acquisition and retention have increased in complexity with more roles and workflows than ever, Rev Ops teams have become mandatory to align incentives and drive revenue. With their considerable experience, the Everstage founding team is well-positioned to help Rev Ops teams succeed, starting with real-time commission planning and visibility, and we’re excited to partner with them.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Baby Boomers (aged 57-75 at this point) and Gen X (aged 41-56) head into their dotage, they are no longer the “senior citizens” of yore, being still active and, often, healthy. But leaving work means they lose about half of their social network,  which has a negative impact on wellbeing. Plus, the pandemic <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/coronavirus/2021/07/19/the-silent-covid-nightmare-loneliness/">increased loneliness</a> levels with COVID lockdowns.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mirthy.co.uk/">Mirthy’s</a> platform allows over 60s to host or participate in free or ’affordable’ activities, socialising online and eventually offline as well. It’s aiming to become the “go-to platform for all over 60s’ social, physical and financial needs” thus capturing an increasingly large and wealthy market.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $1.1M pre-Seed funding led by Ascension’s &#8216;Fair By Design&#8217; fund, with participation from Ada Ventures, Redrice Ventures and True.</p>
<p>Co-Founders Alex Ramamurthy and Dhruv Haria were inspired by the negative impact of social isolation and loneliness on their parents&#8217; mental and social wellbeing. Ramamurthy has been Chairman of the Care Innovation Hub incubator. Haria is a Cambridge Grad (Maths), qualified Actuary, and Data Scientist with a background in the Finance and Technology domains.</p>
<p>Ramamurthy said: “Both Dhruv and I witnessed the effects retirement was having on our parents. We noticed how their wellbeing was being affected by their decreasing social circles and the increasing inactive free time they had alone.”</p>
<p>Users for Mirthy can get access to fitness classes to belly dancing workshops, and history lectures to piano concerts at home, delivered by hosts, most of them over 60. The startup now claims over 35,000 users since launch in April-2020.</p>
<p>Its competitors include The Joy Club, Hello Revel, GetSetUp and several others. What Mirthy says, however, is that its content is created and curated “by over 60s for 60s” while “most of the other companies offer intergenerational events” and hosts are amateurs, passionate about a particular interest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium-sized construction businesses in Europe and the US tend not to be run on digital platforms, leaving a $1.6 trillion industry relatively untouched. publicly-listed Procore (NYSE: PCOR) is the go-to platform for large general contractors, but newer startups are going for this SMB construction market such as Sitemax, Sitemate, Fieldlens and Fieldwire.</p>
<p>Now, the <a href="https://remato.com/">Remato</a> construction management platform is joining them with a $1.7 million seed investment round, led by London-based Passion Capital.<br />
 <br />
Additional investors in the financing round include founders and early team members of Pipedrive along with venture funds Superangel, Lemonade Stand, Spring Capital, and Kaamos Group – a long-standing property developer and general contractor. The new investment brings Remato’s total funding up to $2.5 million. Remato currently has customers in the Nordics and Baltics.<br />
 <br />
Founded in 2018, Remato says its platform allows field contractors to plan and manage budgets, labor, materials, and equipment on one app. The company says it is growing steadily at 10-15% MoM with a mobile-first user experience and now has 1,700 daily active users.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Madis Lehtmets said: “The construction industry needs simplicity and modern design to achieve the mass adoption of software. We believe that user experience should be much more of a priority, as frontline adoption depends on it. It helps the traditionally low-tech industry to go fully digital.”  </p>
<p>Eileen Burbidge, Partner at Passion Capital, said: “We’re very excited to be working with Remato. Their traction to date clearly validates the need for digital user experiences and platforms for the massive construction sector, which comprises 10% of the global economy. We look forward to supporting the team’s ambitions in the UK, across the rest of Europe, and North America.”<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-headquartered Parcel Perform, which connects merchants with e-commerce carriers and provides shipment tracking features, said on Wednesday it has raised $20 million in a new financing round as it scales its business in several parts of the world.</p>
<p>Cambridge Capital led the logistics tech startup’s Series A financing round, while SoftBank Ventures Asia and existing investors including Wavemaker Partners and Investible participated in it.</p>
<p>The SaaS startup helps improve the experience of e-commerce merchants and their customers when engaging with carriers, explained Dr. Arne Jeroschewski, co-founder and chief executive of Parcel Perform, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Nespresso, which sells home coffee machines, capsules and accessories, relies on Parcel Perform to gain access to logistics data, for instance. Based on this data, said Jeroschewski, tracking experience &#8212; such as a web page for tracking, a system for authentication &#8212; is charted for the firm and the startup also provides tools for customer support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.parcelperform.com">Parcel Perform</a> also provides these merchants with tools to create additional touchpoints after the checkout to create higher brand loyalty with customers, opportunities to move more inventories, and it has also developed a system to support more than 30 languages to offer the most personalized experience to customers. It says businesses on its platform <span style="font-weight: 400;">have increased their customer lifetime value by up to 40%. </span></p>
<p>The startup &#8212; which is already profitable and has grown its revenue by 5x since the onset of the pandemic &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">also uses its AI stack to make predictions on things such as when a customer will get their parcel. Parcel Perform, which integrates with over 700 carriers, has courted clients globally and executes more than 100 million parcel updates each day.</span></p>
<p>“Visibility is a vital market in this age of e-commerce. After evaluating many companies worldwide, we believe that Parcel Perform simply offers the best visibility and experience solution. They have built a unique value proposition for brands, marketplaces and carriers, with the most complete solution for end-to-end shipment tracking,” said Benjamin Gordon, Managing Partner of Cambridge Capital, in a statement. Cambridge focuses exclusively on global logistics and supply chain technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jeroschewski founded the startup with Dana von der Heide. Jeroschewski previously co-founded e-tail unicorn Zalora, and held senior roles in Singapore Post and DHL, where he worked together with Dana. Dana is also an advisory member of the German Logistics Association and part of the distinguished eFounder Fellowship program by Alibaba.</p>
<p>Parcel Perform will deploy the fresh funds to scale further in Asia and Europe and also set up a regional office in North America, said Jeroschewski. The startup is also looking to increase its headcount.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When adding text code from a 3rd party source into a platform, the process is an unavoidable and time-consuming chore. Developers currently spend a large part of their day reviewing things like “NPM” packages, and such. There are developer libraries and text code platforms like JetBrains and Visual Studio, but these don’t entirely solve the problem. A UK startup thinks it might have the answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://cranq.io/">CRANQ</a> is a Low-Code IDE (integrated dev environment, like Visual Studio)  which provides component authoring, with, it says, a lot of re-usability. Its focus on standardized datatypes and ports means that intent can be easily checked, says the company. It’s now raised a Pre-Seed £1m funding from Venrex and Profounders.</p>
<p>Developers build their code in the IDE visually, using a drag-and-drop interface. So far it’s been used to built a version of the Educai.io back-end, and Alpha trials will begin this summer.</p>
<p>The cofounders are Toby Rowland and Dan Stocker. Rowland, CEO, is a serial entrepreneur, best-known for co-founding King.com in 2003. His most recent digital startup &#8211; Mangahigh.com &#8211; was acquired by Westermann Publishing in 2018, and subsequently, Rowland launched RyzeHydrogen.comfor the hydrogen-for-transport market. Stocker, CTO, is an experienced developer, software architect, and inventor. Among other projects, Dan conceived and created Giant, a React competitor, in 2012.</p>
<p>CRANQ’s initial focus on testing will also bring it into competition with Postman.com. The Workflow space (Zapier, N8N etc.) also overlaps with CRANQ.</p>
<p>But CRANQ is addressing a sizeable market. The microservices market is estimated to be worth $32bn in 2023, growing at 16% you, according to some estimates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today is rolling out a set of new features aimed at helping people protect their accounts from abuse, including offensive and unwanted comments and messages. The company will introduce tools for filtering abusive direct message (DM) requests as well as a way for users to limit other people from posting comments or sending DMs during spikes of increased attention &#8212; like when going viral. In addition, those who attempt to harass others on the service will also see stronger warnings against doing so, which detail the potential consequences.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/instagram-confirms-test-of-new-anti-harassment-tool-limits-designed-for-moments-of-crisis/">recently confirmed</a> it was testing the new anti-harassment tool, Limits, which Instagram head Adam Mosseri referenced in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRot2ucpUoA/">a video update</a> shared with the Instagram community last month. The feature aims to give Instagram users an easy way to temporarily lock down their accounts when they&#8217;re targeted with a flood of harassment.</p>
<p>Such an addition could have been useful to combat the recent racist attacks that took place on Instagram following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020_Final">Euro 2020 final</a>, which saw several England footballers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/12/england-players-racism-euros-defeat/">viciously harassed</a> by angry fans after the team’s defeat. The incidents, which had included racist comments and emoji, raised awareness of how little Instagram users could do to protect themselves when they&#8217;ve gone viral in a negative way.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188258" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188258" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2188258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Limits.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Limits.png 1601w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Limits.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Limits.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Limits.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Limits.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Limits.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Limits.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188258" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>During these sudden spikes of attention, Instagram users see an influx of unwanted comments and DM requests from people they don&#8217;t know. The Limits feature allows users to choose who can interact with you during these busy times.</p>
<p>From Instagram&#8217;s privacy settings, you&#8217;ll be able to toggle on limits that restrict accounts that are not following you as well as those belonging to recent followers. When limits are enabled, these accounts can&#8217;t post comments or send DM requests for a period of time of your choosing, like a certain number of days or even weeks.</p>
<p>Twitter had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/">eyeing a similar set of tools</a> for users who go viral, but has yet to put them into action.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s Limits feature had already been in testing, but is now becoming globally available.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NbTGVeCm7r"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/">Twitter is eyeing new anti-abuse tools to give users more control over mentions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter is eyeing new anti-abuse tools to give users more control over mentions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/twitter-is-eyeing-new-anti-abuse-tools-to-give-users-more-control-over-mentions/embed/#?secret=NbTGVeCm7r" data-secret="NbTGVeCm7r" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s currently experimenting with using machine learning to detect a spike in comments and DMs in order to prompt people to turn on Limits with a notification in the Instagram app.</p>
<p>Another feature, <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-new-tools-to-protect-our-community-from-abuse">Hidden Words</a>, is also being expanded.</p>
<p>Designed to protect users from abusive DM requests, Hidden Words automatically filters requests that contain offensive words, phrases and emojis and places them into a Hidden Folder, which you can choose to never view. It also filters out requests that are likely spam or are otherwise low-quality. Instagram doesn&#8217;t provide a list of which words it blocks to prevent people from gaming the system, but it has now updated that database with new types of offensive language, including strings of emoji &#8212; like those that were used to abuse the footballers &#8212; and included them in the filter.</p>
<p>Hidden Words had already been rolled out to a handful of countries earlier this year, but will reach all Instagram users globally by the end of the month. Instagram will push accounts with a larger following to use it, with messages both in their DM inbox and in their Stories tray.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="A34CNgVaAF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/instagram-confirms-test-of-new-anti-harassment-tool-limits-designed-for-moments-of-crisis/">Instagram confirms test of new anti-harassment tool, Limits, designed for moments of crisis</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Instagram confirms test of new anti-harassment tool, Limits, designed for moments of crisis&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/instagram-confirms-test-of-new-anti-harassment-tool-limits-designed-for-moments-of-crisis/embed/#?secret=A34CNgVaAF" data-secret="A34CNgVaAF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The feature was also expanded with a new option to &#8220;Hide More Comments,&#8221; which would allow users to easily hide comments that are potentially harmful, but don&#8217;t go against Instagram&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p>Another change will involve the warnings that are displayed when someone posts a potentially abusive comment. Already, Instagram would warn users when they first try to post a comment, and it would later display an even stronger warning when they tried to post potentially offensive comments multiple times. Now, the company says users will see the stronger message the first time around.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188259" style="width: 401px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188259" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2188259 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png?w=391" alt="" width="391" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png?resize=172,300 172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png?resize=391,680 391w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Comment-Warning.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188259" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>The message clearly states the comment may &#8220;contain racist language&#8221; or other content that goes against its guidelines, and reminds users that the comment may be hidden when it&#8217;s posted as a result. It also warns the user if they continue to break the community guidelines, their account &#8220;may be deleted.&#8221;</p>
<p>While systems to counteract online abuse are necessary and underdeveloped, there&#8217;s also the potential for such tools to be misused to silence dissent. For example, if a creator was spreading misinformation or conspiracies, or had people calling them out in the comments, they could turn to anti-abuse tools to hide the negative interactions. This would allow the creator to paint an inaccurate picture of their account as one that was popular and well-liked. And that, in turn, can be leveraged into marketing power and brand deals.</p>
<p>As Instagram puts more power into creators&#8217; hands to handle online abuse, it has to weigh the potential impacts those tools have on the overall creator economy, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope these new features will better protect people from seeing abusive content, whether it’s racist, sexist, homophobic or any other type of abuse,&#8221; noted Mosseri, in an announcement about the changes. &#8220;We know there’s more to do, including improving our systems to find and remove abusive content more quickly, and holding those who post it accountable.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/july-2021-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-report/">new report</a> about &#8220;coordinated inauthentic behavior&#8221; on its platform, Facebook states that it last month removed hundreds of accounts across its Facebook and Instagram platforms that were tied to anti-vaccination disinformation campaigns operated from Russia. In one campaign, says the company, a newly banned network &#8220;posted memes and comments claiming that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine would turn people into chimpanzees.&#8221; More recently, in May, the same network &#8220;questioned the safety of the Pfizer vaccine by posting an allegedly hacked and leaked<br />
AstraZeneca document,&#8221; says Facebook.</p>
<p>The company publishes such reports as a reminder to the public that it is focused on &#8220;finding and removing deceptive campaigns around the world.&#8221; Still, a new New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/technology/facebook-vaccine-misinformation.html">investigation</a> into Facebook&#8217;s relationship with the Biden administration suggests that the company continues to fall short when it comes to tackling misinformation, including, currently, around vaccine misinformation.</p>
<p>We talked about that reported disconnect earlier today with Sheera Frenkel, a cybersecurity correspondent for the New York Times and recent co-author, with New York Times national correspondent Cecelia Kang, of &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Untitled-Sheera-Frenkel/dp/0062960679">An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook&#8217;s Battle for Domination</a>,&#8221; which was published in June. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: This big story right now about Facebook centers on it shutting down the accounts of NYU researchers whose tools for studying advertising on the network violated its rules, according to the company. A lot of people think those objections don&#8217;t hold water. In the meantime, several Democratic senators have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/facebook-pressed-by-us-lawmakers-disabling-nyu-research-accounts-2021-08-09/">sent the company a letter</a>, grilling it about its decision to ban these scholars.  How does this particular situation fit into your understanding of how Facebook operates? </strong></p>
<p>SF: I was struck by how it fit a pattern that we really showed in [our] book of Facebook taking what seems like a very ad hoc and piecemeal approach to many of its problems. This action they took against NYU was surprising because there are so many others that are using data in the way that NYU is, including, private companies and commercial firms that are using it in ways that we don&#8217;t fully understand.</p>
<p>With NYU, the academics there were actually quite transparent and how they were collecting data. They didn&#8217;t hide what they were doing. They told journalists about it, and they told Facebook about it. So for Facebook to take action against just them, just as they were about to publish some research that may have been critical of Facebook and may have been damaging to Facebook, seems like a one off thing and really gets to the root of Facebook&#8217;s problems about what data the company holds about its own users.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Do you have any sense that investigators in the Senate or in Congress may demand more accountability for more recent industry indiscretions, such as the events of January 6? Typically, there comes a point where Facebook apologizes over a public flap . . . then nothing changes. </strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>SF: After the book came out, I spoke to one lawmaker who read our book and said, &#8216;It&#8217;s one thing if they apologized once, and we saw a substantial change happen at the company. But what these apologies are showing us is that they think they can get away with just an apology and then changing really surface level things but not getting to the root of the problem.&#8217;</p>
<p>So you brought up January 6, which is something that we know Congress is looking at, and I think that what lawmakers are doing is going a step beyond what they usually do . . . they&#8217;re taking a step back and saying, &#8216;How did Facebook allow groups to foment on the platform for months ahead of January 6? How did its algorithms drive people toward these groups? And how did its piecemeal approach to removing some groups but not others allow this movement known as stop-the-steal really take off. That&#8217;s fascinating because, until now, they haven&#8217;t taken that step back to understand the whole machinery behind Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Still, if Facebook is not willing to share its data in a more granular way, I wonder how fruitful these investigations will really be.</strong></p>
<p>SF: We reported in the New York Times that Facebook, when asked by the White House for this prevalence data on COVID &#8212; the idea being how prevalent is COVID misinformation &#8212; couldn&#8217;t give it to the White House because they didn&#8217;t have it. And the reason they didn&#8217;t have it is that when their own data scientists wanted to start tracking that over a year ago at the start of the pandemic, Facebook did not give them the resources or the mandate to start tracking the prevalence of COVID misinformation. One thing lawmakers can do is pressure Facebook to do that in the future and to give the company firm deadlines for when they want to see that data.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Based on your reporting, do you think there&#8217;s a reporting issue within Facebook or that these unclosed information loops are by design? In the book, for example, you talk about Russian activity on the platform leading up to the 2016 elections. You say that the company&#8217;s then chief security officer, Alex Stamos, had come up with a special team to look at Russian election interference relatively early in 2016, but that after Donald Trump won the election, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg said they were clueless and frustrated and they didn&#8217;t know why they weren&#8217;t presented with Stamos&#8217;s findings earlier.  </strong></p>
<p>SF: As we were doing reporting for this book, we really wanted to get to the bottom of that. Did Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg avoid knowing what there was to know about Russia, or were they just kept out of the loop? Ultimately, I think only Mark Zuckerberg or Sheryl Sandberg can answer that question.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ll say is that early on, about a week or two after the 2016 elections, Alex Stamos goes to them and says, &#8216;There <em>was</em> Russian election interference. We don&#8217;t know how much; we don&#8217;t know the extent. But there definitely was something here and we want to investigate it. And even after being told that startling news, Mark Zuckerberg [and other to brass] didn&#8217;t ask for daily or even weekly meetings to be updated on the progress of the security team. I know this is the chief executive of a company and as the CEO [he has] a lot on [his] plate. But you would think if your security team said to you, &#8216;Hey, there was an unprecedented thing that happened on our platform. Democracy was potentially harmed in a way that we didn&#8217;t foresee or expect,&#8217; you would think that as the head of the company, you&#8217;d say, &#8216;This is a really huge priority for me, and I&#8217;m going to ask for regular updates and meetings on this.&#8217; We don&#8217;t see that happen. And that let&#8217;s them monthly to be able to say, &#8216;Well, we didn&#8217;t know. We weren&#8217;t totally up to date with things.&#8217;</p>
<p><strong>TC: In the meantime, industry participants remain very interested in where regulation goes. What are you watching most closely?</strong></p>
<p>SF: In the next six months to a year, there are two things that are fascinating to me. One is COVID misinformation. It&#8217;s the worst problem for Facebook, because it&#8217;s been growing on the platform for close to a decade. It&#8217;s got deep roots across all parts of Facebook. And it&#8217;s homegrown. It&#8217;s Americans who are spreading this misinformation to other Americans. So it challenges all Facebook&#8217;s tenets on free speech and what it means to be a platform that welcomes free speech but also hasn&#8217;t drawn a clear line between what free speech is and what harmful speech is, especially during the time of the pandemic. So I&#8217;m really curious to see how they handle the fact that their own algorithms are still pushing people into anti vaccine groups and are still promoting people that definitely off the platform spread incorrect information about about COVID.</p>
<p>The second thing for me is that we&#8217;re going into a year where there are a lot of really important elections to be held in other countries with populist leaders, some of whom are modeling their use of Facebook after Donald Trump. After banning Donald Trump. I&#8217;m very curious to see how Facebook deals with some of these leaders in other countries who are testing the waters much in the same way that he did.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pave.com/">Pave,</a> a San Francisco-based startup that helps companies benchmark, plan and communicate compensation to their employees, has raised a $46 million Series B. YC Continuity led the round, which also saw participation from Andreessen Horowitz and Bessemer Venture Partners. The round comes eight months after Pave closed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/pave-trove-a16z-series-a/">a $16 million Series A round</a>. Today’s financing puts Pave’s valuation at $400 million, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/ycs-most-anticipated-startup-raised-16m-from-a16z-before-demo-day">up from $75 million one year ago. </a></p>
<p>Pave launched with an ambitious goal: Can it measure pay across venture-backed tech companies in real time, and help startups move their comp table off of spreadsheets? AngelList and Glassdoor have already tried to build a similar benchmark-worthy data set, but Pave may have a built-in advantage over the companies that tried to fix the same problem before. Y Combinator, which helped incubate Pave and is now leading its most recent round through its later-stage capital vehicle, is one of the largest startup accelerators in the world. Of Pave’s 900 customers to date, one-third come from Y Combinator, and CEO Matthew Schulman only sees that number growing.</p>
<p>“Having YC’s deep support of Pave as the YC-stamped leader in the burgeoning [compensation technology] industry is and will continue to be game changing for our distribution and ability to have ample data coverage in our benchmarking product,” Schulman said. He compared Pave’s distribution trajectory as similar to what fintech company Brex, also backed by Y Combinator Continuity, managed. The founder estimates that 60% of YC companies are active Brex customers.</p>
<p>The reliance on YC could engender platform risk, considering how often the accelerator invests in competitors &#8212; often within the same batch. That said, an investment from Y Combinator Continuity, which does <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/continuity/">Series B rounds and higher,</a> may be a signal that YC has found the comptech player it wants to back. Ali Rowghani, the managing director of the fund and former COO of Twitter, is joining Pave’s board.</p>
<p>Data is everything for the startup, supporting each of Pave&#8217;s three main services that it offers to companies. First, Pave uses market and partner data to help companies benchmark salaries for their employees. Second, the startup integrates with HR tools such as Workday, Carta and Greenhouse to give its customers a holistic picture on how employees are currently being compensated, and what makes sense for promotion cycles and salary bumps. And third, the data work culminates into formal offers and compensation packages that employers can then offer to new and old employees.</p>
<p>Pave&#8217;s current customers account for data on over 65,000 employee records. The first product serves as a free top of funnel service, while the last two are paid services offered up like any ol&#8217; enterprise software contract.</p>
<p>The world of compensation is rife with inequity, leading to the gender wage gap, and the gaps we can see in the market regarding minority pay disparity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Schulman views one of Pave’s goals as getting companies to go from doing their D&amp;I analysis from once a year, to doing it consistently.<strong> </strong>The company plans to build diversity and inclusion-specific dashboards that allow companies to see inequities and access ways or suggestions to improve their breakdown.</p>
<p>“What gets measured, gets improved,” Schulman said. Pave has begun to track its own compensation and diversity metrics, in an effort to be more transparent with its employees and maybe inspire some companies to do the same. About 33% of Pave&#8217;s workforce identify as women, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/it-could-take-12-years-to-reach-equal-representation-of-women-in-tech.html">compared to an industry average of 28.8%.</a> Half of Pave&#8217;s executives, and half of Pave&#8217;s board members, identify as women. The company has committed to having 50% of its client-facing roles, which include customer success managers and sales members, &#8220;to be female or persons from underrepresented groups.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;On the diversity front, 2020 may prove a tipping point&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/on-the-diversity-front-2020-may-prove-a-tipping-point/embed/#?secret=LhS5O3RInp" data-secret="LhS5O3RInp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Pave is starting to disclose its own internal benchmarks, transparency around diversity isn&#8217;t yet a standard within tech companies &#8212; it&#8217;s far easier to get valuations than to get specifics around the makeup of historically overlooked individuals within organizations. Pave recently launched the<a href="https://www.pave.com/pdl"> Pave Data Lab,</a> which uses its data set to showcase compensation trends and inequities within how tech workers are paid. That said, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pave doesn’t currently require the companies it works with to upload gender and race information into their benchmarking tool, and didn&#8217;t disclose what specific percentage of companies on its platform share that data.</span></p>
<p>It is hoping noise will make a difference. Pave&#8217;s compensation benchmarking data is now free for all companies to use, which will bring more data underneath its umbrella, and more standards to the confusing world of compensation.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-privacy-details-child-abuse-detection-and-messages-safety-features/">Apple makes its privacy case:</a> </strong>In a TechCrunch interview with Apple’s privacy chief Erik Neuenschwander, our own Matthew Panzarino got to ask questions about Cupertino’s impending software rollout of a method to detect certain abusive material. The decision by Apple has caused an uproar among privacy-minded groups.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/following-the-ipccs-report-we-need-more-technology-to-respond-to-more-disasters/">We need more disaster tech:</a> </strong>That’s Danny Crichton’s thesis after reading the latest IPCC report on climate change and considering his time reporting on startups building tech to better respond to increasingly common fires, floods and other forms of natural mischief. If you were hunting for a market where you might be able to build a company <em>and</em> make a difference, this could be your jam.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/salesforce-wants-salesforce-to-be-the-netflix-of-biz-content/"><strong>Salesforce announces Salesforce+:</strong></a><strong> </strong>And yes, it is a streaming network of sorts. For context, Salesfoce used to host a yearly in-person event called Dreamforce. Then the pandemic hit. Now Salesforce is looking to build a home for Dreamforce online and extend its general video-and-content remit by producing more stuff, more often. The streaming service, which will focus on business topics, will be free when it launches later this year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/44-01-secures-5m-to-turn-billions-of-tons-of-carbon-dioxide-to-stone/"><strong>Speaking of climate change:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A startup called 44.01 just closed a $5 million round. What’s the money for? The company’s tech that turns carbon dioxide into stones. The process, called mineralizing, is known but not on a commercial scale. If 44.01 has its way, that could change.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/kiwibot-partners-with-hospitality-giant-sodexo-to-bring-food-delivery-robots-to-college-campuses/"><strong>In case you thought college kids had too much to do:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Kiwibot, makers of a cute little robot that can deliver food, has “announced a partnership with food services and facilities management giant Sodexo to bring its robots to U.S. college campuses.” Now college students can ingest substances <em>and</em> not have to go pick up said vittles themselves. This makes me at once jealous and somewhat cranky about being old.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/jerry-raises-75m-at-a-450m-valuation/"><strong>Auto insurance comparison app raises again:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Jerry, which raised a $28 million Series B just a few months ago, is back with a new, larger round. This time it’s a $75 million Series C. Jerry, which has built an app that lets users compare insurance options, is in competitive territory. But given its new round, we presume that it has found an angle on its market that is proving lucrative thus far.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/"><strong>The Hyundai self-driving car program is coming to LA:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Motional, a joint effort from Aptiv and Hyundai, is bringing its autonomous cars to Los Angeles via a new facility to do testing. What’s fun about this particular bit of news is that there are so many self-driving companies that I cannot keep them straight. Which means that perhaps one of them will nail the problem and I never have to drive again.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/surfside-a-marketing-technology-for-the-cannabis-space-inhales-4-million/"><strong>Surfside raises $4M for cannabis marketing tech:</strong></a><strong> </strong>I suppose I didn’t know that cannabis needed marketing help, as it seems to sell itself rather well. But all the same, with myriad smaller cannabis brands getting started as the U.S. and other markets work in decriminalizing the drug, Surfside is building tech that may help them get to market.</li>
<li>In case you need just a little bit more, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/everyone-wants-to-fund-the-next-coinbase/">took a look</a> at just how many crypto exchanges are raising money. Call it the Coinbase effect.</li>

<h2>What’s driving the global surge in retail media spending?</h2>
<p>As the pandemic changed consumer behavior and regulations began to reshape digital marketing tools, advertisers are turning to retail media.</p>
<p>Using the reams of data collected at the individual and aggregate level, retail media produce high-margin revenue streams. &#8220;And like most things, there is a bad, a good and a much better way of doing things,&#8221; advises Cynthia Luo, head of Marketing at e-commerce marketing stack Epsilo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before you hire a marketing consultant who doesn&#8217;t understand your products or commit to a CMO who has several years of experience — but none in your sector — consider influencer marketing.</p>
<p>If the phrase evokes images of celebrities hawking hard seltzer, think again: An influencer can be as humble as an enthusiastic Reddit user who manages your Telegram channel.</p>
<p>According to Uber growth marketing manager Jonathan Martinez:</p>
<blockquote><p>“ … You don’t need to find influencers with millions of followers. Instead, lean toward microinfluencers for testing, which will bring cost efficiency and the ability to sponsor a diverse range of people.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If your startup has a clear brand pitch, &#8220;an enticing offer&#8221; and &#8220;clear next steps,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/early-stage-brands-should-also-unlock-the-power-of-influencers/">you&#8217;re ready to reach out to influencers</a>, he says.</p>
<p>In a guest post, Martinez explains how to structure offers that will maximize conversions and keep your representatives motivated to promote your products and services.</p>

<p>This morning, we published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/the-art-of-startup-storytelling-with-julian-shapiro/">an interview with growth expert Julian Shapiro</a>, a founder and angel investor who also advises startups on the best way to present themselves.</p>
<p>Marketing is data-driven, but good storytelling is an art, says Shapiro.</p>
<p>To connect with consumers on an emotional level, &#8220;you need a mix of goodwill, what-we-stand-for ideology, social prestige and customer delight — among other affinity-building ingredients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch this week!</p>

<p>“In celebration of Coinbase’s earnings report today, investors poured a mountain of cash into one of the company’s global competitors,” Alex Wilhelm writes in The Exchange.</p>
<p>Rolling up his sleeves, he dug into numbers from Coinbase, FalconX and FTX to give readers some perspective on the state of cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>

<p>Companies that have reached $5 million to $10 million in annual revenue are more likely to assemble growth teams; it&#8217;s a smart investment for any startup that&#8217;s achieved product-market fit.</p>
<p>It can also be potentially disruptive: Early marketing and product managers may feel sidelined by new cross-functional teams that suddenly take a leadership role.</p>
<p>In a detailed walkthrough, senior director of growth at OpenView Sam Richard explains the core players needed to build a growth team and how to integrate them into the organization smoothly, and shares some useful experiments to run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don’t expect a single hire to scratch the growth itch for you,&#8221; Richard warns.</p>
<p>&#8220;A brilliant hire is going to come up with ideas, but will absolutely need a team to support them, turn them into experiments and then make them a reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an interview with Brian Heater, Indiegogo CEO Andy Yang spoke about how the pandemic has impacted the crowdfunding platform, the challenges of stepping into the role after the previous CEO departed, and how the company reached profitability.</p>
<p><strong>The company wasn’t profitable when you joined?</strong></p>
<p>We weren’t profitable. I joined and then we cut to profitability, or at least kind of a neutral state, and with any kind of change in leadership, some tenured folks opted out, and we basically became a new team overnight to kind of re-found the company, and we’ve been slowly adding people over the last couple years, but always with that eye on profitability and controlling our own destiny.</p>

<p>Last week, Kickstarter announced that people have backed more than 200,000 projects with $6 billion in pledges since the company launched in 2009. Just 15 months ago, it crossed the $5 billion threshold.</p>
<p>Brian Heater spoke to CEO Aziz Hasan, who took over in 2019, about last year&#8217;s substantial of layoffs, the pandemic&#8217;s long-term impact on crowdfunding, and how he&#8217;s working to build a more resilient company:</p>
<p>I think for us some of the most important things are to really just understand how we’re operating the business, making sure that we are sufficient in the buffer that we have for the business to make sure that we’re operating in a way that we can feel confident that the team is going to have some stability, that they’re going to have this resilience.</p>

<p>We frequently run articles with advice for founders who are working on pitch decks. It&#8217;s a fundamental step in every startup&#8217;s journey, and there are myriad ways to approach the task.</p>
<p>Michelle Davey of telehealth staffing and services company Wheel and Jordan Nof of Tusk Venture Partners appeared on Extra Crunch Live recently to analyze Wheel&#8217;s Series A pitch.</p>
<p>Nof said entrepreneurs should candidly explain to potential investors what they&#8217;ll need to believe to back their startup.</p>
<p>&#8221; … It takes a lot of guesswork out of the equation for the investor and it reorients them to focus on the right problem set that you’re solving,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get this one shot to kind of influence what they think they need to believe to get an investment here … if you don’t do that … we could get pretty off base.&#8221;</p>

<p>Going up against global e-commerce behemoth Amazon might seem futile, but smaller players can leverage value adds that give them a leg up when it comes to ensuring a loyal customer base, says Kenny Small, vice president SAP and Enterprise at Qualitest Group.</p>
<p>“The reality is that Amazon’s true unique selling proposition is its distribution network,” he writes in a guest post. “Online retailers will not be able to compete on this point because Amazon’s distribution network is so fast.</p>
<p>“Instead, it’s important to focus on areas where they can excel — without having to become a third-party seller on Amazon’s platform.”</p>

<p>Edtech and fintech have been in the Chinese Communist Party crosshairs in recent weeks &#8212; now, chat apps and gaming are among the targets.</p>
<p>Beijing filed a civil suit against Tencent over claims that its WeChat Youth Mode flouts laws protecting minors, and state media criticized the gaming industry as the digital equivalent of passing out drugs to kids, Alex Wilhelm writes in The Exchange.</p>
<p>He writes that the “news appears to indicate that we should expect more of the same as we’ve seen in recent months from the Chinese government: More complaints about the impact of ‘excessive’ capital in its industries, more tumbling share prices and more held IPOs.”</p>

<p>In an increasingly on-demand world, shipping delays and disruptions are a major roadblock to customer happiness.</p>
<p>AI can help, says Ahmer Inam, chief artificial intelligence officer at Pactera EDGE, who offers five strategies for using AI that can help startups understand supply chain disruptions and prepare for a Plan B.</p>
<p>“While AI won’t protect startups, manufacturers and retailers from these types of disruptions in the future, it can help them sense, anticipate, reroute and respond to them more effectively.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starship Technologies, an autonomous delivery services company, announced that it will begin delivery service on four additional college campuses this fall, adding to the 20 campuses on which it already operates.</p>
<p>The University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), the University of Kentucky (UK), the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University&#8217;s Daytona Beach, Florida campus will all be graced with the Estonian-born company&#8217;s little six-wheeled, zero-emissions delivery robots.</p>

<p>This announcement comes the same day as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/kiwibot-partners-with-hospitality-giant-sodexo-to-bring-food-delivery-robots-to-college-campuses/">Kiwibot, another autonomous sidewalk delivery robot company, has partnered with hospitality giant Sodexo</a> to bring food delivery to college campuses. Whereas Kiwibot will focus more on delivering food from dining halls and university stores, it looks like Starship will work with on-campus merchants like Starbucks, Panda Express and Panera Bread, among others. Despite the different approaches, the outcome is the same: Delivery companies are preparing for a more &#8220;normal&#8221; school year, even though the Delta variant continues to ramp up case loads. That could either be a blessing or a problem for the Starships and Kiwibots of the world. On the one hand, more &#8216;Rona means more students staying inside and avoiding other humans. On the other, it could also mean school shutdowns and a bunch of useless bots.</p>
<p>“We see the Starship robots as an important part of safely bringing students back to campus,” said Dean Kennedy, executive director of residential life, housing and food services at UNR, in a statement. “Everyone wants to resume in-person classes and be back on campus so we’re doing everything we can to make sure it’s done responsibly. The robots offer several advantages – they make social distancing easier, they are convenient, the students we have spoken with love this idea and they continue our heritage of being an innovative campus.”</p>

<p>UIC will have 25 Starship robots and UNR and Embry-Riddle will get 20 robots each, all of which add to Starship&#8217;s fleet of over 1,000 delivery robots. The company says it has completed more than 1.5 million rides since its founding in 2014. It has raised a total of $102 million, including its recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/starship-technologies-raises-17m-to-roll-out-more-delivery-bots/">$17 million funding round</a>.</p>
<p>“We’ve worked hard to become a trusted and integrated partner on our campus communities and that hard work has paid off,&#8221; said Alastair Westgarth, CEO of Starship, in a statement. &#8220;We are continuing to add new schools every semester, with more to be announced this fall. The students love the robots and the schools appreciate the ability to offer this service. We can’t wait to meet the students at each of these schools and look forward to hiring students on all of the campuses to give them real world experience working with robots and AI.”</p>
<p>Students and faculty will be able to download the Starship Food Delivery app to choose meals and then drop a pin where they want their delivery to be sent. They can track the robot or they can wait for an alert to go outside and meet the robot once it has arrived, where they can then unlock it through the app. Starship says it aims to train and hire students at local campuses who are interested in joining the team and learning more about autonomous technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After the bell today, Coinbase reported another period of impressive results in its <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Coinbase-Q2'21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">second quarter earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>During the quarter, Coinbase&#8217;s total revenue reached $2.23 billion, which helped the company generate net income of $1.61 billion in the three-month period. The company benefited from a one-time line item worth $737.5 million, which stemmed from what Coinbase described as a &#8220;tax benefit&#8221; from its direct listing earlier in the quarter.</p>
<p>This puts us in the odd position of leaning more heavily on the company&#8217;s adjusted EBITDA metric, a figure that we usually discount, rather than the stricter net income result. This quarter the adjusted metric is actually a bit clearer regarding the company&#8217;s regular profitability. Coinbase posted adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion in the period.</p>
<p>The company easily bested expectations, with the market expecting revenues of just $1.85 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of $961.5 million, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-earnings-q2-2021-140559345.html">per Yahoo Finance</a>.</p>

<p>All that&#8217;s well and good, but the company provided a fascinating set of data for us to peruse that may help us better understand where the crypto economy stands today. Let&#8217;s get into the details.</p>
<h2>Trading volume</h2>
<p>There are two data sets from Coinbase&#8217;s Q2 that we need. The first deals with monthly transacting users, and overall trading volume:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2188350" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.31.33-PM.png" alt="" width="697" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.31.33-PM.png 697w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.31.33-PM.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.31.33-PM.png?resize=300,146 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.31.33-PM.png?resize=680,332 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.31.33-PM.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /></p>
<p>Seeing Coinbase continue to add MTUs in the second quarter was impressive, as was the company&#8217;s Q2 trading volume result in light of the falling platform asset figure. Quite simply, Coinbase managed to accrete trading volume despite generally falling crypto prices over the time period in question.</p>
<p>Or as the company put it, &#8220;[d]espite price movements, we saw billions of dollars of net asset inflows and new customers added throughout Q2.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next data set deals with a breakdown of trading volume by source and type:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2188352" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.33.00-PM.png" alt="" width="702" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.33.00-PM.png 702w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.33.00-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.33.00-PM.png?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.33.00-PM.png?resize=680,371 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.33.00-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<p>The incremental growth in retail volume from Q1 2021 to Q2 2021 is impressive for a single quarter, frankly, but the pace at which Coinbase added institutional volume in the quarter is even stronger. It&#8217;s a huge result.</p>
<p>For the more crypto-focused than financials-focused out there, the second set of numbers is even more notable. Ethereum trading volume beat bitcoin trading volume, while &#8220;other&#8221; was more than twice what bitcoin itself managed.</p>
<p>A changing of the guard? The company listed three reasons for why this happened, the second of which is the most interesting. Per the earnings report:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The mix shift was driven by] meaningful growth in Ethereum trading volumes, surpassing Bitcoin trading volumes on Coinbase for the first time driven by growth in the DeFi and NFT ecosystems (where Ethereum is an important underlying blockchain), and increased demand driven by our ETH2 staking product.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, the neat stuff that the Ethereum blockchain enables is driving volume in its underlying coin, ether. Bitcoin may be the oldest crypto, but its crown may be starting to rust. Bitcoin remains the largest asset on Coinbase, at 47%, however.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s talk revenues.</p>
<h3>Top line</h3>
<p>While institutional trading volume was an impressive source of growth for Coinbase, the company&#8217;s revenue breakdown remained retail-heavy. Here&#8217;s the data:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2188359" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.38.10-PM.png" alt="" width="712" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.38.10-PM.png 712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.38.10-PM.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.38.10-PM.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.38.10-PM.png?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-10-at-4.38.10-PM.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /></p>
<p>The transaction revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 speaks for itself, and was a key driver of the company&#8217;s strong second-quarter aggregate results. But perhaps more notable was the huge differential in subscription and services revenue at the company, growing nearly 100% from $56.4 million in Q1 2021 to $102.6 million in the most recent period.</p>
<p>Certainly, Coinbase remains a transaction-led company, but in revenue terms, its third line-item is becoming material.</p>
<p>Now, the somewhat bad news.</p>
<h2>What about Q3 2021?</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with how Coinbase describes the start to its third quarter:</p>
<blockquote><p>In July, retail MTUs and total Trading Volume were 6.3 million and $57.0 billion, respectively, as crypto asset prices and crypto asset volatility declined significantly relative to Q2 levels. August month-to-date, retail MTUs and Trading Volume levels have slightly improved compared to July levels but remain lower than earlier in the year. As a result, we believe retail MTUs and total Trading Volume will be lower in Q3 as compared to Q2.</p></blockquote>
<p>In contrast, Q2 MTUs were 8.8 million and total trading volume, pro-rated for each month of the quarter, came to $154 billion. Therefore, Coinbase had a far smaller July than what it managed on a monthly basis in Q2. That August is trending better than July is a small consolation, but it does appear that Coinbase will be a smaller business in Q3 than it was in Q1 or Q2.</p>
<p>If you were curious why Coinbase&#8217;s stock is not flying in the wake of its strong Q2 results, this is likely why. Of course, any serious investor in a crypto exchange is aware of how variable results can be in the sector. So a decrease after a few periods of strong results is not a huge lump to swallow.</p>
<p>Coinbase is worth $267.55 per share in after-hours trading as of the time of writing, off around three-quarters of a percent. That&#8217;s not even a haircut.</p>
<p>All told, Coinbase&#8217;s second quarter was excellent.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">As a startup founder, there will be three scenarios in which you’ll need to understand how to properly do a quality of earnings (QofE) if you want to maximize value.</p>
<p>The first scenario will be when you decide to raise a Series A and subsequent VC rounds, followed by when you do a strategic acquisition, and lastly, when you sell your company.</p>
<p>This post is a framework for how to think and organize your QofE and go through the most common items that you’ll want to keep top of mind for every M&amp;A and private equity transaction you may be part of.</p>
<h2>Why perform a QofE?</h2>
<p>The goal of a QofE is to adjust the reported EBITDA to calculate a restated EBITDA that best reflects the current state of the company on an ongoing basis. It also presents a historical adjusted EBITDA that is comparable throughout the last two or three years.</p>
<p>QofE can have a significant impact on a company valuation for three main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The adjusted EBITDA will be used by a buyer/investor as the basis for valuation (for companies valued based on an EBITDA multiple).</li>
<li>The adjusted revenue will be used to recalculate the effective growth rate.</li>
<li>The adjusted revenue and EBITDA will form the basis of forecasts.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that in mind, every entrepreneur must understand how to properly form a view of what is the proper adjusted EBITDA and adjusted revenue of your company. It is common for founders in an M&amp;A process to be unfamiliar with the notion of QofE and leave value on the table.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When performed by a professional transaction service advisory team, the quality of earnings is a result of a thorough review of all the documents generally available in a data room.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This breakdown aims to ensure that you won’t be that founder and that you’ll be armed to negotiate your company valuation on equal ground with your investors. If you are in the seller&#8217;s shoes, you will get the advantage of understanding how an experienced investor or buyer thinks. If you’re in the buyer&#8217;s shoes, you’ll benefit from understanding and valuing your acquisitions better.</p>
<h2>How is a QofE professionally performed?</h2>
<p>When performed by a professional transaction service advisory team, the quality of earnings is a result of a thorough review of all the documents generally available in a data room. These include, but are not limited to: Legal documentation, financial statements (P&amp;L, balance sheet, cash flow), audit reports, management presentation and contracts.</p>
<p>When doing a QofE analysis, it&#8217;s key to consistently ask yourself: “Can or should this information translate into an adjustment of revenue or EBITDA, net working capital (NWC) or net debt?”</p>
<p>Why did we include NWC and net debt? That is because they often have an indirect impact on adjusted EBITDA. Think of an adjustment to the historical level of inventory. Less inventory likely means fewer storage costs. So if you adjust historical inventory, you’ll want to also impact your adjusted EBITDA.</p>
<p>On top of reviewing all the aforementioned documents, your QofE analysis will heavily rely on interviewing management. No matter how long you look at the financials, if you can’t have management confirm information or explain trends, you won’t be able to draw proper conclusions and understand the numbers.</p>
<h2>Principles for efficiently building your QofE</h2>
<ol>
<li>Automatically link everything you read and hear to potential QofE adjustments. This has to become second nature during the engagement.</li>
<li>Always think about all the ways an event or item that qualifies for an adjustment impacts the financial statements overall. For instance, if the event impacted revenue, did it impact costs in some way as well?</li>
<li>Make sure that the cost you are adjusting was not already offset by another accounting entry (i.e., had no impact on EBITDA).</li>
<li>Make sure that the cost you adjust for was classified above EBITDA in the first place.</li>
<li>Make sure that you can quantify each adjustment in the most objective and rational way. This is sometimes not possible and you may have to come up with a range.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The encrypted chat app Signal is adding a few new options for users looking to lock down their messages. The app will now allow anyone to turn on a default timer for disappearing messages, automatically applying the settings to any newly initiated conversations.</p>
<p>Signal&#8217;s disappearing messages option deletes chats for both the sender and receiver after a set amount of time passes. Previously, you had to toggle the option on and select an interval for each individual conversation, which made it easy to overlook the extra privacy feature if you had a lot of chats going at once.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shout out to everyone who&#39;s been asking for this for a while.</p>
<p>Now you can set a default disappearing message timer in Signal. All new groups you create or new conversations you initiate will be preconfigured with it. <a href="https://t.co/QGWv6DTx6V">https://t.co/QGWv6DTx6V</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Moxie Marlinspike (@moxie) <a href="https://twitter.com/moxie/status/1425140055442485263?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Signal is also adding more options for how long disappearing messages stick around before evaporating. The app&#8217;s users can now select an interval up to four weeks and as short as 30 seconds. You can even lower that to a single second in the app&#8217;s custom time options.</p>
<p>On any chat app, it&#8217;s important to remember that disappearing messages vanish from the user interface, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re gone for good. Anything you share online can live on indefinitely via screenshots or through someone taking a photo of an app&#8217;s screen with another device.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Signal wants its users to keep this in mind, noting that the disappearing message options are best for saving storage space and keeping conversation history to a minimum, just in case. &#8220;This is not for situations where your contact is your adversary,&#8221; the company <a href="https://signal.org/blog/disappearing-by-default/">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The app remains one of the most popular end-to-end encrypted messaging options to date, and earlier this year even managed to absorb some WhatsApp users who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/following-backlash-whatsapp-to-roll-out-in-app-banner-to-better-explain-its-privacy-update/">grew skittish over data-sharing policy changes at Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>The privacy-minded messaging app is very well regarded for its strong feature set and the company&#8217;s independence, though Signal remains relatively small compared to Facebook&#8217;s own end-to-end encrypted WhatsApp, which the company acquired in 2014. As of December 2020, Signal boasted around 20 million monthly active users, while WhatsApp hit 2 billion users early last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin and Dynetics are still steaming over NASA&#8217;s decision to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">award only one contract — to SpaceX</a> — to build a Human Landing System for the Artemis program. Their protest of the decision was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/government-watchdog-rejects-blue-origins-protest-over-lunar-lander-contract/">recently rejected</a>, and now the Government Accountability Office&#8217;s arguments, which Blue Origin publicly questioned, are available for all to read. Here are a few highlights from the point-by-point takedown of the losing companies&#8217; complaints.</p>
<p>In case you can&#8217;t quite remember (2020 was a long year), NASA originally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/spacex-blue-origin-and-dynetics-will-build-human-lunar-landers-for-nasas-next-trip-back-to-the-moon/">selected the three companies mentioned</a> for early funding to conceptualize and propose a lunar landing system that could put boots on the moon in 2024. They suggested the next step would be, if possible, to pick two proposals to move forward with. But when the time for awards rolled around, only SpaceX walked away with a contract.</p>
<p>Dynetics and Blue Origin protested the decision separately, but on similar grounds: First, NASA should have awarded two companies as promised, and not doing so is risky and anti-competition. Second, it should have adjusted the terms of the award process when it learned it didn&#8217;t have much budget to set aside for it. Third, NASA didn&#8217;t evaluate the proposals fairly, showing a bias to SpaceX and against the others in various ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-419783.pdf">The GAO puts all of these concerns to bed in its report</a> — and in the process makes Blue Origin&#8217;s follow-up complaint, that the agency&#8217;s &#8220;limited jurisdiction&#8221; meant it couldn&#8217;t adequately address the protests, look like the sour grapes it is.</p>
<h2>One and done</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2086840" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50703878421_4c2b6e88c7_k.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2086840" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2086840" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50703878421_4c2b6e88c7_k.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50703878421_4c2b6e88c7_k.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50703878421_4c2b6e88c7_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50703878421_4c2b6e88c7_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50703878421_4c2b6e88c7_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50703878421_4c2b6e88c7_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50703878421_4c2b6e88c7_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/50703878421_4c2b6e88c7_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2086840" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SpaceX</p></div></p>
<p>As to awarding one rather than two companies a contract, the answer is right there in black and white. The announcement clearly stated multiple times that the whole thing was contingent on having enough money in the first place. NASA may have <em>preferred</em>, <em>hoped</em>, even <em>expected</em> to award two contracts, but it was very clear that it would be awarding &#8220;up to two&#8221; or &#8220;one or more&#8221; of them. After all, what if only one met the requirements and the others didn&#8217;t? Would NASA be obligated to throw money at an unsuitable applicant? No, and that&#8217;s more or less what happened.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even where a solicitation contains an intention to make multiple awards, we have recognized that an agency is not required to do so if the outcome of proposal evaluation dictates that only one contract should be awarded. For example, regardless of an agency’s intention, it cannot, in making contract awards, exceed the funds available.</p></blockquote>
<p>The GAO explains that the decision-making process at NASA weighted the technical approach the highest, then price, then management (i.e. organization, scheduling, etc.). Each company&#8217;s proposal was evaluated independently on each of these characteristics, and the final results were compared. Here&#8217;s a top-level summary of the ratings assigned:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188287" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hls-chart.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188287" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2188287" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hls-chart.png" alt="Chart showing evaluations for SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Dynetics. SpaceX comes out on top and with the lowest price." width="1024" height="161" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hls-chart.png 1191w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hls-chart.png?resize=150,24 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hls-chart.png?resize=300,47 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hls-chart.png?resize=768,121 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hls-chart.png?resize=680,107 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/hls-chart.png?resize=50,8 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2188287" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GAO / NASA</p></div></p>
<p>And the report again:</p>
<blockquote><p>The technical approach factor was to be more important than the total evaluated price factor, which in turn was to be more important than the management approach factor; the non-price factors, when combined, were significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>&#8230;Contrary to the protesters’ arguments, even assuming a comparative analysis was required, SpaceX’s proposal appeared to be the highest-rated under each of the three enumerated evaluation criteria as well as the lowest priced.</p></blockquote>
<p>When the budget for NASA was finalized, it left less for the HLS program than expected, and the agency was forced to make some tough choices. Luckily they had a proposal that was as good or better than the others technically (the most important factor), considerably better than the others organizationally and came in at a very reasonable cost. It was a clear choice to award a contract to SpaceX.</p>
<p>But having done so, NASA found that the cupboard was bare. Even so, Blue Origin argued that it deserved to be contacted about somehow making it work. Perhaps, they suggested, if NASA had come to them to negotiate, they could have put together a proposal that might have looked even better than SpaceX&#8217;s. (Jeff Bezos&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/bezos-offers-billions-in-incentives-for-nasas-lunar-lander-contract/">brazen after-the-fact $2 billion offer</a> suggests they had some wiggle room.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bezos offers billions in incentives for NASA&#8217;s lunar lander contract&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/bezos-offers-billions-in-incentives-for-nasas-lunar-lander-contract/embed/#?secret=CLfsf5tgMe" data-secret="CLfsf5tgMe" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>NASA, however, had already concluded otherwise, as the GAO confirms:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;The agency concluded that it was not “insurmountable” to negotiate with SpaceX to shift approximately $[DELETED] in FY2021 proposed milestone payments (or approximately [DELETED] percent of the $2.941 billion total proposed price) to later years to meet NASA’s FY2021 funding limitations. In contrast, the SSA concluded that it was implausible for Blue Origin ($5.995 billion) and Dynetics ($9.082 billion) to materially reduce their significantly higher total proposed prices without material revisions to their respective technical and management approaches&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Redactions notwithstanding, it&#8217;s not difficult to see the issue here. While it was conceivable, even reasonable, for SpaceX to shift a few hundred million or so around to make the fiscal math work, already questionable at the $3 billion mark, it was not conceivable that Blue Origin or Dynetics could shave half or more off their costs to make those same fiscal milestones happen.</p>
<p>As NASA&#8217;s selection group explained at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>After accounting for a contract award to SpaceX, the amount of remaining available funding is so insubstantial that, in my opinion, NASA cannot reasonably ask Blue Origin to lower its price for the scope of work it has proposed to a figure that would potentially enable NASA to afford making a contract award to Blue Origin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blue Origin complained that NASA should have warned them that the budget might lead to restrictions in the selection process, but the GAO simply notes that not only is the federal budget hardly secret, but that the companies waited until after the award was made to raise an issue. Such complaints need to be timely in order to be taken seriously, it wrote, and furthermore there is nothing in the complaints that suggests that even <em>had</em> NASA warned them, anything would have turned out differently.</p>

<p>There is also the question of whether choosing a single provider is &#8220;anticompetitive and unduly risky,&#8221; as the protests put it. While the GAO admits that &#8220;these important questions of policy may merit further public debate,&#8221; the complaint is moot since NASA didn&#8217;t have the money to do more than one in the first place. As voters and advocates of a generous budget for space exploration, we may say it&#8217;s a shame that NASA didn&#8217;t have $6 billion more to play with, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the agency&#8217;s decision to put the money it had to the best purpose possible was incorrect.</p>
<h2>In space, no one can hear you cry</h2>

<p>Blue Origin and Dynetics alleged that the process was biased in favor of SpaceX in that the various companies were unfairly evaluated for strengths and weaknesses. But the GAO sees these complaints for the fluff that they are.</p>
<p>In one case, Blue Origin complains that the announcement did not specifically require the vehicles to be able to land in the dark. Well, first of all, it does, and second of all, <em>space is dark</em>. If your design doesn&#8217;t take that into account, you&#8217;re gonna have a bad time out there.</p>
<p>In another instance, the communications systems proposed by Blue Origin and SpaceX both were flagged for not meeting certain requirements — but Blue Origin got a &#8220;significant weakness&#8221; listed for its system and SpaceX only got a &#8220;weakness.&#8221; Evidence of preferential treatment, they suggest.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Not so much, says the GAO: &#8220;Even a cursory review of the evaluation record demonstrates material differences between the proposals that support NASA’s different evaluation findings.&#8221; In this case four of Blue Origin&#8217;s communications links didn&#8217;t work as required, and a fifth was a maybe. SpaceX only had two not work right. This sort of substantial difference appeared in each of the objections cited by the complainants.</p>
<p>In fact, the report goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>We note that Blue Origin fails to rebut any of the analysis presented by the contracting officer with respect to Blue Origin’s or SpaceX’s proposals. In fact, Blue Origin initially challenged the agency’s evaluation of its own proposal, but then affirmatively withdrew that protest ground after receipt of the agency report.</p></blockquote>
<p>Blue Origin groused that SpaceX got extra points for a design that focused on the crew&#8217;s safety, health and comfort, despite many of the design choices not being explicitly required. The GAO says NASA is well within its discretion as an expert agency to consider these as meritorious — in fact, they call it a &#8220;representative example of why discretion is due&#8221; in such cases — and really, if you&#8217;re objecting on the grounds that the competition&#8217;s capsule was <em>too nice</em>, it may be advisable to reconsider your priorities.</p>

<p>Even had several of the decisions been successfully challenged, it wouldn&#8217;t have changed the outcome, the report explains.</p>
<p>SpaceX received the following evaluation totals:</p>

<li><strong>Technical</strong>: 3 significant strengths; 10 strengths; 6 weaknesses; and 1 significant weakness</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>: 2 significant strengths; 3 strengths; and 2 weaknesses</li>

<p>While Blue Origin received the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical</strong>: 13 strengths; 14 weaknesses; and 2 significant weaknesses</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>: 1 significant strength; 2 strengths; and 6 weaknesses</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s never a pleasant occasion to find one has been thoroughly beaten on practically every factor that counts, but that really seems to be the factor here. Dynetics and its complaint meet the same fate, by the way, but with a bit more rough treatment.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Even allowing for the possibility that the protesters could prevail on some small subset of their challenges to NASA’s evaluation, the record reflects that NASA’s evaluation was largely reasonable, and the relative competitive standing of the offerors under the non-price factors would not materially change&#8230;</p>
<p>The protests are denied.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty brutal documentation of the shortcomings of Blue Origin and Dynetics, and one that would not have been necessary had the companies taken their lumps and accepted that NASA isn&#8217;t out to get them. They lost fair and square, and now they look like whiny also-rans instead of ambitious could-bes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unity, the company behind the super popular 2D/3D engine of the same name, is today announcing plans to make its biggest acquisition to date. Unity says it will acquire <a href="https://parsec.app">Parsec</a>, a remote desktop tool for developers and creatives, for $320 million in cash.</p>
<p>Parsec&#8217;s pitch has long been remote desktop access without compromise. Tuned for creatives, it works fine even if your rig has multiple high-resolution displays. It&#8217;ll stream your work-in-progress artwork without screwing up the colors, and it&#8217;ll play friendly with fancier input devices like pressure-sensitive drawing tablets.</p>
<p>Parsec began its life back in 2016, initially focused on helping gamers stream games from their powerful PCs to other (generally less powerful) devices. It turns out the same things that made it good for game players — low latency, high-resolution display support and compatibility with all kinds of different input devices — made it good for game <em>makers</em> as well. After noticing a number of users across the creative industry tapping Parsec to beam into their workstations, the company started rolling out plans and features just for creative teams. When the pandemic sent more teams home and away from their office setups, usage of Parsec <a href="https://blog.parsec.app/the-rise-of-the-virtual-workday/">took off.</a></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-tfe87a05HA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that, more and more, creators will need to be able to work anywhere,&#8221; Unity Senior Vice President Marc Whitten told me in a call earlier this week. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to work in groups that are dispersed by distance, or they&#8217;re going to be in a hybrid environment where they might be working in the office sometimes and at home sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s going to mean that those creators are going to need to have access to the power they need on the glass that they have, wherever they are,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And Parsec is a great example of a company that has just deeply innovated in that space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whitten also alluded to this being the beginning of a deeper cloud push for Unity: &#8220;I think you&#8217;re gonna see that Parsec is a great foundational block for a broad sort of cloud ambition that we have as a company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to see a lot more from us in that particular regards.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3M935OP3AY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/parsec-series-b/">Parsec raises $25M from a16z to power remote work and cloud gaming</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Parsec&#8217;s total funding before the acquisition was $33 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/parsec-2">according to Crunchbase</a>. Its most recent funding was a $25 million Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/parsec-series-b/"> last December</a>.</p>
<p>Whitten told me that he doesn&#8217;t foresee any changes for existing Parsec users, but couldn&#8217;t comment yet on any potential changes to subscriptions/pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong><em>For anyone concerned about losing access to Parsec&#8217;s free offering, the company tweeted to confirm it has &#8220;no plans to change anything about the free Parsec app.&#8221;</em></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh, and one more thing: we love the communities around games as much as anyone, and have no plans to change anything about the free Parsec app. We hope creative professionals get as much joy out of creating the next great fighting game as you do playing them.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Most businesses by now are well versed with the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic: Faltering offline sales, flexible work-from-anywhere options, fluctuating foot traffic with lockdown mandates and e-commerce becoming a channel many brands wished they had built infrastructure for earlier.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/study-pandemic-affected-southeast-asias-online-shopping-behavior">record number of consumers</a> in Southeast Asia move from shopping malls to online platforms like Shopee, Lazada, Tiki and Tokopedia, the advertising dollars are naturally flowing in. Emerging markets are witnessing the advent of retail media right now.</p>
<p>Amazon paved the way in North America in 2018 by launching Amazon Advertising to become the first bid-and-buy marketplace. BCG now estimates retailers have a <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/how-to-compete-in-retail-media">$100 billion business</a> opportunity to capture, if they can keep up.</p>
<h2>The money is where the consumer is</h2>
<p>To understand why retailers will capture more ad spend, it’s important to evaluate what modern day marketing has become.</p>
<p>Is it bus stop advertisements? Bidding on Google keywords or a Clubhouse session? Or is it a viral TikTok video? As the world becomes more connected and the lines between offline and online blur even more, modern day marketing is a mix of all the channels tied to key performance metrics.</p>
<p>The main goal of marketing, no matter the medium, is to highlight a business or product to the right consumers to score a potential sale. And like most things, there is a bad, a good and a much better way of doing things.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			E-commerce as an advertising channel is unique, because it encapsulates the entire consumer journey from start to finish, especially as marketplaces continue to steal the share of search from search engines.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Traditional marketing channels were primarily linear TV, radio and print, because the mediums were highly popular at the time. However, with the birth of the internet newer platforms emerged such as email, websites and streaming. Then came the rise of social media and apps that shook up the advertising landscape. But regardless of these shifts, there has always been one constant: The business went where the consumer was.</p>
<p>So when sources of traffic and revenue once again change, let’s say due to a pandemic, the marketing mix follows. In the next 12 months alone, many marketers are planning to decrease spending in cinema, print and out of home (OOH), while the majority will increase budgets in social and search, according to <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2021/nielsen-annual-marketing-report-era-of-adaptation/">Nielsen</a>.</p>
<h2>The search for superior advertising channels</h2>
<p>So which channels will benefit as money flows out of outdated buckets? A good indicator is ad revenue trends in mature markets like the U.S. While Google and Facebook remain the dominant advertising players, Amazon has eaten into the duopoly’s ad revenue pie in the U.S., growing its share from 7.8% to 10.3% in 2020 alone, according to <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/amazon-s-share-of-us-digital-ad-market-surpassed-10-2020">eMarketer</a>.</p>
<p>How? Because the most valuable advertising channel is the one that has the most measurable touch points with the consumer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Traditional MBA programs can be costly, lengthy and often lack the application of real-world skills. Meanwhile, big global brands and companies who need product managers to grow their businesses can’t sit around waiting for people to graduate. And the edtech space hasn’t traditionally catered to this sector.</p>
<p>This is perhaps why <a href="https://productschool.com/">Product School</a> says it has secured $25 million in growth equity investment from growth fund <a href="https://www.leedsilluminate.com/">Leeds Illuminate</a> (subject to regulatory approval) to accelerate its product and partnerships with client companies.</p>
<p>The growth funding for the company comes after bootstrapping since 2014, in large part because product managers (PMs) are no longer needed just inside tech companies but have become sought after across almost virtually all industries.</p>
<p>Product School provides certificates for individuals as well as team training, and says it has experienced an upwelling of business since COVID switched so many companies into digital ones. It also now counts Google, Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, PayPal, Uber and Amazon amongst its customers.</p>
<p>“Product managers have an outsized role in driving digital transformation and innovation across all sectors,” said Susan Cates, managing partner of Leeds Illuminate. “Having built the largest community of PMs in the world validates Product School’s certification as the industry standard for the market and positions the company at the forefront of upskilling top-notch talent for global organizations.”</p>
<p>Carlos Gonzalez de Villaumbrosia, CEO and founder of Product School, who started the company after moving from Spain, said: “There has never been a better time in history to build digital products and Product School is excited to unlock value for product teams across the globe to help define the future. Our company was founded on the basis that traditional degrees and MBA programs simply don’t equip PMs with the real-world skills they require on the job.”</p>
<p>Product School has also produced the <a href="https://productschool.com/the-product-book/">The Product Book</a>, <a href="https://productschool.com/proddys/">The Proddy Awards</a> and <a href="https://productschool.com/productcon/">ProductCon</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its main competitor is <a href="https://www.mindtheproduct.com/">MindTheProduct</a>, a community and training platform, which has also boostrapped.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zomato’s losses more than tripled in its first quarterly earnings report since its listing last month as the company&#8217;s expenses grew and the pandemic hit the firm&#8217;s dining-out business.</p>
<p>The Gurgaon-headquartered firm <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/47aa2394-0e3a-415d-ac77-ce10d2b7f1de.pdf">reported</a> (PDF) a net loss of $48 million in the quarter that ended in June, up from about $13.5 million during the same period last year.</p>
<p>The 12-year-old firm also reported strong revenue growth, moving from $35.7 million to $113.4 million during the aforementioned period as more people in the country began to order food online.</p>
<p>The firm said it delivered more than 100 million food orders last quarter and has surpassed a billion orders in the past six years.</p>
<p>“This is largely on account of non-cash ESOP expenses which have increased meaningfully in Q1 FY22 due to significant ESOP grants made in the quarter pursuant to creation of a new ESOP 2021 scheme. This divergence in reported profit/loss and Adjusted EBITDA will continue going forward,” a blog post signed by top Zomato executives read.</p>
<p>The executive said in the post that the second wave of the coronavirus, which hit the country beginning in April, &#8220;significantly impacted the dining-out business in Q1 FY22 reversing most of the gains the industry made in Q4 FY21.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2188220" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2188220" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2188220 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="339" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?resize=768,382 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zomato-share-price.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2188220" class="wp-caption-text">Zomato&#8217;s shares on BSE.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shares of Zomato, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">had a stellar debut on the Indian stock exchanges last month</a>, fell 4% on Tuesday ahead of the results and ended at slightly below the original issue price of $1.68 a share on July 23, which valued Zomato then at $13 billion.</p>
<p>The company said it will hold one call with analysts a year &#8212; instead of the typical four &#8212; and address questions through blogs and quarterly shareholder letters.</p>
<p>In India, Zomato competes with Swiggy, which is backed by SoftBank and Prosus. Last month, the Indian food delivery startup said it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/indian-food-delivery-startup-swiggy-raises-1-25-billion-led-by-softbank-and-prosus/">raised $1.25 billion in a new financing round</a>. SoftBank Vision Fund 2 evaluated Zomato before making its bet on Swiggy, people familiar with the dealflow said.</p>
<p>Both the firms in recent quarters have expanded to new categories, including grocery delivery.</p>
<p>Zomato is the first Indian consumer internet startup in the current wave to go public. India&#8217;s financial services <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/paytm-files-for-2-2-billion-ipo/">Paytm</a> and MobiKwik, as well as online insurer PolicyBazaar and online beauty products firm Nykaa, have filed the paperwork to go public later this year.</p>
