										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The string of engineers who spoke Thursday night during a deep dive into Cruise&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology never mentioned Tesla&#8217;s name. They didn&#8217;t have to, although the message was clear enough.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s self-driving subsidiary Cruise presented a technical and deployment roadmap — at a granular level — that aimed to show how it has built autonomous vehicles that are safer and more scalable than any human-driven vehicle, including those equipped with advanced driver assistance systems.</p>
<p>While Cruise was clearly making a case for its own technology (not to mention trying to recruit fresh talent), the event was also an argument for autonomous vehicles in general. Each engineer or product lead who spoke Thursday presented various components, from how it uses simulations and the development of its own chips and other hardware to the design of its app and the vehicle itself.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The branded &#8220;Under the Hood&#8221; event built off of comments CEO Dan Ammann made last month during GM&#8217;s investor day, in which he laid out the company&#8217;s plan to launch a commercial robotaxi and delivery service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/self-driving-company-cruise-on-track-for-early-commercial-operations-in-2022/">starting with retrofitted Chevy Bolts</a> and eventually scaling to an army of tens of thousands of purpose-built Origin AVs on the road over the next few years.</p>
<p>Cruise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/">just gained approval in California</a> to perform commercial delivery services, and is still one permit away from being able to charge for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/cruise-launches-driverless-robotaxi-service-for-employees-in-san-francisco/">driverless ride-hailing</a>. Still, Cruise thinks it&#8217;ll be able to drive down costs enough to scale up and out quickly.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<h2>Using simulations to scale, not just verify the system</h2>
<p>Cruise is relying on simulations not only to prove out its safety case, but also to scale to new cities without having to perform millions of miles of tests in them first.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will still have to map the cities it enters. But it won&#8217;t have to remap cities to track changes to the environment that inevitably happen, like lane changes or street closures. When Cruise goes to new cities, it starts with a technology it calls WorldGen, which it says does accurate, large-scale generation of entire cities, &#8220;from their quirky layouts to the smallest details,&#8221; which allows engineers to test out new operational design domains, according to Sid Gandhi, technical strategy lead of simulation at Cruise. In other words, WorldGen becomes the stage where the future simulations are set.</p>
<p>To ensure optimal world creation, Cruise takes into account things like lighting at 24 different unique times of day and weather conditions, even going as far as to systematically measure light from a range of street lamps in San Francisco.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we combine a high-fidelity environment with a procedurally generated city, that&#8217;s when we unlock the capability to efficiently scale our business to new cities,&#8221; said Gandhi.</p>
<p>He then laid out the technology for the &#8220;Road to Sim,&#8221; which transforms into editable simulation scenarios real events that have been collected by AVs on the road. This ensures that the AV doesn&#8217;t regress by testing against scenarios it has already seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Road to Sim combines information from perception with heuristics learned from our millions of real-world miles to recreate a full simulation environment from road data,&#8221; said Gandhi. &#8220;Once we have the simulation, we can actually create permutations of the event and change attributes like vehicle and pedestrian types. It&#8217;s a super easy and extremely powerful way to build test suites that accelerate AV development.&#8221;</p>
<p>For specific scenarios that Cruise hasn&#8217;t been able to collect in real-world road conditions, there&#8217;s Morpheus. Morpheus is a system that can generate simulations based on specific locations on the map. It uses machine learning to automatically enter as many parameters as it wants to generate thousands of interesting and rare scenarios against which it tests the AV.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we work on solving the longtail, we&#8217;ll rely less and less on real-world testing because when you have an event that happens rarely, it takes thousands of road miles to test it properly, and it&#8217;s just not scalable,&#8221; said Gandhi. &#8220;So we&#8217;re developing technology to scalably explore large-scale parameter spaces to generate test scenarios.&#8221;</p>
<p>Test scenarios also include simulating the way other road users react to the AV. Cruise&#8217;s system for this is called non-player character (NPC) AI, which is usually a video game term, but in this context, refers to all of the cars and pedestrians in a scene that represent complex multi-agent behaviors.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Morpheus, Road to Sim and NPC AI work together in this really thoughtful way to let us perform more robust testing around rare and difficult events,&#8221; said Gandhi. &#8220;And it really gives us the confidence that we can solve rare issues now and in future similar issues, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Generating synthetic data helps the Cruise AV target specific use cases, said Gandhi, pointing specifically to identifying and interacting with emergency vehicles, presumably for no other reason than to take a dig at Tesla, whose Autopilot ADAS system has come under federal scrutiny for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">repeated crashes into emergency vehicles</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emergency vehicles are rare compared to other types of vehicles, but we need to detect them with extremely high accuracy, so we use our data generation pipeline to create millions of simulation images of ambulances, fire trucks and police cars,&#8221; said Gandhi. &#8220;In our experience targeted synthetic data is about 180 times faster than collecting road data, and millions of dollars cheaper. And with the right mix of synthetic and real data, we can increase relevant data in our data sets by an order of magnitude or more.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Two custom silicon chips developed in-house</h2>
<p>During GM&#8217;s investor day in October, Cruise CEO Dan Ammann outlined the company&#8217;s plan to invest heavily into the compute power of the Origin in order to decrease costs by 90% over the next four generations so it can scale profitably. At the time, Ammann mentioned Cruise&#8217;s intention to manufacture custom silicon in-house to cut costs, but didn&#8217;t admit outright using that silicon to build a chip &#8212; but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/cruise-plans-to-have-tens-of-thousands-of-origin-avs-on-roads-in-coming-years/">TechCrunch had its theories</a>. On Thursday, Rajat Basu, chief engineer for the Origin program, validated those theories.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our fourth-generation compute platform will be based on our in-house custom silicon development,&#8221; said Basu. &#8220;This is purpose-built for our application. It enables focus and improves processing capability, while significantly reducing piece costs and power consumption. Compute is a critical system from a safety perspective, and has redundancy built into it. Add to that an AV system that is processing up to 10 gigabits of data every second, we end up consuming a fair amount of power. Our MLH chip allows us to run our complex machine learning pipelines in a much more focused manner, which in turn helps us to be more energy efficient without compromising on performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cruise&#8217;s AI team developed two chips: The sensor processing chip will handle edge processing for the range of sensors like cameras, radar and acoustics. The second chip, which is designed to be a dedicated neural network processor, supports and accelerates machine learning applications like those large, multitask models developed by the AI team. Basu says the machine learning accelerator (MLA) chip is just the right size to solve exactly a certain class of neural net and ML applications, and nothing more.</p>
<p>&#8220;This keeps the performance at an extremely high level, and it ensures that we are not wasting energy on doing anything that is not value added for us,&#8221; said Basu. &#8220;It can be paired with multiple external hosts or operate standalone. It supports single Ethernet networks up to 25G with a total bandwidth of 400G. The MLA chip we&#8217;re putting into volume production is just the start. Over time we will continue to make this even higher-performing while reducing power consumption.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Cruise ecosystem</h2>
<p>One thing Cruise made clear during its event is that it hasn&#8217;t just thought of the AV tech needed to scale up successfully, but also the entire ecosystem, which includes things like remote assistance operators to validate the AV&#8217;s decision when it comes across unknown scenarios, customer service, a vehicle that people actually want to ride around in and an app that can efficiently and easily handle things like customer support and incidence response.</p>
<p>&#8220;To truly cross the chasm from research and development to a beloved product requires more than just artificial intelligence and robotics,&#8221; said Oliver Cameron, Cruise&#8217;s VP of product, at the event. &#8220;A safe self-driving vehicle alone is insufficient and simply the first step on a long, long journey. To truly build and scale a competitive product that is adopted by millions into their daily lives, you need to build a host of differentiated features and tools atop a safe self-driving foundation. How these features need to be implemented is non-obvious, especially if your company&#8217;s still heads-down solving safety issues.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Is this the beginning of the end for the hated tracking cookie consent pop-up? A flagship framework used by Google and scores of other advertisers for gathering claimed consent from web users for creepy ad targeting looks set to be found in breach of Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">A year ago</a> the IAB Europe&#8217;s self-styled Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) was found to fail to comply with GDPR principles of transparency, fairness and accountability, and the lawfulness of processing in a preliminary report by the investigatory division of the Belgian data protection authority.</p>
<p>The complaint then moved to the litigation chamber of the DPA &#8212; and a whole year passed without a decision being issued, in keeping with the glacial pace of privacy enforcement against adtech in the region.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229932" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But the authority is now in the process of finalizing a draft ruling, according to a <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/all-news/update-on-the-belgian-data-protection-authoritys-investigation-of-iab-europe/">press statement</a> put out by the IAB Europe today. And the verdict it&#8217;s expecting is that the TCF breaches the GDPR.</p>
<p>It will also find that the IAB Europe is itself in breach. Oopsy.</p>
<p>The online advertising industry body looks to be seeking to get ahead of a nuclear finding of non-compliance, writing that the DPA &#8220;will apparently identify infringements of the GDPR by IAB Europe&#8221;, and trying to further spin the finding as &#8216;fixable&#8217; within six months (it doesn&#8217;t say how, however) &#8212; while simultaneously implying the breach finding may not itself be fixed because other EU DPAs still need to weigh in on the decision as part of the GDPR&#8217;s standard cooperation procedure (which applies to cross-border complaints).</p>
<p>The pre-emptive statement (and its Friday afternoon timing) looks very much like the IAB Europe trying to both fuzz and bury bad news and thereby calm the nerves of the tracking industry ahead of looming headlines that a flagship tool is unlawful &#8212; something EU privacy campaigners have of course been saying for literally years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of timing, a final verdict on the investigation is still likely months off &#8212; and may not emerge &#8217;til deep into 2022. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Appeals are also almost inevitable. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But the tracking industry&#8217;s problems are starting to look, well, appropriately sticky. </span></p>
<p>In the short term, the IAB says it expects a draft ruling to be shared by Belgium with other EU DPAs in the next two to three weeks &#8212; at which point they get 30 days to review it and potentially file objections.</p>
<p>If DPAs don&#8217;t agree with the lead authority&#8217;s finding, and can&#8217;t agree among themselves, the European Data Protection Board may need to step in and take a binding decision &#8212; such as happened in another cross-border case against WhatsApp (which led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">a $267M fine</a>, a larger penalty that the lead DPA in that case had originally proposed).</p>
<p>So this GDPR cooperation mechanism can spin procedures out for many more months yet.</p>
<p>Complainants against the IAB Europe and its TCF, meanwhile, told us they have not seen nor been given details of the draft ruling by the DPA.</p>
<p>So it looks pretty whiffy that the ad industry body has had sight of an incoming decision ahead of the other parties to the complaint.</p>
<p>But one of complainants, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties&#8217; Johnny Ryan, quickly posted a <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/online-consent-pop-ups-used-by-google-and-other-tech-firms-declared-illegal/">press statement</a> of his own, in which he writes: &#8220;We have won. The online advertising industry and its trade body, &#8216;IAB Europe&#8217;, have been found to have deprived hundreds of millions of Europeans of their fundamental rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;IAB Europe designed the misleading &#8216;consent&#8217; pop-ups that feature on almost all (80%+) European websites and apps. That system is known as IAB Europe’s &#8216;Transparency &amp; Consent Framework&#8217; (TCF). These popups purport to give people control over how their data are used by the online advertising industry. But in fact, it does not matter what people click.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The looming finding of unlawfulness comes at an interesting time for the tracking ads industry with moves afoot in the European Parliament to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">push for an outright ban on behavioral advertising</a> to be incorporated into incoming pan-EU regulations for digital services &#8212; in favor of privacy-safe alternatives like contextual advertising.</p>
<p>A finding that the flagship tool used by the tracking industry to claim &#8216;consent&#8217; to behavioral ads isn&#8217;t actually operating lawfully under EU law will surely amplify calls to clean house by outlawing the practice entirely.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the IAB Europe, the draft ruling by the Belgian DPA will find that it is a data controller for TCF “TC Strings”, aka &#8220;the digital signals created on websites to capture data subjects’ choices about the processing of their personal data for digital advertising, content and measurement&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>(Or &#8212; in Ryan&#8217;s words &#8212; &#8220;the identification code created about a person, based on which apps they use and which websites they visit, and what they click in consent popups&#8221;.)</p>
<p>It will also find the IAB Europe is a &#8220;joint controller&#8221; for TC Strings that are used in OpenRTB (Real Time Bidding) &#8212; meaning the industry body will have a string of risky new responsibilities attached to the data processing around programatic behavioral advertising (with legal liability aplenty and the risk of big fines if they fail to live up requirements in the GDPR such as privacy by design and default; consent that&#8217;s specific, informed and freely given; and appropriate security wrapping people&#8217;s data).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Ryan again, laying out the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/gdpr-adtech-complaints-keep-stacking-up-in-europe/">parallel case against RTB</a> in brief:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For almost four years, websites and apps have plagued Europeans with this &#8216;consent&#8217; spam. But our evidence reveals that IAB Europe knew that conventional tracking-based advertising was “incompatible with consent under GDPR” before it launched the consent system.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is because the primary tracking-based ad system, called &#8216;Real-Time Bidding&#8217; (RTB), broadcasts internet users’ behaviour and real-world locations to thousands of companies, billions of times a day. RTB is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/irelands-data-watchdog-slammed-for-letting-adtech-carry-on-biggest-breach-of-all-time/">biggest data breach ever recorded</a>. There is no way to protect data in this free-for-all. (We are <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/rtb-june-2021/">litigating</a> against RTB in Hamburg, too.)</p>
<p>&#8220;In proceedings initiated by a group of complainants coordinated by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Belgian Data Protection Authority is close to adopting a draft decision that will find IAB Europe’s its &#8216;consent&#8217; pop-up system infringes the GDPR, vindicating our arguments over several years.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The IAB Europe&#8217;s spin for trying to eschew responsibility for protecting people&#8217;s data is to try to spread blame elsewhere &#8212; claiming it has not considered itself a data controller &#8220;based on guidance from other DPAs up to now&#8221;, among other excuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, it has naturally not fulfilled certain obligations that accrue to data controllers under the Regulation,&#8221; the IAB Europe goes on in &#8212; studiously avoiding making any kind of apology.</p>
<p>(Here&#8217;s Ryan&#8217;s take again: &#8220;IAB Europe is jointly responsible and liable with thousands of online advertising firms when personal data are broadcast in to the RTB data free-for-all. IAB Europe had tried to deny this.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Instead of apologizing, the IAB Europe directs its energy toward suggesting there will be an easy way to fix the tracking industry&#8217;s lawfulness problem, writing: &#8220;The draft ruling will require IAB Europe to work with the APD to ensure that these obligations are met going forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making more market calming noises, it also describes itself as &#8220;optimistic&#8221; that the TCF can be fixed.</p>
<p>But, well, it would say that wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IsJ9zIfe2p"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/20/behavioural-advertising-is-out-of-control-warns-uk-watchdog/">Behavioural advertising is out of control, warns UK watchdog</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The online ad industry body has previously denied there was any case to bring against the TCF or RTB&#8217;s use of people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>So, well, its record here shouldn&#8217;t inspire confidence.</p>
<p>“Google and the entire tracking industry relies on IAB Europe’s consent system, which will now be found to be illegal”, added Ryan in a statement. “IAB Europe created a fake consent system that spammed everyone, every day, and served no purpose other than to give a thin legal cover to the massive data breach in at the heart of online advertising. We hope the decision of the Belgian Data Protection Authority will finally force the online advertising industry to reform.”</p>
<p>Another complainant in the case, Jef Ausloos, a postdoc researcher in data privacy at the University of Amsterdam, suggests the IAB Europe&#8217;s statement is an attempt to sow doubt among other EU DPAs &#8212; and called its claim that identification codes used for targeted advertising aren&#8217;t personal data &#8220;preposterous&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also described the Belgian finding as &#8220;only the very start of the process as I see it&#8221;, adding: &#8220;We&#8217;ve come a long way already but, regardless, this will still take a while&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time of the writing the Belgian DPA had not responded to our request for confirmation of an impending draft ruling.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the IAB Europe claimed it has &#8220;only been informed about the headline findings of the draft ruling&#8221;. She did not specify how it had obtained the information ahead of the complainants. (<strong>Update:</strong> We asked if the information came from the Belgian DPA and she said &#8220;yes, that&#8217;s correct&#8221;.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. Department of State is upping the ante in its fight against <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> by offering a reward of up to $10 million for information that helps identify or track down leaders of the notorious DarkSide ransomware group.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.state.gov/reward-offers-for-information-to-bring-darkside-ransomware-variant-co-conspirators-to-justice/">State Department said</a> it’s also offering as much as $5 million for information that leads to the arrest or conviction of anyone ”conspiring to participate in or attempting to participate in a DarkSide variant ransomware incident.” This is likely a nod to the group’s affiliate program, in which members receive a custom variant of the DarkSide ransomware and receive a chunk of any ransom payment profits.</p>
<p>“In offering this reward, the United States demonstrates its commitment to protecting ransomware victims around the world from exploitation by cybercriminals,” the State Department said. “The United States looks to nations who harbor ransomware criminals that are willing to bring justice for those victim businesses and organizations affected by ransomware.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229968" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2229993" style="width: 706px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229993" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229993 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fbi-darkside-wanted-poster.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="900" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fbi-darkside-wanted-poster.jpg 696w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fbi-darkside-wanted-poster.jpg?resize=116,150 116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fbi-darkside-wanted-poster.jpg?resize=232,300 232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fbi-darkside-wanted-poster.jpg?resize=526,680 526w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fbi-darkside-wanted-poster.jpg?resize=39,50 39w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229993" class="wp-caption-text">The FBI&#8217;s wanted poster for the DarkSide ransomware group. (Image: FBI)</p></div></p>
<p>The State Department says it launched the bounty in the wake of DarkSide’s attack on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline</a> earlier this year, which led to the shut down of a 5,500-mile pipeline that carries 45% of the fuel used on the U.S. east coast.</p>
<p>The group went dark shortly after its servers were hacked, and later rebranded as BlackMatter, which went on to attack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">Japanese technology giant Olympus</a> in September and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/cisa-nsa-blackmatter-food-industry/">“multiple” organizations deemed critical infrastructure</a>, including two companies in the U.S. food and agriculture sector. BlackMatter said this week that it was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/blackmatter-ransomware-shut-down/">ceasing operations</a> due to pressure from law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The $10 million reward is being offered under the Department of State’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program (TOCRP), which it manages with federal law enforcement partners as part of the government’s effort to disrupt and dismantle international crime syndicates. The State Department noted that it had paid $135 million in rewards since it was created in 1986.</p>
<p>Jake Wiliams, CTO at BreachQuest, told TechCrunch that the State Department’s bumper reward will cause ripples far beyond DarkSide: “With rewards this large, there’s a substantial incentive for these criminals to turn on one another. Perhaps more importantly than the specific impacts to DarkSide, this action undermines trust across the ransomware as a service affiliate model.</p>
<p>“This is especially good timing since it capitalizes on the recent REvil infiltration by law enforcement. The law enforcement action against REvil in July already caused significant trust issues among operators. This drives that wedge deeper and will extend far beyond DarkSide.”</p>
<p>This is the latest in a long line of efforts by the Biden administration to crack down on the growing ransomware threat. Most recently, the Treasury took steps to crack down on virtual currency exchanges <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/us-treasury-sanctions-suex-ransomware/">by sanctioning Suex for its role in facilitating ransomware payments</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rent the Runway is more than 10 years old now and has raised upwards of $500 million, recently filing to IPO at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">a valuation north of $1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Jenny Fleiss is a co-founder at Rent the Runway and sits on the board of several notable companies, including Shutterfly, Party City and, of course, Rent the Runway. She&#8217;s also a partner at Volition Capital alongside Larry Cheng.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of TechCrunch Live, Fleiss and Cheng will sit down to discuss their fundraising philosophy and for Fleiss, how her experience at building a unicorn influences investments in early stage startups now.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s data season, with groups like Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), CB Insights, PitchBook and Crunchbase News putting out data sets that we&#8217;re having fun exploring. This morning, we&#8217;re adding one more to our arsenal.</p>
<p>The Exchange spent some time this week diving into the SVB &#8220;<a href="https://www.svb.com/trends-insights/reports/state-of-the-markets-2021-q4-report">State of the Market</a>&#8221; report for the fourth quarter. As is common from the bank&#8217;s publications, it&#8217;s a dense riff of charts and notes, ranging from economic data and trade figures to venture capital statistics.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>While perusing the collected information, we found an interesting pattern: Venture capital investors are racing to pay more to buy smaller pieces of startups that are less profitable than before.</p>
<p>While that may sound somewhat rude, it isn&#8217;t. Instead, the capital crush that we&#8217;ve seen overtake startups around the world, the round preemption that has become common, the rising valuation marks that have become the entry price to hot startups&#8217; cap tables and investments into growth have all come together to create a venture capital market unlike any that I can recall.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />SVB gave The Exchange permission to share a few charts, so what follows is a graphical dig into the data, proving that I am not a brat for claiming that venture investors are getting a rawer deal than usual but merely sharing what the data indicates.</p>
<h2>Less for more</h2>
<p>First, let&#8217;s examine how the time between funding rounds has fallen. SVB data shows a useful 2020 versus 2021 differential, with an aggregate chart tracking the same data over a longer time period on the right:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229017" style="width: 850px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229017" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2229017 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-8.36.17-AM.png" alt="" width="840" height="287" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-8.36.17-AM.png 840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-8.36.17-AM.png?resize=150,51 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-8.36.17-AM.png?resize=300,103 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-8.36.17-AM.png?resize=768,262 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-8.36.17-AM.png?resize=680,232 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-8.36.17-AM.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229017" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SVB</p></div></p>
<p>As you can see in both charts, venture capitalists are accelerating the pace at which they make successive investments into startups. This is what we meant by <em>faster</em>.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Designing for everyone: Accessibility and machine learning at Apple</h2>
<p dir="ltr">For the Apple session, TechCrunch editor-in-chief Matthew Panzarino will speak with Jeff Bigham and Sarah Herrlinger.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229733" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Bigham is the research lead for AI/ML accessibility at Apple, as well as an associate professor of computer science at Carnegie-Mellon. He leads a team of researchers and engineers focused on advancing accessibility through artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Herrlinger is Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy &amp; Initiatives. She leads accessibility programs for Apple — including support for disability communities worldwide, the accessibility technologies built into all Apple hardware, software and services, as well as other initiatives that promote Apple’s culture of inclusion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Apple’s iPhone and VoiceOver are among the most treasured tools available to blind people because they provide so many services, from navigation to reading email out loud. With the addition of lidar and computer-vision capabilities, among others, the phone in combination with cloud compute has become even more capable as a source of data about the world and a means to interpret that information in meaningful ways. Herrlinger and Bigham will provide an overview of Apple’s approach to accessible design, advances of the past year, inclusivity in machine learning research and latest approaches and future features.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Why Amazon’s vision includes talking less to Alexa</h2>
<p dir="ltr">For the Amazon session, Be My Eyes’ vice president Will Butler will speak with Prem Natarajan, vice president of Alexa AI and Beatrice Geoffrin, director of Alexa Trust.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Geoffrin is a director of Product Management on the Alexa team at Amazon. She leads the Alexa Trust organization that is focused on earning and maintaining the trust customers have in Alexa and making Alexa accessible, overseeing the Alexa for Everyone team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Natarajan leads a multidisciplinary science, engineering and product organization which improves customer experience through advances in dialog modeling, natural language understanding, entity linking and resolution, and related machine learning technologies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Amazon’s Alexa is already a standard feature in most homes, and it’s another great addition to a blind person’s technology tool set. As homes become increasingly more technology-driven, inputs from multiple sources — teachable AI, multimodal understanding, sensors, computer vision and more — will create a truly ambient, surround experience. Already, 1 in every 5 Alexa smart home interactions is initiated by Alexa without any spoken command. As Alexa develops an understanding of us and our home well enough to predict our needs and act on our behalf in meaningful ways, what are the implications for accessibility?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>While few would argue over the need for a tech-enabled solution to make parenting easier, the demand is more obvious than the execution. Parenting is hard and requires support for a whole range of moments, from when your kid accidentally eats a button to early signs of depression during the remote school day. The diversity of issues that parents face could thus be a customer service nightmare, but it&#8217;s exactly the reason that founder Saurabh Kamalapurkar feels strongly about building Guardians Collective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aboutgc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guardians Collective</a> brings together small groups of families and pairs them with an early childhood educator, a broad term that can describe a professional who has experience working in early learning and development programs or is licensed in a state to run a day care. The mission, and broader goal of the company, is to make early childhood educators more accessible to families, who once had to lean on formal day cares as the only way to get support. Instead, it’s offering a more savvy, supported way to scale peer-to-peer learning — early mornings and late nights included.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229618" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Today, the startup announced a $3.5 million seed investment round led by Reach Capital with participation from Impact America Fund and Gary Philanthropies.</p>
<p>In my view, Guardians Collective is bringing a fresh take on a controversial trend from the early innings of COVID-19: learning pods. The term, somewhat synonymous with microschools, pandemic pods and small-group learning, describes small clusters of children within the same age range who are paired with a private instructor with the goal of replacing, or supplementing, school learning. Critics saw the growing trend as a threat to low-income students who would consequently face an even larger gap in access to learning material.</p>
<p>Chian Gong, who led the investment for Reach Capital, thinks Guardians Collective is much more than a learning pod, or even a WhatsApp group with other parents.</p>
<p>“WhatsApp connects you to people you already know … whereas Guardians Collective brings you together with 3-5 other families and an early childhood educator in a safe space to ask the questions you can&#8217;t ask anywhere else,” she said. “You get the wisdom, insights and empathy of an educator who has worked with thousands of young kids and who is guiding dialogue among four other families with children at the same age [and] stage.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229632" style="width: 445px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229632" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2229632" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS3-1.png" alt="" width="435" height="774" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS3-1.png 1242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS3-1.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS3-1.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS3-1.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS3-1.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS3-1.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS3-1.png?resize=1152,2048 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PS3-1.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229632" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Guardians Collective</p></div></p>
<p>She added that she thinks the magic of the platform is its combination of expertise, content and community. Winnie, another venture-backed startup in the early childhood space, is a marketplace for childcare that parents can use to find physical day care and preschools near them. And recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/kaipod-learning-thinks-learning-pods-are-here-to-stay/">KaiPod Learning raised millions</a> to give homeschooled children exposure to local, supplemental and socially focused learning hubs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All the startups differ in execution and product strategy, but seemingly fit within the same vision of bringing more connection and access to resources to empower children at scale.</p>
<p>Part of Guardians Collective’s strategy includes convincing more early childhood educators to get on its platform. It’s a political issue, considering that most states require people to get licensed to run day care centers — and prices plus bias can increase who can actually go through that process. The startup is figuring out how to balance quality assurance with people who aren’t licensed but have been supporting children for generations.</p>
<p>“A lot of systems won’t even call these people educators,” Kamalapurkar said. “But they’re not just diaper changers — they’re teachers.” Teacher organizations are biting at the idea of joining a more asynchronous workforce: Guardians Collective did a callout to recruit 40 educators and got 470 applications within days.</p>
<p>So far, Guardians Collective has families using its app in Detroit, New Orleans, Alaska, Navajo Nation, Oklahoma and California’s Central Valley. Over half of the customers are classified as low income, the founder said. The startup uses a subscription model, with a sliding scale, to make sure it can offer an affordable price point to any family that wants to use it.</p>
<p>With venture money in the tank, Guardians Collective will need to balance user retention with new expectations on growth. The company has over 700 families using its platform in the Bay Area but sports a nationwide growth rate of 16x since the beginning of 2020. It also claims that retention is 94%, and 94% of users use the app daily on weekdays.</p>
<p>The big metric that Kamalapurkar is focused on is an elusive one, looking at what families are talking about, where the conversations are occurring and what percentage of messages get answered in a useful way.</p>
<p>“Scale is not only a function of the number of customers we reach, but in what we mean to them,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HashiCorp <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001720671/000119312521319849/d205906ds1.htm">filed go public this week</a>, becoming the latest addition to our growing roster of expected fourth-quarter IPOs.</p>
<p>The cloud infrastructure unicorn presents an interesting mix of open source and proprietary code, with recurring revenues and a nascent hosted product.</p>

<p>To understand HashiCorp&#8217;s performance, we&#8217;ll need to spend a minute talking about how it approaches the market. If you are a fan of open source software (OSS) or curious how companies with a core of open code make money, it should be an interesting read.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220369 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-orng-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>In very broad terms, HashiCorp grew about 50% in its most recent quarter from a year earlier, but with narrower losses. The company has reached nine-figure revenue scale, meaning that the unicorn <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/hashicorp-series-e--515a0e65">worth some $5 billion or so</a> back in 2020 is going to make a splash when it lists.</p>
<p>No more throat clearing, let&#8217;s talk OSS, how it shakes out into a business model and how strong HashiCorp&#8217;s historical results appear through this July.</p>
<h2>HashiCorp&#8217;s open source approach</h2>
<p>When we wrote above that HashiCorp is a cloud infrastructure company, we meant it. It has built a suite of tools that help other companies manage cloud applications (Terraform), keep them and their data secure (Boundary, Vault), handle networking on a granular level (Consul) and deal with orchestration and cross-platform deployment (Nomad, Waypoint).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an incredibly brief overview, but it should give you an idea of the breadth of the software that HashiCorp has built over the course of its life. We expected a good amount of code, frankly; this is a company going public after all, not some middling Series C startup with hopes of one day growing into a unicorn price.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where things get fun. Per the company&#8217;s S-1 filing, it has &#8220;deliberately built [its] products using an open-core software development model.&#8221; In practical terms, that means that all HashiCorp software products are &#8220;developed as open source projects, with large communities of users, contributors, and partners collaborating on their development.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Exchange has written some about how OSS has evolved from exoticism to in-market advantage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/2170552/">in recent months</a>. For investors just now picking up on the monetization possibilities that open source software can unlock in-market, HashiCorp&#8217;s IPO should be a klaxon that they are behind.</p>
<p>Regardless, how <em>does</em> HashiCorp make money from open source software? The company has built proprietary code atop its open source products that it sells, while also offering support and a hosted version of its products.</p>
<p>The company generates revenue in several buckets. The first and biggest bucket is subscription revenues. The second is professional services — this is generally understood, so we&#8217;ll leave it alone.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fusion energy</a> has been a fiery dream for lovers of clean energy since the first controlled thermonuclear fusion reaction was accomplished some 60 years ago. The technology promises all the benefits of current-generation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear fission</a> generators, at a fraction of the risk, with far less radioactivity when running, and with very little radioactive waste. There&#8217;s been one catch: So far, it has been hard to get the fusion process to generate more energy than it has been consuming to keep the reaction under control.</p>
<p>Helion, as a company, has been focusing less on fusion as a science experiment and more on a more important question: Can their technology generate electricity at a commercial and industrial scale?</p>
<p>&#8220;Some projects in the fusion space talk about heat, or energy, or other things. Helion is focused on electricity generation. Can we get it out fast, at a low cost? Can we get it to industrial-scale power?&#8221; asks David Kirtley, Helion&#8217;s co-founder and CEO. &#8220;We are building systems that are about the size of a shipping container and that can deliver industrial-scale power &#8212; say on the order of 50 megawatts of electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June of this year, Helion<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210622005366/en/Helion-Energy-Achieves-100-Million-Degrees-Celsius-Fusion-Fuel-Temperature-and-Confirms-16-Month-Continuous-Operation-of-Its-Fusion-Generator-Prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210622005366/en/Helion-Energy-Achieves-100-Million-Degrees-Celsius-Fusion-Fuel-Temperature-and-Confirms-16-Month-Continuous-Operation-of-Its-Fusion-Generator-Prototype&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1636070604211000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHpiyZtJtoGXpUg4x0r2PrDyjwWVg"> published results</a> confirming it had become the first private fusion company to heat a fusion plasma to 100 million degrees Celsius, an important milestone on the path to commercial electricity from fusion. Soon after, the company announced it had broken ground on building its factory to start the process of preparing for manufacturing of its seventh-generation fusion generator, which the company calls &#8220;Polaris.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch was surprised to learn of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/y-combinator-and-mithril-invest-in-helion-a-nuclear-fusion-startup/">the company&#8217;s $1.5 million round back in 2014</a>, when the company said it would be able to get net power generation of fusion up and running within three years. Here we are seven years later, and it appears that Helion hit a couple of wobbles &#8212; but the company also found a focus along the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ended up pivoting a little bit in direction, to focus less on scientific milestones of energy and focus more specifically on electricity. We had to prove some of the technologies on the electricity, and electricity extraction side of things. We also needed some funding things that had to happen to get us all the way to those technical milestones,&#8221; Kirtley reflects. &#8220;Unfortunately, that took a little bit longer than we had hoped.&#8221;</p>

<p>As part of the investment round, Sam Altman steps up from being the chairman of the board, to Helion&#8217;s executive chairman, with a higher degree of activity, including input into the commercial direction of the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first funding round was led by Mithril Capital, and Y Combinator was part of it. That&#8217;s where we got introduced to Sam. He has been involved in our fundraising ever since. He is an ambassador that actually understands physics; it&#8217;s pretty amazing. We were really pleased that he was interested in leading the investment, rather than us having to bring in external investors that might have been differently aligned and have a less deep understanding of the technology,&#8221; Kirtley explains. &#8220;He&#8217;s seen the successes, and he has seen what they mean. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited not only to have him as an investor but have him more actively involved. It means we can accelerate the timelines. The funding is part of it, and the technology is another part of it. Ultimately, we need to get it out there in the world, and that&#8217;s something Sam can help us do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m delighted to be investing more in Helion, which is by far the most promising approach to fusion I’ve ever seen,&#8221; said Altman. &#8220;With a tiny fraction of the money spent on other fusion efforts, and the culture of a startup, this team has a clear path to net electricity. If Helion is successful, we can avert climate disaster and provide a much better quality of life for people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helion&#8217;s CEO speculates that its first customers may turn out to be data centers, which have a couple of advantages over other potential customers. Data centers are power-hungry, and often already have power infrastructure in place in order to be able to accept backup generators. In addition, they tend to be a little away from population centers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have a backup power of diesel generators, giving them a few megawatts that keep the data centers running just long enough to sustain any power grid issues,&#8221; Kirtley says, but suggests that the company is more ambitious than just replacing backup diesel generators. The low cost and high power availability mean that the company could start powering whole data centers as the default power source: &#8220;We are excited about being at the 50-megawatt scale, and being able to get electricity costs down to a cent per kilowatt-hour. You can completely change how data centers work, and you can really start answering climate change. Our focus is making low-cost and carbon-free electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Due to physical limitations with the way the power is generated, the current generation of the company&#8217;s tech wouldn&#8217;t be able to replace your Tesla Powerwall and solar panels &#8212; the size of a generator is roughly the size of a shipping container. But at 50 megawatts, the generators could power around 40,000 homes, and with that amount of power, the technology could open some really interesting opportunities for distributed power grids.</p>
<p>One interesting innovation in Helion&#8217;s power generation solution is that it doesn&#8217;t use water and steam as intermediary steps in the power generation.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the beginning of my career, I kept looking at the way we were doing fusion and said hey, you have this beautiful energy that is all electric, including the plasma. And then what do you do? You boil water, you use an old, low-efficiency, capital-intensive process,&#8221; explains Kirtley. Instead of going via water, the company decided to skip a step and use inductive energy instead. &#8220;Can you bypass that whole era? Could we do the equivalent of bypassing the gasoline engine and go right to electric cars right from the beginning? And so that&#8217;s been what we&#8217;ve been focusing on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is aiming to be able to generate more electricity than what it takes to run the fusion reactor by 2024, and the CEO points out that the goal at this point is to generate electricity at a commercial scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our 2024 date is not a key demonstration of the science at this point. The goal is to go after commercially installed power generation. There&#8217;s a huge market, and we want to be able to get this out in the world as soon as possible,&#8221; concludes Kirtley.</p>
<p>&#8220;By focusing on getting to electricity as soon as possible, we should be able to count on fusion as part of the natural conversation we&#8217;re having about climate change and about carbon free electricity generation. We&#8217;re really excited we&#8217;ve secured this funding, and the amount we raised should be able to get us all the way there.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shared electric micromobility giant Lime has closed a $523 million raise in convertible debt and term loan financing, money that Lime CEO Wayne Ting says is the next step on the company&#8217;s path to going public next year. Lime will use the capital to invest in its decarbonization efforts, refresh a significant portion of its fleet with its Gen4 e-bikes and e-scooters, scale into more cities and develop new technologies that will help win additional city RFPs.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a very oversubscribed round, and I think it really does underscore the renewed interest in micromobility as a sector, and more importantly, the recognition that Lime is the undisputed leader in this space,&#8221; Ting told TechCrunch. &#8220;Companies typically do a convertible note as the last round before they go IPO and investors are betting that the company is going public, and they want to get in on the round early because they get to come in at a discount. And we certainly think the fact that you know, over $400 million of investment coming in is a real great milestone as we look towards taking Lime public next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the total funding amount, $418 million is made up of convertible debt led by Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Uber and certain funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management. That debt will convert into shares automatically when Lime goes public. The remaining $105 million comes in as a senior secured term loan facility from the private credit group UBS O&#8217;Connor. Lime would not reveal the terms of the loan.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229779" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Fidelity and Uber are among Lime&#8217;s largest previous investors. In 2019, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/06/lime-closes-310-million-series-d-valuing-the-company-at-2-4-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fidelity was one of the leading investors in Lime&#8217;s $310 million Series D</a>, and last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">Uber led a $170 million down round</a> for Lime as it struggled with pandemic woes, a deal that saw Lime acquire Uber&#8217;s micromobility subsidiary Jump.</p>
<p>This announcement, coupled with Lime&#8217;s stated intention to go public next year, comes as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/shareholders-approve-bird-spac-merger-stock-promptly-falls/">competitor Bird enters the markets via a SPAC deal</a> with Switchback II Corporation. Ting didn&#8217;t specify <em>when</em> next year Lime would file for IPO or whether it would go the traditional route or attempt a SPAC merger, but sources familiar with Lime say it&#8217;s unlikely the company will pursue the SPAC route.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make sure we have enough capital to achieve our mission, which is to build a transportation alternative that is shared, that is affordable, that is green,&#8221; said Ting.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Lime had its carbon targets <a href="https://www.li.me/second-street/lime-climate-target-validated-by-sbti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative</a>, an organization that promotes best practices in emissions reductions in line with climate science, and announced that it is working toward being consistent with the Paris Climate Accord and being net-zero by 2030. The company is dedicating $20 million of its latest round toward decarbonization efforts, such as investing in cleaner hardware and ensuring that 80% of its supply chain sets better emissions goals. Capital goods, which includes the vehicles themselves, including all of the extraction of materials and production that goes into them, make up 44.3% of Lime&#8217;s total emissions, according to the company&#8217;s carbon targets report. Pre-purchased goods and services, which consist of scooter parts and warehouse expenses, make up 25.8%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I want to show tangible results through capital investments to change our operations, to pushing our suppliers,&#8221; said Ting, who also said Lime would not continue to work with suppliers that don&#8217;t have their own carbon targets in the hope that other companies also pressure manufacturing partners to make similar commitments. &#8220;We mean business when we talk about decarbonization and transportation. When we do become a public company, I want our investors to know that that&#8217;s what this company stands for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lime will primarily use the funds to double down on its existing city permits, deepening its relationships in the markets in which it already resides. That could look like building new vehicle modes or investing in technology &#8220;that actually makes us good partners to cities as we expand and scale our business,&#8221; said Ting, but he didn&#8217;t specify what new modes or technologies Lime is exploring.</p>
<p>However, last month Ting mentioned that Lime is interested in joining the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">sidewalk detection technology club</a> during a WSJ tech event, at which time the CEO also claimed that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/lime-announces-second-ebitda-profitable-quarter-in-company-history/">Lime is third quarter EBITDA profitable</a> for the second time. Lime was able to reach this level in large part through bottom line growth, meaning the company is running a tight ship. But COVID has continued to affect new ridership and top line growth, despite the fact that the operator launched in 80 contracts this year.</p>
<p>The main use cases for Lime, commute and tourism, are slowly starting to creep back. The United States just announced that it would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/exclusive-us-partly-lift-international-travel-curbs-nov-8-official-2021-10-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lift the travel ban for Europeans</a> who have been double vaccinated. Expanding into new cities is also on Lime&#8217;s roadmap pre-IPO. Ting said Lime is targeting North American and European expansion, but is also interested in looking toward the Middle East, where the company&#8217;s lead investor in this round is based.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve actually seen that we&#8217;ve grown our intercity travel by a ton, and in 2021, our revenue is going to be back to 2019 pre-pandemic levels,&#8221; said Ting. &#8220;People are looking for a safe, affordable, single passenger way to move, and a lot of people have shifted their ridership onto micromobility platforms like Lime. When I look towards 2022, we have an opportunity to deepen that relationship with riders.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With just 22 days left until the holiday shopping season begins, we spoke to several growth marketers to find out how 2021's supply chain meltdowns are impacting their campaign planning.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Because we&#8217;re just 22 days from the official start of the holiday shopping season, we reached out to several growth marketers we&#8217;ve gotten to know through our TechCrunch Experts project to find out how this year&#8217;s supply chain issues are effecting their planned campaigns.</p>
<p>We spoke with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliolopez87">Julio Lopez</a>, director of client strategy, retail practice lead, <a href="https://movableink.com/">Movable Ink</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christoy/">Chris Toy</a>, CEO and co-founder, <a href="https://marketerhire.com/">Marketer Hire</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristindick/">Kristin Dick</a>, head of operations and growth marketer, <a href="https://tuffgrowth.com/">Tuff</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diptiparmar/">Dipti Parmar</a>, founder, <a href="https://diptiparmar.com/">Dipti Parmar Consulting</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The global supply chain disruptions we&#8217;ve seen so far this year will take time to repair. Even as vaccinated employees get back to work, a kaleidoscope of bottlenecks remain: truck driver shortages, congestion at shipping ports and the scarcity of empty shipping containers and the vessels that can carry them.</p>
<p>In quarterly earnings calls, &#8220;there were adjustments made to projections based on the fact that there&#8217;s no telling what challenges we might face going into Q4, as far as supply chain,&#8221; said Lopez. To maximize order flow and meet customer expectations, Dick said her company moved up its campaign start dates by 2-3 weeks and plans to lean more heavily on SMS and email campaigns than in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I look at what&#8217;s happening with these companies from a marketing perspective it&#8217;s all good, solid fundamentals,&#8221; Toy advised. &#8220;A lot of this frankly is what you should be doing year-round.&#8221; Considering the marketing basics, and learning how to pivot at a moment&#8217;s notice, these marketers are ready for the holiday shopping season. Are you?</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a growth marketer that you think we should know about, please fill out the survey below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><script src="//embed.typeform.com/next/embed.js"></script></p>
<h2>Julio Lopez, director of client strategy, retail practice lead, Movable Ink</h2>
<p>Not only is the pandemic a big consideration and supply chain challenge, but we’re also faced with some natural disasters. There&#8217;s been flooding; there&#8217;s been fires. There are many things that are impacting retailers’ ability to control their supply chain. We&#8217;re hearing everything from products not being manufactured to things being stuck at ports of entry, because there isn&#8217;t enough staff, or there aren’t enough shipping containers to get things over here from China.</p>
<p>This is something that is very much top of mind for a lot of retailers and listening to some earning calls in the last quarter, there were adjustments made to projections based on the fact that there&#8217;s no telling what challenges we might face going into Q4, as far as supply chain.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s very important for retailers to be aware that their marketing plans and the SKUs or lines that they were looking to feature at a particular point in time in Q4, may or may not be available. They&#8217;re going to have to be ready to pivot their marketing calendars to account for inventory that may or may not be in stock. So that&#8217;s another place where data and the value of data become even more important.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More fuel for social audio: Berlin-based social audio startup <a href="https://beams.fm/">Beams</a>, which is building a platform for sharing and consuming short-form audio recordings &#8212; as a sort of bite-sized/deconstructed and/or collaborative podcast format which it bills as &#8220;audio-based social media&#8221; &#8212; has doubled its seed funding, adding another $3 million to close out the round at $6M.</p>
<p>&#8220;We raised $3M in late 2020. While in the testing phase, we had very high interest and attention from investors. So in early summer of this year we decided to take on two new strategic investors &#8212; The Venture City and Kal Vepuri &#8212; bringing our overall seed funding to $6M,&#8221; explain two of Beams&#8217; four co-founders (and its co-CEOs), Alan Sternberg and Robert Kilian, on why it&#8217;s taking more funding now.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/onbeams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase</a>, the 2019 founded audio startup&#8217;s earlier seed and pre-seed investors were Mangrove Capital Partners and Redalpine.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Beams counts former Soundcloud, Spotify, and N26 employees among its founding team &#8212; and its PR touts a &#8220;deep understanding of why people connect around voice&#8221;.</p>
<p>Its wider pitch is to create a platform where people can &#8220;come together and share diverse views on different trends and interests&#8221; &#8212; which is something we&#8217;ve heard from a variety of social audio startups, such as the (advice focused) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/anyone-is-building-a-marketplace-for-advice-one-5-minute-call-at-a-time/">Anyone</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/wisdom-is-a-social-audio-app-for-opening-access-to-mentorship/">Wisdom</a>, to name two others that also hail from Europe.</p>
<p>Users on Beams are encouraged to join interest-based groups and (asynchronously) listen or clip into topic-based threads &#8212; on, well, whatever you want to talk about, be it art or politics, fashion, food or music etc etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Topics on Beams are a real pick&#8217;n&#8217;mix &#8212; and the overall experience can feel pretty random. Like the aural equivalent of a splatter-painting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8216;Real people, real voices&#8217; is the slogan Beams has come up with for its app-based alternative to switching on (and dialling around) talk radio. (Or, well, logging onto <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/clubhouse-language-support-android/">Clubhouse</a> &#8212; or hopping into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/twitter-now-lets-you-tune-into-spaces-without-an-account-via-direct-links/">Twitter Space</a> to hear what some of your followers, or someone else&#8217;s, are nattering about.)</p>
<p>Finding the signal in the noice of social audio is turning out to be the real challenge.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="amcKoxcu3C"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">Clubhouse closes an undisclosed $4B valuation Series C round, as tech giants&#8217; clones circle</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse closes an undisclosed $4B valuation Series C round, as tech giants&#8217; clones circle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/embed/#?secret=amcKoxcu3C" data-secret="amcKoxcu3C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Audio clips on Beam are hard-capped at 90 seconds but recordings can be shorter (although as threads build they work against that by stringing sound snippets together). So it&#8217;s using quasi-brevity as a device to try to cut through.</p>
<p>And if &lt;90s is still not short enough for your attention span a button in the app let&#8217;s you speed up playback to up to 2x so it takes even less time for your ears to consume each audio tidbit. (You can also slow playback speed to 0.75x.)</p>
<p>A quick spin around the app suggests content creators are in fairly short supply on Beam. Some of the featured threads on the home page containing just one or two responses, for example. And a few minutes of browsing also turns up the same handful of faces contributing to a variety of threads &#8212; some of whom we confirmed to be Beams staff.</p>
<p>So organic community-building looks like a work in progress.</p>
<p>Beams says its early users comprise a real &#8220;range&#8221;, from young people exchanging stories/memories around cultural themes or past events; to pro audio content creators doing 60 second interviews for sharing elsewhere; to photographers using the form to give people on their art a voice; to citizen journalists recording events on the go.</p>
<p>Many of the featured groups/topics we saw appear to be obvious seeds to try to encourage content generation (&#8216;the best advice you have ever received&#8217;; &#8216;breakfast around the world&#8217; etc); or groups labelled &#8216;Open Mic&#8217; &#8212; which nudge users to share their stories around specific themes (like women&#8217;s &#8216;Uber Stories&#8217;, or &#8216;Tinder Stories&#8217;).</p>
<p>While the group we saw that had the largest number of members (~1k) was an open pitch around podcast ideas and soliciting help for podcast projects.</p>
<p>In general, groups had far fewer members and seemed more focused/niche &#8212; say aimed at illuminating a specific local issues (&#8216;Police reform in Minneapolis explained&#8217;). Or narrating a specific perspective/experience (&#8217;20 years after 9/11&#8242;). Or trying to eke out travel/food tips (&#8216;Best Vegan Spots Las Vegas&#8217;). But quite why you&#8217;d need some of those sorts of content in an audio form vs text is one question to ponder.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting groups we encountered &#8212; &#8220;Young, Black &amp; Fly&#8221; (59 members) &#8212; describes itself as &#8220;a micro podcast about art, film &amp; music for all, through the lenses of young black creatives&#8221;, and was doing bite-sized back-and-forth interviews with creators across a variety of artistic mediums.</p>
<p>On the less interesting side there was the obligatory NFT daily news group (18 members).</p>
<p>Beams&#8217; short-form audio format lends itself to holding Q&amp;A style interviews between a group host and an invited guest. Which means the entire interview ends up deconstructed into discoverable/sharable chunks. But the downside of that is it&#8217;s less immersive than tuning into a full-fat podcast/radio show.</p>
<p>Open groups aim to recreate the Q&amp;A vibe but without active curation by asking anyone who feels like it to chip in. Which means the resulting thread can be, well, a mixed bag in terms of interest/quality from the listener&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>Overall, Beams feels like it&#8217;s still very much in the experimental phase.</p>
<p>Nor is it yet clear whether it&#8217;s onto something with bite-size &#8216;micropods&#8217; for the attention-strapped (post-radio) generation. Or, well, adding to the social audio noise.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Asked how many users the app has, Beams co-founders hedge their response &#8212; saying &#8220;we know of more than 40,000 unique users participating in over 5,000 groups&#8221; &#8212; so presumably it has fewer active users (and the group metric is being actively driven by Beams&#8217; own staff). </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Although it only beta launched in May 2021 so it is still early days.</span></p>
<p>Why focus on short-form audio as a social media medium? &#8220;The short-form recorded audio space needs innovation, from both a creator and consumer point of view,&#8221; Sternberg and Kilian suggest.</p>
<p>&#8220;To create good audio content with today’s options, the bar is very high. You need hardware, you need real expertise in speaking, and it simply is not built for the mainstream. The average person has a hard time making audio content because there’s just too much friction.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to consumption, that too, isn’t really easy. For instance, the only way to know if a podcast or a live audio session is going to be useful or entertaining or worth your time is to listen to it! You don’t know how it’s going to turn out, you can’t navigate your way to &#8216;the good part&#8217; and again, it’s just not a really easy thing to dive into unless you totally know and trust the person creating the content.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to build innovative solutions for this &#8212; to help people enjoy audio recordings and hearing another person’s voice in a simple way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly they&#8217;re not there yet on surfacing purely &#8216;worthy listens&#8217;, though.</p>
<p>Chunking up audio into 90s (meaning you inexorably have to listen to a lot of repetitive &#8216;hello/intro&#8217; spiel) and providing a button for users to crank it to 2x speed of the human voice is a far cry from only airing amazing audio.</p>
<p>Indeed, it sort of implies you think a lot of the content will be skippable. And if your tools to help listeners cut through boring bits end up creating filler audio in the process &#8212; including by soliciting audio content from anyone, voicing thoughts and making recordings of any quality &#8212; the whole approach might be, well, a bit counterproductive&#8230; (Alternatively, Beams may just not yet have found its groove; Communities do take time to nurture and grow.)</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s co-CEO also reckon that current audio platforms are lacking &#8220;intuitive ways for people to connect&#8221;, arguing: &#8220;There is no topic-related and equally interactive audio platform out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beams&#8217; focus is on building tools that &#8220;let people easily record their thoughts in different ways and share them into groups and topics&#8221;, they say, emphasizing the goal of structuring audio.</p>
<p>They also describe what they&#8217;re building as &#8220;an extended audio player for people to be a part of voice threads &#8212; similar to the music streaming services&#8221;. And say they&#8217;re planning to add audio transcriptions and enable Beams&#8217; voice recordings to be exported to other social networks for consuming there too.</p>
<p>Adding other forms of interactions around voice threads is also on their to-do list.</p>
<p>As well as focusing on building &#8220;simple and inclusive&#8221; tools for sharing and consuming audio, Sternberg and Kilian say the aim is to differentiate in a competitive space by being more open vs (more) closed competitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;While most other audio platforms put everything solely in their apps or behind logged-in walls, we don’t like to force people into a closed ecosystem to connect with each other,&#8221; they say, adding: &#8220;We really see ourselves as more of a platform for building audio solutions, not just as a social media network, since we are also available and open on the Web, where you don’t have to be logged in or even have <span class="il">Beams</span> as an app.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Our aim is to give people a way to collect and share voices on the street, provide journalists and media a way to easily embed and share stories, and let friends share their voices on the apps they prefer &#8212; whether that be WhatsApp, Telegram, or Signal.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What about monetization? That&#8217;s not even a conversation for Beams&#8217; co-CEOs yet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are all about building a platform, and a community around collaborative short-form audio. By looking closely at how different user groups use our product we learn and we are sure we will introduce meaningful ways for our community and us to generate revenue in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">And moderation? &#8220;Moderation will be a big challenge but recorded audio content (which is transcribed into text as well) allows us to build more products to protect our community,&#8221; they suggest.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company offers a recurring subscription, and 50% of every dollar spent goes back to farmers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Julia Niiro is on a mission to create a food supply chain that connects small farmers directly to consumers.</p>
<p>Niiro started <a href="https://www.localmilkrun.com/?utm_source=TechCrunch&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Series%20A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MilkRun</a>, a subscription service delivering weekly grocery staples sourced from small, local farms, in 2018 after becoming a small farmer herself in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>She had purchased a meat-processing company and was working with area ranchers when she learned that 85% of farmers are over 65 years old and were being asked to increase food output as populations increase, yet only profiting 10 cents on every dollar.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229571" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Our model is to increase profits by helping small farmers get more of their goods purchased,” she told TechCrunch. “Like the traditional milkman model, people buy directly from the farm and have it delivered. This next wave of the food industry will be how to reduce the middle.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4CzQ3f14lW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/">Hacking lettuce for taste and profit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hacking lettuce for taste and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/embed/#?secret=4CzQ3f14lW" data-secret="4CzQ3f14lW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company grew 15x in 2020, and to keep that momentum going, MilkRun raised $6 million in Series A funding. Spark Capital led the investment and was joined by existing investors Revolution’s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, Social Impact Capital and Congruent VC. The latest infusion gives the company a total of $10 million, which includes money raised after attending Techstars and Y Combinator in 2020, Niiro said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229770" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229770" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229770 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Julia-Niiro-Headshot.png?w=680" alt="Julia Niiro, MikRun" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229770" class="wp-caption-text">MilkRun founder and CEO Julia Niiro</p></div></p>
<p>The new funding enables MilkRun to expand its delivery service to include Seattle and Austin — and a fourth unnamed market coming early next year — and to launch new products. The company recently unveiled a new bacon offering as part of the subscription service and is working with butchers to supply different styles and cuts. The company is also working with seafood suppliers in the Pacific Northwest and will use the funding to add seafood to its other markets.</p>
<p>MilkRun is working with over 300 small and mid-sized farms. Users go online and choose the products they want, like eggs, meat, produce and bread. The company offers a recurring subscription, with no minimum order or subscription fees, and free contactless delivery. Fifty percent of every dollar spent goes back to the farmers, Niiro said.</p>
<p>Since launching the service in 2019, one of the things she has enjoyed is learning alongside the farmers. The opportunity cost is high for farmers as they increase their buying power, so it has been “a relationship game” from the start as MilkRun works through the long list of farmers it wants to work with, getting them quickly integrated into the subscription service and building the infrastructure, she added.</p>
<p>“There has always been this tipping point and need for local food, but this chain has been broken for a long time,” Niiro said. “It is time to tip the scales back to sustainability based on small and mid-sized farmers. Commodity prices are rising to meet the level of food needs, so we are accelerating the awareness of the opportunity to really rebuild these systems and the direct world of commerce.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Niiro also said she was excited to bring on Spark Capital as the lead, referring to the venture capital firm as “a true backer of big visions and ideas.” She explained that the food industry is a massive system that is complex, and the company is a long game play as it makes inroads into the supply chain and works on its next phase of activating the full network of small farmers to be “the largest farmer’s market in the country.”</p>
<p>Kevin Thau, general partner at Spark Capital, said that mission is one of the reasons the firm invested in MilkRun. Spark is attracted to consumer plays, but Thau was initially a strong holdout on grocery ordering, even as more people ordered food online as a result of the global pandemic, he said.</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed “picky customer” when it comes to choosing his own fruits and vegetables, his negative experiences with food delivery companies led him to embrace the farmer’s market, often taking drives out to the country to get good basic food items.</p>
<p>Thau noted that a majority of people typically buy the same grocery staples each week, so rather than search through thousands of SKUs for products, MilkRun is working to be that online.</p>
<p>“MilkRun is following the trend of simplifying things so people can choose less, but the choice is highly curated,” he added. “Julia has a great story, vision and passion. She is also unique in they way she started a technology company. She is all about local farmers, and her vision for the future is one that we buy into. People crave that local business and farm stand as they get more in tune with sustainability and climate change.”</p>

<p>The co-founders initially thought of replacing the unsustainable part of food — factory farming — with regenerative ocean farming. When a friend offered the chance to look at a kelp farm, she went and liked it so much that AKUA was born.</p>
<p>Today, AKUA announced a $3.2 million seed round, led by Vibrant Ventures, to give the company $5.4 million in total fundraising to date. The total funds include backing from a Republic campaign, pre-seed investors and capital from the co-founders.</p>
<p>The round also included participation from a group that includes Pegasus Sustainable Finance, Halogen Ventures, Fifth Down Capital, Alumni Ventures Group, Karmagawa, New England Patriots coach and former linebacker Jerod Mayo, beauty founder Cristina Carlino, SmartyPants CEO Courtney Nichols Gould, Sir Kensington&#8217;s co-founder Brandon Child, Gellert Global Group president Andy Gellert, SOA&#8217;s Seabird Ventures and the Blue Angels.</p>
<p>In 2019, the company came out with its first product, Kelp Jerky, which comes in four flavors, and was a product Boyd Myers thought would be a good trial run to help people see ocean-farmed kelp in a new way.</p>
<p>“It was hit-or-miss, but is very healthy,” she added. “We went back to the drawing board during the pandemic on a new product and invented The Kelp Burger.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The burger is vegan, non-GMO, soy-free and gluten-free, created from ocean-farmed kelp, cremini mushrooms, pea protein, black beans, quinoa, crushed tomatoes and superfoods.</p>
<p>However, because they could not do the food tastings they were able to with the jerky, they decided to start a food club and sent samples of the burger in the mail. Ultimately 1,000 customers signed up, and The Kelp Burger is now the “hero product,” Boyd Myers said.</p>
<p>Meat alternatives are known to have some <a href="https://www.consumerfreedom.com/2021/07/5-chemicals-lurking-in-plant-based-meats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chemical preservatives</a> and other hard-to-pronounce ingredients in them, which can defeat the purpose of seeking out a healthier option. There are even startups looking into that, like Shiru, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/biotech-startup-shiru-sprouting-plant-based-ingredients-with-new-capital-infusion/">raised $17 million</a> to develop more healthier bonding agents for meat.</p>
<p>Boyd Myers noted those claims were inspiration for how AKUA approached developing the ingredient list for its kelp burger, which has <a href="https://akua.co/products/kelp-burger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 ingredients</a>, all of which are food or food-derived.</p>
<p>“The first wave of plant-based eating was the Boca Burger, beans and tofu,” she added. “The second wave is Impossible and Beyond, and the third wave is going to be the return to whole foods and clean eating. We are only as great as the giants that came before us, and if it wasn’t for them, we wouldn’t be here today doing a better plant-based burger.”</p>
<p>AKUA started selling via direct to consumers in May and currently ships to all states except Alaska and Hawaii. Boyd Myers explained that there are sales and repeat customers, but it was too early to discuss growth metrics. However, the company is dabbling in retail locations and has preorders from over 100 stores in New York, and she expects those will go out in the coming months, followed by stores in San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In addition to the jerky and burger, the AKUA portfolio also includes Kelp Pasta. The new funding will be used on R&amp;D for new products in the areas of alternative meat and plant-based seafood that also looks at what more can be done with kelp and other foods, like lentils.</p>
<p>AKUA soft-launched a kelp ground meat product and will have a kelp crab cake product coming out in the second quarter of 2022, Boyd Myers said. The company will also hire additional talent and ramp up its sales and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boyd Myers said she was excited to work with Vibrant Ventures founder Jarret Christie, to whom she was introduced by other founders. Vibrant Ventures is a new plant-based fund out of Los Angeles that launched in July.</p>
<p>As Christie got to know Boyd Myers, he saw her as a community builder who was building a movement away from factory farming, fighting climate change and helping people have access to lower-cost healthier foods.</p>
<p>“Kelp was not on anyone’s radar six months ago, but is now being considered for crop feed, packaging and crop fertilization,” he said. “She is working hand-in-hand with kelp growers; I believe this is just the beginning.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The company formerly known as Facebook has been discussing the possibility of opening retail stores way before it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">rebranded</a> itself as Meta, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/technology/facebook-stores-meta-metaverse.html?referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Apparently, discussions about opening brick-and-mortar shops started last year, though nothing has been finalized, and the project could still end up being scrapped. If Meta does open physical outlets, however, they will reportedly be more like experience stores introducing people to devices developed by its Reality Labs division rather than outright retail shops.</p>
<p>Those devices include the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Oculus Quest</a> (soon to be Meta Quest) virtual reality headsets and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-go-review-140033819.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Portal</a> gadgets, which were designed primarily for video calling. The stores could also showcase the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">augmented reality smart glasses</a> called Stories that Facebook developed with Ray-Ban. Based on the documents <em>The Times</em> saw, Meta&#8217;s goal is to spark &#8220;curiosity&#8221; and &#8220;closeness&#8221; with its stores, as well as provide customers with a welcoming atmosphere where they can have a &#8220;judgment free journey&#8221; while experimenting with headsets.</p>
<p>Those same documents show that Meta envisions shops with a modern, minimalist aesthetic and subtle branding placement. The company considered a lot of possible names, such as Facebook Hub, Facebook Commons, Facebook Innovations, Facebook Reality Store and From Facebook. It eventually settled on Facebook Store, but that will mostly likely change now that the company has been renamed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If Meta does push through with this plan, its first retail/experience store will be located in Burlingame, California, where there&#8217;s a Reality Labs office. <em>The Times </em>says the project could eventually span the world, though, with locations in various countries and regions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/gm-invests-300m-in-chinas-first-self-driving-car-unicorn-momenta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$300 million investment</a> from General Motors in September, Momenta, an autonomous driving solution provider from China, announced today an additional $500 million added to its Series C round.</p>
<p>The new injection brings the total of the startup&#8217;s Series C to over $1 billion. Momenta adapts what it calls a two-legged strategy of supplying advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to auto OEMs like GM and Tier 1 suppliers like Bosch, while conducting R&amp;D on truly unmanned vehicles, that is, Level 4 driving.</p>
<p>The startup has assembled a list of heavyweight strategic investors, including China&#8217;s state-owned SAIC Motor, GM, Toyota, Mercedes Benz, and Bosch. Singapore&#8217;s sovereign fund Temasek and Jack Ma&#8217;s Yunfeng Capital are among its institutional investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229869" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Momenta often speaks of how its alliance with car manufacturers differentiates itself from its peers, which have chosen a more cash-intensive route of developing in-house robotaxi fleets. Instead, it counts on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/momenta-profile/"> gleaning data from a network</a> of mass-produced vehicles powered by its solutions. Pony.ai and WeRide are among its closest rivals and have also raised a significant amount of capital.</p>
<p>In the case of the GM deal, Momenta&#8217;s solution, which uses a mix of consumer-grade millimeter-wave radars and high-definition cameras, will be used in GM&#8217;s vehicles sold in China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/gm-invests-300m-in-chinas-first-self-driving-car-unicorn-momenta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather than the United States</a>. The startup recently opened its first overseas office in Stuttgart to be closer to its German partners, which may imply the footprint of its technology could extend beyond its home market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tencent unveiled its progress in chips for the first time this week, which immediately gave its stock price a<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/tencent-unveils-first-chips-in-push-beyond-online-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> modest boost</a>. Silicon seems distant from the giant&#8217;s main arenas of video games and social networks, so observers suggest that Tencent&#8217;s move is to signal that it&#8217;s aligned with China&#8217;s long-run goals to self-develop semiconductors at a time its gaming unit is under a slate of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/11/china-roundup-tencent-takes-on-sites-trying-to-circumvent-its-age-limits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory assaults</a>. Other major tech powerhouses, from Alibaba, Baidu, to Huawei, have all answered Beijing&#8217;s silicon push with their in-house chips.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for a company with as much data to handle as Tencent, one should wonder why it didn&#8217;t get in on semiconductors earlier.</p>
<p>The three chips Tencent <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Pu1NUnCfZGdxZN2XFI4DRg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> on Wednesday are all custom built: one for AI inference, one for video transcoding, and another for network interface.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229831" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There have been ample examples where internet behemoths start building their own specialized hardware to buttress their existing businesses. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/facebook-has-a-new-job-posting-calling-for-chip-designers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back in 2018</a>, Facebook was already hiring AI chip designers, who could potentially help tackle misinformation and process its gargantuan amount of user data.</p>
<p>Tencent, with over one billion monthly users on its flagship WeChat messenger, surely has a lot of digital footprints to handle.</p>
<p>But WeChat&#8217;s steward Allen Zhang is famously reserved about exploiting personal data. Till now, WeChat&#8217;s user feed is still kept chronological with native ads that sporadically pop up.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we analyze [users’ chat history], we can bring great advertising revenue to the company. But we don’t do that, so WeChat cares a lot about user privacy,” Zhang <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/wechat-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> at WeChat&#8217;s annual conference last year. He wants WeChat to be a useful, disposable tool rather than an app that soaks up people&#8217;s time with addictive, algorithmic recommendations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Zhang seems to have made concessions. WeChat now includes a short video section with the barebone functions of TikTok. Like TikTok, WeChat&#8217;s video feature infers what users like and serves up content accordingly.</p>
<p>Tencent has a slew of other business lines that could benefit from greater machine learning power and are perhaps more eager to monetize: Tencent News, its news aggregator, and Tencent Video, its Netflix equivalent. Under China&#8217;s strict censorship environment, content providers may also find themselves in need of more computing power to root out text, audio and videos that violate government rules.</p>
<p>Dowson Tong, Tencent&#8217;s senior vice president, explained that the firm&#8217;s AI inference chip will be used for image and video processing, natural language processing, search, among other scenarios. The chip for video transcoding, as the name implies, will ensure smoothness and low latency as Tencent handles its massive video workload. Lastly, the smart network interface card (SmartNIC) will be used for CPU server offloads, according to Tong.</p>
<p>Tencent won&#8217;t be working on chips alone. Tong noted in his speech that the company will create an ecosystem to maintain &#8220;deep, strategic collaborations with chip domestic and overseas chip companies.&#8221; For instance, Tencent has backed Shanghai-based Enflame, which specializes in AI training chips, in four funding rounds and is already <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/443262059_120159035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">applying the startup&#8217;s tech to its business</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s get this out of the way: The $2,199 DJI Mavic 3 is excellent and I didn&#8217;t get to try all the new features yet.</p>
<p>The Mavic 3 is DJI&#8217;s latest top-of-the-line consumer drone. It&#8217;s foldable, expensive, and packs an impressive dual-lens camera and dramatically better drone-to-controller communication. The Mavic 3 is easily DJI&#8217;s best consumer drone yet. Unfortunately, a few key features were not available on pre-launch firmware, so a full review is in the works.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new.</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229041" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Dual-camera system that features a custom Hasselblad L2D-20c aerial camera. It has two lenses: a 4/3 CMOS sensor with a 24mm prime lens &amp; a 28x hybrid zoom telephoto lens.</li>
<li>First DJI drone that can transmit live 1080p/60fps video from the drone to the controller</li>
<li>Support for Apple ProRes 422 HQ and H.264/H.265 with video capabilities up to 5.1k@50fps, DCI 4k@120fps, 4k@120fps</li>
<li>Improved vision sensing system able to detect items from .5 to 200 meters thanks to new, improved sensors</li>
<li>46 minutes of flight time (5000 mAh battery)</li>
</ul>
<p>DJI sent me a Mavic 3 last week, and I&#8217;ve been flying it nonstop. However, several key features were unavailable until the drone officially launched. Before today, I was unable to test the drone&#8217;s new ActiveTrack 5.0 system and APAS 5.0 object detection &#8212; both are said to be significant upgrades over past versions. As such, I&#8217;m unable to confirm DJI&#8217;s claims, and I&#8217;m eager to try the new ActiveTrack system. Past DJI implications failed to impress.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The DJI Mavic 3 features a new camera system that includes two lenses. The primary lens is a beast: 20 MP 4/3 CMOS sensor, 24mm prime lens, 84° field of view. The second camera features a 162mm telephoto lens with a 28x hybrid zoom affair. This system gives the Mavic 3 a fantastic prime lens and offloads the dirty work of zooming to a second camera.</p>
<p>With the new camera comes new supported video formats. The Mavic 3 supports encoding in Apple ProRes 422 HQ, DCI 4k, and 5.1k. However, the Apple ProRess 422 HQ encoding is only available on the more expensive Mavic 3, the $4,999 Mavic 3 Cine edition (it also includes a 1TB SSD).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The images straight off the camera are stunning. I compared the images to those captured using the DJI Air 2S, and the differences are noticeable with deeper tones and more nuance in shadows. Details are crisp and sharp.</p>
<p>Look for a full report in the coming days. Several key video features were locked until DJI officially announced the Mavic 3. I need to test the drone using the latest firmware.</p>
<h2>Object Detention</h2>
<p>I crash a lot of drones, and it&#8217;s not for lack of caring. I push them farther (and closer) than they should go. And props are cheap, too. But I haven&#8217;t crashed the Mavic 3 yet despite my best attempts. The drone sees everything.</p>
<p>Features like object detection and crash mitigation have been standard features on drones for several generations. Still, this latest version features upgraded capabilities, including detecting objects at a greater distance and a closer range.</p>
<p>As of writing, DJI had yet to update the drone to the latest firmware that included significant updates to the Mavic 3&#8217;s capabilities. However, even using pre-release software, the Mavic 3 is impressive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Fall in Michigan, and most of the leaves are off the trees. The Mavic 3 doesn&#8217;t care. I found it&#8217;s easily able to detect even the smallest branch. The drone can either stop or attempt to bypass the object.</p>
<p>I took the drone for a walk through the woods. For the most part, it managed to walk itself, sliding side to side to avoid obstacles. I just had to direct the drone forward, and it found its own path. This was capable with past DJI drones, but it was not nearly this smooth. I never trusted the older crash mitigation systems. This one feels much improved.</p>
<p>Like the Mavic Pro 2, the Mavic 3 has sensors watching every corner of the drone. In addition, there are six fish-eye vision sensors and two wide-angle sensors. DJI calls this omnidirectional obstacle sensing, and its capabilities are a step above that found on the Air 2S, which only watches in four directions.</p>
<h2>Range</h2>
<p>Owners are going to notice two things about the Mavic 3 over past models. One, this drone has a much more robust communication connection. I didn&#8217;t lose contact with the drone flying in spots past drones would cut out. The Mavic 3 streams live video to the controller at 1080p/60 &#8212; that&#8217;s twice the frame rates as past models and it&#8217;s very noticeable.</p>
<p>DJI claims that the maximum transmission range is 15km. That&#8217;s over 9 miles, and due to FAA regulations, I&#8217;m unable to test that range. However, this drone has a serious range.</p>
<p>I took the Mavic 3 around to several familiar spots during my short time with the drone, including an abandoned urban area with low bridges over a river. I like to fly drones in this area. Past drones (DJI Air 2S and Mavic Pro 2) struggle to maintain connection when passing under the bridges. The Mavic 3 held its connection the whole time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I noticed the increase in transmission power when flying the drone in the cornfields behind my house. Often, other drones were able to skim the top of the field, but the range was dramatically cut when the drone was a few feet off the ground instead of hundreds of feet in the air. The Mavic 3 didn&#8217;t have that issue and managed to stream the live video to the controller at 1080p/60.</p>
<p>The live video preview is lovely. The drone now transmits in full 1080p HD at 60 fps when close enough. The increase in frame rates is delightful. In addition, the smoother video preview makes flying the drone more enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Build quality</h2>
<ul>
<li>The construction and build quality is better than that found on the DJI Air 2. It feels solid and doesn&#8217;t look like a toy.</li>
<li>The Mavic 3&#8217;s prop arms are significantly thinner than those found on the smaller Air 2S.</li>
<li>The props are 4.5 inches. The props on the Air 2S are 3.5 inches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Battery</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Mavic 3 uses a new battery design from previous models. It&#8217;s a four cell unit that weighs 335.5g. It slides into the drone&#8217;s body.</li>
<li>Charges over DJI&#8217;s preparatory connector. The charging dock uses USB-C.</li>
<li>Claimed battery life is 46 minutes. I saw, on average, around 30 minutes in windy conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unavailable for testing at time of publication</h2>
<ul>
<li>120 fps video modes.</li>
<li>APAS 5.0 &#8212; The pre-launch firmware did not have the latest object detection and crash mitigation features. As such, the drone still featured past versions of this ability and was able to identify and avoid objects as small as a tiny tree branch.</li>
<li>ActiveTrack 5.0 &#8212; This feature will be available at a later, unannounced time. Supposedly, this system allows the Mavic 3 to track and follow an object no matter its direction of travel. Past versions of this feature were disappointing and limited mainly to tracking objects moving towards or away from the drone &#8212; not side to side or diagonally. I&#8217;m eager to try this new feature.</li>
<li>4G Network-Powered Transmission &#8212; This attachment will supposedly improve the video transmission by utilizing 4G network communication. This will be released at a later time and unavailable for testing at the time of writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>A full review is coming. Look for it next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://scifounders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciFounders</a>, an accelerator program and fund launched back in January with $6 million in backing, has a new proposition for the scientist founders who it looks to help run their own companies. It plans to give some of the teams it funds the voting rights that would normally come with its investment.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? Well, it&#8217;s a sign of the times in many ways. While venture capitalists have long been known for the many <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/11621208/four-ridiculous-demands-that-venture-capital-investors-make" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demands</a> they make on founders, entrepreneurs have been sitting comfortably in the driver&#8217;s seat in recent years, with VCs doing whatever they can to stay top of mind, from opening new offices and creating their own editorial arms, to offering term sheets in record time and waiving fresh checks at founders almost immediately after they close a funding round.</p>
<p>But SciFounders co-founder Matt Krisiloff argues that there&#8217;s much more to the thinking of SciFounders, which sprang up this year to cater to the growing number of PhDs for whom there are not enough spots in academia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229667" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Krisiloff, who is himself a founder &#8212; he also runs a biotech company called Conception that&#8217;s trying to turn stem cells into human eggs &#8212; says he&#8217;s tired of watching biotech founders in particular lose control of their companies.</p>
<p>It happens &#8220;a lot of the time just because these startups are far more capital intensive,&#8221; Krisiloff notes. &#8220;You can start a software company with a couple thousand dollars in pre-seed funding, but a life science company probably needs a couple million dollars [to get started], so things can flip pretty quickly&#8221; against founders who can see their ownership and power diluted quickly.</p>
<p>What his outfit wants is to provide those scientists with more leverage, and if it has to come from SciFounders, that&#8217;s apparently fine. Says Krisiloff, &#8220;We think it would be great longer term for scientists to say, &#8216;We&#8217;re first-class citizens in charge of everything,&#8217; as is often the case in the software world, where you have the Collison brothers in charge of Stripe, or the Airbnb founders in charge of their company. We want to make sure that happens more widely for scientist founders, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>SciFounders &#8212; which has so far provided $400,000 and mentorship to seven companies in exchange for a 10% stake &#8212; knows there is only so much impact that an outfit of its size can make.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Krisiloff also sounds unsurprised when we push back on the idea that limited partners will broadly go along with VCs who give away one of the few tools left at their disposal right now: their voting rights, which give them at least some say over corporate matters.</p>
<p>But he suggests that movements have to start somewhere. Besides, SciFounders thinks it has already hit a nerve, simply by providing more guidance to academics than they&#8217;ve historically received. Krisiloff says while SciFounders is working with just seven teams right now &#8212; outfits that it expects to actively help for up to a year because their &#8220;iteration cycles can take a super long time&#8221; &#8212; it has meanwhile received more than 1,000 other applicants, many of whom reached out to the team after a simple Twitter announcement about the outfit&#8217;s launch.</p>
<p>In addition to Krisiloff, who earlier ran a portfolio of research projects affiliated with Y Combinator, SciFounders was co-founded by Alexander Schubert, a molecular biologist who was most recently a postdoctoral research fellow with Genentech, and Lucas Harrington, a co-founder and the chief scientific officer of Mammoth Biosciences.</p>
<p>Among Harrington&#8217;s three other co-founders, of course, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is the CRISPR-Cas genome editing co-inventor Jennifer Doudna, who last year jointly won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with longtime collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier.</span></p>
