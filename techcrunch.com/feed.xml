										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pragma.gg">Pragma</a> is building what it calls a &#8220;backend as a service,&#8221; providing ready-made infrastructure to developers of online, live service games. And it&#8217;s announcing today that it has raised $12 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by David Thacker at Greylock, with participation from Zynga founder Mark Pincus, Oculus founder Nate Mitchell and Cloudera founder Amr Awadallah, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/pragma-is-a-backend-toolkit-for-gaming-companies-so-game-developers-can-focus-on-games/">previous investors</a> Upfront Ventures and Advancit Capital. Amy Chang, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/cisco-acquires-accompany/">sold her business intelligence startup Accompany</a> to Cisco, is joining Pragma&#8217;s board of directors.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Eden Chen told me that where Unity and Unreal have built popular frontend game engines, he and his co-founder Chris Cobb (former engineering lead at Riot Games) are hoping Pragma will fill the void for a &#8220;de facto backend game engine.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while &#8220;many companies tried to do this&#8221; over the past decade, Chen suggested that this is the right time to launch the platform, thanks to the continued rise of live service games (like League of Legends) that have to be treated as &#8220;living, breathing products,&#8221; as well as improved tooling around infrastructure platforms like Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140903" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140903" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140903" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?w=680" alt="Pragma screenshot" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Pragma_Media.pptx.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140903" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pragma</p></div></p>
<p>Pragma is launching a <a href="https://pragma.gg/starter-kit">starter kit</a> today designed to allow developers to quickly set up and test game loops. Meanwhile, the broader platform is currently in private beta testing with studios including One More Game (started by started by Pat Wyatt, one of Blizzard’s first employees) and Mitchell&#8217;s Mountain Top Studios.</p>
<p>Chen said the platform&#8217;s features fall into three broad categories — player accounts/social, game loops (including lobbies and matchmaking) and player/game data. Pragma isn&#8217;t building all of this from scratch; in some cases, it&#8217;s &#8220;acting as the integrator&#8221; for other platforms like Discord. Chen also noted that while the team plans to build a fully managed solution in the future, the current version is on-premise: &#8220;We’re building an instance of Pragma on the studio’s own infrastructure, [so they can] so they can take our code base and customize it to their own preferences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pragma is initially targeting game studios with about 10 to 50 team members. Eventually, Chen hopes the platform could serve larger studios while also supporting &#8220;the democratization of these tools, so that a one- to five-person team can really leverage [them] to launch a networked, online game.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;The vision for us long term is that we really want to be innovating on the social side, creating social features that improve the game and build stronger connections.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Scale AI announced a massive $325 million Series E. Led by Dragoneer, Greenoaks Capital and Tiger Global, the raise gives the San Francisco data labeling startup a $7 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Alexandr Wang founded the company back in 2016, while still at MIT. A veteran of Quora and Addepar, Wang built the startup to curate information for AI applications. The company is now a break-even business, with a wide range of top-notch clients, including General Motors, NVIDIA, Nuro and Zoox.</p>
<p>Backed by a ton of venture capital, the company plans a large-scale increase in its headcount, as it builds out new products and expands into additional markets. “One thing that we saw, especially in the course of the past year, was that AI is going to be used for so many different things,” Wang told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/the-station-a-chat-with-scale-ais-alexandr-wang-the-nyc-scooter-winners-and-tusimple-goes-public/">TechCrunch in a recent interview</a>. “It’s like we’re just sort of really at the beginning of this and we want to be prepared for that as it happens.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The executive will join us on stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=alexandr&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=alexandr&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> on June 9 to discuss how the company has made a major impact on the industry in its short four years of existence, the role AI is playing in the world of transportation and what the future looks like for Scale AI.</p>
<p>In addition to Wang,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=groupsales&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=groupsales&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> will feature an incredible lineup of speakers, presentations, fireside chats and breakouts all focused on the current and future state of mobility — like EVs, micromobility and smart cities for starters — and the investment trends that influence them all.</p>
<p>Investors like <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> (Urban Innovation Fund), <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> (Autotech Ventures) and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> (Construct Capital) — all of whom will grace our virtual stage. They’ll have plenty of insight and advice to share, including the challenges that startup founders will face as they break into the transportation arena.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from CEOs like Starship Technologies’ <strong>Ahti Heinla</strong>. The company’s been busy testing delivery robots in real-world markets. Don’t miss his discussion touching on challenges ranging from technology to red tape and what it might take to make last-mile robotic delivery a mainstream reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.co.uk/shopping-and-entertainment/introducing-amazon-salon">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s opening Amazon Salon, the retailer&#8217;s first hair salon and a place where Amazon aims to test new technologies with the general public. The salon will occupy over 1,500 sq. ft on Brushfield Street in London’s Spitalfields, where Amazon says it will initially be trialing the use of augmented reality (AR) and &#8220;point-and-learn&#8221; technology &#8212; the latter being a system that allow customers to point to products on a display shelf in order to learn more through videos and other content that then appears on a display screen.</p>
<p>To then order the products, the customers will scan the QR code on the shelf, which takes them to the Amazon.co.uk shopping page for the item where they can add it to their cart and check out.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140874" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140874" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140874" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-1.jpeg 1624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-1.jpeg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-1.jpeg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-1.jpeg?resize=768,596 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-1.jpeg?resize=680,528 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-1.jpeg?resize=1536,1192 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-1.jpeg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140874" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The salon&#8217;s AR technology, meanwhile, will be used to allow customers to experiment by virtually trying on different hair colors before making a commitment to a new shade.</p>
<p>Amazon has already entered the convenience store market, grocery business and other physical retail, where it&#8217;s innovating with new technologies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/">cashierless checkout</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/amazon-to-test-dash-cart-a-smart-grocery-shopping-cart-that-sees-what-you-buy/">smart grocery carts</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/amazon-expands-its-biometric-based-amazon-one-palm-reader-system-to-more-retail-stores/">biometric systems</a>. But it&#8217;s not clear that Amazon actually has ambitions to be in the salon business itself. Instead, it seems the salon will largely serve as a testing ground for new technologies that Amazon will likely want to sell to other retail clients in the future, or perhaps implement in its own stores. And in the case of AR, Amazon may want to gather data on customers&#8217; experiences it can use on its own shopping site, too.</p>
<p>Hinting that its goals are not about the salon business itself, Amazon today describes the salon as an &#8220;experiential venue where we showcase new products and technology,&#8221; and notes that it has no other plans to open more salons at this time.</p>
<p>The company has also recruited an existing salon owner, Elena Lavagni of Neville Hair &amp; Beauty Salon, to help with this project, instead of hiring a new staff to run it long-term. Lavagni and her team have previously provided hairdressing services for other events, like Paris Fashion Week and the Cannes Film Festival.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140873" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140873" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140873" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="528" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg 1624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=768,596 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=680,528 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=1536,1192 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/download-2.jpeg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140873" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Amazon has not detailed what sort of data it will collect from customers who use the salon, but it&#8217;s clearly there to learn about how new retail technologies would work in a real-world environment. But the fact that Amazon is capturing customer images for its hair color virtual try-on should raise questions about what it plans to do with the data it collects from the new salon. Will it only be used to learn about the specific technology being tested, or will it be put to other uses, too?</p>
<p>As many recall, Amazon has a complicated history with its use of technologies like facial recognition and biometrics, having <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">sold biometric facial recognition services</a> to law enforcement in the U.S., while its facial recognition technology <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">was the subject of a data privacy lawsuit</a>. And its Ring camera <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-2000-police-fire-departments-213301374.html">company continues</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/over-30-civil-rights-groups-demand-an-end-to-amazon-rings-police-partnerships/">work in partnership with police.</a> Customers should be told if they&#8217;re participating in an Amazon research project, not just having fun with new tech products.</p>
<p>Like other Amazon physical stores, the salon will first be open to Amazon employees only before offering bookings to the wider public in the weeks to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://capeprivacy.com/">Cape Privacy</a>, the early stage startup that wants to make it easier for companies to share sensitive data in a secure and encrypted way, announced a $20 million Series A today.</p>
<p>Evolution Equity Partners led the round with participation from new investors Tiger Global Management, Ridgeline Partners and Downing Lane. Existing investors Boldstart Ventures, Version One Ventures, Haystack, Radical Ventures and a slew of individual investors also participated. The company has now raised approximately $25 million including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/cape-privacy-launches-data-science-collaboration-platform-with-5-06m-seed-investment/">$5 million seed investment</a> we covered last June..</p>
<p>Cape Privacy CEO Ché Wijesinghe says that the product has evolved quite a bit since we last spoke. &#8220;We have really focused our efforts on encrypted learning, which is really the core technology, which was fundamental to allowing the multi-party compute capabilities between two organizations or two departments to work and build machine learning models on encrypted data,&#8221; Wijesinghe told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wijesinghe says that a key business case involves a retail company owned by a private equity firm sharing data with a large financial services company, which is using the data to feed its machine learning models. In this case, sharing customer data, it&#8217;s essential to do it in a secure way and that is what Cape Privacy claims is its primary value prop.</p>
<p>He said that while the data sharing piece is the main focus of the company, it has data governance and compliance components to be sure that entities sharing data are doing so in a way that complies with internal and external rules and regulations related to the type of data.</p>
<p>While the company is concentrating on financial services for now because Wijesinghe has been working with these companies for years, he sees uses cases far beyond a single vertical including pharmaceuticals, government, healthcare telco and manufacturing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every single industry needs this and so we look at the value of what Cape&#8217;s encrypted learning can provide as really being something that can be as transformative and be as impactful as what SSL was for the adoption of the web browser,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Richard Seewald, founding and managing partner at lead investor Evolution Equity Partners likes that ability to expand the product&#8217;s markets. &#8220;The application in Financial Services is only the beginning. Cape has big plans in life sciences and government where machine learning will help make incredible advances in clinical trials and counter-terrorism for example. We anticipate wide adoption of Cape’s technology across many use cases and industries,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company has recently expanded to 20 people and Wijesinghe, who is half Asian, takes DEI seriously. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been very, very deliberate about our DEI efforts, and I think one of the things that we pride ourselves in is that we do foster a culture of acceptance, that it&#8217;s not just about diversity in terms of color, race, gender, but we just hired our first non binary employee,&#8221; he said,</p>
<p>Part of making people feel comfortable and included involves training so that fellow employees have a deeper understanding of the cultural differences. The company certainly has diversity across geographies with employees in 10 different time zones.</p>
<p>The company is obviously remote with a spread like that, but once the pandemic is over, Wijesinghe sees bringing people together on occasion with New York City as the hub for the company where people from all over the world can fly in and get together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many large enterprises now rely on hundreds of third-party SaaS applications to do business, but their security organizations can barely keep pace. Right now, the state of the art for SaaS enterprise security are cloud access security brokers (CASBs) that act as intermediaries between users and the actual service. But they don&#8217;t provide the kind of visibility that enterprises want since employees will often route around their IT departments. Tel Aviv-based Grip Security aims to make this a lot easier by providing enterprises with full visibility into their SaaS portfolios through enforceable endpoint-centric access controls and new data governance capabilities that work across devices and locations.</p>
<p>Grip Security today announced that it has raised a $6 million seed round led by cybersecurity-focused YL Ventures, with participation from CrowdStrike CEO and co-founder George Kurtz and a group of other angel investors with deep roots in the cybersecurity industry. These include the likes of former Akamai CSO Andy Ellis, former Zscaler CISO Michael Sutton, former Bank of America Chief Security Scientist Sounil Yu and Amazon Whole Foods CISO Sameer Sait.</p>

<p>&#8220;The founding team at Grip Security brings deep technical acumen to disrupt the SaaS security market,&#8221; said Ofer Schreiber, partner at YL Ventures. &#8220;Grip will not only upend antiquated SaaS security solutions, but they’ll also help enterprises implement much needed automated and granular security for SaaS, the fastest growing segment in information technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before starting Grip Security, co-founder and CEO Lior Yaari actually spent some time as the CTO of YL Ventures (though he says he still had to go through the firm&#8217;s standard vetting procedure to get funding). In that role, he talked to a lot of CISOs, and, again and again, they talked to him about the problems with current SaaS security solutions. Like his co-founders, Idan Fast (CTO) and Alon Shenkler (VP R&amp;D), Yaari also has a deep cybersecurity background. But it was during his time YL Ventures that the idea for Grip Security was born.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within YL Ventures, we were always looking for the next interesting sub-market and we knew from our conversation with CISOs  [&#8230;] that people know SaaS is a problem and they did not like the existing solutions &#8212; many of them being CASBs,&#8221; Yaari told me. &#8220;From this view of an investment team that not only talks with customers but also sees some technical teams that try to solve this problem and then go back and look for other solutions because they didn&#8217;t find a good fit within the market, I eventually wanted to do it myself. Last July, I actually told [YL Ventures partner Ofer Schreiber] that if no one solved this until October, I will. That was a joke back then &#8212; and then, three or four months later, it became reality. It&#8217;s hard to look at hard and interesting problems without trying to solve them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the popular CASBs today were founded around 2013 and 2014 and then later acquired by other major players like Microsoft, Cisco and Proofpoint. But Yaari argues that the problems with protecting SaaS today is fundamentally different from those 10 years ago. These solutions, he argues, worked for protecting a dozen applications or so.</p>
<p>The promise of Grip Security is that after a quick installation, enterprises get full visibility into which applications their employees actually use. Yaari wasn&#8217;t quite ready to give away the secret sauce of how Grip does this, though. But he noted that this is a non-intrusive solution. &#8220;We do not install anything on user devices or corporate networks, but we follow the footprints left by SaaS applications and use this data to identify with extreme accuracy what applications were used.&#8221; He noted that Grip Security&#8217;s solution travels with the users, no matter which device they use.</p>
<p>Grip Security currently has about 15 employees and plans to use the new funding to build out its platform with additional capabilities, especially around providing access governance and data governance to applications. The plan is to grow to 20 to 25 employees within the next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After five years of providing non-dilutive financing for founders, Clearbanc is tired of being only a bank. So, it’s rebranding, and has just raised $100 million Series C at a $2 billion valuation off of its broader ambitions. The new valuation is five times larger than it was when Clearbanc closed a Series B <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/31/clearbanc-300m/">in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Clearbanc has renamed itself Clearco, a move that is more in line with the company’s long-term vision of providing data-driven solutions for founders, say co-founders Michele Romanow and Andrew D’Souza.</p>
<p>“We’re moving from just being a capital provider and [having] sort of a transactional relationship with our customers to really using data, our network, guidance, [and] capital to be a long-term partner,” D’Souza said. In other words, Clearco wants founders to think of the company as more than a check-writing machine.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Today’s news a step away from what Clearco framed itself around just two years ago: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/clearbanc-plans-to-disrupt-venture-capital-with-the-20-min-term-sheet/">the 20-minute term-sheet.</a> The product, perhaps its most well-known in tech, allowed e-commerce companies to raise non-dilutive marketing growth capital between $10,000 to $10 million based on its revenue and ad spend. The founders then flexed rapid capital deployment based on data &#8211; and to date, Clearco has put over $2 billion in over 4,600 companies.</p>
<p>“We can provide you the capital, really efficiently but then we can also help you figure out what to do with that capital to grow your business, and increase the value, and that was a big part of the motivation around the rebrand,” D’Souza said.</p>
<p>Clearco has been on a tear of new product launches in the past year. In April 2020, Clearco launched ClearRunway to help SaaS founders secure non-dilutive capital repaid through revenue-share agreements. A few months later, in July, <a href="https://blog.clearbanc.com/clearbanc-valuation/">it launched a way</a> for founders to figure out how to value their companies based on benchmarking data and internal metrics. In October, Clearco launched a tool that would purchase a company’s inventory upfront directly from suppliers, and is then paid back <a href="https://blog.clearbanc.com/upfront-inventory-financing/">as products sell. </a>And in February, the company announced that it had created <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/how-capital-as-a-service-can-help-you-get-your-first-check-in-2021/">Clearangel</a>, a product similar to its 20-minute term sheet, but focused on founders who bring in less revenue.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1862306" style="width: 723px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1862306" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1862306" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RAW_Clearbanc_150519099W.jpg" alt="RAW Clearbanc 150519099W" width="713" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RAW_Clearbanc_150519099W.jpg 2220w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RAW_Clearbanc_150519099W.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RAW_Clearbanc_150519099W.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RAW_Clearbanc_150519099W.jpg?resize=768,517 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RAW_Clearbanc_150519099W.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RAW_Clearbanc_150519099W.jpg?resize=1536,1034 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RAW_Clearbanc_150519099W.jpg?resize=2048,1378 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RAW_Clearbanc_150519099W.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1862306" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clearco</p></div></p>
<p>The growth hasn’t come without challenges. In April 2020, the same month it launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/as-vcs-pull-back-clearbanc-launches-a-way-for-startups-to-get-runway/">ClearRunway</a>, Clearco laid off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/13/clearbanc-cuts-number-of-staff-to-navigate-long-term-economic-impact-of-covid-19/">8% of its workforce</a>, or 17 people. The company said it would be writing more conservative checks, more frequently. At that time, it gave $1 billion to 2,200 companies. By now, it has sent $2 billion to  4,500 companies, a mix between startups and online businesses.</p>

<p>The company, still unprofitable, declined to close ARR, but instead pointed to another proxy: With all of its capital products, Clearco makes 6% in fees when it is repaid. Last year, Clearco spent $1 billion on its companies. This means that Clearco brought in around $60 million in sales last year.</p>
<p>“We were very naive when we started the business around the complexity around how fast you could lose a lot of money if you don’t get things right,” he said. Romanow added that in the beginning, Clearco had “very, very high loss rates” and it has gotten better with more data over time. The company is doubling down on different channels to get and shape and convey that data thus feels like a logical next step.</p>
<p>Since inception in 2015, Clearco’s biggest challenge was scaling the capital market side of its business and making sure it consistently had funds available. With the new product suite, Clearco’s new biggest challenge will be providing valuable services, consistently, to companies and balancing that mentorship with these checks.</p>
<p>Many of Clearco’s newest products are still in their infancy, but the potential success of the startup could nearly be tied to the general growth of startups looking for alternatives to venture capital when financing their startups. Similar to how AngelList’s growth is neatly tied to the growth of emerging fund managers, Clearco’s growth is cleanly related to the growth of founders who see financing as beyond a seed check from Y Combinator.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe anyone becomes a founder because they&#8217;re like, &#8216;I can&#8217;t wait to fundraise right now and can&#8217;t wait to like figure out which software to use&#8217;,&#8221; Romanow said. &#8220;They just want to build products and market incredible products [and] we&#8217;re just trying to make it easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its latest round was led by Oak HC/FT, which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/oak-hc-ft-1-4-billion/"> closed a $1.2 billion fund in February</a>. In other words, a traditional venture capital firm backed a company that is betting that the future of raising financing for a startup is beyond venture capital. And, while meta, it’s a signal worth pointing out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community banks and credit unions aim to be the heart of the, well, communities, they serve. But without the big budgets of larger institutions, keeping up technology-wise can be a challenge. And not only are they competing with legacy players, there is also a slew of digital banks that have emerged in recent years, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="http://www.mantl.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MANTL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that has developed technology to make it easier for people to open accounts digitally at community banks and credit unions so that those institutions can increase deposits and ultimately, profits. Founded in 2016, New York-based Mantl has been described by some as “the Shopify of account opening.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community banks and credit unions make up a big percentage of all banking institutions, which means Mantl&#8217;s market opportunity is pretty darn large. The fintech’s revenue increased by &#8220;2.1x&#8221; in 2020 as financial institutions clamored to meet increased demand for digital offerings from consumers in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the company is announcing it has raised $40 million in a Series B round of funding led by Alphabet’s independent growth fund, CapitalG, to help it grow even more. The financing brings Mantl’s total funding raised since inception to $60.7 million and included participation from D1 Capital Partners, BoxGroup and existing backers Point72 Ventures, Clocktower Technology Ventures and OldSlip Group. The company <a href="https://tearsheet.co/modern-banking-experience/with-deposit-volume-growing-705-in-april-mantl-raises-19-million/">raised $19 million</a> last July after growing deposit volume by 705% in April of that year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup declined to reveal hard revenue figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mantl originally set out to build its own challenger bank, but in doing so realized there are 10,000 banks and credit unions in the U.S., and that 96% of them outsourced their technology to third-party legacy vendors such as Fiserv and Jack Henry, many of which have technology that is in some cases “decades old,” according to Nathaniel Harley, co-founder and CEO at Mantl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such outdated technology has kept many financial institutions such as community banks and credit unions from competing online, and also limits the digital banking options available to consumers, the company said.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="27riQxaDoC"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uxtra-crunch-banks-customer-support/">(How to fix) 5 common UX mistakes in online banking</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;(How to fix) 5 common UX mistakes in online banking&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uxtra-crunch-banks-customer-support/embed/#?secret=27riQxaDoC" data-secret="27riQxaDoC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the company pivoted, based on the premise that most community banks and credit unions are critical to maintaining competition and equity in the United States’ financial system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At a high level, Mantl is an enterprise software company that is really focused on helping traditional financial institutions modernize and grow,” Harley told TechCrunch. “Our mission at the end of the day is to really expand the access to financial services by taking on the legacy infrastructure, which has really hindered access to digital banking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that its white-labeled account opening software allows banks and customers “to open an account from anywhere at any time, on any device in less than three minutes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rough its flagship account opening software, Mantl claims to have helped community institutions — many of which are competing online for the first time — establish efficient </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">profitable digital operations. Among the community banks it works with are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross River Bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quontic</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midwest BankCentre</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Banks are naturally very risk averse, and we need to build trust in order to fully take on that full infrastructure that they&#8217;re working in,” Harley said. “Account opening is low risk, but it&#8217;s also extremely high value considering that less than 50% of banks actually have online account opening today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mantl integrates directly into the legacy infrastructure, also known as a core banking system, in order to enhance that system and help institutions launch digital products quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its software also automates application decisioning for over 90% of cases while also reducing fraud by more than 60%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This results in deposit growth that’s &#8220;typically 4x faster than other solutions on the market and up to 10x more cost-effective than building a new branch,” the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined, the institutions it works with have onboarded hundreds of thousands of new customers and raised billions of dollars in core deposits, the company claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re challenging the legacy infrastructure that is holding community institutions back,” Harley said,&#8221; and we see account opening as just the beginning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to do some hiring and expand its product offerings, including software that it says would be able to improve and digitize the onboarding experience for not just financial institutions but businesses of all sizes, from sole proprietors to complex commercial enterprises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CapitalG partner Jesse Wedler shares Mantl’s belief that banks form the backbone of this nation’s economy, both on a local and national level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While digitization has long been a priority for banks, it has become an urgent imperative as branches close and digital disruptors grow,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As CapitalG reviewed the landscape of companies helping banks with digital transformation, Mantl stood out, Wedler said, due to its “user experience, resulting deposit growth and time-to-value for banks of all sizes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what has his firm most excited, he added, is the team’s vision for “transforming adjacent core banking applications.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its founding in 2013, CapitalG has invested in a number of fintechs, including MX, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripe, Robinhood, Credit Karma, Albert, Aye Finance and LendingClub. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> was one of the first of what is now a growing number of infrastructure-as-code startups and today, at its developer conference, the company is launching version 3.0 of its cloud engineering platform. With 70 new features and about 1,000 improvements since version 2.0, this is Pulumi&#8217;s biggest release yet.</p>
<p>The new release includes features that range from support for Google Cloud as an infrastructure provider (now in preview) to a new Automation API that turns Pulumi into a library that can then be called from other applications. It basically allows developers to write tools that, for example, can then provision and configure their own infrastructure for each customer of a SaaS application, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140705" style="width: 717px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-150048.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140705" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2140705" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-150048.png" alt="" width="707" height="405" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-150048.png 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-150048.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-150048.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-150048.png?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-19-150048.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2140705" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pulumi</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also launching Pulumi Packages and Components for creating opinionated infrastructure building blocks that developers can then call up from their preferred languages.</p>
<p>Also new is support for Pulumi&#8217;s CI/CD Assistant across all the company&#8217;s paid plans. This feature makes it easier to deploy cloud infrastructure and applications through more than a dozen popular CI/CD platforms, including the likes of AWS Code Service, Azure DevOps, CircleCI, GitLab CI, Google Cloud Build, Jenkins, Travis CI and Spinnaker. Until now, you needed to be on a Team Pro or Enterprise plan to use this, but it&#8217;s now available to all paying users.</p>
<p>In addition, the company is expanding some of its enterprise features with, for example, SAML SSO, SCIm synchronization and new role types.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started out on Pulumi, we knew we wanted to enable developers and infrastructure teams to<br />
collaborate more closely to build more innovative software,&#8221; said Joe Duffy, Pulumi co-founder and<br />
CEO. &#8220;What we didn&#8217;t know yet is that we&#8217;d end up calling this ‘Cloud Engineering,’ that our customers<br />
would call it that too, and that they would go on this journey with us. We are now centering our entire<br />
platform around this core idea which is now accelerating as the modern cloud continues to disrupt<br />
entire business models. Pulumi 3.0 is an exciting milestone in realizing this vision of the future —<br />
democratizing access to the cloud and helping teams build better software together — with much more<br />
to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Founded almost a decade ago, <a href="https://octopus.com/">Octopus Deploy</a> has grown to serve 25,000 organizations, including Microsoft, NASA, Xero, Disney and Stack Overflow, through bootstrapping. Today the company announced its first outside investment. Insight Partners has taken a minority stake in Octopus Deploy for $172.5 million and will help the automated enterprise software deployment company embark on its next stage of growth.</p>
<p>Octopus Deploy was launched after founder and chief executive officer Paul Stovell observed that many software teams were able to set up continuous integration (CI) servers, but struggled to achieve full continuous deployment (CD). Stovell and his wife Sonia Stovell, Octopus Deploy’s chief financial officer, began working on the company as a “nights-and-weekend” project in 2011. By the next year, it had reached profitability. Now Octopus Deploy employs more than 100 people in Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Insight Partners works with software companies to scale up their operations. Other portfolio companies in its ScaleUp Network include Pluralsight, Shopify, Twitter, Calm and Qualtrics. Octopus Deploy plans to use its investment to increase its enterprise market share, especially in the United States.</p>

<p>Stovell told TechCrunch in an email that Octopus Deploy has “declined venture approaches and have been turning away VC firms for years. However, the growth path we’ve been on meant that at some point, it might make sense to bring on an investor.”</p>
<p>“Our largest customer segment was the enterprise, and after consideration, we decided it was the right step to bring on board an investor that understood enterprise go-to-market, scaling up a company, and a partner that understood what the next 5-10 years of growth will look like for Octopus,” he added.</p>
<p>In a press statement, Insight Partners managing director Michael Triplett said, “We routinely talk to our portfolio companies about the products they use or that their customers are using and Octopus Deploy came up over and over. The company has flown under the radar, but when you talk to their customers, they are huge fans. It is clear to us that Octopus is the leader in enterprise deployment automation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. House of Representatives passed a landmark bill aimed at easing restrictions placed on the cannabis industry. The SAFE ACT (Secure and Fair Enforcement) banking act provides safe harbor for financial institutions to work with cannabis operators. If passed by the Senate and approved by President Biden, this bill would allow the cannabis industry to access traditional banking services, which has so far been forced to do much of their business with cash.</p>
<p>This is the fourth time the SAFE ACT passed the House of Representatives. A previous version of the bill passed the House in 2019, but later died in a Senate committee and never reached then-President Trump&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>Under the current bill, the SAFE ACT would protect banks and credit unions from federal prosecution when operating with cannabis companies compliant with their state&#8217;s laws. This would open up traditional lines of capital from financial institutions, which have been unavailable since cannabis is still considered illegal on a federal level. The SAFE ACT would allow these banks to work with operators in states where cannabis is legal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cannabis is currently legal for medical purposes in thirty-six states, four territories, and the District of Columbia. Recreational use is legal for adults in eighteen states, two territories, and D.C.</p>
<p>The bill passed the House with broad bipartisan support and was approved by 321-101. Before the bill&#8217;s passing, a letter showing support of the legislation was sent to House leadership from 20 state governors and one U.S. Territory and bankers from each state and a coalition of state treasurers.</p>
<p>With support from both parties, advocates and industry experts feel more confident that this bill will pass the Senate and reach President Biden&#8217;s desk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup that enables businesses to set up and manage their billing, subscription, revenue operations and compliance has become the newest firm to earn the much coveted unicorn status.</p>
<p>Chennai and San Francisco-headquartered <a href="https://www.chargebee.com/">Chargebee</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $125 million in its Series G financing round led by Sapphire Ventures and existing investors Tiger Global and Insight Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The new financing round valued the 10-year-old startup at $1.4 billion, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/chargebee-raises-55-million-to-help-businesses-move-to-subscriptions/">3x increase since the Series F round six months ago</a>. Some other existing investors also participated in the new round, said Chargebee, which has raised $230 million to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you’re a business, setting up and managing a subscription service &#8212; to ensure recurring revenue &#8212; could prove to be a complex process. You may want to offer a free 30-day trial to new potential customers. What if some customers want to move to a different pricing tier? These are some of the problems Chargebee is equipped to handle.</p>
<p>Chargebee helps individuals, small and medium-sized businesses and enterprises set up, manage, and automate subscriptions, billing, invoicing, and payments.</p>
<p>One of the key strengths of Chargebee is that it can help even large enterprises move to a subscription model within 10 days.</p>
<p>The industry is going through a “significant change” with businesses digitally transforming themselves and moving to the SaaS model, Krish Subramanian, co-founder and chief executive of Chargebee, told TechCrunch in an interview. And it’s this change that has made Chargebee so vital to thousands of companies today.</p>
<p>Chargebee was founded in an apartment in Chennai, a city on India’s southeastern coast. Subramanian has credited reading blog posts by Joel Spolsky, founder of Trello, as an early inspiration to start his own venture.</p>
<p>“He was solving a very boring problem but in very interesting ways, and he used to share the story of how he is building a company,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AdVoF9XjhU">said in an earlier interview</a>. “That was my inspiration that I should start my company like that. So while working at other companies we saved enough and acquired skills to start this.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tiger Global goes super aggressive in India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/tiger-global-goes-super-aggressive-in-india/embed/#?secret=kTdTf3Etnw" data-secret="kTdTf3Etnw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup’s offerings today are not limited to just billing. It also helps businesses plug revenue leakage, increase customer loyalty, expand into new categories with the backend ready, and experiment with pricing plans &#8212; introducing and removing them within 30 minutes.</p>
<p>It supports over 100 currencies, and dozens of popular payment gateways, including Stripe, Braintree, WorldPay and PayPal, and its global tax management coverage also helps businesses to expand to new markets. MakeSpace, an on-demand storage company, used Chargebee’s services to scale from four markets to 31 in one year, for instance.</p>
<p>The startup has amassed over 3,000 customers, most of whom are based in the U.S. and Europe. Some of these customers include brands such as cloud software Okta, business software firm Freshworks, calendar invites manager Calendly, training platform Linux Academy, and Japanese tech giant Fujitsu.</p>
<p>Subramanian said Chargebee’s revenue has doubled in the past 12 months and customer’s revenue has grown by 125%, though he didn’t disclose figures.</p>
<p>He said that like other businesses, Chargebee has been cautiously navigating the global pandemic. The fundraise six months ago ensured that the startup had enough capital in the bank to operate comfortably, he said.</p>
<p>But the recent growth Chargebee has seen prompted the startup to grow more aggressive. “There’s a window of opportunity for the next five years for us to build out this category beautifully and serve a lot of customers,” he said. “And that’s what led the startup to explore the new financing round, he said, adding that the fact that the cost of capital is lower currently in the market also played a role.</p>
<p>“As the global shift to subscription-first models continue to grow in popularity, Chargebee has an incredibly bold vision for new products for multiple market segments,” said Rajeev Dham, Partner at Sapphire Ventures, in a statement. “After years of knowing them, I’ve been most impressed by their thoughtfulness and execution in building Chargebee as the emerging category leader that is reinventing the broader space.”</p>
<p>Chargebee will deploy the fresh capital to expand its suite of products and work on new capabilities to help enterprises in even more ways.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement comes at a time when a slice of Indian startups are raising large amounts of capital at a much more frequent pace and at increased valuations as investors double down on promising bets in the world’s second-largest internet market. Chargebee is the seventh Indian startup to turn a unicorn this month, and 11th this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FoodTech industry is effectively now going into fast food. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sweetgreen">Sweetgreen</a> in the US is a &#8216;fast-casual&#8217; restaurant chain that serves healthy “bowl food”. It’s raised $478.6M. A similar firm is Sweetfin. Both employ a lot of tech in their back-end to improve efficiencies.</p>
<p>Into this area has come European startup <a href="https://pokehouse.it">Poke House</a>, which is effectively industrializing the production of “poke bowls” for food delivery platforms. Poke House specializes in bowl food that often includes marinated fish that&#8217;s cubed and layered up with sticky rice, pickles, noodles, etc.</p>
<p>The company has now raised €20 million ($24m) in a Series B funding round led by Eulero Capital, with the backing of FG2 Capital and reinvestment from Milan Investment Partners SGR. It using tech and data to optimize the production and delivery of its product via all the major food delivery platforms such as Uber East etc. The Italy-born food tech startup claims to have built a &#8220;€100M+ company&#8221; inside two years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Matteo Pichi and Vittoria Zanetti, Poke House has opened 30+ stores in Italy, Portugal and Spain, and now has 400 employees. It’s claiming an expected turnover of €40M+ in 2021.</p>
<p>With the funding, the startup will start opening new stores in existing markets, enter France and start in expansion in the UK.</p>
<p>Poke House says it uses a lot of tech on its back-end, tracking every element of the supply chain to optimize the business. It also analyzes data from third-party delivery platforms (ie. Deliveroo, Glovo, UberEats) to deliver a sub-10 mins food preparation time, and a delivery time under 25 mins.</p>
<p>Matteo Pichi, Co-Founder of Poke House said: “The pandemic has challenged our food sector, and we see technology as the way forward to innovate and digitalize the traditional restaurant experience. We are seeing a shift in people&#8217;s desires in fast but healthy food. Poke bowls fit this new need and it promotes a more balanced, active and sustainable lifestyle with quick and healthy food options available nearby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Pichi added: “Our competitors are the fast-growing healthy concepts such as Sweetgreen or Sweetfin in the US. But in the same time, we think we are lucky because we really are one of the first brands built 100% from food delivery experts or former employees. Our next competitors are gonna be full native virtual brands extremely strong in data analysis and digital brand building. We use food delivery platforms as media platforms and we invest heavier than competitors in the channel.”</p>
<p>Gianfranco Burei, Founding Partner of Eulero Capital said: “Poke House business model rides some of the main trends in the food sector (food-tech, healthy food, delivery, customization) and has all the characteristics and talents to position the company among the top players at European level. We are thrilled to be a partner of Poke House in an innovative and forward-looking project, in line with our investment strategy which is based on the search for companies included in the macro-trends that will characterize the economic, technological and social evolution of the coming years.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has given the go ahead to local startup <a href="https://www.sees.ai">sees.ai,</a> which is developing a beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) command &amp; control solution to aid data capture for industrial use-cases, to trial a concept for routine BVLOS operations &#8212; the first such authorization for a U.K. company, the regulator <a href="https://www.caa.co.uk/News/Step-forward-for-the-drone-industry-as--Civil-Aviation-Authority-authorises-trial-of-a-concept--for-routine-BVLOS-operations/">said today</a>.</p>
<p>The test is taking place under a sandbox program announced back in May 2019 &#8212; directing government funding and regulatory support to R&amp;D in the drone space &#8212; initially through virtual testing, such as of avoid and detect systems.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Sees.ai,</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> an early participant in the sandbox, has now secured authorization to trial a concept for routine BVLOS operations at three (physical) sites without needing to pre-authorise each flight. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxS-m_ti73g">Techstars-backed </a>startup is focused on drone operations in industrial settings &#8212; building tech to scale the use of drones for inspection and maintenance purposes in industries, such as the oil &amp; gas sector, by enabling pilots to remote-control craft from a central location, rather than needing to be on site for each flight.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s clear BVLOS capabilities will be essential for other uses of drone tech &#8212; such as delivery &#8212; hence the CAA calling the trial &#8220;a significant step forward for the drone industry&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;By testing the concept in industrial environments for inspection, monitoring and maintenance purposes, sees.ai aims to prove the safety of its system within this context initially, before extending it to address increasingly challenging missions over time,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Under current U.K. rules, drone operators must keep their aircraft within line of sight and follow the country&#8217;s <a href="https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/drone-code">drone code</a> &#8212; unless they have specific permissions to do otherwise.</p>
<p>One company that previously gained such permission was U.S. tech giant Amazon &#8212; which started testing BVLOS delivery drones in the UK back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/amazons-prime-air-delivery-uk/">2016</a> &#8212; and continues to work on bringing a commercial drone delivery service to market, under its Prime Air brand.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s effort has already been years in the making (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/01/amazon-is-experimenting-with-autonomous-flying-delivery-drones/">it&#8217;s been running experiments since 2013</a>) &#8212; and last year the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/95cc17b6-88a5-47b0-a773-f247942a9a8f">FT</a>, citing a Prime Air source, reported that it still remains &#8220;years&#8221; out from realizing the goal of drone deliveries at scale. So while (another) U.K. trial of BVLOS drone tech is being lauded as a significant development for the industry by the regulator, any Brits expecting drone deliveries in the wild anytime soon are likely to be disappointed.</p>
<p>The CAA authorization for the sees.ai trial will enable the BVLOS test flights to operate under 150ft &#8212; initially requiring an observer to remain in visual line of sight with the aircraft and be able to communicate with the remote pilot if necessary, per the regulator.</p>
<p>So, technically then, the trials will begin as extended-line-of-sight (EVLOS), which still entail limits vs true BVLOS &#8212; enabling drone flights to operate further than 500m from the remote pilot (by deploying flight observers) but not removing on-site observers entirely, as is the ultimate industry goal. <strong>Update: </strong>The CAA confirmed the intention is to remove the observer once/if the trials prove the concept works. It also said the trial differs from traditional EVLOS flying because the spotter does not need to be in constant contact with the pilot &#8212; they only need the ability to contact the pilot if required.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP%201861%20-%20BVLOS%20Fundamentals%20v2.pdf">regulatory roadmap</a> published last fall the CAA wrote that many steps are required to arrive at the sought-for situation of BVLOS being &#8216;business as usual&#8217; in non-segregated airspace &#8212; so there still looks to be a long road ahead before commercial drones will be able to legally whiz around gathering data (or delivering stuff) far from any humans in the loop.</p>
<p>&#8220;The long-term aspiration of operators is for BVLOS operations to be a routine part of business across the UK. This vision requires a significant volume of evidence, experience and learning by everyone involved. There will inevitably be a need for innovators and the CAA to build, test, learn and repeat in small steps to work towards the vision,&#8221; the CAA roadmap notes.</p>
<p>Commenting on sees.ai&#8217;s trial authorization in a statement, CEO John McKenna dubbed it a &#8220;significant milestone&#8221;, adding: &#8220;We are accelerating towards a future where drones fly autonomously at scale &#8212; high up alongside manned aviation and low down inside our industrial sites, suburbs and cities. Securing this UK-first permission is a major step on this journey which will deliver big benefits to society across public health &amp; safety, efficiency and environmental impact.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venmo is adding support for cryptocurrency, starting today. The company says it will begin to roll out the ability for Venmo&#8217;s more than 70 million users to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies directly in the app, similar to the support Venmo parent company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/paypal-says-all-users-in-u-s-can-now-buy-hold-and-sell-cryptocurrencies/">PayPal added late last year</a>. Initially, Venmo will support four types of cryptocurrency: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash &#8212; the same that PayPal offers its U.S. users.</p>
<p>The company had already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/venmo-to-gain-crypto-budgeting-bill-pay-and-honey-integrations-this-year/">announced</a> its plans to introduce cryptocurrency on Venmo in 2021. Both Venmo and PayPal support for crypto come by way of a partnership with <a href="https://www.paxos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.paxos.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618924466703000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFORHplBX48OKy9S0KRYp6IimIx9A"><span class="m_-111796029276706869normaltextrun">Paxos Trust Company</span></a><span class="m_-111796029276706869normaltextrun">, a regulated provider of cryptocurrency products and services. </span></p>
<p>Though there isn&#8217;t much differentiation between what both PayPal and Venmo offers users today, the company explains that the move is more about getting cryptocurrencies in front of a separate, and arguably younger, audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2140640" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140640" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140640" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg 3680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Crypto-on-Venmo-Share-screen.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140640" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;While there is some overlap between the bases, there are also a lot of customers who are discretely either PayPal or Venmo users,&#8221; explains Darrell Esch, Venmo general manager and SVP. &#8220;So this ultimately gives us a new group of customers who aren&#8217;t using PayPal day in and day out the ability to access [crypto] through Venmo.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that Venmo skews younger, with more of its users in their 20s and 30s, compared with the overall U.S. population. They also have other traits that might make them receptive to investing in cryptocurrencies. For example, they&#8217;re more likely than the overall U.S. population to have a college degree, they&#8217;re solidly middle-income earners and they skew toward digital natives.</p>

<p>The user base has also already begun purchasing crypto, Venmo notes. More than 30% had purchased crypto or equities, according to a 2020 Venmo customer study. This picked up during the pandemic, as well.</p>
<p>At launch, Venmo will leverage its in-app social feed to spread the word about cryptocurrencies. Users can share their crypto transactions to the feed, if they choose. This will raise awareness and engagement with the idea of crypto, as will Venmo&#8217;s new educational features. The company says it plans to publish access guides and videos inside the app that will help to answer some of the common questions about cryptocurrencies for those who are just getting started. (See below video, for example.)</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eFIQxwvXD0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Meanwhile, although PayPal announced its U.S. customers could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/paypals-new-feature-allows-u-s-consumers-to-check-out-using-cryptocurrency/">shop with cryptocurrencies</a> via its supported merchant base, Venmo doesn&#8217;t immediately have a similar option. However, the company as of February rolled out to its user base a feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/venmo-begins-piloting-business-profiles-for-small-sellers/">Business Profiles</a>, which enables Venmo users to transact with small sellers and merchants on its app. It&#8217;s not difficult to imagine the role that crypto could play here, as well, in the future. Venmo also offers other products, including a debit and credit card, which could also be leveraged in the future to take advantage of a crypto integration, perhaps.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, the only way to use crypto on Venmo is by buying, selling and holding. The company says users can start with as little as a dollar and pay via their linked bank account or debit card. Of note, the Venmo wallet doesn&#8217;t connect with that of parent company PayPal, though we understand the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees">exchange rates</a> will be the same.</p>
<p>Support for crypto on Venmo is starting to roll out today and will reach all customers within the next few weeks, Venmo says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is working on vehicles tailored to Chinese consumers as complaints about the quality of its electric vehicles send shock waves through the internet in the country.</p>
<p>The American EV giant is mulling new products that will be designed from the ground up for China, Grace Tao, a vice president at Tesla, <a href="https://m.21jingji.com/article/20210420/herald/f79c9e7c28095577ce7acb6859fc2c5a.html">told 21st Century Business Herald</a>, a Chinese business news outlet, during the Shanghai auto show this week. The vehicles developed in China will also be sold globally, she added.</p>
<p>At the same auto event on Monday, a woman showed up at Tesla&#8217;s booth, climbing atop a Tesla car and shouting allegations of faulty brakes made by the company. The person was later detained for damaging the vehicle, and Tesla <a href="https://weibo.com/3615027564/KbCRXnlzU?from=page_1006063615027564_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime">said</a> on microblogging platform Weibo that her car had crashed due to exceeding the speed limit, not quality issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nonetheless, the protestor won widespread sympathy when videos of her spread online. Many users joined in to vent about their Tesla problems. Posts with the hashtag &#8220;Tesla stand turned into a stage for defending rights&#8221; garnered <a href="https://s.weibo.com/weibo/%23%E7%89%B9%E6%96%AF%E6%8B%89%E5%B1%95%E5%8F%B0%E5%8F%98%E7%BB%B4%E6%9D%83%E7%8E%B0%E5%9C%BA%23">over 220 million views</a> on Weibo within two days.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have since the start been willing to work with national and authoritative third-party organizations to thoroughly inspect the issues raised by the public. By doing this, we wish to win assurance and understanding from consumers,&#8221; Tesla China said in a <a href="https://weibo.com/teslaofficial?profile_ftype=1&amp;is_all=1#_0">statement</a> posted on Weibo in response to the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we still haven&#8217;t fulfilled this wish, mainly because our ways of communicating with customers may be problematic. Secondly, we indeed can&#8217;t decide for our customers how they want to resolve these issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like in the West, Tesla has fostered a cult-like following in China. And along with Apple, it&#8217;s one of the few American tech giants that have gained a firm foothold in China. Last year, Tesla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-summoned-by-chinese-regulators-for-quality-concerns/">shipped nearly 500,000 vehicles</a> globally and China contributed 20% to its revenues.</p>
<p>But the company also faces mounting competition from Chinese homegrown challengers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/tesla-rival-xpeng-lidar-dji/">Xpeng</a>, Nio, and Li Auto, the well-funded startups, as well as old-school carmakers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/huawei-auto-strategy/">with help from high-tech firms like Huawei</a>, are ready to take a slice of Tesla&#8217;s market. The designed-in-China vehicles are already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/06/business/china-xinjiang-boycott-heytea-nio.html">finding a spot</a> among the more patriotic crowds.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that the Chinese government is placing more scrutiny over Tesla. In January, the firm was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/tesla-summoned-by-chinese-regulators-for-quality-concerns/">summoned by local regulators</a> over quality concerns, shortly after it recalled several tens of thousands of vehicles in the country. The government restricted the use of Tesla by military facilities over national security concerns, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-restrict-tesla-usage-by-military-and-state-personnel-11616155643?mod=article_inline">reported</a> in March. Elon Musk later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-forum-musk-idUSKBN2BC04Q">said</a> his company would be shut down if its cars were used to spy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Challenger&#8221; startups in banking and insurance have upended their industries, and picked up significant business, by building more customer-friendly tools and services &#8212; more personalized, easier to access, and usually competitively priced &#8212; than those typically provided their bigger, incumbent rivals. Now, a startup out of Romania that is building tools to help the incumbents respond with better services of their own is announcing a significant round of funding as its business grows.</p>
<p><a href="https://fintechos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FintechOS</a>, which has built a low-code platform aimed at larger (older) banking and insurance companies to help them build new services and analytics on top of and around their existing infrastructure, has raised €51 million ($61.5 million at today&#8217;s rates, but $60 million at the time of the deal closing) in a Series B round of funding.</p>
<p>FintechOS&#8217;s opportunity has been to target wave of incumbents in the insurance and banking industries that have been slowly watching as newer players like Lemonade (in insurance) and a huge plethora of challenger banks (Revolut, N26, Monzo and many others) are swooping in and picking up customers, especially among younger demographics, while they have been unable to respond mostly because their infrastructure is too old and big. Turning a huge ship around, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-56505413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we have seen</a>, is no small task &#8212; a situation that has become only more apparent in the last year of pandemic living and the big shift to digital interactions that resulted from it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When we launched FintechOS in 2017, we could already see existing solutions to digital transformation would struggle to deliver tangible results. By contrast, our unique approach has quickly inspired a sea-change in how financial institutions address digitization and engage with their customers,&#8221; said Teodor Blidarus, co-founder and CEO at FintechOS, in a statement. “Events over the last year have only increased pressure on our industry to evolve and as a result we’re seeing growing demand for our powerful platforms. Our latest round of funding will help us grow at the pace needed to improve outcomes for financial institutions and their customers globally.”</p>
<p>(It is not the only one. Others out of Europe in the space of bringing new tools to incumbent banks to help them make more modern and competitive products include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/10x-founded-by-the-ex-ceo-of-barclays-raises-46m-to-take-on-ancient-banking-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10x</a>, <a href="https://www.temenos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thought Machine</a>, <a href="https://www.temenos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temenos</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mambu</a> and many more.)</p>
<p>The Series B round of funding is being led by Draper-Esprit, with Earlybird, Gapminder Ventures, Launchub, and OTB Ventures (which all participated in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/fintechos-raises-14m-help-banks-launch-products-as-fast-as-fintech-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A in December 2019</a>) also participating. There are other backers in the round that are not being disclosed at this time, the startup added. FintechOS is also not disclosing its valuation. The company, based out of Bucharest, has raised just under $80 million to date.</p>
<p>FintechOS is active today in the UK and Europe &#8212; where it has been growing at a CAGR of 200% and says its services touch &#8220;millions&#8221; of people, with some of its key customers including the likes of banking giants Societe Generale and IdeaBank and international insurance brokers Howden. The plan will be to continue investing in those markets, as well as expanding internationally.</p>
<p>And it will be adding in more services. Today, the banking platform is designed to help banks launch more retail services for consumers and small and medium business customers, and for insurance companies to build new health, life and general insurance products (there are a lot of synergies in how insurance and financial services companies have been built over the years, and so it&#8217;s a natural couplet when it comes to building tools for those industries).</p>
<p>In the financial sector, FintechOS lets banks build in new digital onboarding flows, credit cards and loan products, savings and mortgage products. Insurance products include new approaches to generating and handling quotes, customer onboarding and management and claims automation &#8212; which may well bring FintechOS into closer contact and collaboration with the most successful startup to come out of its home country to date, the RPA juggernaut UiPath. In all cases, it helps stitch together data from a bank&#8217;s own systems with more modern tooling, and to link that up with yet more modern tools to help process that data more easily.</p>
<p>This is &#8220;low code&#8221; but it typically means that the company needs to work with third parties to enable all of this. Partners include the likes of integrators and other global services technicians, such as Microsoft, Deloitte, CapGemini, KPMG, and so on. (And the founders of the startup themselves come from consulting backgrounds so they well understand the role these companies play in the process of bringing technology into big businesses.)</p>
<p>FintechOS is tapping into a couple of very big trends that have arguably been the biggest in the financial and related insurance industries.</p>
<p>The first of these is the fact that core services around things like credit/loans, current deposits and savings are not just very complex to build but actually have largely become commoditized &#8212; similar to digital payments &#8212; and so packaging them up and turning them into services that can be integrated by way of an API makes them more easily accessed without the heavy lifting needed to build them from scratch. This lets companies focus instead on customer service or building more interesting tools around those basic services to customise them (for example AI based personalization). Disintermediating basic functions from the services built around them is arguably a bigger trend but it has been especially prevalent in enterprise, which has long been a slow-moving space when it comes to innovation in the back-end, and the front-end.</p>
<p>The second of these is the big swing towards using no-code and low-code tools to empower more people within organizations to get stuck in when they can see something not working as efficiently as it could, and building the workflows themselves to improve that. This also applies to trying out and testing new products &#8212; again something that typically has not been done in financial and insurance services but can now be possible with low-code and no-code tools.</p>
<p>“Not only is our technology helping financial institutions become customer centric, but it’s also helping them provide products and services to more people and businesses,&#8221; said Sergiu Negut, the other co-founder who is FintechOS&#8217;s CFO and COO, said in a separate statement. &#8220;With so many markets still underserved, the ability to tailor offerings to a segment of one offers the opportunity to increase financial inclusion and adheres to our ideal that easy access to financial services is essential. We’re delighted to be working with investors who share our views on how fintech should be transforming the financial services industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, Draper Esprit also has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed Thought Machine</a>, another big player in the world of fintech that is taking some of the learnings and models that have helped new entrants disrupt incumbents, and is packaging them up as services for incumbents, too. It takes a different approach to doing this, not using low-code but smart contracts, which could be one reason why the VC doesn&#8217;t see the investments as conflict of interest. They are also tackling an enormous market, and so at least for now there is room for them, and many others in the space, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/10x-founded-by-the-ex-ceo-of-barclays-raises-46m-to-take-on-ancient-banking-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10x</a>, Temenos, Mambu, Rapyd and many others.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we met Teo and Sergiu, we were immediately convinced of their vision: a data led, end-to-end platform, facilitated with a low-code/no-code infrastructure,&#8221; Vinoth Jayakumar, partner at Draper Esprit, said in a statement. “Incumbent financial services firms have cost-to-income ratios up to 90%, so we see a huge and increasing need for infrastructure software that allows digitisation at speed, ease and lower cost. Draper Esprit builds enduring partnerships; with the team at FintechOS we hope to build an enduring fintech company that will dramatically change financial services experiences for people all over the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year we covered the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/heights-raises-2m-for-its-subscription-supplements-aimed-new-braincare-category/">Heights</a>, a new supplements startup in an increasingly hot category. <a href="https://wearefeel.com">Feel</a>, is a year-old UK startup with another twist on this world: pure nutritional supplements. It’s now closed a $6.2 million investment, led by Fuel Ventures, with participation from TMT Investments, Sova VC, Richard Longhurst (founder of LoveHoney.com) and Igor Ryabenkiy (founder and GP of Altair Capital).</p>
<p>Feel founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/borhod/?originalSubdomain=uk">Boris Hodakel</a> says he spun his startup up after looking at the UK’s big health and retail brands including Graze, Tesco, Bulk Powders and Simba Sleep.</p>
<p>In many ways Feel is very akin to Graze. The supplements arrive in a post-box-friendly box and is available in a range of subscription packages. This is basically ‘Graze nuts, but for supplements.’</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Feel has a direct-to-consumer subscription model, and is claiming a 60x growth in its first year and 21,000 active subscriptions.</p>
<p>Hodakel’s contention is that while Feel provides higher grade supplements to consumers which cost more to produce, it manages to keep costs down for consumers via direct-to-consumer model.</p>
<p>Hodakel, founder and CEO of Feel said: “Not all vitamins are created equal and the majority you find on retail shelves have a dirty formula that is difficult to absorb by the body, missing natural elements. We’re the cleanest alternative in the market &#8211; backed up by science &#8211;  and continually invest in making our formulas as effective as possible while still affordable.”</p>
<p>He says he started Feel because, having a skin problem, supplements were part of his health routine, but &#8220;the aha moment&#8221; happened he realized how many fillers were in normal supplements. &#8220;All our formulas are researched and formulated in-house, and we keep updating them, like our flagship multivitamin in just two years is already in its 3rd version,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mark Pearson, managing partner at Fuel Ventures added: “The growth and the expansion of Feel’s product line present a really exciting time for Feel and we are supporting them in becoming a significant disruptor to the health supplement market.” </p>
<p>Alexander Chikunov, Partner at Sova VC added, “Feel is in the process of disrupting consumer habits around vitamin intake, and changing a marketplace worth $144bn by providing its customers with top-quality products, combined with flawless and friendly service.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the past ten years, an investment team led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/winterchristian/">Christian Winter</a>, Jan Sessenhausen, Helmut Klawitter and Wilken Engelbracht worked principally with German family offices, investing in startups such as Klarna, Zalando and Delivery Hero that went on to be worth around €80 billion in total. Today they are launching a VC firm of their own, Cusp Capital, with €300 million ($361m) under their belt. </p>
<p>Cusp Capital will back early-stage young tech companies across Europe. Its LPs include institutional investors such as the European Investment Fund, KfW Capital, RAG Stiftung, and NRW.BANK, alongside family offices and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>In a statement Christian Winter, general partner, said: “Cusp Capital is built on and incorporates our experience as investors over the past decade. We have worked in various operational roles and accompanied more than 50 early-stage companies to successful exits and IPOs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to forming Cusp, the team of partners had worked largely with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erivan_Haub">Haub</a> Family office  and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengelmann_Group">Tengelmann Group</a>.</p>
<p>Over a call, he told me the firm is planning lead deals in Seed and Series A rounds, and co-lead in growth rounds. They plan to do 25-30 investments with this fund or a 6-7 a year period.</p>
<p>Cusp’s Initial investments will range from mid-to-high single-digit million Euros and it says it has already signed the first term sheets for investments.</p>
<p>Jan Sessenhausen, General Partner of Cusp Capital says: “We dedicate a lot of time to developing investment hypotheses with global relevance. We use these hypotheses to identify promising companies, and actively approach entrepreneurs with our expertise. Having our own perspective early on allows us to see eye-to-eye with founders and have the deep discussions needed to help them realize their full potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of those hypotheses is around focused sustainability. The firm says this will be a core theme for its investing, going forward. In addition, widening access to financing for lower-income consumers will also be a feature of its investing thesis.</p>
<p>Cusp Capital is headquartered in Essen, with a second office in Berlin.</p>
