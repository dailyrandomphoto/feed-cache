										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month Jeff Bezos announced he would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">step down as CEO of Amazon</a> later this year, moving into the executive chairman role, while passing the baton to AWS CEO Andy Jassy. Could Marc Benioff, co-founder, chairman and CEO at Salesforce be the next big-name executive to make a similar move?</p>
<p>A Reuter&#8217;s story <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-salesforce-com-ceo/exclusive-salesforces-taylor-emerges-as-ceo-candidate-sources-idUSKBN2B12C0?il=0">published on Monday</a> suggested that could be the case. Citing unnamed sources, the story indicated that Benioff&#8217;s CEO exit could happen this year. Further those same sources suggested that current Salesforce president and COO Bret Taylor is the likely heir apparent.</p>
<p>We wrote a story <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/salesforce-has-built-a-deep-bench-of-executive-talent-via-acquisition/">at the end of last year</a> speculating on possible successors to Benioff, were he to step away from the CEO role. There were a number of worthy candidates, several of whom, like Taylor, came to the company via an acquisition. All the same, we thought that Taylor seemed to be the most likely candidate to replace Benioff.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We asked Salesforce for a comment on the Reuter&#8217;s story. A company spokesperson told us that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on rumors or speculation.</p>
<p>While the entire scenario fits firmly in the rumor and speculation column, it is not entirely unlikely either. What would it mean if Benioff stepped away and what if Taylor was truly the next in line? And how would that swap compare with the Bezos decision were it to happen?</p>
<h2>Similar yet different</h2>
<p>Salesforce and Amazon are both companies founded in the 1990s, each looking to shake up its industry.</p>
<p>For Amazon, it was changing the way goods (starting with books) were bought and sold. And for Benioff the goal was changing the way software was sold. Bezos famously founded his company in his garage. Benioff <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/08/salesforce-at-20-offers-lessons-for-startup-success/">built his in a rented apartment</a>. From these humble beginnings both have built iconic companies and accumulated enormous wealth. You could understand why either could be ready to step away from the daily grind of running a company after all these years.</p>
<p>Bezos announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">veteran executive Andy Jassy,</a> who runs the company&#8217;s cloud arm, would be his replacement when the handoff comes. Jassy knows the organization&#8217;s priority mix as he&#8217;s been working at the company for more than two decades. He&#8217;s locked into the culture and helped take AWS <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/">from idea</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">$50 billion juggernaut</a>.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/embed/#?secret=wGH44CNl6B" data-secret="wGH44CNl6B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Benioff hasn&#8217;t made any actual firm pronouncement, we have seen Bret Taylor &#8212; who joined the company in 2016 when Salesforce purchased <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/01/salesforce-buys-word-processing-app-quip-for-750m/">his startup Quip for $750 million</a> &#8212; move quickly up the ladder.</p>
<p>Laurie McCabe, co-founder and analyst at SMB Group, who has been following Salesforce since its earliest days, says that if Benioff were to leave, he would obviously leave big shoes to fill. But she agreed that everything seems to point to Taylor as his successor should that happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Salesforce has been grooming Taylor for awhile. He has some stellar credentials both at Salesforce, his own start-up, Quip, that Salesforce acquired, and at Facebook. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind he can lead Salesforce forward, but he&#8217;ll bring a different more low-key style to the role. And I&#8217;m sure Benioff will stay very involved [&#8230;],&#8221; McCabe said.</p>
<h2>Two different situations</h2>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials says that while he believes Taylor could be chosen as Benioff&#8217;s successor, and would be qualified to lead the company, he&#8217;s taken a very different path from Jassy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Benioff moving on could be different from Bezos in the sense that Jassy has been at Amazon for over 20 years and was there to basically see and be part of most of the story. [&#8230;] But if Taylor were to succeed Benioff there&#8217;s not as much [history] at Salesforce with him not being on board until the Quip acquisition in 2016,&#8221; Leary said.</p>
<p>Leary wonders if this relatively short history with the company could create some political friction in the organization if he were chosen to succeed Benioff. &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying that this would happen, but choosing one of the many possible heirs that have come via a number of high profile acquisitions could possibly lead to high level turnover from those not picked to succeed Benioff,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research says that if you look at the range of candidates available, he believes that Taylor would be the best choice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect any issue because there is no one with a similar or even better background, which is when there are problems &#8212; that or when people are in an open competition as it used to be at GE,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know for sure what the final outcome will be, but if Benioff does decide to join Bezos and takes the executive chairman mantle at the company, it makes sense that the person to replace him will be Taylor. But for now, it remains in the realm of speculation, and we&#8217;ll just to wait and see if that&#8217;s what comes to pass.</p>

<p>The new group will be led by Joe Bryan, who was appointed as a special assistant to the Secretary of Defense focused on climate earlier this year.</p>
<p>The move is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-biggest-step-the-biden-administration-took-on-climate-yesterday-wasnt-rejoining-the-paris-agreement/">one of several steps that the Biden administration has taken</a> to push an agenda that looks to address the dangers posed by global climate change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Bryan, who previously served as deputy assistant to the Secretary of the Navy for Energy under the Obama administration, will oversee a group intended to coordinate the Department&#8217;s responses to Biden&#8217;s recent executive order and subsequent climate and energy-related directives and track implementation of climate and energy-related actions and progress, according to a statement.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense controls the purse strings for hundreds of billions of dollars in government spending and is a huge consumer of electricity, oil and gas, and industrial materials. Any steps it takes to improve the efficiency of its supply chain, reduce the emissions profile of its fleet of vehicles, and use renewable energy to power operations could make a huge contribution to the commercialization of renewable and sustainable technologies and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Pentagon is already including security implications of climate change in its risk analyses, strategy development and planning guidance, according to the statement, and is including those risk analyses in its installation planning, modeling, simulation and war gaming, and the National Defense Strategy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it is increasing platform efficiency to improve freedom of action in contested logistics environments, or deploying new energy solutions to strengthen resilience of key capabilities at installations, our mission objectives are well-aligned with our climate goals,&#8221; wrote Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a statement. &#8220;The department will leverage that alignment to modernize the force, strengthen our supply chains, identify opportunities to work closely with allies and partners, and compete with China for the energy technologies that are essential to our future success.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A newly launched Mac app called <a href="https://superpowered.me/">Superpowered</a> aims to make it easier to stay on top of all your Zoom calls and Google Meets, without having to scramble to find the meeting link in your inbox or calendar app at the last minute. Instead of relying on calendar reminders, Superpowered offers a notification inbox for the Mac menu bar that alerts you to online meetings just before they start, which you can then join with a click of a button.</p>
<p>To use Superpowered, you first <a href="https://superpowered.me/onboarding">download the app</a> then authorize it to access to your Google Calendar. The app currently works with any Google account, including G Suite, as well as your subscribed calendars.</p>
<p>Once connected, Superpowered pulls all your events into the menu bar, which you can view at any time throughout the day with a click or by using the keyboard shortcut Command+Y.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When you have a meeting coming up, Superpowered will display a drop-down notification to alert you, or you can opt for a more subtle halo effect instead to have it get your attention. You can also configure other preferences &#8212; like whether you want a chime to sound, how far in advance you want to be alerted, whether you want a meeting reminder as text to appear in the menu bar ahead of the meeting and so on.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s time for the meeting, all you have to do is click the button it displays to join your Zoom call or Google Meet. The solution is simple, but effective. The startup plans to add support for more integrations going forward, including Microsoft Teams, Cisco WebEx and others.</p>
<p>The idea for the app comes from four computer science and software engineering students from the University of Waterloo, who previously interned at tech companies like Google, Facebook, Asana and Spotify.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123817" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123817" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123817" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/photo.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123817" class="wp-caption-text">Team photo.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> Superpowered</p></div></p>
<p>Wanting to build a startup of their own, the team applied to the accelerator Y Combinator with an idea to build a lecture platform for professors. But they soon faced issues in keeping up with their own calendar appointments as they began to conduct user research interviews.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were struggling to keep up with each other&#8217;s calendars and balance all these meetings throughout the day,&#8221; explains Superpowered co-founder Jordan Dearsley, who built the service alongside teammates Nikhil Gupta, Ibrahim Irfan and Nick Yang. &#8220;We would be at lunch and be like, &#8216;Oh shoot, we have a meeting now &#8212; I have to run!&#8217; or just completely miss it altogether,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Irfan had the idea to just put a button in the Mac menu bar to make it easier to join Zoom meetings and soon the team pivoted to work on Superpowered instead.</p>
<p>The product itself is very new. Development work began roughly two months ago and Superpowered <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/superpowered-2">opened up to users just last month</a> &#8212; a quick pace that Dearsley says was possible because three of the four team members are engineers, and the other, Yang, is the designer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123820" style="width: 613px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123820" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123820" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?w=603" alt="" width="603" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png 1689w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=133,150 133w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=266,300 266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=768,866 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=603,680 603w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=1362,1536 1362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/superpowered-close-up.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123820" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Superpowered</p></div></p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s a paid product offered at $10 per month, Superpowered already has hundreds of users who are interacting with the app, on average, 10 times per day. Busier users, like product managers, are clicking on Superpowered as many as 20 to 40 times per day &#8212; an indication that it&#8217;s found a place in users&#8217; workflows. In the month since its launch, the app has connected users with over 10,000 online meetings, the company says.</p>
<p>Superpowered is not the first to add calendar appointments to the Mac&#8217;s menu bar. It competes with a range of products, like <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/meetingbar">MeetingBar</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meeter-fast-call-initiation/id1510445899?mt=12">Meeter</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/next-meeting/id1017470484?mt=12">Next Meeting</a> and others. But users have been responding to Superpowered&#8217;s sleek, clean design.</p>
<p>The company also has a vision for the product&#8217;s future that extends beyond meetings. After solving this particular pain point, Superpowered plans to broaden its scope to fix other annoyances for knowledge workers &#8212; like Slack notifications, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really annoying to be pinged all the time while I&#8217;m coding … and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s worth seeing because Slack doesn&#8217;t really give me those controls or ability to peek,&#8221; explains Dearsley. Meanwhile, Mac&#8217;s built-in Notification Center isn&#8217;t smart enough to show you just those items that you really need to know about.</p>
<p>To address this, the team is now working on a Slack integration that will let you quickly check your messages and reply without having to launch the Slack app. Further down the road, the team wants to integrate support for other platforms &#8212; like Google Docs, JIRA and GitHub &#8212; which would all be pulled into Superpowered&#8217;s universal notification inbox.</p>
<p>For the time being, Superpowered is $10 per month for Mac users or $8 per month for those who sign up with a team. Annual pricing is not yet available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Actor Terry Crews is going in on the blockchain. With the help of social currency startup <a href="https://tryroll.com/">Roll</a>, Crews is launching his own social currency, $POWER.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s break down what that means. Anyone can create a social currency, which hundreds of creators have already done via Roll, to change their relationships with fans and users. Roll enables creators to mint and distribute their own social currency under the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/">ERC-20 standard</a> and then determine the ways in which their communities can earn and spend that social currency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone, anywhere, anytime can create their own content,&#8221; Roll founder and CEO Bradley Miles told TechCrunch. &#8220;We refer to this as mass personalization of content. Right now, Roll is experiencing the same thing with money itself. Anyone, anywhere, anytime can create their own money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The way I think of it is it&#8217;s almost like the process for earning and redeeming credit card points but minus the credit card company and plus the blockchain and creators. I haven&#8217;t run this analogy by Miles, but I&#8217;m going with it. Just how your credit card provider gives you points for using your card and then you can redeem those points for cash, airline tickets, etc., creators give fans social currency for engaging with their work in a variety of ways. Then, fans can redeem that social currency for more art, content or what have you.</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 300 creators, including Crews, using Roll. Roll, which has <a href="https://tryroll.com/roll-fundraise-mainstream/">$2.7 million in funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Trevor McFedries and others,</a> recently saw its <a href="https://app.tryroll.com/markets">social currency market cap surpass $1 billion</a>. Bradley Miles gifted me .10 $WHALE (worth about $3) so I could get a better understanding of how creators are already using Roll. $WHALE is backed by tangible and rare nonfungible token assets, which means that I can use my $WHALE to buy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts/">NFTs</a>. Because Roll enables users to trade their social currency for over 600 other digital assets, that means I could buy the below NFT over on NFT marketplace OpenSea.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123747" style="width: 1132px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123747" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2123747 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png" alt="" width="1122" height="616" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png 1122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=680,373 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1122px) 100vw, 1122px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123747" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x9e1f3e8db4d1119894624632499eaed1e56d2b1d/268">Screenshot/OpenSea</a></strong></p></div></p>
<p>However, you&#8217;ll see that the Podmork Pix 35 WS cost 28 $WHALE, so I will not be buying this NFT.</p>
<p>In the case of Crews, he envisions folks earning $POWER via blockchain art purchases, NFTs, physical goods and experiences. Initially, Crews is engaging with his $POWER community through Discord. Folks with 50 $POWER, for example, can access a special channel within Discord. To date, Crews had distributed $POWER to about 100 people, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I give you $POWER, you own a piece of me,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no other way to put it. And I want to be very careful about who is holding me, no puns intended.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days for $POWER, but Crews says he eventually wants to offer interest-free microloans to artists. The ultimate goal with $POWER is to empower artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our long-term plan,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;To become this thing that this community can live and exist in. You could use it anywhere you are &#8212; at Target, the grocery store.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crews attributes his interest in this space to something that happened to him about four years ago.</p>

<p>While in Milan, Crews said he was trying to buy designer furniture from an artist he respected at <a href="https://www.salonemilano.it/en/exhibitions/international-furnishing-accessories-exhibition">Salone del Mobile</a>. He realized he needed extra money to complete the purchase, but didn&#8217;t have enough cash in his checking account to cover it. So he got on the phone with American Express, he said, who told him to go to a local bank. American Express, on Crews&#8217; behalf, then tried to explain the situation to the local bank manager so that Crews could get the funds he needed to complete the transaction. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Crews said the local bank manager took one look at him and said, &#8220;No.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m watching all these white men and women pass me in line, and they&#8217;re looking at me strangely,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;I&#8217;d been standing there for 15 minutes and it slowly dawns on me that because I&#8217;m Black, I was not going to get my money,&#8221; he said. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;That was the moment I knew everything had to change for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Crews ended up going to a check-cashing place, in an area where he said his Uber driver refused to go, and got the funds to pay the fees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bringing it up still makes me angry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What I love about this new world of finance is that cryptocurrency does not know what race you are, how old you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Through $POWER, Crews hopes to put power back in the hands of artists and creators, Crews explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no gatekeeper to tell us no,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Crews says he&#8217;s also going to start putting out his own content into the $POWER community, where the community will collectively own it together.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is bigger than me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a new future.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Miles, he envisions a world in which $POWER is accepted at movie theaters or at Paramount Pictures properties.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Social currency] is not to replace the dollar,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220;It&#8217;s to complement [money] and do work that probably the dollar is not suited to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked Crews if this means he&#8217;s leaving Hollywood and will solely focus on producing his own content for his $POWER community. But Crews said he left Hollywood when he sued William Morris Endeavor in 2017 alleging an executive from the firm groped him. Crews and WME <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/07/actor-terry-crews-settles-his-lawsuit-against-the-powerful-hollywood-agent-who-allegedly-groped-him/">settled the suit in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they were done with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the deal is, is that I had my power. I still had my talent. William Morris threatened to end everything I&#8217;m doing. But everything I&#8217;m doing right now, you can&#8217;t take. So that&#8217;s when I separated from Hollywood. I&#8217;ve never felt like a Hollywood person, even to this day. But every artist out there probably feels the same way. They want their power.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has challenged the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">FTC&#8217;s antitrust case against it</a> using a standard playbook that questions the agency&#8217;s arguably expansive approach to defining monopolies. But the old reliable &#8220;we&#8217;re not a monopoly because we never raised prices&#8221; and &#8220;how can it be anti-competitive if we never allowed competition&#8221; may themselves soon be challenged by new doctrine and the new administration.</p>
<p>In a document filed today, which you can read at the bottom of this post, Facebook lays out its case with a tone of aggrieved pathos:</p>
<blockquote><p>By a one-vote margin, in the fraught environment of relentless criticism of Facebook for matters entirely unrelated to antitrust concerns, the agency decided to bring a case against Facebook that ignores its own prior decisions, controlling precedent, and the limits of its statutory authority.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yes, Facebook is the victim here, and don&#8217;t you forget it. (Incidentally, the FTC, like the FCC, is designed to split 3:2 along party lines, so the &#8220;one-vote margin&#8221; is what one sees for many important measures.)</p>
<p>But after the requisite crying comes the reluctant explanation that the FTC doesn&#8217;t know its own business. The suit against Facebook, the company argues, should be spiked by the judge because it fails along three lines.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yDyWjpVjps"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">FTC seeks to break up Facebook, alleging illegal monopoly</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;FTC seeks to break up Facebook, alleging illegal monopoly&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/embed/#?secret=yDyWjpVjps" data-secret="yDyWjpVjps" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>First, the FTC does not &#8220;allege a plausible relevant market.&#8221; After all, to have a monopoly, one must have a market over which to exert that monopoly. And the FTC, Facebook argues, has not shown this, alleging only a nebulous &#8220;personal social networking&#8221; market, and &#8220;no court has ever held that such a free goods market exists for antitrust purposes.&#8221; The FTC also ignores the &#8220;relentlessly competitive&#8221; advertising market that actually makes the company money.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately, the FTC&#8217;s efforts to structure a crabbed &#8220;use&#8221; market for a free service in which it can claim a large Facebook &#8220;share&#8221; are artificial and incoherent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The implication here is not just that the FTC has failed to define the social media market (and Facebook won&#8217;t do so itself), but that such a market may not even exist because social media is free and the money is made in a different market. This is a variation on a standard Big Tech argument that amounts to &#8220;because we do not fall under any of the existing categories, we are effectively unregulated.&#8221; After all you cannot regulate a social media company by its advertising practices or vice versa (though they may be intertwined in some ways, they are distinct businesses in others).</p>
<p>Thusly Facebook attempts, like many before it, to squeeze between the cracks in the regulatory framework.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;FTC to examine every acquisition by Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft in 2010-2019 over antitrust issues&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/ftc-to-examine-every-acquisition-by-alphabet-amazon-apple-facebook-and-microsoft-in-2010-2019-over-antitrust-issues/embed/#?secret=7DxMnuTLGj" data-secret="7DxMnuTLGj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This continues with the second argument, which says that the FTC &#8220;cannot establish that Facebook has increased prices or restricted output because the agency acknowledges that Facebook’s products are offered for free and in unlimited quantities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea here is literally that if the product is free to the consumer, it is by definition not possible for the provider to have or abuse a monopoly. When the FTC argues that Facebook controls 60% of the social media market (which of course doesn&#8217;t exist anyway), what does that even mean? 60% of zero dollars, or 100%, or 20%, is still zero.</p>
<p>The third argument is that the behaviors the FTC singles out — purchasing up-and-coming competitors for enormous sums and nipping others in the bud by restricting access to Facebook&#8217;s platform and data — are not only perfectly legal but that the agency has no standing to challenge them, having given its blessing before and having no specific illegal activity to point to at present.</p>
<p>Of course the FTC revisits mergers and acquisitions all the time, and there&#8217;s precedent for unraveling them long afterward if, for instance, new information comes to light that was not available during the review process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook acquired a small photo-sharing service in 2012, Instagram … after that acquisition was reviewed and cleared by the FTC in a unanimous 5-0 vote,&#8221; reads the document. Leaving aside the absurd characterization of the billion-dollar purchase as &#8220;small,&#8221; leaks and disclosures of internal conversations contemporary with the acquisition have cast it in a completely new light. Facebook, then far less secure than it is today, was spooked and worried that Instagram may eat its lunch, so it was better to buy than compete.</p>
<p>The FTC addresses this and indeed many of the other points Facebook raises <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/facebook-q-a">in a FAQ it posted</a> around the time of the original filing.</p>
<p>Now, some of these arguments may have seemed a little strange to you. For instance, why should it matter if a market has no money from consumers being exchanged, if there is value exchanged elsewhere contingent on those users&#8217; engagement with the service? And how can the depredations of a company in the context of a free product that invades privacy (and has faced enormous fines for doing so) be judged by its actions in an adjacent market, like advertising?</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;9 reasons the Facebook FTC settlement is a joke&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/9-reasons-the-facebook-ftc-settlement-is-a-joke/embed/#?secret=XQyT4ouxpR" data-secret="XQyT4ouxpR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The simple truth is that antitrust law and practice have been stuck in a rut for decades, weighed down by doctrine that states that markets are defined by consumer good, defined as the price of a product and whether a company can increase it arbitrarily. A steel manufacturer that absorbs its competitors by undercutting them and then later raises prices when it is the only provider is a simple example, and the type that antitrust laws were created to combat.</p>
<p>If that seems needlessly simplistic, well, it&#8217;s more complicated in practice and has been effective in many circumstances — but the last 30 years have shown it to be inadequate to address the more complex multibusiness domains of the likes of Microsoft, Google and Facebook (to say nothing of TechCrunch parent company Verizon, which is a whole other matter).</p>
<p>The ascendance of Amazon is one of the best examples of the failure of antitrust doctrine and resulted in <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">a breakthrough paper called &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox&#8221;</a> that pilloried these outdated ideas and showed how network effects led to subtler but no less effective anti-competitive practices. Establishment voices decried it as naive and overreaching, and progressive voices lauded it as the next wave of antitrust philosophy.</p>
<p>It seems that the latter camp may win out, as the author of this controversial paper, Lina Khan, has just been nominated for the vacant fifth commissioner position at the FTC.</p>
<p>Whether or not she is confirmed (she will face fierce opposition, no doubt, as an outsider plainly opposed to the status quo), her nomination validates her view as an important one. With Khan and her allies in charge at the FTC and elsewhere, the decades-old assumptions that Facebook relies on for its pro forma rejection of the FTC lawsuit may be challenged.</p>
<p>That may not matter for the present lawsuit, which is unlikely to be subject to said rules given its rather retrospective character, but the gloves will be off for the next round — and make no mistake, there <em>will</em> be a next round.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1998, Sun Microsystems piloted its “Open Work” program, letting roughly half of their workforce work flexibly from wherever they wanted. The project required new hardware, software and telecommunications solutions, and took about 24 months to implement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Results were </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna20281475"><span style="font-weight: 400;">very positive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a reduction in costs and the company’s carbon footprint. Despite this outcome, long-term remote work never really caught on more broadly. In fact, the 2010s were focused on going the other direction, as open offices, on-site perks and coworking spaces sprung up around the idea that in-person community is an essential component of innovation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, companies of all sizes, in all corners of the world, were forced to shift to remote work with the onset of COVID-19. While some companies were better positioned than others — whether it be due to a previously distributed workforce, a reliance on cloud apps and services, or already-established flexible work policies — the adjustment to a fully remote workforce has been challenging for everyone. The truth is that even the largest companies have had to rely on the heroics of employees making sacrifices and persevering through numerous challenges to get through this time.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The best engineering work isn’t done in isolation, but in collaboration, as teams discuss, wrangle and brainstorm through problems.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology like high-quality video conferencing and the cloud have been integral in making remote work possible. But we don’t yet have a complete substitute for in-person work because we continue to lack tooling in one critical area: passive collaboration. While active collaboration (which is the lion’s share) can happen over virtual meetings and emails, we haven’t fully solved for enabling the types of serendipitous conversations and chance connections that often power our biggest innovations and serve as the cornerstone of passive collaboration.</span></p>
<h2><b>Active versus passive collaboration</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those outside of the tech industry may think that software engineers only need a computer and a secure internet connection to do their work. But the stereotype of the lone engineer coding away in solitude has long been shattered. The best engineering work isn’t done in isolation, but in collaboration, as teams discuss, wrangle and brainstorm through problems. Video conference platforms and chat applications help us collaborate actively, and tools like Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Google Docs allow for dedicated asynchronous collaboration, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what we currently lack are the moments of spontaneous engagement that energize us and invite new ideas that otherwise wouldn’t have been part of the conversation. The long-term impact of not having access to this has not yet been measured, but it’s my belief that it will have a negative effect on innovation because passive collaboration plays such a critical role in fostering creativity.</span></p>
<h2><b>The whiteboard</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to think about the differences between passive and active collaboration is to look at a whiteboard. Someone recently asked me, “What is it with people in tech and whiteboards? Why are they such a big deal?” Whiteboards are simple and “low-tech,” yet have become quintessential in our industry. That’s because they represent a source of multimodal collaboration for engineers. Let’s think back to before COVID. How many times have you walked by (or been a part of) a scrum meeting of engineers huddled around a whiteboard? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever stopped by because you overheard a snippet of a conversation and wanted to learn more or share your perspective? Or maybe something on a whiteboard caught your eye and caused you to start a conversation with another colleague, leading to a breakthrough. These are all moments of passive collaboration, which whiteboards so excellently enable (in addition to being a tool for real-time, active collaboration). They’re low-friction ways to invite new ideas and perspectives to the conversation that otherwise wouldn’t have been considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While whiteboards are one mode of facilitating passive collaboration, they aren’t the only option. Serendipitous meetings in the break room, overhearing a conversation from the next cubicle over, or spotting someone across the room who’s free for a quick gut check are also examples of passive collaboration. These interactions are a critical piece of how we work together and the hardest to recreate in a world of remote work. Just as silos in the development process are detrimental to software quality, so too is a lack of passive collaboration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need tools that will help us peek over at what other people are working on without the pressure of a dedicated meeting time or update email. The free and open exchange of ideas is a birthplace for innovation, but we haven’t yet figured out how to create a good virtual space for this.</span></p>
<h2><b>Looking forward</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of work is one in which teams are more distributed than ever before, meaning we need new tools for passive collaboration not just for this year, but for the future, too. Our own internal survey results tell us that while some employees prefer the option to be fully remote once the pandemic is behind us, the majority want a more flexible solution in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crucially, the answer is not to create more meetings or email threads, but instead to reimagine virtual spaces that can function like the classic whiteboard and other serendipitous modes of collaboration. As we all still look for ways to solve this challenge, we at LinkedIn have been thinking about how to encourage cross-team conversations and open Q&amp;As to share resources, as a start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, the tech industry has paved the way for innovations in employee experience, creating spaces and benefits that reduced friction in collaboration and productivity. Now, as we look ahead to a hybrid work world, we must find new ways to continue supporting employee productivity and creativity. It’s only when we’re able to fully realize passive collaboration virtually that we’ll have unlocked the full potential of remote and hybrid work situations.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Roblox began to trade today, the company&#8217;s shares shot above its reference price of $45 per share. Currently, Roblox is trading at $71.10 per share, up just over 60% from the reference price that it announced last night. That effort finally<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> set a directional value of sorts on Roblox&#8217;s shares before it floated on the public markets. </span></p>
<p>Roblox, a gaming company aimed at children and powered by an internal economy and third-party development activity, has had a tumultuous if exciting path to the public markets. The company initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/roblox-files-to-go-public/">intended to list in a traditional IPO</a>, but after enthusiastic market conditions sent the value of some public-offering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">shares higher after they began to trade</a>, Roblox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">hit pause</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Na2Ppmvjrv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">The Roblox Gambit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;The Roblox Gambit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/embed/#?secret=Na2Ppmvjrv" data-secret="Na2Ppmvjrv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The former startup then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">raised a Series H round of capital</a>, a $520 million investment that boosted the value of Roblox from around $4 billion to $29.5 billion. TechCrunch jokes that, far from IPOs mispricing IPOs, that $4 billion price <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/roblox-raises-150m-series-g-led-by-andreessen-horowitz-now-valued-at-4b/">set in early 2020</a> was the real theft, given where the company was valued just a year later. Sure, the pandemic was good for Roblox, but seeing a 5x repricing in four quarters was hilarious.</p>
<p>Regardless. At $45 per share, Roblox&#8217;s direct listing <i>reference</i> price, the company was worth $29.1 billion, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/79113/Robloxs-NYSE-reference-price-is-set-at-$45-ahead-of-direct-listing">per Renaissance Capital</a>, an IPO-focused group. Barron&#8217;s <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-is-roblox-worth-well-know-more-today-51615320241">placed the number</a> at $29.3 billion. No matter which is closer to the truth, they were <em>both</em> right next to the company&#8217;s final private price.</p>
<p>So, the Series H investors nailed the value of Roblox, or the company merely tied its reference price to that price. Either way, we had a pretty clear Series H <em><strong>→</strong></em> direct listing reference price handoff.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s performance today makes that effort appear somewhat meaningless as both prices were wildly under what traders were willing to cough up during its first day of trading; naturally, we&#8217;ll keep tabs on its price as time continues, and one day is not a trend, but seeing Roblox trade so very far above its direct listing reference price <em>and</em> final private valuation appears to undercut the argument that this sort of debut can sort out pricing issues inherent in more traditional IPOs.</p>
<p>To understand the company&#8217;s early trading activity, however, we need to understand just how well Roblox performed in Q4 2020. When we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">last noodled on the company&#8217;s valuation</a>, we only had data through the third quarter of last year. Now we have <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312521075435/d87104d424b4.htm">data through December 31, 2020</a>. Let&#8217;s check how much Roblox grew in that final period, and if it helps explain how the company managed that epic Series H markup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">British electric vehicle subscription service Onto has partnered with Shell to give its users access to charging stations in preparation for a wave of new EVs coming to market over the next several years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership, which Shell announced Tuesday, will give Onto customers access to more than 3,400 Shell Recharge charge points in the UK, plus over 17 charging partners within Shell&#8217;s network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Buying an electric car is a big, scary switch for most drivers,” Onto CEO Rob Jolly told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “Charging anxiety is an issue for them, so we’re trying to make EVs as accessible and affordable as possible, and the Shell partnership is a step up from that.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn&#8217;t Onto&#8217;s first partnership. The company, which is an “all-inclusive” subscription model that covers servicing, road tax, insurance and charging in its monthly fee, has already locked up network partnerships with BP and Tesla. Onto has been expanding its electric fleet beyond its base of Tesla, BMW, Jaguar and Renault vehicles to</span><a href="https://www.electrive.com/2021/02/09/onto-expands-ev-subscription-fleet-once-more/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyundai, which joined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sales of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids climbed to more than 3 million and reached a market share of more than 4%, according to </span>preliminary estimates <a href="https://www.iea.org/commentaries/how-global-electric-car-sales-defied-covid-19-in-2020">from the IEA</a>. While 4% can hardly be considered market saturation, <span style="font-weight: 400;">automakers, charging network companies and energy experts expect existing infrastructure to be squeezed as new electric vehicles come to market. VW, GM, Ford, Hyundai and Rivian are just a few of the automakers that are introducing new electric vehicles in 2021. </span></p>
<h2>A subscription (ev)olution</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the UK, </span><a href="https://uk.motor1.com/news/353737/91-percent-cars-financed-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 90% of new car buyers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finance their vehicles, a transition from a decade ago when the common practice was to buy a car outright. Jolly believes the EV subscription model is going to be the next evolution in the auto market, especially as the UK and other countries move to ban gas and diesel cars and drivers cozy up to the idea of having a flexible, accessible, all-inclusive means of getting into an electric car. Jolly&#8217;s pitch to consumers is that the startup’s EV subscription prices are competitive with premium financing deals, but they don’t include the big upfront deposits or the hassle of having to locate and pay for charging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Forty percent of the UK population doesn’t have access to off road parking,” said Jolly. “They’re going from knowing exactly how and where to refuel to being unsure of how charging works. Will they leave it on a street nearby their house or will they charge it on the way to work, or will they charge it at work? That’s the ambition of working with Shell. It’s making the options available to them and making sure our charging infrastructure footprint is as far and wide as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell’s British network includes more than 950 charge points, including Shell Recharge rapid and high-powered chargers (50 kWh and 150 kWh respectively), which are powered by renewable energy sources, and the Shell Recharge and Ionity network of ultra-high power (350 kWh) charge points. Customers can find all of Onto’s participating charging stations through the company’s app or online map, and all customers have been issued Shell Recharge cards so they have fast access to energy company&#8217;s network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shell’s move to partner with the EV subscription startup is in line with the company’s plans to move away from gas stations and towards charging stations. The energy giant made its first move in this space in 2019 when it</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/with-its-greenlots-acquisition-shell-is-moving-from-gas-stations-to-charging-stations/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired Los Angeles-based EV charging developer Greenlots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Earlier this year, Shell also acquired Ubitricity in the U.K. and announced its</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/planning-500000-charging-points-for-evs-by-2025-shell-becomes-the-latest-company-swept-up-in-ev-charging-boom/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to launch 500,000 new EV charging stations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the next four years. </span></p>

<p>The biggest one, historically, is that Twitter&#8217;s algorithm that decides which part of an image gets the focus was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/twitter-and-zoom-algorithmic-bias-issues/">demonstrated to have baked-in racial bias</a>. The algorithm prioritized white faces over Black ones in its image preview, even<a href="https://twitter.com/bascule/status/1307440596668182528"> cropping out the former president of the United States</a> in one person&#8217;s tests.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s automatic image handling is also a hassle for photographers and artists, who generally prefer to have total control over how an image is presented. If the crop is off, that small misfire can be the difference between a photo attracting a ton of attention or getting ignored outright. It also ruins narrative tweets, as Twitter notes in its example of the tweet about a dog who is conspicuously absent from one of its crops.</p>
<p>It sounds like Twitter is also trying out showing more full images in the timeline. In tweets, Twitter&#8217;s Chief Design Officer Dantley Davis said that anyone testing the new image cropping system will find that most single image tweets in normal aspect ratios won&#8217;t get a crop at all, though super wide or super tall images will get a crop weighted around the center.</p>
<p>For photographers (present company included) tired of toggling between Instagram&#8217;s preference for portrait-oriented images and Twitter&#8217;s insistence on landscape crops, that&#8217;s good news too. As you can see in the sample image, the change could actually make Twitter a richer visual platform. That would likely mean more scrolling past images that take up multiple tweets&#8217; worth of vertical space, but we&#8217;d be happy to trade the time spent clicking through images for a prettier Twitter timeline.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie: </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m an entrepreneur who wants to expand my startup to the U.S. What are the benefits and drawbacks of various types of visas and green cards? </strong></p>
<p><strong>The ones I’ve heard the most about are the H-1B, O-1 and EB-1A.</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Intelligent in India</strong></p>
<p>Dear Intelligent:</p>
<p>I’m happy to hear you’re considering the O-1A extraordinary ability visa and the EB-1A extraordinary green card! Individuals often assume they need to have won a Nobel Prize or some other major award or be well known in their field to qualify for either the O-1A or the EB-1A — and that’s simply not the case.</p>

<p>“Particularly for folks from Asia, being a self-promoter is massively looked down upon. Humility is important,” says <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/navroopsahdev/">Navroop Sahdev</a>, a pioneering economist and blockchain expert <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/061-the-immigration-journey-with-navroop-sahdev/">I recently interviewed for my podcast</a>. Sahdev is founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.thedigitaleconomist.com/">The Digital Economist</a>, a <a href="https://connection.mit.edu/navroop-sahdev">Connection Science Fellow</a> at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a partner at <a href="http://www.nextgenvp.com">NextGen Venture Partners</a>.</p>
<p>She spoke with me about her immigration journey to the United States, which included two <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/what-we-do/h-1b_speciality_occupations/">H-1B</a> visas, an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/o-1a-extraordinary-ability/">O-1A</a> visa and an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A</a> green card.</p>
<p>Here are the pros and cons of each visa and green card that you listed.</p>
<h2>H-1B visa</h2>
<p>Overall, the requirements for the H-1B specialty occupation visa are not as stringent as those for the O-1A visa and the EB-1A green card, which is why many employers sponsor international students who are on an F-1 visa and recently graduated or on OPT (Optional Practical Training) or STEM OPT for an H-1B.</p>
<p>Because demand for the H-1B far exceeds the annual supply of 85,000, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) holds a random lottery to determine who can apply for an H-1B. (That random lottery is slated to switch to a wage-based selection process next year.)<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.arist.co/">Arist</a>, a startup that sells software allowing other organizations to offer SMS-based training to staff, announced that it has extended its seed round to $3.9 million after adding $2 million to its prior raise.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered the company modestly before this seed-extension, noting that it was part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/with-the-crv-backed-liftoff-list-competition-and-prize-student-entrepreneurs-get-rewarded/">the CRV-backed Liftoff List</a>, and reporting on some of its business details when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">took part in a recent Y Combinator demo day</a>.</p>
<p>Something that stood out in our notes on the company when it presented at the accelerator&#8217;s graduation event was its economics, with our piece noting that the startup &#8220;already [has] several big ticket clients and [says it] will soon be profitable.&#8221; <em>Profitable</em> is just not a word TechCrunch hears often when it comes to early-stage, high-growth companies.</p>
<p>So, when the company picked up more capital, we picked up the phone. TechCrunch spoke with the company&#8217;s founding team, including <a href="https://twitter.com/maxrosea?lang=en">Maxine Anderson</a>, the company&#8217;s current COO; <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjlaverty?lang=en">Ryan Laverty</a>, its president; and <a href="https://twitter.com/realioffe?lang=en">Michael Ioffe</a>, its CEO, about its latest round.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KqnyvWNI42"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/">Here are the 98 companies from Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2020 Demo Day 1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Here are the 98 companies from Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2020 Demo Day 1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/here-are-the-98-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-1/embed/#?secret=KqnyvWNI42" data-secret="KqnyvWNI42" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>According to the trio, Arist raised its initial $1.9 million around the time it left Y Combinator, a round that was led by <a href="https://www.craftventures.com/">Craft Ventures</a> at a $15 million valuation. Following that early investment, the company&#8217;s business with large clients performed well, leading to it closing $2 million more last December. The founders said that the new funds were raised at a higher price-point than its previous seed tranche.</p>
<p>The second deal was led by <a href="https://www.globalfounderscapital.com/">Global Founders Capital</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s enterprise adoption makes sense, as all large companies have regular training requirements for their workers; and as anyone who has worked for a megacorp knows, current training, while improved in recent years, is far from perfect. Arist is a bet that lots of corporate training &#8212; and the training that emanates from governments, nonprofits and the like &#8212; can be sliced into small pieces and ingested via text-message.</p>
<p>For that the company charges around $1,000 per month, minimum.</p>
<p>Arist did catch something of a COVID wave, with its founding team telling TechCrunch that pitching its service to large companies got easier after the pandemic hit. Many concerns better realized how busy their staff was when they moved to working from home, the trio explained, and with some folks suffering from limited internet connectivity, text-based training helped pick up slack.</p>
<p>We were also curious about how the startup onboards customers to the somewhat new text-based learning world; is there a steep learning curve to be managed? As it turns out, the startup helps new customers build their first course. And, in response to our question about the expense of that effort, the Arist crew said that they use freelancers for the task, keeping costs low.</p>
<p>Recently Arist has expanded its engineering staff, and plans to scale from around 11 people today to around 30 by the end of the year. And while Anderson, Laverty and Ioffe are based in Boston, they are hiring remotely. The startup serves global customers via a WhatsApp integration. So Arist should be able to scale its staff and customer base around the world effectively from birth. (This is the new normal, we reckon.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ahead? Arist wants to grow its revenues by 5x to 10x by the end of the year, hire, and might share if it wants to raise more capital around the end of the year.</p>
<p>Oh, and it partners with Twilio to some degree, though the group was coy on just what sort of discounts it may receive; the founding team merely noted that they liked the SMS giant and deferred further commentary.</p>
<p>All told, Arist is what we look for in an early-stage startup in terms of growth, vision and potential market scale &#8212; the startup thinks that 80% of training should be via SMS or Slack and Teams, the latter two of which are a hint about its product direction. But Arist feels a bit more mature financially than some of its peers, perhaps due to its price point. Regardless, we&#8217;ll check back in at the mid-point of the year and see how growth is ticking along at the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re putting aside the IPO news cycle this morning to check in on the venture capital world and the fintech market in particular.</p>
<p>As we all know, fintech is booming: Between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">Robinhood</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/">Public</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/m1-finance-raises-another-rapid-fire-round-after-scaling-its-aum-to-more-than-3-5b/">M1 Finance</a> raising competing rounds, payment-tech startup Finix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/fintech-startup-finix-closes-on-3m-in-black-and-latinx-investor-led-spv/">moving to diversify its cap table</a>, and ideas that work in one market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/latam-corporate-spend-management-startup-clara-raises-3-5m-comes-out-of-stealth/">finding purchase and capital in others</a>, it&#8217;s a damn good time to build financial technology.</p>

The preceding period, Q4 2020, for example, saw 30 fintech rounds across the globe that were worth nine figures. But, to date, Q1 2021 is ahead and is thus guaranteed to set a new record, having already bested the preceding all-time high.</p>
<p>This morning we&#8217;re talking big money and fintech, with a splash of early-stage digging. I asked a CB Insights analyst about what appears to be falling fintech seed deal volume. Is this the result of data reporting delays inherent to seed data, the impact of SAFEs and other sorts of notes limiting visibility into the earliest stages of venture, or just a plain-old slowdown? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Big, bigger, small, fewer</h2>
<p>Per the interim CB Insights dataset, there have been some 33 fintech mega-rounds so far in 2021. For context, it&#8217;s more than 50% more such rounds in Q1 2020 and Q1 2019. Via the preliminary report, here&#8217;s the data:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A team of mobile app engineers and designers from companies like Rent the Runway, ClassPass, Kickstarter and others, are now launching their own startup, <a href="https://www.runway.team/">Runway</a>, to address the common pain points they experienced around the mobile app release cycle. With Runway, teams can connect their existing tools to keep track of the progress of an app&#8217;s release, automate many of the manual steps along the way and better facilitate communication among all those involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mobile app releases are exercises in herding cats, we often say. There&#8217;s a lot of moving pieces and a lot of fragmentation across tools,&#8221; explains Runway co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gsavit/">Gabriel Savit</a>, who met his fellow co-founders &#8212; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabel-barrera-48b0941b8/">Isabel Barrera</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-filion-bb050249/">David Filion</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattvarghese/">Matt Varghese</a> &#8212; when they all worked together as the first mobile app team at Rent the Runway.</p>
<p>&#8220;The result is a lot of overhead in terms of time spent and wasted, a lot of back and forth on Slack to make sure things are ready to ship,&#8221; he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Typically, interdisciplinary teams involving engineers, product, marketing, design, QA and more, will keep each other updated on the app&#8217;s progress using things like spreadsheets and other shared documents, in addition to Slack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the actual work taking place to prepare for the release is being managed with a variety of separate tools, like GitHub, JIRA, Trello, Bitrise, CircleCI and others.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123647" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123647" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2123647 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-App-Home.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-App-Home.png 2872w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-App-Home.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-App-Home.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-App-Home.png?resize=768,441 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-App-Home.png?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-App-Home.png?resize=1536,881 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-App-Home.png?resize=2048,1175 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-App-Home.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123647" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Runway</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.runway.team/">Runway</a> is designed to work as an integration layer across all the team&#8217;s tools. Using a simple OAuth authentication flow, the team connects whichever tools they use with Runway, then configure a few settings that allow Runway to understand their unique workflow &#8212; like what their branching strategy is, how they create release branches, how they tag releases and so on.</p>
<p>In other words, teams train Runway to understand how they operate &#8212; they don&#8217;t have to change their own processes or behavior to accommodate Runway.</p>
<p>Once set up, Runway reads the information from the various integration points, interprets it and takes action. Everyone on the team is able to log into Runway via its web interface and see exactly where they are in the release cycle and what still needs to be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re forming this glue, this connective tissue between all of the moving pieces and the tools, and creating a true source of truth that everybody can refer to and sync or gather around. That really facilitates and improves the level of collaboration and getting people on the same page,&#8221; Savit says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123648" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123648" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123648" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-Feature-Readiness.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-Feature-Readiness.png 2872w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-Feature-Readiness.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-Feature-Readiness.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-Feature-Readiness.png?resize=768,441 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-Feature-Readiness.png?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-Feature-Readiness.png?resize=1536,881 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-Feature-Readiness.png?resize=2048,1175 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-Feature-Readiness.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123648" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Runway</p></div></p>
<p>As the work continues, Runway helps to identify problems, like missing JIRA tags, for example. It then automatically backfills those tags. It can also help prevent other mistakes, like when the incorrect build is being selected for submission.</p>
<p>Another automation involves Slack communication. Because Runway understands who&#8217;s responsible for what, it can direct Slack notifications and updates to specific members of the team. This reduces the noise in the Slack channel and ensures that everyone knows what they&#8217;re meant to be working on.</p>
<p>Currently, Runway is focused on all the parts of the mobile app release cycle from kickoff to submission to the actual app store releases. On its near-term roadmap, it plans to expand its integrations to include connections to things like bug reporting and beta testing platforms. Longer term, the company wants to expand its workflow to include launching apps on other platforms, like desktop.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123649" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123649" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123649" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-Kickoff.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-Kickoff.png 2872w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-Kickoff.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-Kickoff.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-Kickoff.png?resize=768,441 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-Kickoff.png?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-Kickoff.png?resize=1536,881 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-Kickoff.png?resize=2048,1175 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-Kickoff.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123649" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Runway</p></div></p>
<p>The startup is currently in pilot testing with a few early customers, including ClassPass, Kickstarter, Capsule and a few others. These customers, though not all yet paying clients, have already used the system in production for over 40 app release cycles.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s pricing will begin at $400 per app per month, which allows for unlimited release managers and unlimited apps, access to all integrations, and iOS and Android support, among other things. Custom pricing will be offered to those who want higher levels of customer support and consulting services.</p>
<p>The startup doesn&#8217;t have an exact ETA to when it will launch publicly as it&#8217;s working to onboard each customer and work closely with them to address their specific integration needs for now. Today, Runway supports integrations with the App Store, Google Play, GitHub, JIRA, Slack, Circle, fastlane, GitLab, Bitrise, Linear, Jenkins and others, but may add more integrations as customers require.</p>
<p>Runway&#8217;s team of four is mostly New York-based and is currently participating in Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2021 virtual program. The company hasn&#8217;t yet raised a seed round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the U.S. reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/microsoft-solarwinds-hack-russia-china.html">readies for retaliation</a> against Russia for hacking into some of the government&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">most sensitive federal networks</a>, the U.S. is facing another old adversary in cyberspace: China.</p>
<p>Microsoft last week revealed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">a new hacking group it calls Hafnium</a>, which operates in, and is backed by, China. Hafnium used four previously unreported vulnerabilities — or zero-days — to break into at least tens of thousands of organizations running vulnerable Microsoft Exchange email servers and steal email mailboxes and address books.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qx76QlryIj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">Microsoft says China-backed hackers are exploiting Exchange zero-days</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Microsoft says China-backed hackers are exploiting Exchange zero-days&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/embed/#?secret=qx76QlryIj" data-secret="qx76QlryIj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear what Hafnium&#8217;s motives are. Some liken the activity to espionage — a nation-state gathering intelligence or industrial secrets from larger corporations and governments.</p>
<p>But what makes this particular hacking campaign so damaging is not only the ease with which the flaws can be exploited, but also how many — and how widespread — the victims are.</p>
<p>Security experts say the hackers automated their attacks by scanning the internet for vulnerable servers, hitting a broad range of targets and industries — law firms and policy think tanks, but also defense contractors and infectious disease researchers. Schools, religious institutions and local governments are among the victims running vulnerable Exchange email servers and caught up by the Hafnium attacks.</p>
<p>While Microsoft has published patches, the U.S. federal cybersecurity advisory agency CISA said the patches only fix the vulnerabilities — and <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/remediating-microsoft-exchange-vulnerabilities">won&#8217;t close any backdoors</a> left behind by the hackers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">CISA is aware of widespread domestic and international exploitation of Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities and urges scanning Exchange Server logs with Microsoft&#39;s IOC detection tool to help determine compromise. <a href="https://t.co/khgCR2LAs0">https://t.co/khgCR2LAs0</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cyber?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Cyber</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cybersecurity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Cybersecurity</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InfoSec?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#InfoSec</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>There is little doubt that larger, well-resourced organizations have a better shot at investigating if their systems were compromised, allowing those victims to prevent further infections, like destructive malware or ransomware.</p>
<p>But that leaves the smaller, rural victims largely on their own to investigate if their networks were breached.</p>
<p>&#8220;The types of victims we have seen are quite diverse, many of whom outsource technical support to local IT providers whose expertise is in deploying and managing IT systems, not responding to cyber threats,&#8221; said Matthew Meltzer, a security analyst at Volexity, a cybersecurity firm that <a href="https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/03/02/active-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities/">helped to identify</a> Hafnium.</p>
<p>Without the budget for cybersecurity, victims can always assume they are compromised — but that doesn&#8217;t equate to knowing what to do next. Patching the flaws is just one part of the recovery effort. Cleaning up after the hackers will be the most challenging part for smaller businesses that may lack the cybersecurity expertise.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a race against the clock to prevent other malicious hackers from discovering or using the same vulnerabilities to spread ransomware or launch destructive attacks. Both <a href="https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1367935292724948992">Red Canary</a> and <a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/rapid-response-mass-exploitation-of-on-prem-exchange-servers">Huntress</a> said they believe hacking groups beyond Hafnium are exploiting the same vulnerabilities. ESET said <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/">at least 10 groups</a> were also exploiting the same server flaws.</p>
<p>Katie Nickels, director of intelligence at threat detection firm Red Canary, said there is &#8220;clearly widespread activity&#8221; exploiting these Exchange server vulnerabilities, but that the number of servers exploited further has been fewer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cleaning up the initial web shells will be much easier for the average IT administrator than it would be to investigate follow-on activity,&#8221; said Nickels.</p>
<p>Microsoft has published guidance on what administrators can do, and CISA has <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-062a">both advice</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow">a tool</a> that helps to search server logs for evidence of a compromise. And in <a href="https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1368275202883411975?s=20">a rare statement</a>, the White House&#8217;s National Security Council warned that patching alone &#8220;is not remediation,&#8221; and urged businesses to &#8220;take immediate measures.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Patching and mitigation is not remediation if the servers have already been compromised. It is essential that any organization with a vulnerable server take immediate measures to determine if they were already targeted. <a href="https://t.co/HYKF2lA7sn">https://t.co/HYKF2lA7sn</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>How that advice trickles down to smaller businesses will be watched carefully.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity expert Runa Sandvik said many victims, including the mom-and-pop shops, may not even know they are affected, and even if they realize they are, they&#8217;ll need step-by-step guidance on what to do next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Defending against a threat like this is one thing, but investigating a potential breach and evicting the actor is a larger challenge,&#8221; said Sandvik. &#8220;Companies have people who can install patches — that’s the first step — but figuring out if you’ve been breached requires time, tools and logs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security experts say Hafnium primarily targets U.S. businesses, but that the attacks are global. Europe&#8217;s banking authority is one of the largest organizations to confirm its Exchange email servers <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56321567">were compromised</a> by the attack.</p>
<p>Norway&#8217;s national security authority said that it has &#8220;already seen exploitation of these vulnerabilities&#8221; in the country and that it would <a href="https://nsm.no/aktuelt/oppdater-microsoft-exchange-snarest">scan for vulnerable servers</a> across Norway&#8217;s internet space to notify their owners. Slovenia&#8217;s cybersecurity response unit, known as SI-CERT, said <a href="https://twitter.com/sicert/status/1369194835891064833">in a tweet</a> that it too had notified potential victims in its internet space.</p>
<p>Sandvik said the U.S. government and private sector could do more to better coordinate the response, given the broad reach into U.S. businesses. CISA proposed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/09/cisa-subpoena-powers-isp-vulnerable-systems/">new powers</a> in 2019 to allow the agency to subpoena internet providers to identify the owners of vulnerable and unpatched systems. The agency just received <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/government-and-defense/cisa-set-to-receive-subpoena-powers-over-isps-in-effort-to-track-critical-infrastructure-vulnerabilities/">those new powers</a> in the government&#8217;s annual defense bill in December.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone needs to own it,&#8221; said Sandvik.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Korean e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.coupang.com/">Coupang</a> is expected to hold one of the biggest tech IPOs of the year on March 11. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/coupang-may-raise-up-to-3-6-billion-in-its-ipo-at-a-potential-valuation-of-51-billion/">disclosed earlier this month</a> that it is seeking up to $3.6 billion at a potential $51 billion valuation on the New York Stock Exchange. Founded in 2010, Coupang is sometimes described as the Amazon of South Korea, but for years it has managed the impressive feat of achieving an even higher dollar retention rate than Amazon, according to a <a href="https://www.goodwatercap.com/thesis/understanding-coupang">report</a> by Goodwater Capital.</p>
<p class="p1">Goodwater’s S-1 teardown of Coupang, released today, is based on a combination of proprietary consumer research and information from Coupang&#8217;s S-1 filing. Before launching Goodwater, co-founder Eric Kim was managing director at Maverick, an early investor in Coupang and served on the company&#8217;s board from 2011 to 2017. Neither he nor Goodwater have holdings in Coupang, however, and are releasing the teardown as third-party research.</p>
<p class="p1">According to the report, Coupang is not only the current market leader in South Korea, but also &#8220;the only player making major market share gains, widening its lead over competitors&#8221; like G Market, 11 Street, Auction, WeMakePrice, Naver Shopping and TMON. In 2020, it increased its market share to 24.6%, up from 18.1% in 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2122751" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Coupang-16-Market-Share-1-1024x614-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122751" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122751" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Coupang-16-Market-Share-1-1024x614-1.png?w=680" alt="Coupang market share" width="680" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Coupang-16-Market-Share-1-1024x614-1.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Coupang-16-Market-Share-1-1024x614-1.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Coupang-16-Market-Share-1-1024x614-1.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Coupang-16-Market-Share-1-1024x614-1.png?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Coupang-16-Market-Share-1-1024x614-1.png?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Coupang-16-Market-Share-1-1024x614-1.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2122751" class="wp-caption-text">Coupang market share. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Goodwater Capital</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">Notably, Goodwater’s research found that shoppers are more likely to return and spend money on Coupang than other e-commerce sites — not just compared to its South Korean competitors, but also other major e-commerce players around the world. Based on dollar retention rate (or the amount of money a group spends each year after they first use a platform), Coupang customers return and spend more money than shoppers on eBay, Etsy, Walmart or Alibaba in the U.S.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Customers are coming back and spending at a rate that easily exceeds those platforms and closely matches the behavior on Amazon,&#8221; the report says. &#8220;But more surprising is that as early as 2017, Coupang’s performance already started to exceed Amazon, with year-three dollar retention of 346% with Amazon at 278%. Later cohorts have already improved on that. The value of these customers are not only best-in-class in Korea, but likely the highest in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p class="p1">This is due in large part to Coupang’s heavy investment in logistics. When the company was founded in 2010, there were no major third-party logistics providers in South Korea comparable to UPS or FedEx in the U.S. Coupang had to build its own infrastructure and now has 100 fulfillment and logistics centers in 30 cities and 15,000 delivery drivers.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result of this aggressive focus, about 70% of South Korea’s population now lives within seven miles of a Coupang logistics center. This means it can offer free next-day delivery, same-day deliveries for items like groceries and its trademark Dawn Delivery (order by midnight for packages that arrive before 7 a.m.) for millions of products. This makes it especially attractive to shoppers in a country where &#8220;the work culture rivals that of the 996 work culture in China,&#8221; the report says.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In order to catch up, Kim told TechCrunch in an email that &#8220;a </span><span class="s2">competitor would need to figure out a way to invest billions into logistical and technical infrastructure to try to compete with Coupang. Even with the necessary resourcing, you&#8217;ll notice that in South Korea, similar to other developed geographies, market leaders tend to build on their leads over time. We&#8217;ve seen this with Kakao, Naver and now Coupang.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">&#8220;The moats from scale are quite strong in a market like South Korea because you&#8217;ve done something right to win over the South Korean consumer,&#8221; he added. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Despite its high market penetration already, Kim said Coupang still has two main areas of growth. These are Rocket Fresh, its fresh grocery delivery business, and Coupang Eats, similar to Uber Eats. &#8220;</span><span class="s2">Both leverage Coupang&#8217;s vast logistics network and Coupang has the largest directly employed delivery fleet in South Korea with over 15,000 directly employed drivers.&#8221;</span></p>

<p class="p6">Coupang was also able to grow quickly thanks to South Korea&#8217;s very high internet penetration rate of 96% and relatively high gross domestic product per capita. In addition, its logistics infrastructure benefits from the country&#8217;s geography.</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s5">&#8220;</span><span class="s3">Coupang&#8217;s model is very unique because of the density of South Korea. You have 50 million+ people in the landmass the size of the state of Indiana, but when you look specifically at just inhabitable land, it&#8217;s really the size of Rhode Island, about 2,700 square kilometers,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;This allows Coupang to innovate on delivery in a way the world has never seen before.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s6">Coupang’s IPO is drawing comparisons to Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, since both are Asian e-commerce giants. But there are also several noteworthy differences between the two companies including &#8220;</span><span class="s2">the amount of capital intensity between the two at the time of the IPO, where Alibaba had a capital-light model that didn&#8217;t require having a lot of infrastructure investment at the time,&#8221; Kim said. &#8220;That shows mainly in the operating margins at the time, where it was 31% for Alibaba versus -4% for Coupang (Coupang was still operating cash flow positive from in 2020 with $302 million).&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3">A major commonality is that both companies became pioneers by focusing on making it easier to buy from their platforms in their respective markets, he added. &#8220;</span><span class="s2">The road to solving for the consumer experience in China was different than the road for solving it in Korea, where the biggest friction points for consumers are different. This led Alibaba to embrace initiatives like digital payments early on, and why Coupang went to solve consumer logistics.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/03/apple-to-invest-over-1-billion-euros-in-germany-with-new-munich-campus/">has announced</a> that it plans to increase its corporate spendings in Germany. In particular, the company wants to set up a new facility in Munich, Germany. Called the European Silicon Design Center, the team will focus on 5G and potentially future wireless technologies.</p>
<p>The company said that Munich is already its largest engineering hub in Europe. There are already 1,500 engineers working there. In particular, Apple has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/apple-could-be-designing-its-own-power-management-chip-as-well/">putting together</a> its own team of engineers working on power management chips.</p>
<p>Overall, half of Apple’s engineers working on power management are located in Germany. Since then, Apple’s teams in the country have expanded beyond power management to work on other chip designs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, Apple plans to invest $1.2 billion (€1 billion) over the next three years on a new building and new R&amp;D investments. While Apple is partnering with Qualcomm for the 5G modems in the iPhone 12 lineup, the company has also acquired most of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/apple-acquiring-most-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business-1b-deal/">Intel’s smartphone modem business</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to in-house chip development, Apple’s teams also work on integrating third-party hardware with its devices, such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The company is also using this announcement to remind everyone that it is investing a lot of money in Germany as a whole. Apple works with many German providers, such as DELO, Infineon and Varta. Overall, Apple has spent $17.8 billion (€15 billion) with 700 German companies over the past five years</p>
<p>Here’s a rendering of the new building in Munich’s Karlstrasse. It should open in late 2022:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of a heated standoff between platforms and publishers in Australia, U.S. lawmakers reintroduced a piece of legislation that would allow the news industry to collectively negotiate content deals with tech companies.</p>
<p>The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act is sponsored in the Senate by Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Kennedy (R-LA) and in the House by David Cicilline (D-RI), Ken Buck (R-NY) and Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA.). The legislation was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2054">first introduced in 2019</a>, but the bipartisan cluster of lawmakers hope to breathe new life into it during the Biden era.</p>
<p>The bill would create an exemption from existing antitrust laws that would allow news organizations to collectively negotiate favorable terms with tech companies like Facebook and Google. That special treatment would open a 48-month window for publishers, in theory boosting their leverage to better the industry as a whole.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The U.S. isn&#8217;t the only country grappling with tech platforms&#8217; publishing dominance. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-restricts-users-in-australia-from-sharing-or-viewing-news-links-in-response-to-proposed-legislation/">Facebook dramatically pulled links to news content in Australia</a> as it pushed back against new regulations that could force tech platforms to pay for more content. Specifically, Facebook objected to a final arbitration clause that would set the price for news automatically if tech platforms and news publishers couldn&#8217;t agree on terms.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Facebook restricts users in Australia from sharing or viewing news links&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-restricts-users-in-australia-from-sharing-or-viewing-news-links-in-response-to-proposed-legislation/embed/#?secret=HCg0i4n4Yw" data-secret="HCg0i4n4Yw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We must enable news organizations to negotiate on a level playing field with the big tech companies if we want to preserve a strong and independent press,&#8221; Sen. Klobuchar said of the bill, which she argues would give publishers a &#8220;fighting chance&#8221; in dealing with tech platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;A strong, diverse, free press is critical for any successful democracy,&#8221; Rep. Cicilline said. &#8220;Access to trustworthy local journalism helps inform the public, hold powerful people accountable and root out corruption.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Cicilline and Klobuchar sit in powerful positions, chairing the House and Senate&#8217;s respective antitrust subcommittees. In the coming months, those committees will play a major role in shaping legislative proposals that could rein in big tech&#8217;s many excesses. Balancing the power of colossal tech platforms against the priorities of a shrinking news industry is just one piece of that puzzle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the tech and venture scene in Latin America has been </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing at an accelerated pace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More global investors are backing startups in the region and certain sectors in particular, such as fintech, are exploding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global investors are not only pouring money into companies. They’re also investing in funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Volpe Capital  announced the $80 million first close of its fund targeting high growth technology investments in Latin America. Notably, Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank, BTG and Banco Inter affiliates are anchor investors in the new fund, which is targeting aggregate commitments of $100 million with a hard cap of $150 million. Volpe also received a &#8220;large anchor investment&#8221; from its management team.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andre Maciel, Gregory Reider and Milena Oliveira are the fund’s founding partners, and are based in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Notably, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maciel is the former managing partner at SoftBank’s $5 billion Latin America-focused innovation fund. He launched Volpe in 2019 primarily with SoftBank’s backing. Reider formerly invested at Warburg Pincus.</span></p>
<p>Maciel said the fund&#8217;s raise was &#8220;significantly oversubscribed with firm commitments&#8221; and believed to be &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">among the best capital raises for a first-time fund in its asset class in Latin America.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volpe Capital plans to invest in about 15 companies over a two and half year time span, according to Maciel, who expects its average check size to be around $5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, it’s backed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uol Edtech, a subsidiary of Grupo Uol that aims to redefine the digital learning experience in Brazil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in no rush,” Maciel told TechCrunch. “We are happy with our first deal and will take capital preservation in consideration. We believe markets are hot now and plan on taking advantage of the cycle by being patient.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund’s strategy is to go after the companies that are not actively raising capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to invest in companies that are not necessarily raising capital when we approach them,” Maciel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund views itself as agnostic regarding stage and primary versus secondary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is seeking to back early-stage companies with less than $50 million in valuation as well as some later stage, high growth companies. The fund’s first investment &#8212; Uol Edtech &#8212; falls in the latter category with EBITDA margins above 30%, according to Maciel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volpe plans to avoid capital intensive industries, even if related to tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those are more suitable to investors with deeper pockets than Volpe,” Maciel said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead it’s eyeing edtech, healthtech, software and fintech investments (that are not credit-related).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We like sectors that are prone for disruption in Latin America and that require local customization,” Maciel said. “Given the stage of the vc/growth industry in Latin America, we believe it is better to be a generalist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank International CEO Marcelo Claure describes Maciel as one of his “amazing founding partners for SoftBank in Latin America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are very happy to be one of Volpe’s anchor investors and look forward to continuing our relationship with them,” he added in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another anchor investor has a SoftBank tie. João Vitor Menin, CEO of Inter, a publicly traded fintech platform in Brazil with a market cap of over  $7 billion, points out that Maciel led an investment in Inter’s platform through SoftBank. He also “made valuable contributions” as a board member, according to Menin.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On January 6, America watched in horror as groups that recruited and organized on major social media sites violently attacked the seat of American democracy. Within a matter of hours, tech companies took actions they’d said we’re out of the question for years.</p>
<p>But real change requires thoughtful policy and a clear-eyed look at the choices that allowed dangerous extremism to thrive in the first place. We spoke with <a href="https://www.adl.org/">Anti-Defamation League</a> CEO Jonathan Greenblatt on proposed policy solutions and tech&#8217;s coming era of accountability at TechCrunch Sessions: Justice 2021.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On how the ADL ramped up its efforts in Silicon Valley:</h3>
<p>Given the rise of online hate, harassment and dangerous misinformation, tech companies are increasingly on the radar for civil rights organizations. It&#8217;s now common to see organizations like the ADL to participate in pressure campaigns aiming to change platforms&#8217; policies and sign onto legislation proposing regulations for the industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So at the ADL, we&#8217;re the oldest anti hate organization in the world. But we deeply believe that today, the frontline and fighting hate is really on Facebook. I mean, there&#8217;s just no question that social media has become a breeding, breeding ground for kind of bigotry, that is offensive and ugly in all respects. Now, we&#8217;ve known this for years. But when I came on board, about five and a half years ago, I really wanted to focus on this, and try to get causal and right to the heart of the problem. So we could finally turn it around. So in 2017, we actually opened an office in Silicon Valley, our Center for Technology and Society, we were the first civil rights group with an actual presence in the valley. And for me, that was sort of second nature, because I had worked in the valley for years before taking this job, you know, both raising money on Sandhill road, managing teams of engineers building products.&#8221; (Timestamp: 0:53)</p></blockquote>

<h3>How algorithms make social media uniquely dangerous:</h3>
<p>Algorithms are what sets social networks apart from more traditional media sources. Rather than seeking it out, the average internet user has extreme ideas served directly to them through algorithms that decide what they see. This is particularly an issue with Facebook and YouTube&#8217;s way of keeping users engaged for as long as possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>Algorithmic amplification has a lot to do with the dilemma that we found ourselves in, and extremists are, if nothing else innovative, they exploit loopholes. And indeed, they have used the kind of libertarian laissez faire attitude of the companies to their own advantage for a number of years. And so from Facebook groups to YouTube channels to kind of accounts on Twitter, let alone all the other platforms, they&#8217;ve used them with tremendous depth, depth. So what&#8217;s interesting is, and many people that I know have seen this, I&#8217;ve seen this myself, you may have to I&#8217;m sure your audience has. It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that you might watch a YouTube video and one click or two clicks over, suddenly find yourself down the rabbit hole of some crazy QAnon or anti vaxxer you know, Boogaloo content. Same thing on Facebook.</p>
<p>When you search a piece of content, suddenly, you&#8217;re served up Facebook groups that may be from accelerationist, or white supremacists, or other racist and anti Semites. But the reality that we&#8217;ve got to confront is that algorithms aren&#8217;t our right, if you will, algorithmic amplification isn&#8217;t a privilege which should be accorded to everyone. It&#8217;s a responsibility that the companies have to make sure that their products give users what they want, but that they&#8217;re also not abused. And that the users themselves are not abused, to seeing the kind of things to which they might be very viable. Robots are susceptible. So we deeply believe that algorithmic amplification is very problematic. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve been supporting legislation on Capitol Hill that will finally address this&#8230; If you could basically turn off the algorithms for some of these worst elements, you could have curbed these issues a long time ago.

<h3>How social media companies failed before the Capitol attack:</h3>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the attack on the Capitol, social media companies suddenly made a number of changed that belied how reluctant they&#8217;d been to address the hate and extremism brewing on their platforms all along.</p>
<blockquote><p>To those of us who&#8217;ve been tracking violent extremists for years. This was not a surprise at all, this was the most predictable terror attack in American history. Literally, these groups told us in advance what they were going to do. And the attack itself was sort of the culmination of years and in the last in the months prior intense campaigning by the President himself, to undermine the integrity of the election, to question the democratic process, to call on individuals to interrupt the certification of the election based on this big lie, this totally contrived idea that somehow the election was rigged. I mean, truly, it was bananas.</p>
<p>&#8230; The tech companies who for years have told us there was a political exemption, and they wouldn&#8217;t necessarily take action when presidents or other politicians said things that were outrageous, and committed slander or incited violence on the platform, suddenly, because of the public pressure from groups like Stop Hate for Profit and the ADL, from internal pressure from their own employees, and I believe, you know, their boards — suddenly they took action instantaneously, overnight. All their other concerns sort of fell by the wayside. I think it was really important that in order Facebook and Twitter and YouTube took down President Trump, that was critical, we called for them to do that. And I&#8217;m really pleased that they did. We called for them previously to take down armed militia groups, to take down QAnon content. And I&#8217;m really glad that they did and it had a huge impact.</p>
<p>You know, we&#8217;ve seen like on Twitter QAnon content drop 97% you know, just days after the attack, because the company actually took action. So I think it really laid bare the myth that somehow, some way the companies couldn&#8217;t do anything about this, clearly they could. And they did. And I think their services and society as a whole is better for it. (Timestamp: 7:53)</p></blockquote>

<h3>On Silicon Valley exceptionalism</h3>
<p>The tech industry doesn&#8217;t think of itself like other traditional sectors of business, instead often casting its own grand pursuits as for the greater good — not just for profits. Those attitudes can contribute to some extraordinary innovations, but they also permeate its products and cultures in ways that create some serious problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think Silicon Valley is almost like, rooted in this American tradition of like, Manifest Destiny, right? conquering the frontier. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s ironic, but altogether appropriate, that&#8217;s happening in California, right in the land where they have the Gold Rush, right again, where people went to make their fortunes. And now they&#8217;re doing it today in Silicon Valley, in tech, and even that&#8217;s continued to evolve, right? It was the internet 15 years ago, five years ago, with social media. Today, it&#8217;s Clubhouse, and I don&#8217;t know what comes next. But I do think that the whole industry does need to undergo a serious self examination.</p>
<p>And I think you&#8217;ve seen people like who&#8217;ve come out of the industry, I think about Chris Sacca, the former Googler, I think about Alexis Ohanian, the Redditor, and a few others start to grapple with these issues. You know, trust, my friend, Tristan Harris, at the Center for Humane Technology has also done this in his film — The Social Dilemma really plays this out. Whereas Silicon Valley often has a very short memory, the reality is that we there will be a long road ahead of us. And if we don&#8217;t wrestle with these demons, and if we don&#8217;t sort again, through the wreckage to what they&#8217;ve wrought, I think the future is very unclear.

<h3>On policy solutions to rein in big tech</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a huge swath of policy proposals on the table that could put some real restrictions on how tech companies operate.  From proposed changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to federal and state antitrust suits, tech companies are on notice in 2021.</p>
<blockquote><p>So look, the ADL, I mean, we&#8217;ve been literally fighting for a more just country, we&#8217;ve been fighting for civil rights, we&#8217;ve been fighting hate for over 100 years. And we are fiercely, ferociously, defenders of the First Amendment. But freedom of speech isn&#8217;t the freedom to slander people, right to freedom of expression isn&#8217;t the freedom to incite violence against individuals or groups of people based on their immutable characteristics? And so I think what we&#8217;ve seen is the first amendment been warped and weaponized online in ways that are, you know, completely beyond the pale of what the founding fathers ever would have, you know, could have imagined.</p>
<p>Section 230 does need to be addressed. And I think that Warner Hirono bill that you pointed out is a step in the right direction, it is definitely not sufficient&#8230; It might actually not be the federal government, but the states that actually pushed the companies to do more, we&#8217;ve seen California, do some innovative stuff on privacy that&#8217;s pushed the companies and you may see, I think more state action.

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down and focus on a single topic, or theme. This is our sweet spot: going beyond definitions and into the dirty and deep impact of how a phenomenon could impact startups and tech. We are hoping to explore more than answer, and debate more than agree.</p>
<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, is this week&#8217;s topic! This is something that you have nearly certainly heard of in the past few weeks but probably don&#8217;t understand with perfect clarity. While we&#8217;ve all seen the Twitter threads of basic definitions, consider this episode the appetizer to your aperitif understanding.</p>
<p>The Equity team put on our research caps, dug in, and found quite a lot to like. But we did not tread alone: our EIC <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer">Matthew Panzarino</a> joined <a href="http://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> to help us out. Panzer was early to the NFT world and has contributed some of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/memes-for-sale/">TechCrunch’s reporting on the matter</a>.</p>
<p>So, what did we get into? More than a little:</p>
<p>We spent a few minutes on the NFT basics, including historical examples and how NFTs are minted, as well as some examples of how they have been used recently.</p>
<p>From there we riffed on use-cases more broadly, and where we might find NFTs in the wild. Sure, we talked about visual art, but also music, tickets and sports moments. The NFT world has the possibility of a large remit if it plays its, <em>ahem</em>, tokens correctly.</p>
<p>Then we talked culture. What could it mean that NFTs are in the market? Could residual incomes from the reselling of NFTs constitute a material revenue base for future artists, and how broad can the value-experiment go? Depending on which side of the NFT hype-cynicism divide you land, there’s plenty of room for discussion. A point made by Panzer:</p>
<blockquote><p>NFT&#8217;s and the architecture of smart contracts and the way that social tokens work, these are all opportunities for the creators and originators of culture, to finally take part and participate in their rewards of the platforms of that culture &#8212; you know, that hosts that culture. Because we&#8217;ve seen it over and over again: Artist blows up on TikTok, and you know, somebody does a dance to them, and then that video blows up. What does the artist get out of it? Sometimes they get a recording deal. Many times they get nothing. Right? In Vine, famously built on Black creators and brown creators and Latino creators and Latino creators. You know, TikTok, very much the same. Black Twitter one of the early driving forces of engagement on Twitter and culture on Twitter &#8212; how many of them were actually able to participate in the economic rewards of Twitter as a platform selling advertising and making millions of dollars and their stock going bonkers? Besides, of course, you know, maybe they were able to purchase stock, right? So the, the remapping of how creators can participate in that economy directly by saying, “Hey, I&#8217;ve created something of value, and I&#8217;d love to connect directly with the people that enjoy that and they can provide me value back” &#8212; that’s what’s so exciting about this.</p></blockquote>
<p>And we chatted just a minute about the <em>weight</em>, or carbon footprint, of different blockchains. There’s real nuance to this point of argument, but it was also something we couldn’t avoid. Panzer again:</p>
<blockquote><p>And this is probably the biggest negative blowback on Ethereum and NFTs is that Ethereum is by nature a very heavy chain, which means that it takes a lot of work to prove that a block has been written to the chain. Not quite as heavy as Bitcoin, but it&#8217;s up there. And that energy usage that was used to mine that Ethereum that&#8217;s being spent on the chain to confirm a new transaction is being sort of credited forwards in&#8211; for lack of a better term to the artists minting on it. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s absolutely fair. But it&#8217;s absolutely fair to acknowledge that it does have an ecological impact.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every week Equity will bring you something special on Wednesdays, adding to our regular Monday (weekly kickoff!) and Friday (news roundup!) shows. The world of tech is large, diverse, and variously dangerous and delightful. We&#8217;re excited to keep talking through it with you.</p>
