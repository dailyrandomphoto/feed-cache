										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/92ba9f93-e0d3-4d54-a806-95b604957711?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann </a>took over this week&#8217;s show with <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace, </a>which meant that our overdeveloped senses of curiosity filled up the script just fine (even on a somewhat short week). Unintentionally, today&#8217;s episode was built around a theme of inclusion &#8211; from auto-insurance to women&#8217;s health, and from payments to knowledge.</p>
<p>But here are some more specifics on what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>For our funding round section, we discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/marshmallow-insurance-85-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK’s Marshmallow getting unicorn status for its </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more inclusive, big-data take on car insurance, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/womens-health-tech-brand-elvie-tops-up-series-c-to-97m/">Women’s health tech brand, Elvie, topping up its Series C to $97M,</a> and an ambitious fintech play from Leap, which wants to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/former-head-of-mint-raises-4-5m-for-lean/"> give gig workers access to financial products</a> by partnering directly to marketplaces. </span></span></li>
<li> After getting past the dollars and the deals, I indulged by bringing up my latest piece: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/edtech-leans-into-the-creator-economy-with-cohort-based-classes/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Edtech leans into the creator economy with cohort-based classes.</a> The core of the story gets into a ton of tensions, the biggest of which I&#8217;d pose as a question to you: should anyone be allowed to be a teacher?</li>
<li>Then we headed into Mary Ann&#8217;s world of fintech to understand what I dubbed feels like national BNPL week. If I may, I&#8217;d argue that this is the can&#8217;t miss segment of the entire show, as we made sense of why it&#8217;s a global phenomenon, which markets are popping off, and what this means for the credit card industry. Below is a smattering of headlines we walked through.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal acquires Japan’s Paidy for $2.7B to crack the buy-now, pay-later market in Asia </span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/zip-acquisition-of-payflex-means-africa-is-ripe-for-bnpl-disruption/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zip acquisition of Payflex means Africa is ripe for BNPL disruption</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/addi-raises-75m-to-advance-buy-now-pay-later-in-latam-nearly-triples-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addi raises $75M to advance ‘buy now, pay later’ in LatAm, nearly triples valuation</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And then we ended by talking about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/a-chinese-ev-startup-wants-to-build-a-ridable-robot-unicorn-for-kids/">an adorable, but potentially dangerous robot unicorn.</a> Yep. You read that right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember when we were all thinking about what &#8216;the new normal&#8217; would look like? Well, I guess it&#8217;s here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.vouch.us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vouch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a provider of business insurance to startups and high-growth companies, announced today it has raised $90 million in new funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $90 million figure was raised across two rounds: a $60 million Series C co-led by SVB Capital (a subsidiary of Silicon Valley Bank) and Ribbit Capital that values the company at $550 million, and a previously unannounced $30 million Series B1 led by Redpoint Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest financing, San Francisco-based Vouch has now raised a total of $160 million since its 2018 inception. Other investors include</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Allegis Group, Sound Ventures and SiriusPoint.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6bp936ZVeJ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/embed/#?secret=6bp936ZVeJ" data-secret="6bp936ZVeJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are many insurance technology companies out there that serve consumers, there are far fewer that offer it to companies, much less startups. Vouch describes itself as “a new kind of insurance platform” for startups that offers fully digital, “tailored coverage that takes minutes to activate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, Vouch has seen impressive growth. The company declined to reveal hard revenue figures, but said it saw “7x” increase in its customer base year over year and currently protects over $5.7 billion in risk across thousands of policies. Today, Vouch has more than 1,600 clients, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">Pipe,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/middesk/">Middesk</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/neighbor-raises-53m-series-b-for-self-storage-marketplace-after-5x-revenue-growth/">Neighbor</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/altman-brothers-lead-b2b-payment-startup-routables-30m-series-b/">Routable</a>. It is also the “preferred” business insurance provider to the customers of Silicon Valley Bank, Brex, Carta and WeWork. Y Combinator too also refers Vouch to its portfolio companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Vouch co-founder and CEO Sam Hodges, the ability to attract some of the highest-profile businesses in the startup world speaks to the company’s understanding of the startup ecosystem. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s our responsibility to meet startup founders where they are, and give startups flexibility as they navigate changing laws, regulations and the virtual and physical locations of their businesses,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other companies, Vouch had to shift its model during the pandemic to adapt to the different types of emerging risks businesses have faced. For example, last year, Vouch saw a change in where its startup clients’ teams were distributed. Before the pandemic, nearly 30% of the teams were remote. During the pandemic, that figure has shifted to over 53%. As a result, Vouch developed a broader range of insurance coverages to adapt to the “new normal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Included in its new line of proprietary products and services aimed at startups are: work from anywhere coverage, broader cyber coverages and embedded insurance. It also expanded its underwriting capabilities to serve early-stage to growth-market startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, the work from anywhere coverage is in direct response to the pandemic-related shift in remote work and can insure up to $500,000 per occurrence and can include a specified property owned by a startup regardless of the location of that property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One major differentiator for Vouch, said Hodges,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it is now the only business insurance provider for startups that has its own insurance carrier, which means the company backs its own policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This capability means we have a lot of control over how we build and underwrite our policies — which translates into superior coverage and a better experience for our clients,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hodges co-founded Vouch with Travis Hedge three years ago after seeing how challenging it could be for a company to get the business insurance it needs to start and then scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to make it as easy as possible to onboard new customers and personalize the coverage as much as possible based on each company’s needs based on what they do, their customer base, stage of growth and the founder’s threshold for risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A typical client can get a quote and bind their coverage online in under 10 minutes, without any phone calls or paperwork,” he told TechCrunch. “Vouch also has many coverage features that are uniquely geared for startups. For example, our directors and officers coverage includes a cap table coverage feature meant specifically to protect startups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vouch looks at startups that need business insurance on a case by case basis, Hodges added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it asks questions like, “Does an e-commerce company handle a very limited amount of client-sensitive information?” If so, it could make sense that it has a lower cyber insurance coverage limit and pay less for its policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if a startup is trying to raise money, it might need to invest more in Vouch’s directors and officers insurance to make sure it is covered should disputes arise in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Hodges said the new capital would go toward continued investment in technical capabilities, an expansion of its product offerings, more hiring and building embedded insurance for its partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With regard to the embedded capabilities, within the next 12 months, all of the company’s partners’ customers will be able to purchase Vouch insurance directly from those partners’ websites. Vouch’s headcount has more than doubled, from 55 employees in September 2020 to 125 full-time employees presently, and Hodges expects that will continue to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Becker, president and CEO of SVB Financial Group, said that Vouch’s mission aligns with SVB’s in that they both aim to “empower the innovation economy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what Vouch is doing today, helping startups and tech innovators mitigate their risks as they grow,” he wrote via email. “We are proud to co-lead Vouch’s latest funding round to give startups access to the insurance they need as they add headcount, increase their customer base, or raise funding rounds of their own.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[MaxRewards is a digital wallet app that manages credit cards and automatically activates benefits like rewards, cashback offers and monthly credits.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Anik Khan graduated from college, his first job was working on credit cards and business expenses at Accenture. There, he found that someone could bring in a couple of thousand dollars just by having the right credit cards and following the rewards and promotions.</p>
<p>It was back in 2017 when he and David Gao got the idea for his company <a href="http://maxrewards.com/">MaxRewards</a>, a digital wallet app that manages credit cards and automatically activates benefits like rewards, cashback offers and monthly credits. It also makes recommendations at the point of purchase on which card would yield the best reward for that purchase.</p>
<p>Going after the some <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2021-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2020-banking-and-credit.htm">83% of Americans that have a credit card</a>, the app version was officially launched in 2019, and now the Atlanta-based company is announcing a $3 million seed round co-led by Dundee Venture Capital and Calano Ventures. Also backing the company are Techstars, Fintech Ventures Fund, Service Provider Capital and Fleetcor president Nick Izquierdo.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1EJaFBLKvf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/">Upgrade launches a credit card with bitcoin rewards</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Upgrade launches a credit card with bitcoin rewards&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/upgrade-launches-a-credit-card-with-bitcoin-rewards/embed/#?secret=1EJaFBLKvf" data-secret="1EJaFBLKvf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Tracking his own credit cards manually prior to MaxRewards, Khan recalled in one year, getting $16,000 in rewards. However, utilizing those benefits was time-consuming and difficult, because the rewards and savings aren’t always made evident by the credit card companies.</p>
<p>“Other companies have tried to do something similar, but the issue is you don’t have the reward information or the offers,” Khan told TechCrunch. “If you were to aggregate this information, you still would have to activate all of these things and use them before they expired.”</p>
<p>Users connect their accounts and when they make a purchase, their location is cross-referenced with the merchant and an algorithm is applied to tell the user which card to use. The average app user has six credit cards.</p>
<p>MaxRewards is free to download and use, and the majority of the app&#8217;s functionalities are free. Users who want additional features, like the auto activation or rewards, can join MaxRewards Gold and are given the opportunity to choose their own monthly price — the average is over $25 per month — based on the value they expect to gain, Khan said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200610" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200610" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200610" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Offers__Benefits.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200610" class="wp-caption-text">MaxRewards offers and benefits. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> MaxRewards</p></div></p>
<p>Ron Watson, partner at Dundee, said his firm invests in seed-stage companies between the coasts and is interested in consumer and e-commerce companies. Watson said he was impressed with what MaxRewards has been able to do with a team of three. He also relates to the company’s mission, having grown up in a lower, middle-class family that did not frequently go on vacations.</p>
<p>When he got his first job and was suddenly flying everywhere, he recalls building up so many rewards to the point where he was able to go on a vacation to Hawaii and only spend maybe $100, he said.</p>
<p>“I used to put my points into a spreadsheet, but as I got older and had kids, I realized how hard it was for the average person to do that and how important it is to have automation,” Watson said. “I downloaded the app, and on the first day, saved $20.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is often compared to NerdWallet or Mint, but in terms of functionality, Khan said he feels MaxRewards is unique due to its credit card system connectors. Rather than rely on third-party aggregators to discover the rewards, MaxRewards leverages its own proprietary connectors to card systems.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of offers to be discovered, and consumers are asking for even more features, so Khan decided it was time to go after seed funding. He had raised a small seed, about $200,000, from his time at Techstars, but the new funding will enable him to add to his team of three people. He expects to be at 20 by the end of the year. Khan also wants to accelerate its user acquisition, product improvement and compliance.</p>
<p>Next up, the company is going to automate rewards and savings across additional platforms like debit cards, payment apps and cashback apps, as well as create browser extensions and a web app. Khan also wants to do more on the education side with regard to using credit cards in a smart manner.</p>
<p>Arron Solano, managing partner at Calano, met Khan through Techstars and said he is an advocate for using credit cards in the right way. His firm was looking for a company like MaxRewards.</p>
<p>“During our first call, I remember telling my partner that Anik was a bulldog who knew what he was talking about, especially at that stage,” Solano added. “He had strong team members, his vision lined up well and that checked off a massive box for us. He energized us and showed he could find a market with insanely high ‘super users.’ ”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amagi provides cloud broadcast and targeted advertising software so that customers can create content that can be created and monetized to be distributed via broadcast TV and streaming TV platforms.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Media technology company <a href="https://www.amagi.com/">Amagi</a> announced Friday $100 million to further develop its cloud-based SaaS technology for broadcast and connected televisions.</p>
<p>Accel, Avataar Ventures and Norwest Venture Partners joined existing investor Premji Invest in the funding round, which included buying out stakes held by Emerald Media and Mayfield Fund. Nadathur Holdings continues as an existing investor. The latest round gives Amagi total funding raised to date of $150 million, Baskar Subramanian, co-founder and CEO of Amagi, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>New Delhi-based Amagi provides cloud broadcast and targeted advertising software so that customers can create content that can be created and monetized to be distributed via broadcast TV and streaming TV platforms like The Roku Channel, Samsung TV Plus and Pluto TV. The company already supports more than 2,000 channels on its platform across over 40 countries.</p>
<p>“Video is a complex technology to manage — there are large files and a lot of computing,” Subramanian said. “What Amagi does is enable a content owner with zero technology knowledge to simplify that complex workflow and scalable infrastructure. We want to make it easy to plug in and start targeting and monetizing advertising.”</p>
<p>As a result, Amagi customers see operational cost savings on average of up to 40% compared to traditional delivery models and their ad impressions grow between five and 10 times.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft acquires video creation and editing software maker Clipchamp&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/microsoft-acquires-video-creation-and-editing-software-maker-clipchamp/embed/#?secret=xdZRzJLgYm" data-secret="xdZRzJLgYm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new funding comes at a time when the company is experiencing rapid growth. For example, Amagi grew 30 times in the United States alone over the past few years, Subramanian said. Amagi commands an audience of over 2 billion people, and the U.S. is its largest market. The company also sees growth potential in both Latin America and Europe.</p>
<p>In addition, in the last year, revenue grew 136%, while new customer year over year growth was 44%, including NBCUniversal — Subramanian said the Tokyo Olympics were run on Amagi’s platform for NBC, USA Today and ABS-CBN.</p>
<p>As more of a shift happens with video content being developed for connected television experiences, which he said is a $50 billion market, the company plans to use the new funding for sales expansion, R&amp;D to invest in the company’s product pipeline and potential M&amp;A opportunities. The company has not made any acquisitions yet, Subramanian added.</p>
<p>In addition to the broadcast operations in New Delhi, Amagi also has an innovation center in Bangalore and offices in New York, Los Angeles and London.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Consumer behavior and infrastructure needs have reached a critical mass and new companies are bringing in the next generation of media, and we are a large part of that growth,” Subramanian said. “Sports will come on quicker, while live news and events are going to be one of the biggest growth areas.”</p>
<p>Shekhar Kirani, partner at Accel, said Amagi is taking a unique approach to enterprise SaaS due to that $50 billion industry shift happening in video content, where he sees half of the spend moving to connected television platforms quickly.</p>
<p>Some of the legacy players like Viacom and NBCUniversal created their own streaming platforms, where Netflix and Amazon have also been leading, but not many SaaS companies are enabling the transition, he said.</p>
<p>When Kirani met Subramanian five years ago, Amagi was already well funded, but Kirani was excited about the platform and wanted to help the company scale. He believes the company has a long tailwind because it is saving people time and enabling new content providers to move faster to get their content distributed.</p>
<p>“Amagi is creating a new category and will grow fast,” Kirani added. “They are already growing and doubling each year with phenomenal SaaS metrics because they are helping content providers to connect to any audience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ten days after Apollo Global <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completed its acquisition of Yahoo</a> (formerly Verizon Media) from Verizon for $5 billion, it has appointed a new CEO for the group. Jim Lanzone, who is currently the CEO of dating app Tinder, is coming on to <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210910005121/en/Jim-Lanzone-to-Join-Yahoo-as-Chief-Executive-Officer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lead the company</a> (which, disclaimer, also owns TechCrunch). Renate Nyborg, who had been running Tinder&#8217;s business in EMEA, is taking on the role of CEO at Tinder.</p>
<p>Guru Gowrappan, who had led the division for three years under Verizon, is stepping down and taking on a role as &#8220;advisor&#8221; to Apollo.</p>
<p>The major changing of the guard had been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/25/verizon-media-leadership-in-doubt-ahead-of-apollo-acquisition-on-sept-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored for weeks</a> leading up to the Apollo sale closing, something that our sources were saying was not inaccurate, so this should not come as a huge surprise.</p>
<p>Lanzone&#8217;s tenure at Tinder was just 14 months, short-lived but perhaps in keeping with an app optimised for speed and casually meeting people? Before that, he spent years running CBS Interactive, among other roles in media and specifically digital media, including dabbling in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/14/tc50-backstage-is-jim-lanzone-a-jerk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founding digital media startups</a>, such as this online video guide that launched at TechCrunch Disrupt many years ago (that company, Clicker, was acquired by CBS, which is how he came eventually to run CBS Interactive). Prior to that he worked at IAC, the company that originally incubated and launched Tinder.</p>
<p>“Jim has a remarkable track record of leading and growing innovative businesses in our industry, and we are thrilled to welcome him on board. With his experience and proven management skills, we are confident Jim is the right leader to steward Yahoo through a transformational new phase that can leverage the best of Yahoo’s platform and performance to reach new heights,” said Yahoo Chairman and Apollo Partner Reed Rayman, in a statement. “We also want to thank Guru for his significant contributions to the company, passing the baton following three consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. We look forward to working with him in his new capacity as an advisor to Apollo.”</p>
<p>Nyborg is young but has a very long track record in tech &#8212; and another disclaimer, she&#8217;s a friend of mine &#8212; which includes time at Headspace, working at Apple across different roles in subscriptions and developer relations, building her own startups and more.</p>
<p>Her connection to Tinder is a professional and personal one.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I swiped right on my husband and it changed my life,&#8221; she said in a statement. &#8220;Being CEO of this company is a truly humbling and extraordinary opportunity; to make that happen for the next generation of singles around the world. The Tinder team is – hands down – the most innovative and inspiring group I&#8217;ve ever worked with. We are building the most fun, inclusive, safest place for singles to connect. And you can see this evolution on our app. We&#8217;re building the technology and raising the bar for the industry along with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two big changes leave a lot of question marks in the air for both companies. For Yahoo, many will be wondering how and if Apollo longer-term plans to try to continue running the organization as a cohesive whole, or whether it will sell it for parts, as is sometimes the tendency with private equity houses. The appointment of Lanzone implies that there could be a bigger view to building the business into a more profitable operation as-is with a media and content face at the front of it. Or at least tighten it up to make it more attractive to other digital media conglomerates.</p>
<p>For Tinder, appointing a woman to the top job is a major move to give the app a more human face after years of controversy behind it and one of its co-founders, Whitney Wolfe-Herd, who eventually left and built Bumble &#8212; a more female-friendly dating app &#8212; to take Tinder head-on.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The uproar that arose after Dolly Parton <a href="https://timesofe.com/friday-roundup-side-hustle-collision-open-season-on-the-vaccine-and-future-of-digital-banking/">rewrote the lyrics to &#8220;9 to 5&#8221;</a> for a Squarespace Super Bowl commercial revealed a problem with the English language: A worker is no longer a worker.</p>
<p>As she sang in celebration of entrepreneurs:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Working 5 to 9<br />
you’ve got passion and a vision<br />
&#8216;Cause it’s hustlin’ time<br />
a whole new way to makе a livin’<br />
Gonna change your life<br />
do something that givеs it meaning…”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Some criticized it, saying it celebrated an “empty promise” of capitalism, as if people aiming to establish their own businesses were “workers” who needed to be protected from powerful corporations. Others grasped that there is more nuance in our economy than ever before and that, perhaps, Parton was on to something.</p>
<p>In fact, her updated lyrics represent a shift in the primacy between capital and labor in the 40 years since she penned the original. Gone is the idea that getting ahead is only a “rich man’s game… puttin’ money in his wallet.” Workers today have a different potential than they did in 1980 when she first sang:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;There’s a better life<br />
And you think about it, don&#8217;t you?<br />
It&#8217;s a rich man&#8217;s game<br />
No matter what they call it,<br />
And you spend your life<br />
Puttin&#8217; money in his wallet.”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>There are abusive corporations, and we do need a better social safety net so that people aren’t at the mercy of the doctrine of shareholder primacy, but that truth disguises a more complicated reality. The divide between capital and labor increasingly looks like an anachronism, a throwback to the language and illusory simplicity of another time. Yet still, the media persists in pushing this false dichotomy; this mistaken idea that labor and capital are two separate and oppositional forces in our economy. Perhaps doing so is human nature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Or perhaps it simply sells more newspapers or generates more clicks. The media certainly thrives on conflict (real or imaginary) and, along with human nature to try to group things into black and white, the continued framing of our economy as somehow consisting of individual actors who exist solely on one side of the capital/labor line makes for easier narratives.</p>
<p>The truth of this aspect of our economy, as with most things, exists in the gray areas. In the nuance and the movement between groups. The U.S. economy has always been uniquely entrepreneurial, from the discovery of the “new land” to the formation of our government to the expansion of our country and eventually its industrialization. Entrepreneurs have long led the way. Today, nearly 60 million people are entrepreneurial in some way.</p>
<p>The vast majority inhabit the frontlines of the economy. They are freelancers or the late-night business starters that Parton sang about. They are freelancing on the side to earn money to support some other dream, or are stitching together lives for themselves by being their own boss. They’re driving Ubers, delivering meals for GrubHub and selling their crafts on Etsy. Never have more people had more access to expand their horizons through pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams than right now. And they exist in the world of technology, where a single person at a kitchen table has the same power to bring an innovation to market as giant corporations did four decades ago.</p>
<p>Victor Hwang, CEO of Right to Start and a former vice president of entrepreneurship for the Kauffman Foundation, described the capital-versus-labor debate as “the biggest false narrative out there. It’s an artificial narrative that we’ve created: employer versus employee; big versus small; corporation versus worker. All are false narratives and contribute to the incorrect notion that the most important fight in our economy exists between these supposedly oppositional forces.”</p>
<p>But our economic and government funding debates are framed, often by the media, around the idea of capitalism versus socialism, corporations versus workers. That increasingly divisive conversation has some of the hallmarks of a deliberately engineered division, like the ones over climate change or gun rights. Right-wing groups with an interest in freezing the government into inaction figured out how to divide the country into two groups and get them fighting.</p>
<p>Why don’t we have universal health care, parental leave, working infrastructure — all things that would, not incidentally, boost entrepreneurship and small business? We’ve been too busy fighting about a socialist takeover and the evils of capitalism.</p>
<p>The conflict thrives in part because we don’t have the right language to describe what’s happening now: “These debates should be viewed as part of a larger discussion,” Hwang said. “We should be striving to encourage highly innovative people and companies. What are the categories we need to develop? How do you classify someone’s role in the economy?”</p>
<p>What we need as an economy is a system that empowers more people to be producers and entrepreneurs. To solve problems and look for opportunities to create change in their communities. Instead, we’ve built a system that supports incumbents; that thrives on the status quo; that stifles innovation and uses the tactics of division to do so. It’s a tension that stems from our neoliberal worldview that achieved an almost consensus in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>
<p>Beyond just arguing that free markets and open trade make it easier and better to do business (which we generally agree with), it also implied that the only thing that mattered in our economy was making big companies bigger (while, perhaps, allowing for the occasional upstart &#8212; but only those that had the potential to grow quickly and become big companies themselves). Lost was the value of smaller businesses, operating in the in-between spaces in our economy. We don’t even effectively measure their impact.</p>
<p>Wanting to know how the “economy” is doing, we look no further than the fate of the 500 largest publicly traded companies (the S&amp;P 500) or the 30 massive businesses that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average. No wonder people across Main Streets are scratching their heads as pundits describe the economy as thriving by citing the continued rise of the Dow when they can see the millions of small businesses closing all around them.</p>
<p>In our book, &#8220;<a href="https://thenewbuilders.com/"><u>The New Builders</u></a>&#8220;, we describe entrepreneurs as “builders.” Builder is a word with Old English roots in the ideas “to be, exist, grow,” according to the Online Dictionary of Etymology. In a century where change is the lingua franca, builders own the value of their own labor as a mechanism to build independence and, eventually, capital.</p>
<p>We often forget that the majority of these builders &#8212; the small business owners of America &#8212; create opportunities with the most limited resources. According to the Kauffman Foundation, 83% of businesses are formed without the help of either bank financing or venture capital. Yet small businesses are responsible for nearly 40% of U.S. GDP and nearly half of employment. Perhaps that’s why International Economy publisher David Smick termed them “the great equalizer” in his book of the same name.</p>
<p>Technology has fundamentally changed the landscape for businesses of all sizes and has the potential to enable a resurgence of our small business economy. Rather than pushing a false narrative that individuals need to choose between being a part of the labor or capital economies, we should be encouraging fluidity between the two. The more capital ownership we encourage &#8212; through savings, investment in their own businesses, and by allowing more and more people to become investors of all kinds &#8212; the more we drive wealth creation and open economic activity for generations to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like to buy things online ranging from e-commerce stores to subscription-based sites. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, no one enjoys the hassle when you have to always re-log into different sites and stores. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, shopping can be a whole lot more fun if a fast logging and checkout system existed across all your favorite online stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S., high-flying startup Fast already caters to this need. Although the company is building a global product, it is limited in Africa, and <a href="https://www.ourpass.co/">OurPass</a> has taken an interest to build one for the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nigeria-based startup, which describes itself as the &#8220;Fast for Africa&#8221;, has also closed a $1 million pre-seed round to scale across the country. The round was led by Tekedia Capital and angel investors from Fortune 500 companies, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce checkout problem is one founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-chukwunonso-eze-4279a1107">Samuel Eze</a> is familiar with, but through a second-hand experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I watched my mother struggle to shop online where I saw her set up </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accounts on different platforms while going through a rigorous checkout process,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she ended up dropping the card and moving on to a different online store. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the same pattern happen with other friends and family, I had to dive into it and found that it was actually a major headache for consumers and online retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria&#8217;s e-commerce market is still </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reliant on cash on delivery. In fact, as of 2019, 70% of Nigerians <a href="https://techeconomy.ng/2018/03/ecommerce-report-shows-70-of-nigerians-prefer-cash-on-delivery/">in a survey</a> said they prefer cash on delivery options to making online payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the narrative is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">slowly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> changing with the likes of Paystack and Flutterwave, making it easier for merchants to collect online payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1172940/distribution-of-online-payment-methods-in-nigeria/">Statista</a>, 27% of online payments made on e-commerce sites a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">re now carried</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out with cards, topping cash and bank transfers as the most common payment method</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heckout still remains a major issue for merchants. Yearly, about 75% of shopping carts </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are abandoned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to how cumbersome the checkout experience can be with long forms and re-log ins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempting to tackle this challenge, OurPass provides a mobile application that enables consumers to shop with one click. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first time consumers sign up on the OurPass platform, they enter their names, email and shipping addresses. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OurPass then creates an identity for each customer, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is passed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across every online store they shop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We built an identity layer across the web to enable consumer identity to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be sent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across to every single online store they go to check out from,&#8221; said Eze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, OurPass customers would not need to fill out any form anymore and do not have to deal with re-logging issues. But here&#8217;s the thing: they can only shop with merchants that have OurPass API linked to their platforms. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&#8217;s a big ask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why has OurPass decided to go this route of creating its own ecosystem of merchants and consumers? For instance, in Fast&#8217;s case</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only the merchants need to install Fast Checkout, while users can access the service via an e-commerce or merchant&#8217;s website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But for OurPass, users need to download an application and shop with merchants using the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> OurPass allowed users to fill in their payment card details when completing their forms for the first time without the need to download an application</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after several instances of payment gateways flagging many cards used by OurPass consumers and failed card transactions, the company chose to adopt a wallet strategy and created an application for consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We did not want to defeat our USP of one-click checkout by allowing consumers to try to check out in one-click only for them to see their cards flagged as fraudulent,&#8221; Eze said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;Hence the reason why we had to build our system on a wallet system to enable that one-click checkout.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means consumers and merchants </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are assigned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> virtual account numbers to be used in a wallet. For consumers to check out from a store, they&#8217;ll need to fund their wallets, and once they check out, the money moves into the merchants&#8217; wallets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eze says this helps OurPass capture value end to end and offers instant settlement of payments which, according to him, was not the case with payment gateways</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OurPass has gathered a few merchants on its platform. Most of its clients are small businesses that use <a href="http://storemia.ourpass.co/">Storemia</a>, an online storefront provider OurPass acquired recently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to work with merchants on e-commerce platforms, including WooCommerce, Magento, Squarespace and Shopify in the future and social commerce platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside its one-click checkout, OurPass also offers free delivery on all orders for customers. The company partnered with logistics companies like MAX.ng and Gokada to execute on this front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-year-old company charges 0.8% per transaction, capped at N1,000 (~$20) for merchants and a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commission of 5% on every product sold — Eze also hints at a plan for the company to introduce subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since beta launching in May this year, OurPass claims to have done $500,000 in transaction value and hopes continuous growth will see it become the go-to platform for consumer checkout in Nigeria by 2023</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per use of funds, Eze says OurPass will develop its technology and grow its team to up to 200 people before the end of next year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Music announced today that it&#8217;s created a process to properly identify and compensate all of the individual creators involved in making a DJ mix. Using technology from the audio-recognition app Shazam, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/24/apple-closes-its-shazam-acquisition-and-says-the-music-recognition-app-will-soon-become-ad-free/">Apple acquired in 2018 for $400 million</a>, Apple Music is working with major and independent labels to devise a fair way to divide streaming royalties among DJs, labels, and artists who appear in the mixes. This is intended to help DJ mixes retain long-term monetary value for all creators involved, making sure that musicians get paid for their work even when other artists iterate on it. And, as one of Apple&#8217;s first major integrations of Shazam&#8217;s technology, it appears that the company saw value in</p>
<p>Historically, it&#8217;s been difficult for DJs to stream mixes online, since live streaming platforms like YouTube or Twitch might flag the use of other artists&#8217; songs as copyright infringement. Artists are entitled to royalties when their song is played by a DJ during a live set, but dance music further complicates this, since small samples from various songs can be edited and mixed together into something unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Apple Music already hosts <a href="https://music.apple.com/curator/apple-music-dj-mixes-live-sets/1441811365">thousands of mixes</a>, including sets from Tomorrowland&#8217;s digital festivals from 2020 and 2021, but only now is it formally announcing the tech that enables it to do this, even though <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9581667/apple-music-clearing-dj-sets-twitch-track/">Billboard noted it in June</a>. As part of this announcement, Studio K7!&#8217;s DJ Kicks archive of mixes will begin to roll out on the service, giving fans access to mixes that haven&#8217;t been on the market in over 15 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple Music is the first platform that offers continuous mixes where there’s a fair fee involved for the artists whose tracks are included in the mixes and for the artist making those mixes. It’s a step in the right direction where everyone gets treated fairly,&#8221; DJ Charlotte de Witte said in a statement on behalf of Apple. &#8220;I’m beyond excited to have the chance to provide online mixes again.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200588" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200588" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200588" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/applemusic.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="665" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/applemusic.jpg 1967w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/applemusic.jpg?resize=150,147 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/applemusic.jpg?resize=300,294 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/applemusic.jpg?resize=768,752 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/applemusic.jpg?resize=680,665 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/applemusic.jpg?resize=1536,1503 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/applemusic.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/applemusic.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/applemusic.jpg?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200588" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple Music</p></div></p>
<p>For dance music fans, the ability to stream DJ mixes is groundbreaking, and it can help Apple Music compete with Spotify, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/podcasts-focus-spotify-user-growth/">leads the industry</a> in paid subscribers as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/">surpasses Apple&#8217;s hold on podcasting</a>. Even as Apple Music has introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/">lossless audio, spatial audio</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/apple-buys-classical-music-service-primephonic/">classical music</a> acquisitions, the company hasn&#8217;t yet outpaced Spotify, though the addition of DJ mixes adds yet another unique music feature.</p>
<p>Still, Apple Music&#8217;s dive into the DJ royalties conundrum doesn&#8217;t necessarily address the broader crises at play among live musicians and DJs surviving through a pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though platforms like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/04/mixcloud-select/">Mixcloud</a> allow DJs to stream sets and monetize using pre-licensed music, Apple Music&#8217;s DJ mixes will not include user-generated content. MIDiA Research, in partnership with Audible Magic, found that user-generated content (UGC) &#8212; online content that uses music, whether it&#8217;s a lipsync TikTok or a Soundcloud DJ mix &#8212; could be a music industry goldmine worth <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/ugc-is-the-next-music-industry-growth-driver-and-the-short-term-opportunity-is-worth-6-billion">over $6 billion</a> in the next two years. But Apple is not yet investing in UGC, as individuals cannot yet upload their personal mixes to stream on the platform like they might on Soundcloud. According to a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9581667/apple-music-clearing-dj-sets-twitch-track/">Billboard report</a> from June, Apple Music will only host mixes after the streamer has identified 70% of the combined tracks.</p>
<p>Apple Music didn&#8217;t respond to questions about how exactly royalties will be divided, but this is only a small step in reimagining how musicians will make a living in a digital landscape.</p>
<p>While these innovations help get artists compensated, streaming royalties only account for a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-do-musicians-make-money-2018-10">small percentage</a> of how musicians make money &#8212; Apple pays musicians <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-reveals-how-much-it-pays-when-you-stream-a-song-11618579800">one cent per stream</a>, while competitors like Spotify pay only fractions of cents. This led the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers (UMAW) to launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/justice-at-spotify-demands-better-compensation-and-increased-transparency-for-musicians/">a campaign</a> in March called <a href="https://www.unionofmusicians.org/justice-at-spotify">Justice at Spotify</a>, which demands a one-cent-per-stream payout that matches Apple&#8217;s. But live events remain a musician&#8217;s bread and butter, especially given platforms&#8217; paltry streaming payouts &#8212; of course, the pandemic hasn&#8217;t been conducive to touring. To add insult to injury, the Association for Electronic Music estimated in 2016 that dance music producers missed out on <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/9332838/music-recognition-technology-royalties-dj-producers-2020-dance-issue/">$120 million in royalties</a> from their work being used without attribution in live performances.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games has asked Apple to rejoin its Fortnite developer account in South Korea as the U.S. game maker plans to re-release Fortnite on iOS in South Korea, offering both Epic and Apple payments side-by-side, it <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1436105346184056832">said in a tweet.</a></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Epic has asked Apple to restore our Fortnite developer account. Epic intends to re-release Fortnite on iOS in Korea offering both Epic payment and Apple payment side-by-side in compliance with the new Korean law.</p>
<p>— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1436105346184056832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This request comes after South Korea passed a bill, the updated Telecommunications Business Act, in late August that will force Apple and other tech giants to let developers use their third-party payment systems.</p>
<p>“Epic intends to re-release Fortnite on iOS in Korea offering both Epic payment and Apple payment side-by-side in compliance with the new Korea law,” according to the official Fortnite Twitter account.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we’ve said all along, we would welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else. Epic has admitted to breach of contract and as of now, there’s no legitimate basis for the reinstatement of their developer account,&#8221; Apple said in its statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Epic would also have to agree to comply with Apple&#8217;s App Store Review Guidelines regarding all apps, but Epic has not consistently abided by the Guidelines, and their request of Apple does not indicate any change in Epic&#8217;s position, added Apple&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>Even if the South Korean legislation, which is not yet effective, were to become law in the country, it would impose no obligation on Apple to approve any developer program account application, based on Apple&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>In August 2020, Apple kicked Fortnite off the App Store after Epic introduced a direct payment system in Fortnite that violated Apple’s in-app purchase requirement. The two companies have been embroiled in a legal dispute over the Apple Store’s payment system.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">Apple is changing its app policy to allow developers to link to external websites</a> and it also has reached a settlement with Japan for allowing developers of “reader” apps to link to their own websites.</p>
<p>An Epic Games spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food ordering and delivery platforms DoorDash, Caviar, Grubhub, Seamless, Postmates and Uber Eats have banded together to sue the City of New York over a law that would permanently limit the amount of commissions the apps can charge restaurants to use their services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grubhub-doordash-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-over-fee-caps-11631237227">The Wall Street Journal</a> first reported the news that the companies filed suit in federal court on Thursday evening and are seeking an injunction that would prevent the city from enforcing the legislation, unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial.</p>
<p>Last year, the city council introduced temporary legislation that would prohibit third-party food delivery services from charging restaurants more than 15 percent per delivery order and more than 5 percent for marketing and other nondelivery fees in an effort to help ease the strain on an industry struggling from pandemic lockdowns. The companies filing suit against the city claim the limit on fees, which was made  permanent last month under <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/permanent-cap-on-delivery-app-fees-proposed-for-new-york-city-11624549165?mod=article_inline">a bill sponsored in June by Queens Councilman Francisco Moya</a>, has already cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, third-party platforms like Plaintiffs have been instrumental in keeping restaurants afloat and food industry workers employed, including by investing millions of dollars in COVID-relief efforts specifically for local restaurants,&#8221; the lawsuit reads. &#8220;Yet, the City of New York has taken the extraordinary measure of imposing permanent price controls on a private and highly competitive industry—the facilitation of food ordering and delivery through third-party platforms. Those permanent price controls will harm not only Plaintiffs, but also the revitalization of the very local restaurants that the City claims to serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other cities also instituted similar caps during the pandemic, but most have fizzled out as the pandemic has eased and restaurants have been able to open their dining rooms. San Francisco is among of handful of cities that has also decided to enact a permanent 15 percent cap, and the app-based companies are suing there, as well. They argue that extending the limits on fees, which can be as high as 30 percent per order, &#8220;bears no relationship to any public-health emergency,&#8221; and are unconstitutional because they interfere with negotiated contracts and dictate &#8220;the economic terms on which a dynamic industry operates.&#8221;</p>
<p>As with the temporary law, any violators of the permanent cap would face up to $1,000 per day in fines per restaurant. The companies said the new law would not only cause them to have to rewrite their contracts with restaurants, but also raise fees for consumers and hurt delivery workers&#8217; ability to make money.</p>
<p>The companies also argue that if the city wants to improve profitability of local restaurants, it could provide tax breaks or grants out of its own pocket instead of hurting the commissions of the delivery services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;But rather than exercise one of those lawful options, the City chose instead to adopt an irrational law, driven by naked animosity towards third-party platforms,&#8221; the companies said, citing a tweet from Moya after he introduced a 10 percent commission cap bill that said, &#8220;NYC local restaurants needed a 10 percent cap on delivery fees from third party services like GrubHub long before #COVID19 hit us. They damn sure need it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>This legislation also comes amid increasing scrutiny over app-based delivery companies that have a reputation for harming both restaurants and gig workers in an effort to keep costs low for consumers. Recently, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/">California superior court ruled Proposition 22</a>, which would allow these companies to continue classifying its workers as independent contractors, rather than employees, as unconstitutional. This ruling prompted DoorDash workers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe/">protest last week outside the home of CEO Tony Xu</a> demanding better pay and more tip  transparency. Meanwhile in Massachusetts, a similar law to Prop 22 has just gotten the green light to go ahead on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/massachussetts-ag-greenlights-uber-lyft-backed-gig-worker-ballot-initiative/">November 2022 ballot</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Restaurants pay app-based delivery companies for a variety of services through commissions, one of these being delivery services,&#8221; said an unnamed courier in the lawsuit against the city. &#8220;Capping these commissions means less earnings for people like me. A commission cap could also mean delivery services get more expensive for the customers I deliver to, which ultimately means less orders for me.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://snyk.io">Snyk</a>, the Boston-based late-stage startup that is trying to help developers deliver more secure code, announced another mega-round today. This one was for $530 million on an $8.5 billion valuation, with $300 million in new money and $230 million in secondary funding, the latter of which is to help employees and early investors cash in some of their stock options. The $8.5 billion valuation was up from $4.7 billion in March when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/snyk-raises-300-million-at-a-4-7-billion-valuation-as-employees-cash-in-and-the-security-company-beefs-up/">the company raised $300 million</a>.</p>
<p>The long list of investors includes an interesting mix of public investors, VC firms and strategics. Sands Capital and Tiger Global led the round, with participation from new investors Baillie Gifford, Koch Strategic Platforms, Lone Pine Capital, T. Rowe Price and Whale Rock Capital Management. Existing investors also came along for the ride, including Accel, Addition, Alkeon, Atlassian Ventures, BlackRock, Boldstart Ventures, Canaan Partners, Coatue, Franklin Templeton, Geodesic Capital, Salesforce Ventures and Temasek.</p>
<p>This round brings the total raised in funding to $775 million, excluding secondary rounds, according to the company. With secondary rounds, it&#8217;s up to $1.3 billion, according to Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/snyk">data</a>. The company has been raising funds at a rapid clip (note that the last three rounds include the Snyk money plus secondary rounds):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2200722" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="Snyk's last four rounds" width="680" height="176" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg 1250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?resize=150,39 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?resize=300,78 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?resize=768,199 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?resize=680,176 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-09-at-10.25.31-PM.jpg?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>While the company wouldn&#8217;t share specific revenue figures, it did say that ARR has grown 158% YoY; given the confidence of this list of investors and the valuation, it would suggest the company is making decent money.</p>
<p>Snyk CEO Peter McKay says that the additional money gives him flexibility to make some acquisitions if the right opportunity comes along, what companies often refer to as &#8220;inorganic&#8221; growth. &#8220;We do believe that a portion of this money will be for inorganic expansion. We&#8217;ve made three acquisitions at this point and all three have been very, very successful for us. So it&#8217;s definitely a muscle that we&#8217;ve been developing,&#8221; McKay told me.</p>
<p>The company started this year with 400 people and McKay says they expect to double that number by the end of this year. He says that when it comes to diversity, the work is never really done, but it&#8217;s something he is working hard at.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been able to build a lot of good programs around the world to increase that diversity and our culture has always been inclusive by nature because we&#8217;re highly distributed.&#8221; He added, &#8220;I&#8217;m not by any means saying we&#8217;re even remotely close to where we want to be. So I want to make that clear. There&#8217;s a lot we still have to do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>McKay says that today&#8217;s investment gives him added flexibility to decide when to take the company public because whenever that happens it won&#8217;t have to be because they need another fundraising event. &#8220;This raise has allowed us to set up with strong, highly reputable public investors, and it gives us the financial resources to pick the timing. We are in control of when we do it and we will do it when it&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has reportedly appointed a new executive to lead the development of its secretive self-driving car division. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-09/apple-s-watch-software-chief-takes-over-self-driving-car-project?sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company has tapped Kevin Lynch to oversee Project Titan following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-hires-doug-field-204511159.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1"><ins>departure of executive Doug Field</ins></a>, who left the iPhone maker for Ford earlier this week.</p>
<p>The name may not be familiar, but if you’ve watched any Apple event in recent years, you’ve seen Lynch on stage. After a stint at Adobe, he joined Apple in 2013 to oversee the company’s wearable and health unit and has frequently been the one to present whatever new features Apple is working on for watchOS.</p>
<p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports Lynch joined the division earlier in the year but is now overseeing the entire unit. The outlet notes Lynch’s appointment suggests Apple is likely focusing on underlying software that a self-driving car would need to navigate the road, instead of a vehicle that we could see the company release anytime soon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hi friends!</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/grg">Greg</a> here again for this edition of the Daily Crunch on Thursday, September 9, 2021. <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a> is still out on vacation for a few more days … even though he&#8217;s still tweeting a lot, which leads me to think he&#8217;s either bad at vacation or dislikes Twitter less than I do. Whatever the case, I&#8217;ll keep that daily recap goodness flowing to give you a glimpse into the biggest stories to cross our front page.</p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebook-debuts-its-ray-ban-stories-smart-sunglasses/"><strong>Facebook&#8217;s smart Ray-Bans:</strong></a> Five years after Snap shipped its Spectacle sunglasses, Facebook is taking a swing at the concept. But you won&#8217;t find the Facebook logo anywhere on these things (presumably because nobody on the planet wants the Facebook logo on their face). Built in partnership with Ray-Ban&#8217;s parent company, they look just like a classic pair of Wayfarers with an added bit of heft … and cameras. A white LED lights up when you&#8217;re shooting photos or videos, and near-ear speakers pipe in your tunes and phone calls. You can&#8217;t get them wet, which is great because no one wears sunglasses around places with water, like pools or beaches. Lucas Matney <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/facebooks-first-smart-glasses-make-the-case-for-face-worn-wearables/">reviewed them here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/the-newest-roomba-gets-smarter-as-it-vacuums/"><strong>Roomba gets smarter:</strong></a> New Roomba incoming! The big new feature? It&#8217;ll try to detect and avoid poop your pets might have left in its path. Past models would just blast right through that mess and drag it around, leaving owners quite the horror show to come home to.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/notion-acquires-indias-automate-io-in-push-to-accelerate-product-expansion/">Notion acquires Automate.io:</a></strong> Notion is buying Automate.io, a startup out of India that lets you easily hook into services like Mailchimp or Gmail or Salesforce (or Notion!) and create complex automated workflows. &#8220;It&#8217;s a sizable acquisition,&#8221; Notion&#8217;s COO said without disclosing exactly how much it spent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/solar-powered-aircraft-developer-skydweller-aero-adds-8m-to-series-a-partners-with-palantir/">Skydweller Aero raises $8M for solar-powered planes:</a></strong> &#8220;Airplanes and drones today, regardless of size or fuel type, all face the same limitation: eventually they have to land.&#8221; writes Aria Alamalhodaei. &#8220;Skydweller Aero, the U.S.-Spanish aerospace startup, wants to break free from that constraint … &#8220;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/varo-bank-raises-510m-at-a-2-5b-valuation/">The $510M Series E:</a></strong> Varo Bank just won&#8217;t stop raising money. In June 2020, it raised $241 million, tacking on another $63 million in February 2021 because why not. Now it&#8217;s raised a staggering $510 million in a Series E round that values the company at $2.5 billion. “We didn’t set out to raise this much money. It was coming in fast and furious and we were at like $510 [million] and I finally said, ‘OK, enough,’” says Varo CEO Colin Walsh in a statement we can all totally relate to. Right? Anyone?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/affinity-a-relationship-intelligence-company-raises-80m-to-help-close-deals/">Affinity raises $80M to use machine learning to close deals:</a></strong> Who in your organization is best suited to close that deal? Can machine learning algorithms chew through your company&#8217;s data (past email interactions, calendar availability, etc.) and recommend the right person? That&#8217;s part of what Affinity is working on, and they&#8217;ve raised another $80 million to keep the ball moving and the company growing. Affinity currently has 125 employees, with plans to balloon to over 200 in the next year.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Anatomy of a SPAC: Inside Better.com’s ambitious plans</h2>
<p>Online mortgage company Better.com isn&#8217;t waiting to complete its SPAC merger before making big moves: Today, Ryan Lawler reported that it purchased Property Partners, a U.K.-based startup that offers fractional property ownership.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second company Better bought in recent months: In July, it snapped up digital mortgage brokerage Trussle.</p>
<p>“We aren’t so easily categorized,” said Better CEO Vishal Garg, who told Ryan that the company plans to soon expand into traditional financial services like auto loans and insurance.</p>
<p>Said CFO Kevin Ryan, “A lot of people have their niches in the way they’re attacking this, but we feel like we’re on a path to being full stack where everything’s embedded in the same flow.&#8221;</p>

The latest experiment: Communities, or moderated social hubs, in which you can tweet with others around a shared interest. Twitter is limiting the categories, for now, to topics like dogs, weather, sneakers, skincare and astrology, and presumably hoping to stay way, way, way far away from politics for as long as possible.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM unveiled Thursday the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado, a full-sized pickup truck that received a major technology upgrade, including its hands-free Super Cruise advanced driver assistance system and an infotainment system with embedded Google services, as well as an overhauled interior. A new flagship trim, the off-road ZR2 truck with a factory-installed suspension lift, has also joined the Silverado lineup.</p>
<p>The Silverado refresh comes ahead of GM&#8217;s electric vehicle offensive, which will include Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">GM aims to deliver</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> 30 new electric vehicles to the global market by 2025 and to transition to all zero-emission vehicles by 2035. GM said the new Silverado trims will arrive at dealerships in spring 2022.</span></p>
<p>The exterior of the Chevy Silverado also received a refresh, including new front fascia and daytime running lights that animate when the driver walks up or away from the vehicle. But the real change can be found in the cabin — and the hardware and software guts — of the truck.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200623" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200623" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2200623 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg" alt=" 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-008.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2200623" class="wp-caption-text">The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2 and new headlights. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> GM</p></div></p>
<p>Chevy offers the Silverado in the LT, RST, LT Trail Boss, ZR2, LTZ and High Country trims, all of which come standard with a 2.7-liter turbocharged engine — now with 420 pound-feet of torque (up 20% over the previous model). The maximum tow rating on 2WD models is 9,600 pounds. GM also made changes to smooth out shifting and give drivers more power on demand.</p>
<p>The automaker also improved its 3.0 L Duramax turbocharged diesel engine to enable a max tow rating of 13,300 pounds (2WD models). Two other powertrains, the 5.3-liter V8 and the 6.2-liter V8, are also offered.</p>
<p>The interior cabin has been revamped to make it feel more spacious and includes a 13.4-inch touchscreen and a new 12.3-inch configurable digital instrument cluster standard. Owners will also be able to add a rear camera mirror and a head-up display.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2200602" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200602" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2200602 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg" alt="Chevrolet Silverado" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2022-Chevrolet-Silverado-ZR2-012.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2200602" class="wp-caption-text">The first-ever 2022 Chevrolet Silverado ZR2. <strong>Image Credits</strong>: GM</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, the Silverado interior will be offered in new colors, seat designs and premium materials. For model trims with bucket seats, the new center console incorporates an electronic shift controller.</p>
<p>Alexandre Scartezini, Chevrolet Truck&#8217;s lead interior designer, has described it as more contemporary and refined &#8220;with a hint of Corvette influence in its design DNA.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Everything Google</h2>
<p>Moving in deeper inside the vehicle, aka the infotainment, users will find Google, or more specifically Android Automotive, at the heart of the operating system. This means that Google Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play are all integrated into the infotainment screen.</p>
<p>Android Automotive OS shouldn&#8217;t be confused with Android Auto, which is a secondary interface that lies on top of an operating system. Android Auto is an app that runs on the user&#8217;s phone and wirelessly communicates with the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system. Both Android Auto and its Apple CarPlay counterpart will be offered in the new Silverado. GM said the system also works with Amazon Alexa.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Android Automotive OS is modeled after its open source mobile operating system that runs on Linux. But instead of running smartphones and tablets, Google modified it so automakers could use it in their cars. Google has offered an open source version of this OS to automakers for some time. In recent years, automakers have worked with the tech company to natively build in an Android OS that is embedded with all the Google apps and services.</p>
<h2>Hands-free driving</h2>
<p>All of the Silverado trims come standard with six active safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assist and forward collision alerts, a warning if the vehicle leaves its lane, a following distance indicator, automatic high beams and front pedestrian braking.</p>
<p>The big change is the addition of the automaker&#8217;s Super Cruise hands-free driver-assistance technology, which will be an available option on the High Country trim. Importantly, the system can be used even while trailering. Certain features of Super Cruise like automatic lane changing and lane change on demand will be restricted if the truck is towing.</p>
<p>Super Cruise uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention. Unlike Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>While GM has steadily improved Super Cruise since its introduction in 2017, for years it was limited to its luxury Cadillac brand and restricted to certain divided highways. That began to change in 2019 when GM announced plans to expand it to more models and use cases. The system can be activated on more than 200,000 miles of roads in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>The Silverado will offer other trailer assistance features, including one that will alert drivers to vehicles in their blind spot.</p>

He advises technology, media, entertainment and a variety of companies on issues of cybersecurity and privacy, IP  counseling; social media law; and advertising, marketing, and promotions law. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">China enacted a sweeping new data privacy law on August 20 that will dramatically impact how tech companies can operate in the country. Officially called the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China (PIPL), the law is the first national data privacy statute passed in China.</p>
<p>Modeled after the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the PIPL imposes protections and restrictions on data collection and transfer that companies both inside and outside of China will need to address. It is particularly focused on apps using personal information to target consumers or offer them different prices on products and services, and preventing the transfer of personal information to other countries with fewer protections for security.</p>
<p>The PIPL, slated to take effect on November 1, 2021, does not give companies a lot of time to prepare. Those that already follow GDPR practices, particularly if they&#8217;ve implemented it globally, will have an easier time complying with China&#8217;s new requirements. But firms that have not implemented GDPR practices will need to consider adopting a similar approach. In addition, U.S. companies will need to consider the new restrictions on the transfer of personal information from China to the U.S.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Implementation and compliance with the PIPL is a much more significant task for companies that have not implemented GDPR principles.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a deep dive into the PIPL and what it means for tech firms:</p>
<h2>New data handling requirements<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>The PIPL introduces perhaps the most stringent set of requirements and protections for data privacy in the world (this includes special requirements relating to processing personal information by governmental agencies that will not be addressed here). The law broadly relates to all kinds of information, recorded by electronic or other means, related to identified or identifiable natural persons, but excludes anonymized information.</p>
<p>The following are some of the key new requirements for handling people&#8217;s personal information in China that will affect tech businesses:</p>
<h3>Extra-territorial application of the China law</h3>
<p>Historically, China regulations have only been applied to activities inside the country. The PIPL is similar in applying the law to personal information handling activities within Chinese borders. However, similar to GDPR, it also expands its application to the handling of personal information outside China if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the purpose is to provide products or services to people inside China.</li>
<li>Where analyzing or assessing activities of people inside China.</li>
<li>Other circumstances provided in laws or administrative regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you are a U.S.-based company selling products to consumers in China, you may be subject to the China data privacy law even if you do not have a facility or operations there.</p>
<h3>Data handling principles</h3>
<p>The PIPL introduces principles of transparency, purpose and data minimization: Companies can only collect personal information for a clear, reasonable and disclosed purpose, and to the smallest scope for realizing the purpose, and retain the data only for the period necessary to fulfill that purpose. Any information handler is also required to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data it handles to avoid any negative impact on personal rights and interests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Squad Mobility&#8217;s vision of the perfect urban vehicle is a low-cost EV equipped with solar panels, swappable batteries and enough zip and range in its diminutive 6.5-foot package to meet the needs of city drivers.</p>
<p>The early-stage Dutch startup, which recently revealed the final design of its quadricycle, is now assembling working prototypes in Breda, the Netherlands. Squad has said the vehicle will have a base price of €5,750 ($6,790), excluding taxes. That price goes up if buyers want to add features like removable doors, air conditioning, heating and extra batteries.</p>
<p>Squad plans to present the prototypes this fall, <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Hoevers, CEO and co-founder of the company, said in a recent interview. Pre-production is also expected to begin this year with a goal to start </span>delivering the car at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Squad, like so many other new entrants to the EV car scene, will need more funds to reach its target.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In June, the company </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/squad-mobility-closes-investment-partnership-bloomit-squadmobility/">raised an undisclosed amount from Bloomit Ventures</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. To reach its production goals, Hoevers estimates Squad will need an additional €3.5 million ($4.1 million) for its next round, and then another €8 million ($9.6 million) to be able to deliver the first Squads. The company has not yet announced a round publicly, but says it&#8217;s in talks with various interested parties.</span></p>
<p>Interested customers can go on <a href="https://www.squadmobility.com/">Squad&#8217;s website</a> and pay a €5 reserve fee, but where Squad really sees its path to market is with shared mobility companies. The startup says it is in talks with a range of micromobility and car-sharing operators that might be interested in diversifying their fleets with a compact, smart vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Squad, which is a combination of the words &#8220;solar&#8221; and &#8220;quadricycle,&#8221; seats two, punches up to 30 miles per hour and is fueled by two swappable batteries with a capacity of around 1.6 Kwh each and a collective range of about 62 miles. This is similar to the battery capacity and range of electric mopeds.</p>
<p>For the average European city driver, that should be enough range. Squad also installed a 250-watt solar panel to the vehicle, which the company says adds another 12 miles per day given the amount of sun Europe tends to get.</p>

<p>Squad is coming onto the scene at the intersection of new mobility categories and EV charging innovation, which could be appealing to shared mobility operators looking to solve more use cases.</p>
<p>Shared micromobility companies are beginning to add electric mopeds to their fleets of e-scooters and e-bikes. The Squad could appeal to operators that want to appeal to a broader demographic, and one specifically more comfortable in a four-wheeled vehicle.</p>
<p>The potential savings from harnessing the power of the sun could attract operators as well. In the micromobility world, the labor costs associated with swapping batteries or charging vehicles represent a roadblock to profitability. A vehicle that&#8217;s constantly on a bit of a charge, at least during the daylight hours, might help alleviate that pain point.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is not to drive directly on solar,&#8221;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hoevers </span>told TechCrunch. &#8220;The idea is to buffer the batteries with solar and then drive on the batteries. The sun is more or less drip charging the battery throughout the day, which is actually a very healthy way of charging. You don&#8217;t want to top off your batteries to 100%. You want to keep them at around 50% to 60% all the time for a longer battery life.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoevers</span> said Squad has been in talks with shared micromobility providers to pitch the quadricycle, and has found that most dockless vehicles see about four to five rides per day and drive about 36 to 38 miles per day, numbers that TechCrunch confirmed with a few micromobility operators and that are well within the range of the Squad car.</p>
<p>Squad also intends to equip its vehicles with cameras, sensors and other smart features like remote diagnostics and maintenance, which will make the company more attractive to shared operators looking for a fleet that can be integrated into its management platforms. Hoevers also says he and his co-founder, Chris Klok, have used their collective 40 years of experience in mobility and shared past at long range solar EV company Lightyear to develop a strong CAN bus and drivetrain upon which new features can be added.</p>
<p>Whether Squad ends up selling fleets to micromobility platforms or car-sharing platforms might depend on the category in which the vehicle ends up. With its current speed and weight, the Squad car will be in the L6e category for light four-wheeled vehicles.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are interesting cost and tax benefits in this segment,&#8221; said Hoevers. &#8220;For example, there is no congestion charge, no road tax, no parking fees, low insurance fees and no car driving license needed in most markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Hoevers said the company is also considering producing a more powerful L7 that can go top speeds of around 45 miles per hour, which might be better for cities with more hills.</p>
<h2>The competition</h2>
<p>Squad isn&#8217;t the only company that has added solar panels to its electric vehicles. Germany-based startup Sono Motors told TechCrunch that it&#8217;s on track to begin deliveries of its electric Sion vehicle by 2023. The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/sono-motors-plans-to-license-the-tech-that-powers-its-solar-electric-car/"> vehicle&#8217;s exterior is composed of hundreds of solar cells</a> that have been integrated into polymer instead of glass and can add up to nearly 22 miles of extra battery life per day.</p>
<p>Although the Sion has not yet been released, the Sono app is already inviting owners of the vehicle to engage in a sort of car sharing that&#8217;s reminiscent of Airbnb for Sions in order to make use of vehicles that otherwise sit parked and useless for most of the day. As of Thursday, <a href="https://sonomotors.com/en/press/press-releases/sono-motors-carsharing-service-expansion/">Sono is expanding this vision to allow any car to be shared via the Sono app</a>.</p>
<p>Aptera Motors, a California company that has promised to roll out the &#8220;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2021/solar-car/">first mass-produced solar car</a>&#8221; this year, raised $4 million in a <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a34869242/the-aptera-ev-is-back-and-claims-up-to-1000-miles-of-range/">Series A this February</a> that it is using to pay for fiberglass, carbon fiber and batteries for its spaceship-looking tricycle. Aptera says its vehicle, which is available for pre-order and could cost anywhere between $25,900 and $46,900, will be built with 34 square feet of solar cells that can add an additional 40 miles of battery capacity on a clear day.</p>
<p>Each of the players in the solar-powered EV space have differences in tech, path to market and style, but they&#8217;re all potentially finding ways to ease the strain on the electrical grid.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/07/todays-electric-vehicle-market-slow-growth-in-u-s-faster-in-china-europe/#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20about%2064%2C300%20plug,the%20U.S.%20new%2Dcar%20market.">new electric cars make up 25% of total market share</a>, and that number will only increase. It might not be feasible in the long run for all of those vehicles to each plug into the grid to power up, especially when industries across sectors are beginning to electrify.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s clear that the technology isn&#8217;t there yet for vehicles to run purely on solar, Squad and other companies like it are laying the groundwork for future solar technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. government has announced a consultation on plans to shake up the national data protection regime, as it looks at how to diverge from European Union rules following Brexit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a year since the U.K. published a national data strategy in which said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/uk-wants-pandemic-levels-of-data-sharing-to-be-the-new-normal/">wanted pandemic levels of data sharing</a> to become Britain&#8217;s new normal.</p>
<p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCPS) has today trailed an incoming reform of the information commissioner&#8217;s office &#8212; saying it wants to broaden the ICO&#8217;s remit to &#8220;champion sectors and businesses that are using personal data in new, innovative and responsible ways to benefit people’s lives&#8221;; and promising &#8220;simplified&#8221; rules to encourage the use of data for research which &#8220;benefit&#8217;s people&#8217;s lives&#8221;, such as in the field of healthcare.</p>
<p>It also wants a new structure for the regulator &#8212; including the creation of an independent board and chief executive for the ICO, to mirror the governance structures of other regulators such as the Competition and Markets Authority, Financial Conduct Authority and Ofcom.</p>
<p>Additionally, it said the data reform consultation will consider how the new regime can help mitigate the risks around algorithmic bias &#8212; something the EU is already moving to legislate on, setting out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">a risk-based proposal for regulating applications of AI</a> back in April.</p>
<p>Which means the U.K. risks being left lagging if it&#8217;s only going to concern itself with a narrow focus on &#8220;bias mitigation&#8221;, rather than considering the wider sweep of how AI is intersecting with and influencing its citizens&#8217; lives.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing the consultation, DCMS highlights an artificial intelligence partnership involving Moorfields Eye Hospital and the University College London Institute of Ophthalmology, which kicked off back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/05/deepmind-partners-with-nhs-eye-hospital-to-conduct-ai-research/">2016</a>, as an example of the kinds of beneficial data sharing it wants to encourage. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0867-7">Last year</a> the researchers reported that their AI had been able to predict the development of wet age-related macular degeneration more accurately than clinicians.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The partnership also involved (Google-owned) DeepMind and now Google Health &#8212; although the government&#8217;s PR doesn&#8217;t make mention of the tech giant&#8217;s involvement. It&#8217;s an interesting omission, given that DeepMind&#8217;s name is also attached to a notorious U.K. patient data-sharing scandal, which saw another London-based NHS Trust (the Royal Free) sanctioned by the ICO,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/deepmind-nhs-health-data-deal-had-no-lawful-basis/"> in 2017</a>, for improperly sharing patient data with the Google-owned company during the development phase of a clinician support app (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/google-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-streams-its-uk-clinician-support-app/">Google is now in the process of discontinuing</a>).</p>
<p>DCMS may be keen to avoid spelling out that its goal for the data reforms &#8212; aka to &#8220;remove unnecessary barriers to responsible data use&#8221; &#8212; could end up making it easier for commercial entities like Google to get their hands on U.K. citizens&#8217; medical records.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/aug/22/nhs-data-grab-on-hold-as-millions-opt-out">sizeable public backlash</a> over the most recent government attempt to requisition NHS users&#8217; medical records &#8212; for vaguely defined &#8220;research&#8221; purposes (aka the &#8220;General Practice Data for Planning and Research&#8221;, or GPDPR, scheme) &#8212; suggests that a government-enabled big-health-data-free-for-all might not be so popular with U.K. voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government’s data reforms will provide clarity around the rules for the use of personal data for research purposes, laying the groundwork for more scientific and medical breakthroughs,&#8221; is how DCMS&#8217; PR skirts the sensitive health data sharing topic.</p>

<p>Elsewhere there&#8217;s talk of &#8220;reinforc[ing] the responsibility of businesses to keep personal information safe, while empowering them to grow and innovate&#8221; &#8212; so that sounds like a yes to data security but what about individual privacy and control over what happens to your information?</p>
<p>The government seems to be saying that will depend on other aims &#8212; principally economic interests attached to the U.K.&#8217;s ability to conduct data-driven research or secure trade deals with other countries that don&#8217;t have the same (current) high U.K. standards of data protection.</p>
<p>There are some purely populist flourishes here too &#8212; with DCMS couching its ambition for a data regime &#8220;based on common sense, not box ticking&#8221; &#8212; and flagging up plans to beef up penalties for nuisance calls and text messages. Because, sure, who doesn&#8217;t like the sound of a crackdown on spam?</p>
<p>Except spam text messages and nuisance calls are a pretty quaint concern to zero in on in an era of apps and data-driven, democracy-disrupting mass surveillance &#8212; which was something the outgoing information commissioner <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/">raised as a major issue of concern</a> during her tenure at the ICO.</p>
<p>The same populist anti-spam messaging has already been deployed by ministers to attack the need to obtain internet users&#8217; consent for dropping tracking cookies &#8212; which the digital minister Oliver Dowden <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/after-years-of-inaction-against-adtech-uks-ico-calls-for-browser-level-controls-to-fix-cookie-fatigue/">recently suggested</a> he wants to do away with &#8212; for all but &#8220;high risk&#8221; purposes.</p>
<p>Having a system of rights wrapping people&#8217;s data that gives them a say over (and a stake in) how it can be used appears to be being reframed in the government&#8217;s messaging as irresponsible or even non-patriotic &#8212; with DCMS pushing the notion that such rights stand in the way of more important economic or highly generalized &#8220;social&#8221; goals.</p>
<p>Not that it has presented any evidence for that &#8212; or even that the U.K.&#8217;s current data protection regime got in the way of (the very ample) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/uks-covid-19-health-data-contracts-with-google-and-palantir-finally-emerge/">data sharing during COVID-19</a>&#8230; While negative uses of people&#8217;s information are being condensed in DCMS&#8217; messaging to the narrowest possible definition &#8212; of spam that&#8217;s visible to an individual &#8212; never mind how that person got targeted with the nuisance calls/spam texts in the first place.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK&#8217;s COVID-19 health data contracts with Google and Palantir finally emerge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/05/uks-covid-19-health-data-contracts-with-google-and-palantir-finally-emerge/embed/#?secret=mIS0RJvELX" data-secret="mIS0RJvELX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The government is taking its customary &#8220;cake and eat it&#8221; approach to spinning its reform plan &#8212; claiming it will both &#8220;protect&#8221; people&#8217;s data while also trumpeting the importance of making it really easy for citizens&#8217; information to be handed off to anyone who wants it, so long as they can claim they&#8217;re doing some kind of &#8220;innovation&#8221;, while also larding its PR with canned quotes dubbing the plan &#8220;bold&#8221; and &#8220;ambitious&#8221;.</p>
<p>So while DCMS&#8217; announcement says the reform will &#8220;maintain&#8221; the U.K.&#8217;s (currently) world-leading data protection standards, it directly rows back &#8212; saying the new regime will (merely) &#8220;build on&#8221; a few broad-brush &#8220;key elements&#8221; of the current rules (specifically it says it will keep &#8220;principles around data processing, people’s data rights and mechanisms for supervision and enforcement&#8221;).</p>
<p>Clearly the devil will be in the detail of the proposals which are due to be published tomorrow morning. (<strong>Update:</strong> The consultation document is now on DCMS&#8217; website and can be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/data-a-new-direction">found here</a>; the consultation runs until November 19.) So expect more analysis to debunk the spin soon.</p>
<p>But in one specific trailed change DCMS says it wants to move away from a &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; approach to data protection compliance &#8212; and &#8220;allow organisations to demonstrate compliance in ways more appropriate to their circumstances, while still protecting citizens’ personal data to a high standard&#8221;.</p>
<p>That implies that smaller data-mining operations &#8212; DCMS&#8217;s PR uses the example of a hairdresser&#8217;s but plenty of startups can employ fewer staff than the average barber&#8217;s shop &#8212; may be able to expect to get a pass to ignore those &#8216;high standards&#8217; in the future.</p>
<p>Which suggests the U.K.&#8217;s &#8220;high standards&#8221; may, under Dowden&#8217;s watch, end up resembling more of a Swiss Cheese&#8230;</p>
<h2>Data protection is a &#8220;how to, not a don&#8217;t do&#8221;&#8230;</h2>
<p>The man who is likely to become the U.K.&#8217;s next information commissioner, New Zealand&#8217;s privacy commissioner John Edwards, was <a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/1508ef32-ec1d-4295-a5bf-aa8cd8211e7a">taking questions from a parliamentary committee</a> earlier today, as MPs considered whether to support his appointment to the role.</p>
<p>If he&#8217;s confirmed in the job, Edwards will be responsible for implementing whatever new data regime the government cooks up.</p>
<p>Under questioning, he rejected the notion that the U.K.&#8217;s current data protection regime presents a barrier to data sharing &#8212; arguing that laws like GDPR should rather be seen as a &#8220;how to&#8221; and an &#8220;enabler&#8221; for innovation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would take issue with the dichotomy that you presented [about privacy vs data-sharing],&#8221; he told the committee chair. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that policymakers and businesses and governments are faced with a choice of share or keep faith with data protection. Data protection laws and privacy laws would not be necessary if it wasn&#8217;t necessary to share information. These are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UK DPA [data protection act] and UK GDPR they are a &#8216;how to&#8217; &#8212; not a &#8216;don&#8217;t do&#8217;. And I think the UK and many jurisdictions have really finally learned that lesson through the COVID-19 crisis. It has been absolutely necessary to have good quality information available, minute by minute. And to move across different organizations where it needs to go, without friction. And there are times when data protection laws and privacy laws introduce friction and I think that what you&#8217;ve seen in the UK is that when it needs to things can happen quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also suggested that plenty of economic gains could be achieved for the U.K. with some minor tweaks to current rules, rather than a more radical reboot being necessary. (Though clearly setting the rules won&#8217;t be up to him; his job will be enforcing whatever new regime is decided.)</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can, in the administration of a law which at the moment looks very much like the UK GDPR, that gives great latitude for different regulatory approaches &#8212; if I can turn that dial just a couple of points that can make the difference of billions of pounds to the UK economy and thousands of jobs so we don&#8217;t need to be throwing out the statute book and starting again &#8212; there is plenty of scope to be making improvements under the current regime,&#8221; he told MPs. &#8220;Let alone when we start with a fresh sheet of paper if that&#8217;s what the government chooses to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked another Edwards (no relation) &#8212; Newcastle University&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/lilianedwards">Lilian Edwards</a>, professor of law, innovation and society &#8212; for her thoughts on the government&#8217;s direction of travel, as signalled by DCMS&#8217; pre-proposal-publication spin, and she expressed similar concerns about the logic driving the government to argue it needs to rip up the existing standards.</p>
<p>“The entire scheme of data protection is to balance fundamental rights with the free flow of data. Economic concerns have never been ignored, and the current scheme, which we’ve had in essence since 1998, has struck a good balance. The great things we did with data during COVID-19 were done completely legally &#8212; and with no great difficulty under the existing rules &#8212; so that isn’t a reason to change them,&#8221; she told us.</p>
<p>She also took issue with the plan to reshape the ICO &#8220;as a quango whose primary job is to &#8216;drive economic growth&#8217; &#8221; &#8212; pointing out that DCMS&#8217; PR fails to include any mention of privacy or fundamental rights, and arguing that &#8220;creating an entirely new regulator isn’t likely to do much for the &#8216;public trust&#8217; that’s seen as declining in almost every poll.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also suggested the government is glossing over the real economic damage that would hit the U.K. if the EU decides its &#8220;reformed&#8221; standards are no longer essentially equivalent to the bloc&#8217;s. &#8220;[It&#8217;s] hard to see much concern for adequacy here; which will, for sure, be reviewed, to our detriment &#8212; prejudicing 43% of our trade for a few low value trade deals and some hopeful sell offs of NHS data (again, likely to take a wrecking ball to trust judging by the GPDPR scandal).&#8221;</p>
<p>She described the goal of regulating algorithmic bias as &#8220;applaudable&#8221; &#8212; but also flagged the risk of the U.K. falling behind other jurisdictions which are taking a broader look at how to regulate artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Per DCMS&#8217; press release, the government seems to be intending for an existing advisory body, called the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI), to have a key role in supporting its policymaking in this area &#8212; saying that the body will <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">focus on &#8220;enabling trustworthy use of data and AI in the real-world&#8221;. </span>However it has still not appointed a new CDEI chair to replace Roger Taylor &#8212; with only an interim chair appointment (and some new advisors) announced today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world has moved on since CDEI’s work in this area,&#8221; argued Edwards. &#8220;We realise now that regulating the harmful effects of AI has to be considered in the round with other regulatory tools not just data protection. The proposed EU AI Regulation is not without flaw but goes far further than data protection in mandating better quality training sets, and more transparent systems to be built from scratch. If the UK is serious about regulating it has to look at the global models being floated but right now it looks like its main concerns are insular, short-sighted and populist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Patient data privacy advocacy group MedConfidential, which has frequently locked horns with the government over its approach to data protection, also queried DCMS&#8217; continued attachment to the CDEI for shaping policymaking in such a crucial area &#8212; pointing to last year&#8217;s <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/08/26/fk-the-algorithm-what-the-world-can-learn-from-the-uks-a-level-grading-fiasco/">biased algorithm exam grading scandal</a>, which happened under Taylor&#8217;s watch.</p>
<p>(NB: Taylor was also the Ofqual chair, and his resignation from that post in December cited a &#8220;difficult summer&#8221;, even as his departure from the CDEI leaves an awkward hole now&#8230; )</p>
<p>“The culture and leadership of CDEI led to the A-Levels algorithm, why should anyone in government have any confidence in what they say next?&#8221; said MedConfidential&#8217;s Sam Smith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tired of swerving around the same pothole every day but don&#8217;t know how to report it to your city? Already reported it but feel like said report was fired off into the ether, never to be read much less fixed?</p>
<p><a href="http://donotpay.com">DoNotPay</a>, a company that makes annoying processes less annoying through automation, might be able to help. Their &#8220;robot lawyer,&#8221; as the company calls it, started out as a service meant to help people more easily fight parking tickets. Over time it&#8217;s learned a bunch of new tricks, like helping users end tough-to-cancel subscriptions, get refunds they&#8217;re owed and more.</p>
<p>Its latest thing? Helping users report issues like potholes, fallen trees/branches and broken streetlights to their city government — and if said issue damaged your property or cost you money, it&#8217;ll help get you paid back.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200448" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200448" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200448" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png 2304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=300,147 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=768,376 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=680,333 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=1536,752 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=2048,1003 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/donotpay-city-repairs.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200448" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DoNotPay</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It just seems so unfair that if an ordinary American is driving down the street with a broken tail light, the government could give them a ticket and charge them money … but if there&#8217;s a pothole in the road, you can&#8217;t get money from the government,&#8221; says DoNotPay founder Joshua Browder. &#8220;So we&#8217;ve decided to create a product that is like a fix-it ticket for the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you start the process of reporting a city issue with DoNotPay, you&#8217;re given two options: report the issue or claim compensation. The first finds the correct place to report an issue in your city, then their chatbot gathers all the info it needs and sends it over to the city with your contact info. The second walks you through the small claims court process; their robot lawyer can&#8217;t represent you, but it&#8217;ll generate the documents you need and try to tell you everything you need to know to make your case.</p>
<p>DoNotPay started out as something of a side project but quickly grew into something more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When I was studying at Stanford, I got a bunch of parking tickets,&#8221; Browder tells me. &#8220;I learned … I was a terrible driver. But I also learned that the government issues tickets to make money, not necessarily to punish people. So I created the first version for fun — to help myself and my friends. Within two days of creating it, one of my friends posted it on reddit and it went completely viral internationally. I went from 10 cases on day one to like … 50,000. All this made me realize that this is bigger than just a side project. It really taps into what people hate: being ripped off. So I&#8217;ve decided to devote all my time to pursuing that over the past six years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Browder tells me these new reporting features are live now, currently work in the top 50-or-so biggest US cities, and are included in DoNotPay&#8217;s standard subscription price ($36 for three months.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is introducing a new feature that will allow accounts to self-identify as bots by adding a label to their profile. This feature is designed to help people better differentiate between automated accounts &#8212; like bots that retweet the news, public service announcements or other updates &#8212; from those operated by humans. It&#8217;s not, however, designed to help users identify the &#8220;bad bots,&#8221; which are those that pose as people, often to spread misinformation or spam.</p>
<p>The company has been contemplating labeling bots for years.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RbxNRYWSCL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/3-guiding-principles-for-ceos-who-post-on-twitter/">3 guiding principles for CEOs who post on Twitter</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;3 guiding principles for CEOs who post on Twitter&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/02/3-guiding-principles-for-ceos-who-post-on-twitter/embed/#?secret=RbxNRYWSCL" data-secret="RbxNRYWSCL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/twitter-is-considering-badging-bots-as-far-as-we-can-detect-them/">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was asked</a> during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing whether he believed users had a &#8220;right to know&#8221; if they were speaking to a bot or a human on Twitter&#8217;s platform. He agreed that Twitter should add more context to tweets and was considering identifying bots, to the extent that it could. However, Dorsey also pointed out it would be more difficult to identify bots that were using scripting to give the appearance of being a human, compared with those that were leveraging Twitter&#8217;s API.</p>
<p>Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-verification-bots-2021/">finally solidified those plans</a>, saying it would later introduce new features that would allow users to be able to distinguish between human-run accounts and those that were automated. When Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/twitter-opens-account-verification-applications-to-the-public-under-new-guidelines/">launched</a> its account verification system in May, it reminded users that it would soon offer other ways to identify different types of accounts beyond the long-coveted blue badge &#8212; such as labels for bots.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200570" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200570" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200570" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200570" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Today, Twitter says its new &#8220;Automated Account&#8221; label that identifies &#8220;good bots&#8221; will be made available to over 500 Developer Accounts. This group will test the feature and provide feedback before it&#8217;s opened up more broadly to all Twitter developers. As it&#8217;s still a test for the time being, the label won&#8217;t be required.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, when Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/twitter-rewrites-developer-policy-to-better-support-academic-research-and-use-of-good-bots/">updated its Developer Policy</a> last year, it did ask developers to indicate in their account profile or bio whether the account was a bot, what the account is and who&#8217;s behind it. These account labels would allow developers an easier way to comply with that policy rather than having to handwrite this information in their bio.</p>
<p>Twitter tells TechCrunch that based on what it learns during this experiment, it may decide to make adopting the label a requirement for all developers who run automated accounts in the future, once it becomes broadly available.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2200569" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2200569" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2200569" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pasted-image-0-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2200569" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>To be clear, Twitter doesn&#8217;t have any problem with those who run good bots, as it understands how automation can allow accounts to update people with helpful, relevant or, sometimes, just fun information. The company even celebrated a few of its favorite bots when announcing today&#8217;s developer news, including the public service account <a href="https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/earthquakesSF&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5WDq6vi7Y7nVk5ty0x9z5Bg2PwA">@earthquakesSF</a>; a bot offering COVID-19 updates, <a href="https://twitter.com/vax_progress" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/vax_progress&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYvakD6bj-U6vi7AnMeJNzkf0WuA">@vax_progress</a>; a bot that offers an ongoing breakdown of the last 100 bills introduced in Congress, <a href="https://twitter.com/last100bills" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/last100bills&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5V_BHVBuBJqzqui6U6migBp8Elg">@last100bills</a>; an accessibility-focused bot, <a href="https://twitter.com/alttxtreminder" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/alttxtreminder&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQy3thJB3m9OxdwEEf_Nbu4gbPvA">@AltTxtReminder</a>; and others that just add value in their own way, like <a href="https://twitter.com/met_drawings" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/met_drawings&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNELU1MqaEpv-GENvi0GFP3oTDDFFA">@met_drawings</a>, which shares public domain works from The Met’s Drawings &amp; Prints department, or the goofy <a href="https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631302191562000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGchDl4BjnSSP1Pt0bbcP4ufPqh3A">@EmojiMashupBot</a>, among others.</p>
<p>All these will be a part of the initial test group.</p>
<p>Twitter is also less concerned with how consumers may use automation to update their own accounts, perhaps by using third-party tools like IFTTT to post links or other content.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are ultimately responsible for the actions taken with your account, or by applications associated with your account,&#8221; Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation">policy</a> advises Twitter users. &#8220;Before authorizing a third-party application to access or use your account, make sure you&#8217;ve thoroughly investigated the application and understand what it will do.&#8221; It also adds that Twitter users that adopt automation will still need to adhere to Twitter&#8217;s guidelines.</p>
<p>The company has been on a tear lately in terms of rolling out new features. Just this week, it has launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">Communities</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/twitter-users-in-turkey-can-now-emoji-react-to-tweets/">tests of emoji reactions</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/twitter-full-width-image-tweets-test/">support for full-width photos and videos</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-tests-a-safety-feature-on-web-to-remove-followers-without-blocking-them/">way to &#8220;soft block&#8221; followers</a>, among other things.</p>
<p>Twitter has not said how long the test would run before the Automated Account labels are rolled out more broadly.</p>

<p>In a statement issued just now, Jio Platforms said it has been testing the smartphone with a &#8220;limited set of users for further refinement&#8221; and is &#8220;actively working to make it available more widely&#8221; around the time of Diwali festival, which is scheduled for early November.</p>

<p>The Indian firm, which operates the largest telecom network with over 400 million subscribers, blamed global semiconductor shortages for the launch delay and said it expects the additional two months &#8220;will&#8221; mitigate that.</p>
<p>The JioPhone Next smartphone, unveiled in June this year, was scheduled to launch on Friday. Neither of the firms had given any indication in recent days that they may have to postpone the launch. &#8220;The companies remain committed to their vision of opening up new possibilities for millions of Indians, especially those who will experience the internet for the very first time,&#8221; the Indian firm said in a press statement.</p>

<p>Powered by &#8220;extremely optimized Android” mobile operating system, the JioPhone Next phone is marketed to be an &#8220;ultra-affordable 4G smartphone&#8221; to tap the roughly 300 million users in India who are still on slower networks. The two firms have said that they plan to eventually launch the smartphone in other markets as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At an event in June, the two firms said the JioPhone Next will feature a “fast, high-quality camera” which will support HDR, and will be protected by the latest Android releases and security updates. It will also ship with a range of features, including Read Aloud and Translate Now that will work with any text on the phone screen, including web pages, apps, messages and even photos, the two firms have said.</p>
<p>Analysts have said in recent weeks that the JioPhone Next &#8212; whose price and tech specifications are yet to be revealed &#8212; could disrupt the Indian smartphone market &#8212; the world&#8217;s second largest &#8212; and help the telecom network further solidify its dominance in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;At present, there are 430 million smartphone users, 115 million JioPhone users [Jio&#8217;s &#8220;smart&#8221; featurephone] and 320 million featurephone (2G) users in India. We believe smartphone users with devices priced above $100 are unlikely to opt for a sub $100 device,&#8221; analysts at Jefferies wrote in a report to clients this week. &#8220;That leaves 25% of smartphone users, i.e. 105 million smartphones, 115 million JioPhone users and 320 million featurephone users as the addressable market for JioPhone Next. Assuming replacement cycle of 2 years for smartphones and 3 years for JioPhone/featurephones, the addressable market for JioPhone Next could be 200m devices annually.&#8221;</p>
<p>The smartphone is the latest collaboration between the two firms. Last year, Google invested <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">$4.5 billion in Jio Platforms</a> and that&#8217;s where it first announced the plans to develop cheap smartphones with the Indian telecom operator. Facebook and scores of other firms have also bought stakes in the Indian firm. Jio Platforms operates a number of businesses, including telecom giant Jio Infocomm, which competes with Airtel and Vodafone Idea; and e-commerce firm JioMart, which competes with Tata-owned BigBasket, SoftBank-backed Grofers and Amazon and Walmart&#8217;s Flipkart.</p>
