										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tillit.ai/">Tillit</a>, a fintech startup that is building something akin to buy now, pay later for B2B purchases , looks set to become Sequoia&#8217;s next European investment, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>According to multiple sources, the Silicon Valley VC &#8212; which recently expanded to Europe with an office in London &#8212; is backing a €2.5 million round in the Oslo, Norway-based company, alongside seed investors LocalGlobe and Visionaries Club. Sequoia and LocalGlobe declined to comment.</p>
<p>With the tagline, &#8220;Making b2b purchases a breeze&#8221; and yet to launch, Tillit appears to combine invoice financing with a buy now, pay later model, meaning that credit is offered at the point of checkout (or invoice), with a number of payment options, including instalments. In addition, Tillit offers expenses management, with a range features to make it easier for employees to make B2B purchases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, the premise is that sellers get better conversions through offering instant credit, and buyers can defer or spread out payments and have greater control and visibility over purchases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tillit isn&#8217;t the first investment in Europe by Sequoia since it revealed that it was doubling down on Europe with a dedicated team on the ground. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/germanys-xentral-nabs-20m-led-by-sequoia-to-help-online-facing-smbs-run-back-offices-better/">the firm led a $20 million round in Xentral</a>, a German startup that develops enterprise resource planning software covering a variety of back-office functions for online small businesses. That speaks to Sequioa&#8217;s remit to &#8220;invest throughout the journey,&#8221; from pre-seed/seed all the way to IPO and beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Workplace injuries and illnesses cost the U.S. upwards of $250 billion each year, according to the <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/workplace-injuries-illnesses-cost-250-billion/#:~:text=Workplace%20injuries%20and%20illnesses%20cost%20U.S.%20%24250%20billion%20annually,-Economic%20Snapshot%20%E2%80%A2&amp;text=On%20average%2C%20there%20are,%24192%20billion%2C%20according%20to%20J.">Economic Policy Institute</a>. <a href="https://www.eranyc.com/">ERA</a>-backed startup <a href="https://www.intenseye.com/">Intenseye</a>, a machine learning platform, has raised a $4 million seed round to try to bring that number way down in an economic and efficient way.</p>
<p>The round was co-led by Point Nine and Air Street Capital, with participation by angel investors from Twitter, Cortex, Fastly, and Even Financial.</p>
<p>Intenseye integrates with existing network-connected cameras within facilities and then uses computer vision to monitor employee health and safety on the job. This means that Intenseye can identify health and safety violations, from not wearing a hard hat to ignoring social distancing protocols and everything in between, in real time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The service&#8217;s dashboard incorporates federal and local workplace safety laws, as well as an individual organization&#8217;s rules to monitor worker safety in real time. All told, the Intenseye platform can identify 30 different unsafe behaviors which are common within workplaces. Managers can further customize these rules using a drag-and-drop interface.</p>
<p>When a violation occurs and is spotted, employee health and safety professionals receive an alert immediately, by text or email, to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Intenseye also takes the aggregate of workplace safety compliance within a facility to generate a compliance score and diagnose problem areas.</p>
<p>The company charges a base deployment fee and then on an annual fee based on the number of cameras the facility wants to use as Intenseye monitoring points.</p>
<p>Cofounder Sercan Esen says that one of the greatest challenges of the business is a technical one: Intenseye monitors workplace safety through computer vision to send EHS (employee health and safety) violation alerts but it also never analyzes faces or identifies individuals, and all video is destroyed on the fly and never stored with Intenseye.</p>
<p>The Intenseye team is made up of 20 people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, our team at Intenseye is 20% female and 80% male and includes 4 nationalities,&#8221; said Esen. &#8220;We have teammates with MSs in computer science and teammates who have graduated from high school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diversity and inclusion among the team is critical at every company, but is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai">particularly important at a company that builds computer vision software</a>.</p>
<p>The company has moved to remote work in the wake of the pandemic and is using VR to build a virtual office and connect workers in a way that&#8217;s more immersive than Zoom.</p>
<p>Intenseye is currently deployed across 30 cities and will use the funding to build out the team, particularly in the sales and marketing departments, and deploy go-to-market strategies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People don&#8217;t often equate gaming with dating, but maybe they should. As gaming continues to grow in popularity, particularly in the wake of the pandemic, a new startup called 2up is launching to help gamers connect both on and off screen.</p>
<p>The app was founded by sibling duo Stephanie and Lincoln Smith, who have been gamers since they were young.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2112034" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112034" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2112034" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_3719.jpg?w=680" alt="2up" width="680" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_3719.jpg 1955w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_3719.jpg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_3719.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_3719.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_3719.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_3719.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_3719.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2112034" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> 2up</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>2up isn&#8217;t specifically a dating app — users can specify if they&#8217;re looking for new friends, new teammates, or a romantic connection on the app. They can also share their preferred console or platform, favorite games, and whether they prefer to play games competitively or casually, filtering down their potential matches based on aligned interests.</p>
<p>Delightfully, 2up is designed with an old-school 8-bit aesthetic.</p>
<p>The startup plans on generating revenue through a premium subscription, not unlike other matching and dating apps. A premium subscription will provide unlimited swiping, as well as Charms. Charms are the equivalent of a Super Like, helping users get the attention of someone they&#8217;re interested in matching with.</p>
<p>At launch, one month of premium 2up will cost $19.99, six months costs $12.49 per month, and a yearly subscription costs $8.49 per month.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2112035" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2UP_mockup-female.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2UP_mockup-female.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2UP_mockup-female.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2UP_mockup-female.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2UP_mockup-female.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2UP_mockup-female.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2UP_mockup-female.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2UP_mockup-female.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2UP_mockup-female.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>2up also has quests, which rewards people for using the app on a daily basis and completing monthly engagement goals. Those who complete quests will be entered into a raffle to win a real-world prize like a gaming headset, gaming chair or even a new console.</p>
<p>&#8220;2up is one network that unites gamers,&#8221; said Stephanie Lincoln. &#8220;There are so many different consoles, and there are all these different forums and communities. We wanted to unify everything and put everyone in one place. We knew that there was a need for something that was a more intimate. We wanted to deliver a way for that same community to connect one-on-one, on screen and off screen, to bring people together.&#8221;</p>
<p>2up has been bootstrapped since its inception.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Interest, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 401(k) provider for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), announced Thursday that it has tacked on another $55 million to its Series C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news is notable for a couple of reasons. For one, the San Francisco-based company had already raised $50 million across two tranches in 2020. Secondly, the majority of its existing backers (about 40 of 55) joined one new investor &#8212; NEA spinout </span><a href="http://nvc.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NewView Capital (NVC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; in pumping more capital into Human Interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And last but definitely not least, the latest extension &#8212; which closed in December but is only now being publicly announced &#8212; effectively doubles Human Interest’s valuation from its financing a few months prior. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Jeff</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Schneble would not disclose the company’s current valuation, but he did say Human Interest “is now in the position of becoming a unicorn” the next time it raises, if that round “follows the same step-ups as the last couple” of financings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this latest extension, Human Interest has now raised a total of $136.7 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Interest’s growth has been impressive. It’s gone from adding about $100,000 a month in net new revenue in early 2019 to now adding more than $1 million a month in net new revenue, according to Schneble. The startup’s goal is to get to over $2 million a month by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve grown about 10 times in the past 18 months or so, and we&#8217;re not going to stop here,” he told TechCrunch. “Our goal is to get to $100 million-plus ARR [annual recurring revenue] in the next three years so that we can go public in the next three to four years.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch, Human Interest says it has helped nearly 3,000 businesses across America to offer retirement accounts to their more than 80,000 employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic was challenging, but led to an interesting shift in the company’s business. Pre-2020, about 85% of its customers were first-time 401(k) users. Last year, that number dropped to about 50%. This means that more companies moved from existing plans to Human Interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given there was a recession and a lot of uncertainty, it was a much easier pitch, considering we could offer a more affordable product,” Schneble said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Interest says it works with &#8220;every kind of SMB&#8221; &#8212; from tech startups to law offices, from dentists to dog walkers, manufacturing firms and social justice nonprofits. Customers include a San Francisco Bay Area electrician company, a Denver-based  pizza chain and a Seattle-based chain of gas stations and convenience stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being just a few years old, Schneble said the company doesn’t view itself as a startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to build a really big company that will be around for decades, and can go public,” he said. “If we were trying to sell the company, we might be doing this differently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Human Interest has about 300 employees, up from a little over 100 a year ago. It plans to double the size of its engineering team this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Schneble said the company is simply out “to do more of the same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t need new products,” he told TechCrunch. “There’s so much runway just doing what we’re doing, and that’s taking market share from others.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to focus on improving the technology on its platform, which it moved from a third-party provider to in-house in 2020. The move led the company to double its margins over the past six months while eliminating transaction fees for plan administrators and participants, according to Schneble. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Often financial services products get worse as you go,” he said. “We want to be the opposite, and this year are focused on making our platform as awesome as it can be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Interest says it also </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched new offerings, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complete and Concierge</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, last year in an effort to simplify retirement plan administration and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make retirement savings accessible to people in all lines of work.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The big incumbents haven’t figured out how to make plans affordable and accessible for smaller companies,” Schneble said. “We knew that to make a permanent dent in this country’s retirement crisis, we had to do something different.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 401(k) space is indeed a growing one. Last July San Mateo-based Guideline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; which is also focused on SMBs &#8212; announced an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$85 million Series D round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-led by Al Gore’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generation Investment Management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greyhound Capital. It was later revealed that American Express Ventures had </span><a href="https://finledger.com/2020/11/04/exclusive-amex-ventures-closes-on-investment-in-401k-startup-guideline/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined the financing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as an investor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NewView founder and Managing Partner Ravi Viswanathan said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he was impressed by how the company simplifies the process and administration for SMBs to offer 401(k)s and “is able to do so at lower fees through software and automation.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NewView team was also drawn to the company’s desire to make offering a 401(k) accessible for more employers. In a blog post, Ankit Sud and Christina Fa wrote:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traditional 401(k) providers like Vanguard and Fidelity designed and priced their plans for large businesses. The administrative burden and high fees make it unaffordable for small business owners. In fact, only 10% of small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs) offer 401(k) plans to their workforce, despite employing one-third of the working population&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Interest brings simple, affordable 401(k) plans to the 90% of small businesses that do not offer retirement plans today. “</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has crafted a number of policies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/tiktok-explains-its-ban-on-political-advertising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the years</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/tiktok-takes-down-election-misinformation-aimed-at-younger-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distance itself from the often-messy political fray</a>, but its users continue to have other agendas in mind.</p>
<p>In Russia, a tug-of-war has emerged on the social network.</p>
<p>On one side are young people using the app to create videos in support of free speech, rallying the public against the government and its treatment of Alexander Navalny, the anti-Putin, anti-corruption politician and activist.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the other is a government that has quickly versed itself in the art of video messaging &#8212; tapping and allegedly paying influencers to dissuade the masses from joining them.</p>
<p>Navalny&#8217;s long-term battle with Putin&#8217;s government has included political run-ins, imprisonments and a poisoning (with an evacuation to Germany to heal), followed by a return to Russia, subsequent arrest and conviction for violating a previous parole.</p>
<p>Through all of that, Navalny has taken on the mantle of anti-authoritarian hero. With many already unhappy about how the government is handling a weak economy and COVID-19 &#8212; a situation that has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/navalny-faces-test-of-support-in-protest-fight-against-putin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shaken</a> (but, apparently, <a href="https://www.intellinews.com/putin-s-popularity-slips-slightly-to-65-but-2020-crises-burnished-the-government-s-image-199362/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not completely toppled</a>) government approval ratings &#8212; Navalny&#8217;s call for mass protests has been met with a strong response.</p>
<p>And as those protests unfold, TikTok is shaping up to be the scrappy social media analogue of that activity &#8212; not unlike the prominent role that Twitter took on during the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Political content is not typical for Russian TikTok,’’ said food blogger <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kushat_hochu">Egor Khodasevich</a>, whose @kushat_hochu account has 1.2 million followers on the app. &#8220;Before Navalny’s return, Russian TikTok was all about dancing, pranks and post-Soviet trash aesthetics. All of a sudden, political videos have started to appear across all categories — humour, beauty, sport.’’</p>
<p>Now, in a significant turnaround, Russian content on the app is being flooded with catchy videos of teenagers cutting their passports in half and throwing them away, pupils <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@almorozova/video/6919376127253417218?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking down portraits of Putin</a> and swapping them with those of Navalny, and others creating how-to’s for would-be protestors — advising them to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@malina.rina0/video/6919500716797152513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wear warm clothes</a>, to equip themselves with water and power banks and, if arrested, to pretend they are foreign.</p>

<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>These are pooling around hashtags like #23января (January 23, the date of one of the biggest protests so far) and #занавального (&#8220;For Navalny&#8221;).</p>
<p>The wave of videos even got shout-outs from Navalny himself — fittingly, not on TikTok, but Instagram, where he praised the TikTok activists for helping get the word and the crowds out.</p>
<p>“Respect to the schoolchildren who, according to my lawyer, caused a frenzy on TikTok,” he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKWYho7onM9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a> on one post. Later he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKmET5MoU28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">poked fun</a> at how the TikTok protest videos were described as “fakes” planted by dastardly Americans.</p>
<p>Russia as a country has a small but fast-growing and vocal group of TikTok users.</p>
<p>Figures provided to us from SensorTower estimate that of the more than 2.66 billion times to date globally that TikTok has been downloaded (a figure that includes its Chinese version Douyin), it has been installed about 93.6 million times in Russia (figures that don’t count third-party Android stores, direct downloads or sideloads).</p>
<p>A report in the <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/12/18/warning-an-army-of-russian-trolls-has-invaded-tiktok-a72410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moscow Times</a> from the end of December estimates that there are around 20 million active users in the country, more than double the 8 million it had at the end of 2019. TikTok itself does not disclose current MAUs in Russia or globally, but analysts have projected that the company is on track to pass 1 billion MAUs sometime in the early part of this year.</p>
<p>Even with those sub-100 million numbers, videos with the Navalny hashtag have passed 1 billion views on the platform (as of the time of publishing, the number of views has passed 1.6 billion).</p>
<h2>The Empire Strikes Back…</h2>
<p>But Russia is nothing if not persistent when it comes to being ahead of the game in tech, and it has been harnessing the media world in a couple of ways in aid of its own ends.</p>
<p>State television and other state media outlets strongly encouraged people to stay away from protests, citing issues like public safety, the spread of Covid-19, and the threat of arrest (one they followed through on: authorities have carried out <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55790699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial mass arrests</a> of hundreds of people at these gatherings).</p>
<p>At the same time, attention turned to social media, and in particular TikTok.</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor first <a href="https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news73328.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed that it would fine</a> all major social media platforms up to 4 million rubles ($54,000) over protest-related content, citing that &#8220;these Internet platforms failed to remove a total of 170 illegal appeals in a timely manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>It then followed that up with an <a href="https://rkn.gov.ru/news/rsoc/news73364.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">order to the management teams of TikTok, Facebook, Telegram and Vkontakte</a> to appear at the regulators&#8217; offices to explain why they have not yet removed offending videos, reminding them that failure to comply will mean that fines will be increased to 10% of a company&#8217;s annual revenues, dangling the threat that non-compliance could mean services get blocked.</p>
<p>With TikTokers claiming they were being called in by the police after their videos were taken down, TikTok more directly started to get <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55813094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">threatened with fines</a> by the regulator in the wake of all this.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/05/to-get-off-russias-blacklist-github-has-blocked-access-to-pages-that-highlight-suicide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous moves to censor</a> online platforms, investigators explained their actions as a response to societal impact. In this case, regulators described protest videos as a coordinated criminal attempt to get minors to commit illegal acts that could endanger their safety.</p>
<p>In addition to all that, the state appeared to take on a guerilla approach, too.</p>
<p>Small accounts, newly created accounts and popular bloggers slowly all started posting videos persuading people away from the protests. These videos, in Russian, warn of the dangers of protesting.</p>
<p>It turns out that at least some of the people posting videos were quietly getting paid. Sums ranged from 2,000 rubles, or about $25, through to 5,000 rubles, according to one TikToker who declined the offer and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@likefam/video/6920905450405891329?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgow9vA96i2xpGYTsHXgixt%2FIb0obtxcVW6dGdfGyEH8Kkl2RLgcSAmoXhBR6pDK1bLkGgA%3D&amp;language=ru&amp;preview_pb=0&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAA2ecEQJkJA0z6PJgoziNdIODK4UyDhoy-NzMJGk5oZo49UA2pBPYqJlDuUL3Arjj_&amp;share_item_id=6920905450405891329&amp;share_link_id=D86D4D30-683B-4D15-9EEB-896BE62CE427&amp;timestamp=1611401316&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=dd02m4d43ekidi&amp;user_id=6837485659293615109&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted the proposal on TikTok instead</a>.</p>
<p>(Those figures may not sound very high, but they can still be welcome sums for young people in a country where the average salary as of <a href="https://www.rbth.com/business/330451-average-salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a> is around $718 per month.)</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t taken long for the situation to get unmasked. Several videos criticizing protests have been removed in the last week. It&#8217;s unclear whether TikTok &#8212; which declined to comment for this article &#8212; or the original creators removed them.</p>
<p>But in one case, a TikToker who goes by the name @golyakov_ (741,000 followers) initially posted a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@golyakov_/video/6920915117576031489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stream of reasons</a> why protesting was dangerous. He then later <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@golyakov_/video/6921679491525807361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admitted</a> to getting paid but claimed to believe in what he was saying (perhaps one reason why the video has stayed up?).</p>
<p>Startok, one of the agencies that represents social media influencers, confirmed to us that it has cut ties with two of the creators who had taken payments to make videos in support of the state.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s immediate connection and current popularity with younger adults has made  it unique in the social media pantheon. However, it wasn’t the only social media platform seeing anti-Navalny activity &#8212; both in terms of messaging, and entities soliciting posts for payments.</p>
<p>A Navalny <a href="https://twitter.com/ilyapahomov/status/1351494165641703424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assistant posted this thread on Twitter</a> of Stories from Instagram casting doubt on Navalny&#8217;s decision to return to Russia as a publicity stunt, knowing he would be arrested.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/kantorrovich">Boris Kantorovich</a>, a sales director of social media agency Avtorskiye Media who has used Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/IKONASTILYA420/status/1357468522155302913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> about people getting detained, noted that he also came across briefs on Telegram chat ADvizer.me, as well as in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1076026736081123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook group</a> that required bloggers to create a video with one or two talking points. He said included “protesters provoked the police at the rally,&#8221; “we are tired of Navalny&#8221; and “we want peace and quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Kantorovich posed as one of the TikTokers that he represents, he <a href="https://twitter.com/kantorrovich/status/1353373963360104448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">received a brief</a> for a 15-second video. “After a quick negotiation I hiked the price up from 2,000 rubles to 3,500 rubles,” he said.</p>
<p>Further creative briefs came with the guidance that they needed to condemn protests on 31 January and 2 February, the second being the date of Navalny’s trial.</p>
<p>“Bloggers should say that ‘Navalny will go to jail 100%’, he is ‘funded from the West’ and ‘his recent imprisonment is legal,&#8221; Kantorovich said.</p>
<p>Kantorovich added that authorities didn’t reach out to his agency Avtorskiye Media to advertise with the bloggers it works with: “We clearly mark all ads but authorities don’t like it, because they are trying to create an illusion of a public opinion,” he said.</p>
<p>Similar information was shared by <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Kapustin">Anatoly Kapustin</a> with the “Picture” advertising agency.</p>
<p>Kapustin, speaking in an interview on non-State-owned Russian TV station Rain, named the “public organization for youth affairs” as an advertiser.</p>
<p>“Talking points on offer were: ‘criminal charges could be brought against protesters,’ ‘you might end up in jail and then not find well-paid jobs,’ and ‘Navalny&#8217;s children are studying in America,’” he said in the interview.</p>
<p>In some cases, the virality tricks that TikTok is known for have been used by protestors to turn some of those pro-government campaigns around.</p>
<p>After a wave of people <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/оригинальный-звук-6921308581891476226?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowOcd5BbGOMGllWOHIQ7a21KbafLGWNYzvotGdML/GVQW/Th5hwiFLPK0aQRVB+EycGgA=&amp;language=ru&amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAARyjWte0BP0ILgLD9rsYhPnUczyAnb2GplrBcAAD2v2Zx1gr5MdJDLWjF7HNWXyqd&amp;share_link_id=F250E7E1-109E-4E5F-B1DE-C398EEDB3FE5&amp;share_music_id=6921308581891476226&amp;tt_from=copy&amp;u_code=d32ghca0ha67ec&amp;user_id=6620816615652999173&amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_source=copy&amp;source=h5_m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created videos</a> based on the same clip of music that repeats in a deep voice that TikTok is not a place for politics, it’s a place for [fill in a fun and non-political activity/video here] &#8212; the audio and hashtag were hijacked by protestors seeking to encourage people to embrace free speech and not silence their voices.</p>
<p>TikTok declined to comment for this story, but in general the company has made it a policy not to wade into partisan politics, or to make a space for political advertising, turning its platform into a commercial opportunity to get political points across.</p>
<p>It declined to comment on whether it was taking down videos that might be reported as possible paid advertising by viewers, nor would it comment on whether it had responded to any government requests to remove videos. It periodically publishes transparency reports where some of that detail, and its subsequent actions, can be found, after the fact. (It judges each request individually.)</p>
<p>One thing that the Navalny situation has exposed is that there is a strong appetite among younger people to be more politically engaged, and for the moment, TikTok is emerging as their preferred place to do that.</p>
<p>Khodasevich, the food blogger, thinks TikTok can replace Twitter as a platform of choice for the opposition in Russia.</p>
<p>“Thanks to its clever algorithms, TikTok can show your video to a bigger audience than YouTube or Instagram, even if you don&#8217;t pay for promotion,” he said in an interview. “TikTok representatives told me political videos without direct calls for protests will not get banned.’’</p>
<p>It means that, with a bit of creativity &#8212; and a very heavy dose of opportunism and cynicism &#8212; both sides might still be able push forward with their political agenda. Boris Kantorovitch agrees.</p>
<p>“Authorities will change their strategy and become more subtle,” he said. “They acted in haste. Probably they thought of TikTok as a good breeding ground for loyalists. Now, the only way to stop people talking about politics on TikTok is by banning access to this platform.’’</p>
<p>Or, if you can&#8217;t beat them, join them? The last few days have <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2021/02/08/on-trend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seen government organizations</a> the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@midrussia?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> and the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mchs.russia?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ministry of Emergency Situations</a> joining the platform to give the public a glimpse into how they, too, can roll with it.</p>

<p><script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script></p>
<p>Some of the content is not exactly subtle &#8212; the Foreign Affairs almost immediately used its new account to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@midrussia/video/6926141010137337089?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post a TikTok discrediting Navaly</a> &#8212; but more generally, these are signs that the government is all too aware of the impact the platform is having to galvanize people against it, and it&#8217;s trying various things to fight that.</p>
<p>So did TikTok really manage to bring a considerable number of young people to rallies? Are we witnessing a birth of a new protest movement or yet another example of one click activism?</p>
<p>According to a poll conducted on 23 January by TV Rain in Moscow, 44% percent of protesters took to the streets for the first time ever. Only 10% of respondents were under the age of 18, with an average age of protesters hovering around 31 years old, showing an overlap with the audience using TikTok in the country.</p>
<p>Other major movements (such as last year&#8217;s run of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122591/support-george-floyd-protests-us-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLM activism</a>) point to 18-34 being the biggest age demographic among protestors (albeit, worth noting strong participation among other ages, too).</p>
<p>With that in mind, it seems that both authorities and opposition in Russia will try to use the social media platforms most popular among that age group to recruit their new foot soldiers.</p>
<p>Social media might even take on a bigger role in coming months, as the wave of physical, outdoor protests have died down amid the Russian winter weather and the police response, giving people a moment to regroup.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Navalny supporters are planning to stand outside their homes on Sunday evening, February 14, from 8.00 &#8211; 8.15 pm, holding up their telephone flashlights, taking photos and uploading them to social media using a new hashtag: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D0%9B%D1%8E%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8C%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%A1%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%B0?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/hashtag/%25D0%259B%25D1%258E%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258C%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0?src%3Dhashtag_click&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1613139513195000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFWGIaPo27uHRR7UnB196Elu-CX6w">#ЛюбовьСильнееСтраха</a> (Love is Stronger than Fear).</p>
<div>The Kremlin may well oppose these, too. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said that that &#8220;in the event of a violation of the law, all our law enforcement officers will bring those responsible to justice.&#8221;</div>
<p>Of course, as with everything on social media, it’s sometimes hard to figure out everyone’s actual agenda. As Khodasevich said, some political posts are genuine, some could be attributed to “news jacking.&#8221; But ultimately, they are sparking a lot of attention that the government is now mobilizing to counteract.</p>
<p>And with another critical Navalny hearing coming up on February 15th, as well as the September 2021 state Duma elections being only months away, the stakes are high for whatever political battles come next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With a stated goal of aligning the mortgage industry with consumer interests, Austin-based <a href="https:///www.upequity.com/">UpEquity</a> has raised $25 million in equity and debt funding to expand its business.</p>
<p>Chief executive Tim Herman started the mortgage lending company to take advantage of what he saw as inefficiencies in the $2 trillion U.S. housing market.</p>
<p>Existing financial services and property technology companies treat the symptom and not the cause of market inefficiencies, said Herman.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company makes free cash offers but charges 2.5% on the loans it makes to homebuyers to give them the cash they need to make an offer before having to go through the traditional process of taking out a home loan through a bank. Then the homeowners can make payments directly to UpEquity to pay off the mortgage on the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our cash offer works like a guarantee that during the escrow period we will be able to get the mortgage in place,&#8221; Herman said.</p>
<p>A U.S. Naval Academy graduate and former fighter pilot, Herman saw real estate as the only avenue to true wealth creation open to him and his family given their years on the road and lack of available investment capital.</p>
<p>After the Navy, Herman went to Harvard Business School and met his co-founder Louis Wilson. It was in Boston while in B-School that the two men started UpEquity.</p>
<p>They since relocated to Austin because of its booming housing market and relatively more relaxed regulatory environment.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the pitch to customers is the ability to make an all-cash offer, which dramatically improves the likelihood of closing on a house. It&#8217;s a luxury that roughly 90 percent of Americans can&#8217;t afford, Herman said. There&#8217;s no downside for selling homeowners, if a purchaser doesn&#8217;t end up buying the home then UpEquity owns the house.</p>
<p>Of all of the 300 deals the company has done so far, only two have failed.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why a company like UpEquity can raise $7.5 million in venture and $17.5 million in venture debt to start making loans.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s A round was led by Next Coast Ventures and UpEquity said it would use the money to fund product development that can slash the time-to-close for the real estate agents that act as the company&#8217;s sales channel to ten days.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to finally align the mortgage industry with consumer interests,” said UpEquity Co-Founder and CEO Tim Herman. “This funding is validation that consumers, real estate agents and venture investors understand the power of removing friction from the homebuying process, not only for personal advancement, but to attain the American Dream.”</span></p>
<p>So far the company has expanded its operations from Texas into Colorado, Florida and California, where it has originated $100 million in mortgages in 2020.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As real estate continues to evolve in the face of limited supply and tight competition, UpEquity is at the helm of PropTech&#8217;s growing capabilities,” said Thomas Ball, managing director at Next Coast Ventures. “Most innovation has focused on the front end, but until now, nobody has expedited what happens after the borrower submits an application. UpEquity has the team, talent and technology to not only succeed, but to disrupt and emerge as the leader in the mortgage lending marketplace.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Royal Dutch Shell Group, one of the largest publicly traded oil producers in the world, <a href="https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2021/shell-accelerates-drive-for-net-zero-emissions-with-customer-first-strategy.html">just laid out its plan for how the company will survive in a zero-emission, climate conscious world</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a plan that rests on five main pillars that include the massive rollout of electric vehicle charging stations; a greater emphasis on lubricants, chemicals, and biofuels; the development of a significantly larger renewable energy generation portfolio and carbon offset plan; and the continued development of hydrogen and natural gas assets while slashing oil production by 1% to 2% per year and investing heavily in carbon capture and storage.</p>
<p>These four large categories cut across the company&#8217;s business operations and represent one of the most comprehensive (if high level) plans from a major oil company on how to keep their industry from becoming the next victim of the transition to low emission (and eventually) zero emission energy and power sources (I&#8217;m looking at you, coal industry).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our accelerated strategy will drive down carbon emissions and will deliver value for our shareholders, our customers and wider society,” said Royal Dutch Shell Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, in a statement.</p>
<p>To keep those shareholders from abandoning ship, the company also committed to slashing costs and boosting its dividend per share by around 4% per year. That means giving money back to investors that might have been spent on expensive oil and gas exploration operations. The company also committed too pay down its debt and make its payouts to shareholders 20% to 30% of its cash flow from operations. That&#8217;s&#8230; very generous.</p>

<p><strong>The Plan</strong></p>
<p>Shell is a massive business with more than 1 million commercial and industrial customers and about 30 million customers coming to its 46,000 retail service stations daily, according to the company&#8217;s own estimates. The company organized its thinking around what it sees as growth opportunities, energy transition opportunities, and then the gradual obsolescence of its upstream drilling and petroleum production operations.</p>
<p>In what it sees as areas for growth, Shell intends to invest around $5 billion to $6 billion to its initiatives including the development of 500,000 electric vehicle charging locations by 2025 (up from 60,000 today) and an attendant boost in retail and service locations to facilitate charging.</p>
<p>The company also said it would be investing heavily in the expansion of biofuels and renewable energy generation and carbon offsets. The company wants to generate 560 terawatt hours a year by 2030, which is double the amount of electricity it generates today. Expect to see Shell operate as an independent power producer that will provide renewable energy generation as a service to an expected 15 million retail and commercial customers.</p>
<p>Finally the company sees the hydrogen economy as another area where it can grow.</p>
<p>In places where Shell already has assets that can be transitioned to the low carbon economy, the company&#8217;s going to be doubling down on its bets. That means zero emission natural gas production and a trebling down on chemicals manufacturing (watch out Dow and BASF). That means more recycling as well, as the company intends to process 1 million tons of plastic waste to produce circular chemicals.</p>
<p>Upstream, which was the heart of the oil and gas business for years, the company said it would &#8220;focus on value over volume&#8221; in a statement. What that means in practice is looking for easier, low cost wells to drill (something that points to the continued importance of the Middle East in the oil economy for the foreseeable future). The company expects to reduce its oil production by around 1% to 2% per year. And the company&#8217;s going to be investing in carbon capture and storage to the tune of 25 million tons per year through projects like the Quest CCS development in Canada, Norway&#8217;s Northern Lights project, and the Porthos project n the Netherlands.</p>
<p>“We must give our customers the products and services they want and need – products that have the lowest environmental impact,&#8221; van Beurden said in a statement.&#8221;At the same time, we will use our established strengths to build on our competitive portfolio as we make the transition to be a net-zero emissions business in step with society.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1948540" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1948540" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1948540" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1128003505.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="698" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1128003505.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1128003505.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1128003505.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1128003505.jpg?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1128003505.jpg?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1128003505.jpg?resize=1536,1047 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1128003505.jpg?resize=2048,1395 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1128003505.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1948540" class="wp-caption-text">Money or finance green pattern with dollar banknotes. Banking, cashback, payment, e-commerce. Vector background.</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Money talk</strong></p>
<p>For the company to survive in a world where revenues from its main business are cut, it&#8217;s also going to be keeping operating expenses down and will be looking to sell off big chunks of the business that no longer make sense.</p>
<p>That means expenses of no more than $35 billion per year and sales of around $4 billion per year to keep those dividends and cash to investors flowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over time the balance of capital spending will shift towards the businesses in the Growth pillar, attracting around half of the additional capital spend,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;Cash flow will follow the same trend and in the long term will become less exposed to oil and gas prices, with a stronger link to broader economic growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shell set targets for reducing its carbon intensity as part of the pay that&#8217;s going to all of the company&#8217;s staff and those targets are&#8230; eye opening. It&#8217;s looking at reductions in carbon intensity of 6-8% by 2023, 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035 and 100% by 2050, using a baseline of 2016 as its benchmark.</p>
<p>The company said that its own carbon emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.7 giga-tons per year and its oil production peaked in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>The context</strong></p>
<p>Shell&#8217;s not taking these steps because it wants to, necessarily. The writing is on the wall that unless something dramatic is done to stop fossil fuel pollution and climate change, the world faces serious consequences.</p>
<p>A study released earlier this week indicated that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/02/10/fossil-fuel-air-pollution-kills-nearly-as-many-as-cancer-study-finds/?sh=67ee8701dba8">air pollution from fossil fuels killed 18% of the world&#8217;s population</a>. That means burning fossil fuels is almost as deadly as cancer, according to the study<a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2021/02/deaths-fossil-fuel-emissions-higher-previously-thought"> from researchers led by Harvard University</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the human toll directly tied to fossil fuels, there&#8217;s the huge cost of climate change, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/23/new-u-s-report-says-that-climate-change-could-cost-nearly-500-billion-per-year-by-2090/">which the U.S. estimated could cost $500 billion per year</a> by 2090 unless steps are taken to reverse course.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever left a job, chances are you left your 401(k) plan along with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, if you’re like many Americans and change jobs every few years or so, you could have multiple 401(k) plans spread out at various companies, doing their own thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us don’t deal with the hassle of trying to consolidate accounts, which can lead to lost money over many years.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter <a href="https://www.hicapitalize.com/">Capitalize</a>. The New York-based startup aims to address this very problem with a platform that it claims makes it virtually painless to locate misplaced 401(k) accounts, select and open individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and consolidate retirement plans &#8212; for free. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s just raised $12.5 million in a Series A round to help grow that platform. Canapi Ventures led the round, with participation from existing backers including Bling Capital, Greycroft, RRE  Ventures and Walkabout Ventures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian-born Gaurav Sharma co-founded the company after years of working in traditional finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I enjoyed investing, I started peeling back the layers and saw a host of systemwide problems with the 401(k) market,” he recalls. “One of those being that our accounts are tied to our employers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma said that about one-third of the people who change jobs end up cashing out their 401(k) plans, and paying the related penalties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Another several million leave it behind for an extended period of time, ultimately because it’s complicated to move the money,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma teamed up with CTO Chris Phillips in late 2019 to form Capitalize, which went on to raise a $2 million seed round last March led by Bling Capital. Since its formal launch last September, the rollover platform has processed almost $10 million in volume. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were a lot of layoffs during the summer last year as a result of the pandemic,” Sharma said. “So a lot of our early users while we were in beta were people who had been impacted by those layoffs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was curious about how Capitalize’s offering differs from the services that financial advisors provide. According to Sharma, the difference lies in the process and eligibility requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you have an advisor, they will help you do some of this but in a really manual way, whereas we have built an online platform to help consumers find and consolidate retirement accounts,” Sharma told TechCrunch. “And usually, you have to have a few hundred thousand in assets to even get an advisor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was one of the things that motivated Sharma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you have $500 or $500,000 in assets, we’ll help you,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, Capitalize’s service is free to consumers, who can go to the site and let the company manage the consolidation process for them. If they need to open an IRA, the platform can help them do that, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We help them compare IRAs from leading fintech providers and established institutions,” Sharma explained. If Capitalize has forged a commercial relationship with one of those providers, it is compensated by them for the referral in a model that is similar to NerdWallet, PolicyGenius and Credit Karma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if they already have an IRA, Capitalize will still help with consolidation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitalize also offers employers a free offboarding service to help departing employees “roll over quickly at the point of job change,” Sharma said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is also great for the employer, who can save money on administrative fees and reduce fiduciary risk,” he added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canapi Ventures partner Jeffrey Reitman said his fintech venture fund, which has about 43 banks as LPs, was attracted to a number of things about Capitalize’s team and platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, he described Sharma as “one of the best early-stage CEOs” he’s seen when it comes to recruiting, company building and decision making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canapi also had one of its VPs and family members try out the product in its early beta format.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They said, according to Reitman, that the platform “worked like magic and removed so much friction in the process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So when you have a team member that has such a strong reaction to it, that’s such a validator of what it can be at scale,” he told TechCrunch. “That made it a bit of a no-brainer for us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides also being drawn to the company’s “mission-driven” approach, Reitman noted that about 80% of its existing bank LP base has existing IRA and individual retirement account products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many of them are digital in nature, we believe there should be a lot of synergies between what banks are trying to accomplish as they further digitize their product suite and what Capitalize is looking to accomplish in reducing friction for as many people as possible in that process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Capitalize plans to use its new capital to refine and streamline its product, and continue to invest in technology.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shauntelpoulson/">Shauntel Garvey</a> and <a href="https://www.reachcapital.com/team-member/jennifer-carolan/">Jennifer Carolan</a> liked edtech before the sector was cool, so the duo co-founded Reach Capital in 2015 with a <a href="https://golden.com/wiki/Reach_Capital-JNZXNM6">$53 million debut fund. </a>The San Francisco-based venture firm has since put checks into education startups including Newsela, Sketchy, ClassDojo and Outschool, landing six exits so far.</p>
<p>Now, after seeing its portfolio accelerate in the wake of the coronavirus, Reach is announcing its third fund aimed at backing edtech startups. Reach Capital III is a $165 million fund, the firm’s biggest to date. Reach’s team, which also includes Chian Gong, Wayee Chu and Esteban Sosnik, started raising the investment vehicle over the summer. New LPs in the fund include Sesame Workshop, National Geographic, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>Reach plans to reserve half of its fund for follow-on investments for its startups, and the other half will go toward net-new investments. The firm intends to back 20 startups through Reach III, targeting about 15% ownership in each deal.</p>
<p>The edtech market raked in more than $10 billion in venture capital investment globally in 2020, but for students, parents and teachers, the past 12 months were defined more by its scramble than its surge. Reach as well as other firms have the opportunity to back startups that could change the broken bits, which is no easy feat.</p>
<p>Carolan, who taught in Chicago public schools for seven years before joining venture, said that the entire education system’s restructure has opened the door for more innovation and opportunities.</p>
<p>“What parents were experiencing with remote learning was the result of underinvestment in edtech for a long time,” she said. “The companies that were adopted to meet the ends were fragmented, many of the products were inoperable and many of them were built for the home school market and repurposed for schools.” Now, Carolan sees opportunity in the fact that more students have digital devices due to 1:1 technology infrastructure in schools.</p>
<p>“There has never been a more exciting time to be investing in education,” she said. Reach plans to back companies across edtech subsectors, from early childhood to K-12 to post-secondary learning. The firm is also joining a number of investors betting on lifelong learning, a term being used to describe education <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">opportunities outside of a traditional classroom context. </a></p>

<p>Reach is one of the few venture capital firms that specifically back edtech companies. Others in the category include Owl Ventures, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/owl-ventures-new-pair-of-funds-gives-edtech-a-585-million-boost/">which closed $585 million </a>in a pair of investment vehicles in September, and Learn Capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/31/union-square-ventures-and-learn-capital-file-paperwork-indicating-new-funds/">which closed $132 million </a>in December.</p>
<p>The pandemic has opened the software market in education and we’re just in the beginning of that opening,” Carolan said. “Education has gone from let’s hire 10 instructional coaches to let’s adopt some software to do that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.superannotate.ai">SuperAnnotate</a>, a NoCode computer vision platform, is partnering with <a href="https://opencv.org">OpenCV</a>, a non-profit organization that has built a large collection of open-source computer vision algorithms. The move means startups and entrepreneurs will be able to build their own AI models and allow cameras to detect objects using machine learning. SuperAnnotate has so far raised $3M to date from investors including Point Nine Capital, Fathom Capital and Berkeley SkyDeck Fund.</p>
<p>The AI-powered computer vision platform for data scientists and annotation teams will provide OpenCV AI Kit (OAK) users with access to its platform, as well as launching a computer vision course on building AI models. SuperAnnotate will also set up the AI Kit’s camera to detect objects using machine learning and OAK users will get $200 of credit to set up their systems on its platform. </p>
<p>The OAK is a multi-camera device that can run computer vision and 3D perception tasks such as identifying objects, counting people and measuring distances. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/opencv-ai-kit-aims-to-do-for-computer-vision-what-raspberry-pi-did-for-hobbyist-hardware">Since launching</a>, around 11,000 of these cameras have been distributed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The AI Kit has so far been used to build drone and security applications, agricultural vision sensors or even COVID-related detection devices (for example, to identify people whether someone is wearing a mask or not).</p>
<p>Tigran Petrosyan, co-founder and CEO at SuperAnnotate said in a statement that: &#8220;Computer vision and smart camera applications are gaining momentum, yet not many have the relevant AI expertise to implement those. With OAK Kit and SuperAnnotate, one can finally build their smart camera system, even without coding experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Competitors to SuperAnnotate include Dataloop, Labelbox, Appen and Hive .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The venture capital scene in Africa has consistently grown, with an influx of capital from local and international investors reaching unprecedented heights in recent years. To understand how much growth has occurred, African startups </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/23/the-rise-of-silicon-savannah-and-africas-tech-movement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a meagre $400 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2015 compared to the $2 billion that came into the continent in 2019, according to Africa-focused fund Partech Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that figure isn&#8217;t the only yardstick. With other outlets like media publications WeeTracker and Disrupt Africa disclosing different results for the African venture capital market, we compared and contrasted their results last year. The result of that investigation detailed differences in methodology, as well as similarities.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="uIYBMC3fHb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/did-african-startups-raise-496m-1b-or-2b-in-2019/">Did African startups raise $496M, $1B or $2B in 2019?</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Did African startups raise $496M, $1B or $2B in 2019?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/did-african-startups-raise-496m-1b-or-2b-in-2019/embed/#?secret=uIYBMC3fHb" data-secret="uIYBMC3fHb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In comparison to Partech&#8217;s $2 billion figure for 2019, WeeTracker estimated that African startups raised $1.3 billion while Disrupt Africa, $496 million for the same year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was expected that these figures would increase in 2020. But with the pandemic bringing in utter confusion and panic, companies downsized as investors re-strategized, and due diligence slowed during the first few months of the year. Also, new predictions came into light in May with some pegging expected deals to close </span><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/06/african-venture-capital-to-drop-by-40-at-the-end-of-the-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">between $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the end of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investments did pick up, and from July, VC funding on the continent had a bullish run until December. Although 2020 didn&#8217;t witness the series of mammoth deals in 2019 and didn&#8217;t reach the $2 billion mark, it proved to be a good year for acquisitions. Sendwave&#8217;s $500 million purchase by WorldRemit; Network International buying DPO Group for $288 million; and Stripe&#8217;s larger than $200 million acquisition of Paystack were high-profile examples.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To better understand how VCs invested in Africa during 2020, we&#8217;ll look into data from Partech Africa, Briter Bridges and Disrupt Africa.</span></p>
<h2>Behind the numbers</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, </span><a href="https://partechpartners.com/2020-africa-tech-venture-capital-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partech Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that a total of $2 billion went into African startups. For 2020, the number dropped to $1.43 billion. </span><a href="https://briterbridges.com/africa-investment-report-2020"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pegged total 2020 VC for African startups at $1.31 billion (for disclosed and undisclosed amounts), up from $1.27 billion in 2019.  </span><a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/funding-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disrupt Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted an increase in its figures moving from $496 million in 2019 to $700 million in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as last year, contrasting methodologies from the type of deals reviewed, to the definition of an African startup contributed to the numbers&#8217; disparity. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://partechpartners.com/team/cyril-collon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyril Collon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, general partner at Partech says the firm&#8217;s numbers are based on equity deals greater than $200,000. Also, it defines African startups &#8220;as companies with their primary market, in terms of operations or revenues, in Africa not based on HQ or incorporation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When these companies evolve to go global, we still count them as African companies.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges has a similar methodology. According to <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/dario-giuliani/en-us">Dario Giuliani</a>, the firm’s director, the research organisation avoided using geography to define an African startup due to factors contributing to business identities like taxation, customers, IP, and management team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Disrupt Africa, the startups featured in its report are seven years or less in operation, still scaling, and a potential to achieve profitability. It excluded &#8220;companies that are spin-offs of corporates or any other large entity, or that have developed past the point of being a startup, by our definition of one.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>The continued dominance of fintech and the Big Four</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the drop in total funding, Partech says African startups closed more total deals in 2020 than previous years. According to the firm, 347 startups completed 359 deals compared in 2020 compared to 250 deals in 2019. This can be attributed to an increase in seed rounds (up 88% from 2019) and bridge rounds due to shortage of cash amidst a pandemic-induced lockdown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common theme in the three reports shows fintech, healthtech, and cleantech in the top five sectors. But, as expected, fintech retained the lion&#8217;s share of African VC funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Partech, fintech represented 25% of total African funding raised last year, with agritech, logistics &amp; mobility, off-grid tech, and healthtech sectors following behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges reported that fintech companies accounted for 31% of the total VC funding over the same time period. Cleantech came second; healthtech, third; agritech and data analytics, in fourth and fifth.</span></p>
<p>Fintech startups raised 24.9% of the total African VC funding counted by Disrupt Africa. E-commerce, healthtech, logistics, and energy startups followed respectively.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 also showed the Big Four countries’ preponderance in terms of investment destination, at least in two out of the three reports.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2111737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/africa-vc-market-2020.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The countries remained unchanged on Partech&#8217;s top five as Nigeria remained the VC&#8217;s top destination with $307 million. At a close second was Kenya accounting for $304 million of the total investments in the continent. Egypt came third with its startups raising $269 million, while $259 million flowed into South African startups. Rounding up the top five was Ghana with $111 million, displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech&#8217;s 2019 list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sequence remained unchanged from Disrupt Africa&#8217;s 2019 list as well. Funding raised by Kenyan startups reached $191.4 million; Nigeria followed with $150.4 million; South Africa, third at $142.5 million; Egypt came a close fourth with $141.4 million; while Ghanaian startups raised $19.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Briter Bridges took a different approach. Whereas Partech and Disrupt Africa highlighted funding activities per country of origin and operations, Briter Bridges chose to attribute funding to the startups&#8217; place of incorporation or headquarters. This premise slightly altered the Big Four&#8217;s positions. Startups headquartered in the US received $471.8 million of the total funding, according to Briter Bridges. Those in South Africa claimed $119.7 million. Mauritius-headquartered companies received $110 million while African startups headquartered in the U.K. and Kenya raised $107.6 million and $77.1 million respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On why Briter Bridges went with this narrative, Giuliani said the company wants its data to be an impartial conversation starter which can be used to investigate more complex dynamics such as the need for better policies, regulation, or financial availability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This speaks particularly to the absence of Nigeria as a primary location for incorporation. Due to unfriendly regulations, business and tax conditions, Nigerian startups are increasingly incorporating their startups abroad and other African countries like Seychelles and Mauritius. It&#8217;s a trend that may well continue as most foreign VCs prefer African startups to be incorporated in countries with business-friendly investment laws.</span></p>
<h2>Regional and gender diversity check</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/psd/francophone-africa-has-most-promising-tech-startups-and-they-are-looking-investors">increase in startup activity</a> in Francophone Africa, one would&#8217;ve expected an uptick in VC funding in the region. Well, that&#8217;s not exactly the case. Senegal, the region&#8217;s top destination for VC funding dropped from $16 million in 2019 to $8.8 million in 2020 according to Partech. The country was 9th on the list while Ivory Coast, placed 10th, raised a meagre sum of $6.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the good news is that 22 other countries received investments outside this Big Four this year, according to Partech data. Will we see this continue? And if yes, which countries will likely join the nine-figure club?</span></p>
<p><a href="http://partechpartners.com/team/tidjane-deme/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tidjane Deme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a general partner of Partech Africa, believes Ghana might be next. He references how it previously used to be a Big 3 of Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa before Egypt became a dominant force, and says a similar event might happen with the West African country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We see a clear diversification happening as investors are going into more markets. Ghana, for instance, is already attracting above $100 million. Of course, we all wish it would happen faster, but we also recognize that this is a learning process for both investors entering new markets and for founders learning about this game.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghana also emerged in Giuliani&#8217;s forecast. He adds the likes of Tunisia, Morocco, Rwanda as second-tier countries quickly entering global investors&#8217; radar and building more sophisticated ecosystems.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/tom-jackson-36289220"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Jackson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, co-founder of Disrupt Africa, doesn&#8217;t mention any names. But he thinks that while there are some positives from other markets, the Big Four dominance will continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Funding will filter down to other markets more and more, and there are already positive signs in that regard. But the space is still relatively early-stage and those four big markets have a big head start and will remain far ahead for years to come,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another diversity check that cannot be overlooked is that of gender. Despite all the talk of inclusion, Briter Bridges reported that 15% of the funded startups in 2020 had women as founders, co-founders, or C-level executives. Partech, on the other hand, places this number at 14%. There&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done to increase this figure, and we might see more early-stage firms looking to plug that gap.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crypto-currency pioneer and early Bitcoin thought-leader <a href="https://dianabiggs.com/">Diana Biggs</a> has joined Swiss-based startup <a href="https://valour.com">Valour</a>, which lets investors easily buy digital assets through their bank or broker. The move is significant with the news that Tesla has bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, thus massively boosting the mainstream markets for crypto assets. Biggs explored the potential for blockchain technology to help solve humanitarian challenges through her venture, Proof of Purpose, in 2017, and her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6TtI9qEiTU">TEDx speech on Blockchain Technology</a> that year is considered by many in the blockchain space to be one of the best in the genre.</p>
<p>Valour, a  Zug, Switzerland-based issuer of investment products, brought in Biggs, the former Private Banking Global Head of Innovation for HSBC, as CEO after recently launching <a href="https://valour.com/products/">Bitcoin Zero</a>, a fee-free, digital asset ETP product, which trades on the NGM stock exchange.</p>
<p>Biggs, who has been in the Bitcoin space since 2013 told TechCrunch: “I have never seen this much attention to Bitcoin and other crypto-assets&#8230; The time for decentralized technologies has arrived, and their potential is increasingly realized by institutional investors.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Johan Wattenström, the founder of Valour, said: “Diana is the perfect candidate to lead the company through this next phase of growth and expansion. With a wealth of experience in traditional finance, as well as fintech, and her vision for bringing digital assets into the mainstream, we feel very lucky to have her on board.” Wattenström created and listed the digital asset ETP on Nasdaq Nordic, in 2015.</p>
<p>Biggs is an Associate Fellow at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School and served as Head Tutor for their Blockchain Strategy Programme from 2018 to 2020. She is on the Board of the World Economic Forum’s Digital Leaders of Europe community and is a member of the Milken Institute’s Young Leaders Circle. Prior to joining Valour, Biggs was Global Head of Innovation for HSBC Private Banking, where she led on fintech partnerships and driving open innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a>, the U.K. challenger bank with just shy of 5 million customers, has recruited a new U.S CEO to head up its efforts states-side, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>Carol Nelson, who previously spent ten years as CEO of Cascade Bank and prior to that was a long time senior vice president of Bank of America, will start as early as next week, staff at Monzo were informed this morning. Notably, she has been a strategic advisor to Monzo U.S. for more than a year, so she&#8217;ll already be familiar with the bank&#8217;s U.S. ambitions and general culture.</p>
<p>Technically, Nelson takes over from TS Anil, who is now Monzo&#8217;s U.K. CEO and held both CEO titles temporarily after Monzo founder Blomfield relinquished CEO duties to become president in May. Then, last month, we broke news that Blomfield had decided to cease his involvement with Monzo entirely, the challenger bank and now fintech unicorn he founded six years ago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Details of Monzo&#8217;s U.S. ambitions first broke cover in January 2019 (again, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/04/monzo-american-dream/">thanks to this publication</a>), and were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/across-the-pondo/">officially confirmed</a> the following June. Since then, Monzo U.S. has only seen a tentative soft launch, reminiscent of its early U.K. beta all those years ago and an understanding that product-market-fit is key for different geographies.</p>
<p>The current U.S. team is still roughly ten people as the bank works through its U.S. banking charter application and supports a limited pool of U.S. customers. I understand there are currently over 20,000 signups to the U.S. waitlist, and that post pandemic Monzo will choose San Francisco for its U.S. HQ.</p>
<p>(In April last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/monzo-to-shutter-las-vegas/">Monzo shuttered its Las Vegas customer support office</a>, amid a round of cutbacks. However, that satellite office was to serve U.K. customers overnight and separate to its U.S. plans.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recruiting of a new U.S. CEO comes hot on the heels of Monzo reportedly raising further top up funding. First reported by Sky&#8217;s Mark Kleinman via a tweet (yes, really) and with additional details <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/monzo-uk-challenger-banking-fintech-bringing-in-new-us-investor-2021-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">sourced</a> by Business Insider, the challenger bank is closing a further £50 million, thought to be on the same terms as its recent Series G funding. Backing comes from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/monzo-the-u-k-challenger-bank-picks-up-additional-60m-in-funding/">existing investors</a> &#8212; Novator, and Kaiser &#8212; and new investor Octahedron Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://spacelift.io">Spacelift</a>, a startup that automates the management of cloud infrastructure, has raised $6 million in a Series A funding round led by London’s Blossom Capital. Polish fund Inovo Venture Partners and Hoxton Ventures are also investing.</p>
<p>The Polish and US-based startup is taking advantage of the opportunity presented by the increasingly complex cloud world, with what it dubs as an ‘infrastructure-as-code (IaC)’ and a ‘policy-as-code’ platform. This allows teams to automate processes, it says, in a more efficient manner without the risk of downtime.</p>
<p>Co-founder Marcin Wyszynski hit upon the idea after working for companies like Deliveroo in the UK and Berlin-based scooter operator TIER Mobility. The company is headquartered in Redwood City, California, US with an additional office in Warsaw, Poland.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wyszynski said in a statement: “The switch to using cloud servers and infrastructure as code has benefits for businesses but it has created new challenges for teams, particularly when they are distributed. The slightest mistake can cause major outages and downtime which is obviously bad for business. We designed Spacelift to minimize these issues, by providing automation, control, and visibility tools to teams wherever they are.”</p>
<p>Imran Ghory, co-founder and partner at Blossom Capital commented: “Managing infrastructure has been a persistent pain point for fast-growing teams and the need for specialized management tool platforms has been underlined by the fact that so many teams are now working remotely.”</p>
<p>Spacelift’s competitors include HashiCorp (which raised $349.2M) and Scalr (raised $7.5M).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since M-Pesa&#8217;s mobile money infrastructure came into play in 2007, there has been a proliferation of fintech services ranging from wallets to savings and loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this mobile money ecosystem growing in double-digits year-on-year, a lot of data is being created in the process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this has left some fragmentation, where one person&#8217;s information </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is diverse and can be accessed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> channels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For banks and financial institutions, it becomes difficult to understand and provide insights from users&#8217; data. Over the past three years, some platforms have looked to solve this problem. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> users&#8217; financial data and share it with these financial players through APIs driving more data-driven insights and value-added products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One such platform is </span><a href="https://pngme.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Africa-focused but U.S.-based unified financial data platform announced its seed round of $3 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment, led by</span><a href="https://t.sidekickopen87.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cN84YW5MlxqH2zGCwVN8Jbw_8QsRtKMnNpH2dnLGMN16gGDtf0YTm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW49HRfc3F4FngW4kBMz443Whc8f43SNpp04&amp;si=8000000001670236&amp;pi=00deaacb-fd0f-4671-ad3f-dcd18e9fd6ac"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Radical Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://t.sidekickopen87.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cN84YW5MlxqH2zGCwVN8Jbw_8QsRtKMnNpH2dnLGMN16gGDtf0YTm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW4mKLS-49HSjjW43Wg3M43Xxg2W3Fbt5S4cQh_BW4fGBqD1LxjkMW3zdYNw3zd14rF3K8RlSW1v31&amp;si=8000000001670236&amp;pi=00deaacb-fd0f-4671-ad3f-dcd18e9fd6ac"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Raptor Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://t.sidekickopen87.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cN84YW5MlxqH2zGCwVN8Jbw_8QsRtKMnNpH2dnLGMN16gGDtf0YTm101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW3ZSzDS3zfJ3pF43nppZmLX71&amp;si=8000000001670236&amp;pi=00deaacb-fd0f-4671-ad3f-dcd18e9fd6ac"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lateral Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://t.sidekickopen87.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cN84YW5MlxqH2zGCwVN8Jbw_8QsRtKMnNpH2dnLGMN16gGDtf0YTm101?te=W3R5hFj26QkHmW4mKDsX3F7y_dw3DJppJ48S2&amp;si=8000000001670236&amp;pi=00deaacb-fd0f-4671-ad3f-dcd18e9fd6ac"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">EchoVC</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was closed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Q3 2020 and came after the fintech startup raised $500,000 in pre-seed two years ago</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It further reflects the continued customer growth from banks, fintechs, credit bureaus and microfinance banks in Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendanplayford"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brendan Playford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caterung"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cate Rung</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Pngme started </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a lending platform in 2018</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Playford, who grew up in the U.K., came to East Africa in 2007 to work on philanthropic biofield projects. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He ended up writing short-term loans to entrepreneurs, particularly in Kenya and Tanzania, and during this time formed the basis for which he as CEO and Rung as COO founded Pngme</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That was sort of the impetus we needed and also the experience of being credit invisible in the U.K. led Cate and me to found the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focusing on providing access to finance to Africans,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Rung, the company&#8217;s initial thesis was that entrepreneurs didn&#8217;t get enough help, capital-wise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But g</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">oing into 2019, when the company raised its pre-seed round, the founders realized another problem &#8212; the lack of data infrastructure to access risk when giving out loans or capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their stint in an accelerator based in Toronto, Canada helped to better understand the more valuable version of the company &#8212; the B2C layer which connects entrepreneurs with finance or the data infrastructure layer to understand risk or a person&#8217;s financial identity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We were building two different companies at once, so we had to choose one path. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We realised that the data infrastructure layer was critical and a massive pain point in most of sub-Saharan Africa,&#8221; the COO added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme had to make a swift pivot to the latter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building this would have a much more significant impact. Being able to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mobile money transactions, bank transactions, loan data, behavioural data, process all that data into a structured format and make it available as an open API to developers, fintechs or banks across the continent will provide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">data to power real-time credit and new financial products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the company found out in the course of building that consumers want to understand their finances more</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This helps to navigate their way to financial wellness using credit and, later, more sophisticated products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, financial institutions need the data to know what customer segments to expand to or increase their bottom line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Therefore, placing emphasis on the customers&#8217; needs is one of the company&#8217;s core value propositions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re hyper-focused on providing the highest real-time data coverage on credit-invisible customers, something that no other API is offering in our markets,&#8221; said Playford regarding the company&#8217;s consumer-centric play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Pngme&#8217;s customers include <a href="https://www.simplefi.ng/">SimpleFi</a>, Pavelon, <a href="https://www.readycash.com.ng/">ReadyCash</a>, CashTopUp and <a href="https://www.rigomfb.com/">Rigo Microfinance</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to this, the CEO says the company will integrate with large institutional banks next month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite similarities to other API fintech startups in the region with Plaid-esque functionalities, Playford says Pngme intends to be different from the billion-dollar company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, its focus on traditional channels like USSD data &#8212; which has the highest financial coverage on the continent &#8212; attests to that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve gone a step beyond </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> providing rails to actually building on top of the data. We also provide machine learning insights for our customers,&#8221; Rung said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the platform&#8217;s SDK collects user-permissioned data through a partner’s existing app using a one-click data-sharing feature</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This data </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is served</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> up through an easy to integrate API that delivers real-time financial data and alerts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 300% month-on-month growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pngme forecasts the number of user-permissioned data profiles created on its platform to reach hundreds of thousands and millions by 2022</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pngme&#8217;s revenue model is subscription and API-call driven. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform has different tiers; developers can get a set number of free API calls with no subscription with the free tier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he enterprise tier for banks and fintech, API calls </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are charged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and can be discounted in some instances</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides that, the company has a white-glove onboarding process where Playford says developers and startups can reach out to build specific use cases on the platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since raising its pre-seed round, Pngme has been in stealth mode, working with a close group of customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But with this seed round, the company is going full tilt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Pngme, the investment is being used to grow its Lagos and Nairobi teams, particularly the engineers and data scientists, and scaling its product for banks, mobile money operators and fintechs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lateral Capital, one of the investors in this round, also backs another API fintech startup in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">Mono</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On the firm&#8217;s decision to invest in Pngme, managing partner, Rob Eloff said to TechCrunch that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;over the past five years, we have seen a growing appreciation for the continent-wide challenge of providing accurate relational data for financial services customers across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pngme, we are fortunate to have met a team with a unique solution to the root cause of financial exclusion in Africa, and a unique culture that spans the best of Africa and the U.S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For EchoVC Partners, a Lagos-based early-stage VC, it&#8217;s the remarkable job the Pngme team has done in building and delivering a unified financial data API platform for credit identity and access. This is according to Damilola Thompson, the VP and associate general counsel at the firm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, Pngme is processing millions in data points per month. With that scale, Rung </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hopes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it will lead to the creation of new technology and more sophisticated financial products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is most exciting is the way mobile money leapfrogged any sort of traditional financial infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is how we&#8217;re seeing open banking in the U.S. give way to so many new financial products for the end consumer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope that by providing forward-thinking open API layers, the same can happen in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India may soon have another fintech unicorn. BharatPe said on Thursday it has raised $108 million in a financing round that valued the New Delhi-based financial services startup at $900 million, up from $425 million last year.</p>
<p>Coatue Management led the three-year-old startup&#8217;s Series D round. Other six existing institutional investors &#8212; Ribbit Capital, Insight Partners, Steadview Capital, Beenext, Amplo and Sequoia Capital &#8212; also participated in the round, which brings BharatPe&#8217;s total to-date raise to $233 million in equity and $35 million in debt.</p>
<p>The startup said as part of the new financing round it returned $17.17 million to its angel investors and employees with stock option.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;With the balance sheet well capitalized (more than US$ 200M in bank), we are now going to keep our heads down and deliver US$30B TPV and build a loan book of US$ 700mn with small merchants by March 2023,&#8221; said Ashneer Grover, co-founder and chief executive of BharatPe.</p>
<p><a href="https://bharatpe.com/">BharatPe</a> operates an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/bharatpe-raises-75m-to-help-indian-merchants-accept-digital-payments-and-secure-working-capital/"> eponymous service to help offline merchants accept digital payments</a> and secure working capital. Even as India has already emerged as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/whatsapp-india-users-400-million/">second largest internet market</a>, with more than 600 million users, much of the country remains offline.</p>
<p>Among those outside of the reach of the internet are merchants running small businesses, such as roadside tea stalls and neighborhood stores. To make these merchants comfortable with accepting digital payments, BharatPe relies on QR codes and point of sale machines that support government-backed UPI payments infrastructure.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2111978" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111978" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2111978 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="527" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg 1722w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=768,395 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=680,350 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=1536,790 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bharatpe-neighborhood-store-india.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111978" class="wp-caption-text">Scores of giants and startups are attempting to serve neighborhood stores in India.</p></div></p>
<p>The startup, which serves over 6 million merchants, said it had deployed over 50,000 PoS machines by November of last year, and enables monthly transactions worth more than $123 million. It does not charge merchants for universal QR code access, but is looking to make money by lending. Grover said the startup&#8217;s lending business grew by 10x in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;This growth reiterates the trust that the small merchants and kirana store owners have showed in us. This is just the beginning of our journey and we are committed to build India’s largest B2B financial services company that can serve as one-stop destination for small merchants. For BharatPe, merchants will always be at the core of everything we build,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>BharatPe&#8217;s growth is impressive especially because it was not the first startup to help merchants. In a recent report to clients, analysts at Bank of America said BharatPe has proven that fintech is not the winner takes all market.</p>
<p>&#8220;BharatPe perhaps has the late mover advantages in the space. It was one of the first companies to act as a universal consolidator of QR codes on UPI, giving the merchant the advantage to have one QR code (eventually others like Paytm followed). Unlike its Fintech peers, BharatPe is not educating the merchants but instead following its larger peers who have already educated the merchants,&#8221; they wrote in the report, reviewed by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup, which has presence in 75 cities today, plans to further expand its network in the nation with the new fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.northmill.com/international/">Northmill Bank</a>, the Sweden-based challenger that has around 200,000 customers across three European countries, has raised around $30 million in new funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is M2 Asset Management, the Swedish investment company controlled by Rutger Arnhult, and asset management firm Coeli. The injection of cash will be used for continued geographical expansion and to accelerate the development of new products. Notably, this will include plans to launch in 10 new markets as Northmill aims to step on the gas. Next stop, Norway.</p>
<p>As it stands, 2006-founded Northmill is available in Sweden, Norway and Finland, where it competes with incumbent banks with physical branches and the likes of Lunar, Revolut and Klarna (which operates as a bank in its home country of Sweden, and Germany).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>More adjacent, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/21/anyfin/">another competitor is Anyfin</a>, which is similar to Northmill&#8217;s &#8220;Reduce&#8221; product, which promises to help customers consolidate their existing loans/credit and lower their interest payments. &#8220;Our fastest-growing product and main driver today is Reduce, which lowers people’s interest on existing credits, part-payments and credit cards,&#8221; explains a Northmill spokesperson.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Yqb81bKvzO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/">Making sense of Klarna</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Making sense of Klarna&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/making-sense-of-klarna/embed/#?secret=Yqb81bKvzO" data-secret="Yqb81bKvzO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Founded nearly 15 years ago and originally operating as a credit provider, in 2019 Northmill secured a full banking license, regulated by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. The bank employs 150 people and offers savings, credits, payments and insurances. More generally, it has taken a different and slower path than most of the newer crop of challengers in Europe, relying less on investment to fuel its growth and claims to have been profitable from nearly the get-go.</p>
<p>Cue statement from Rutger Arnhult, chairman of the board of M2 Assets Management: “Northmill Bank is already a profitable company with a proven and sustainable business model, which stands out among today&#8217;s tech investments. We have been following their journey for a while and have been impressed by the founders, as well as the company. The banking market is well on its way to change and the winners will be those who best can adapt to the new digital reality. For me, this is an investment in a tech company with long-term owners, who are just at the beginning of their journey. I see great growth potential in the bank.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This afternoon Bumble priced its IPO at <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/10/2173640/0/en/Bumble-Inc-Prices-2-2-Billion-IPO.html">$43 per share,</a> ahead of its raised IPO range of $37 to $39 per share.</p>
<p>Bumble <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/bumble-files-to-go-public/">filed to go public in mid-January</a>, and offered up its first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">price range on February 2</a>. That range, $28 to $30 per share, wound up coming up short. Bumble <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/with-a-higher-ipo-valuation-is-bumble-aiming-for-match-coms-revenue-multiple/">raised its price range to $37 to $39 per share earlier this week</a>.</p>
<p>Before counting a possible underwriters&#8217; option, Bumble raised $2.15 billion by selling 50,000,000 million shares in its public offering. The company will begin to trade tomorrow morning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bumble&#8217;s debut comes amidst a number of other 2021 offerings, including MetroMile&#8217;s SPAC-led public combination earlier this week. Other well-known companies are anticipated to list this year, including Coinbase and, perhaps, Robinhood.</p>
<p>The public offering of Bumble shares comes after a sustained period when one company, Match, was presumed to be the only possible public dating company. However, the smaller Bumble has proven that there is room for at least one more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://scalarr.io/">Scalarr</a>, a startup that says it uses machine learning to combat ad fraud, is announcing that it has raised $7.5 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The company was founded by CEO Inna Ushakova and CPO Yuriy Yashunin, who previously led the mobile marketing agency Zenna. Ushakova told me that while at Zenna, they realized that ad fraud had grown to the point that it posed a real threat to their business.</p>
<p>At the same time, the team wasn&#8217;t impressed by any of the existing anti-fraud solutions, so it built its own technology. Eventually, they shut down Zenna completely and moved the entire team over to Scalarr.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s products include AutoBlock, which is supposed to detect fraud before the advertiser bids on an ad, and DeepView, which is used by adtech platforms (including ad exchanges, demand-side platforms and supply-side platforms).</p>
<p>Scalarr says it can detect 60% more fraud than existing products on the market and that it saved its clients $22 million in ad fraud refunds in 2020. Ushakova attributed this in large part to the startup&#8217;s extensive use of machine learning technology.</p>
<p>She added that while large ad attribution companies are adding anti-fraud products, they aren&#8217;t the focus. And historically, companies have tried to detect fraud through a &#8220;rules-based approach,&#8221; where there&#8217;s a list of behaviors that suggest fraudulent activity — but no matter how quickly they create those rules, it&#8217;s hard to keep up with the fraudsters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fraud is ever evolving,&#8221; Ushakova said. &#8220;It’s like a Tom and Jerry game, so they are ahead of you and we are trying to catch them.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for why machine learning works so much more effectively, she said, &#8220;Only ML could help you predict the next step, and with ML, you should be able to detect abnormalities that are not classified. Right after that, our analytics should be able to take a look at those abnormalities and decide whether something is statistically important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scalarr&#8217;s Series A was led by the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, with participation from TMT Investments, OTB Ventures and Speedinvest. Among other things, the company will use the money to expand its presence in Asia and continue developing the product.</p>
