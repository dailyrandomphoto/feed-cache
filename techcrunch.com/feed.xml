										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM has launched a series of new subsidiaries in the past year tackling electrification, connectivity and even insurance — all part of the automaker&#8217;s aim to find value (and profits) beyond its traditional business of making, selling and financing vehicles. These startups, including numerous ones that will never make the cut, get their start under Vice President of Innovation Pam Fletcher&#8217;s watch.</p>
<p>Fletcher, who joined TechCrunch on June 9 at the virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> event, runs a group of 170 people developing and launching startups with a total addressable market of about $1.3 trillion.</p>
<p>Today, about 19 companies are making their way through the incubator in hopes of joining recent GM startups like OnStar Guardian, OnStar Insurance, GM Defense and BrightDrop, the commercial electric vehicle delivery business that launched in January. Not everything will make it, Fletcher told the audience, noting &#8220;we add new things all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launching any startup presents challenges. But launching multiple startups within a 113-year-old automaker that employs 155,000 people globally is another, more complex matter. The bar, which determines whether these startups are ever publicly launched, is specific and high. A GM startup has to be a new idea that can attract new customers and grow the total addressable market for the automaker, using existing assets and IP.</p>
<h2>The Volt effect</h2>
<p>The 2010 Chevrolet Volt is a noteworthy moment on the GM timeline. The vehicle marked the company&#8217;s first commercial push into electrification since the 1990s EV1 program. Fletcher, who was the chief engineer of the Chevy Volt propulsion system from 2008 to 2011, noted that the Volt was the beginning of a change within the automaker that eventually led to other commercial products including the all-electric Chevy Bolt, the hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise and its current work on autonomous vehicle development with its subsidiary Cruise.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t know that the Volt was a root exactly of what we&#8217;re seeing today. But I think it was definitely the start of a groundswell of really looking at, how do we inject technology that customers are excited about and care about quickly? How do we engage them deeply in the process? … Which we&#8217;ve always done … just, I think there was a climate there where the appetite was so strong with a certain group of customers for the technology that it allowed us to get really a front row seat with them, which was game changing for those of us on the frontlines. And obviously, there have been many programs that have had that in their own ways, but you really see that accelerating now with the advent of everything we&#8217;re doing in electrification and autonomous and a portfolio that is just emerging even to the notion of applying some of these great technologies to our new full size, truck and SUV programs. So it&#8217;s really broad, based across the company, which is exciting. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 4:56)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Fletcher explained how working to commercialize new technology changed how the company interacted with customers.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With new technologies, one, you get to a new customer base sometimes. So, really understanding what that customer is looking like and putting them at the center of everything. Also, different technologies have different development processes and timelines and pipelines for activity. So, it really allowed us to start to think about how to approach each step of our product development and customer engagement differently. And the Volt was an interesting time too, because that was the advent of new social media was really starting to become much more popular. And so we were very connected with those customers and a great customer base that gave us tremendous feedback very directly, you know, through at the time, what was a new channel. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 3:50)<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is making it even easier to buy stuff while you scroll past photos of your high school lab partner&#8217;s dog. Yes, Instagram Shops and Facebook Marketplace are already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/instagram-swaps-out-its-activity-tab-for-shop-in-new-global-test/">displayed prominently</a> on the apps&#8217; bottom navigation tabs. But now, you can shop on WhatsApp too, along with other updates.</p>
<p>Today on a Live Audio Room, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/new-ways-to-shop-for-products-you-love-across-our-apps/">three e-commerce updates</a> that are coming to Facebook products: Shops on WhatsApp and Marketplace, Shops Ads, and Instagram Visual Search.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than 1 billion people use Marketplace each month, so we&#8217;re making it easy for businesses to bring their Shops into Marketplace to reach even more people,&#8221; Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113319652002411">wrote</a> in a Facebook post. When customers view a shop on WhatsApp, they&#8217;ll have the option of chatting with a business before buying something.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2168854" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/whatsapp.jpeg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>At its F8 conference earlier this month, Facebook revealed updates to WhatsApp for Business &#8212; previously, it could take weeks to set up a business account, but now, businesses can sign up in just a few minutes. Though WhatsApp has more than 2 billion global users, only about 175 million people message with WhatsApp Business accounts daily for things like customer support. Since Facebook has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/instagram-adds-affiliate-and-shop-features-for-creators/">pushing e-commerce</a> on platforms like Instagram, it makes sense that this initiative will expand to WhatsApp too.</p>
<p>The rollout for Shops in WhatsApp will start soon, and Shops inventory in Marketplace is available now for Shops in the US with on-site checkout.</p>
<p>The next feature, Shops Ads, aims to provide a more individualized shopping experience based on people&#8217;s individual shopping habits. Zuckerberg said, &#8220;We&#8217;re launching the ability for a business to send shoppers to where you&#8217;re going to be most likely to make a purchase based on your shopping behavior.&#8221; Starting now, AR Dynamic Ads are available in the United States – companies like Huda Beauty and Laura Mercier are using these ads to let customers test lipstick shades with AR before making a purchase. These AR try-on experiences are made available through API integrations with Modiface and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/perfect-corp-developer-of-virtual-beauty-app-youcam-makeup-closes-50-million-series-c-led-by-goldman-sachs/">Perfect Corp</a>. Early this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/22/pinterest-launches-an-ar-powered-try-on-experience-for-eyeshadow/">Pinterest collaborated with ModiFace</a> to launch an AR eyeshadow try-on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168855" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168855" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168855" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AR-Dynamic-Ads.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="623" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AR-Dynamic-Ads.jpeg 890w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AR-Dynamic-Ads.jpeg?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AR-Dynamic-Ads.jpeg?resize=300,275 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AR-Dynamic-Ads.jpeg?resize=768,704 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AR-Dynamic-Ads.jpeg?resize=680,623 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AR-Dynamic-Ads.jpeg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168855" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Over on Instagram, an AI-based Visual Search feature will roll out for testing in the coming months.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of shopping discovery begins with visual discovery, right, so you see something that you think is awesome. And then, you know, maybe you want to see other products that are like that, or you want to figure out how to get that product,&#8221; Zuckerberg explained. &#8220;And this is the type of problem that AI can really help out with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using this AI, people will be able to upload their own photos &#8212; even ones they haven&#8217;t posted on Instagram &#8212; to find similar items. Facebook isn&#8217;t the first company to use this technology &#8212; see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/cadeera-is-doing-ai-visual-search-for-home-decor/">Cadeera</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/donde-search-picks-up-6-million-to-help-fashion-retailers-with-visual-search/">Donde Search</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/syte/">Stye.ai</a>, for instance. But bringing this technology to major platforms might change the way we shop, which seems to be Facebook&#8217;s current goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The hubbub surrounding the autonomous vehicle industry often focuses on venture capital rounds, speculation about IPOs and acquisitions. But the industry&#8217;s future also hinges on the high-stakes task of proving the technology can operate safer than human drivers do today and gaining the public&#8217;s trust. In short: safety matters.</p>
<p>Zoox <a href="https://www.zoox.com/safety/">issued a safety report</a> Tuesday that aims to give new insight into its custom electric autonomous vehicle and describes in greater detail various design details aimed at preventing crashes and protecting if they do.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you know, and something everybody keeps talking about, is that part of the rationale for doing AVs is because of safety, safety, safety, but they never get to the next bullet [point] right? What are you going to actually do to prevent those crashes, to save those lives?&#8221; Mark Rosekind, the company&#8217;s chief safety innovation officer and former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told TechCrunch in a recent interview.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rosekind says this latest report answers those questions.</p>
<p>Zoox is a bit different from its rivals. It isn&#8217;t just developing the self-driving software stack. The company is responsible for creating the on-demand ride-sharing app and the vehicle itself. Zoox also plans to own, manage and operate its robotaxi fleet.</p>
<p>Zoox unveiled in December the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-zoox-unveils-electric-robotaxi-that-can-travel-up-to-75-mph/">electric, autonomous robotaxi</a> it built from the ground up &#8212; a cube-like vehicle loaded with sensors, no steering wheel and a moonroof that is capable of transporting four people at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour. At the time, Zoox shared a few specs on the four-seat vehicle, including the face-to-face symmetrical seating configuration, similar to what a train traveler might encounter, and the 133 kilowatt-hour battery that the company said allows it to operate for up to 16 continuous hours on a single charge. But not everything was revealed, particularly details about how it would protect occupants in the vehicle as well as the pedestrians, cyclists and other drivers it will be sharing the road with.</p>
<p>To be clear, Zoox is not the only AV company issuing safety reports. Voluntary safety self-assessment reports, or VSSAs, have become fairly common in the industry. These voluntary safety reports, which are included in <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/automated-driving-systems/voluntary-safety-self-assessment">NHTSA&#8217;s Automated Driving Systems VSSA Disclosure Index</a>, are supposed to cover 12 areas, including the vehicle&#8217;s design, crash simulation scenarios and benchmarks for testing, as well as protective measures for occupants and other road users.</p>
<p>Zoox&#8217;s <a href="https://www.zoox.com/safety/">first safety report</a> came out in 2018, which outlined the company&#8217;s &#8220;prevent and protect&#8221; philosophy. This latest one reveals how Zoox plans to meet its safety goals, including specific details on the design of the vehicle. And more safety reports are coming — per a few hints in this latest one — including details about its collision avoidance system and the lighting system the vehicle uses for communicating with other road users.</p>
<p>Zoox has designed and included more than 100 safety innovations into its purpose-built vehicle. Rosekind shared details on nine of them that fall into three categories: driving control, no single point of failure and rider protection.</p>
<h2>Driving control</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2168810" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168810" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168810 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg" alt="Zoox at Coit Tower" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-at-Coit-Tower.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168810" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zoox</p></div></p>
<p>Zoox&#8217;s vehicle has independent braking and an active suspension system, which means that each of the brakes has its own electronic control unit, allowing for more control over traction on the road and weight distribution. All of that translates to shorter stopping distances.</p>
<p>The vehicle also has four-wheel steering, which Rosekind noted doesn&#8217;t exist on any AV car on the road today, and is bidirectional. Four-wheel steering allows the vehicle to simultaneously adjust where it is headed and its position within the lane.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once our software has determined the path for the vehicle, it&#8217;ll stay on that path down to centimeters accuracy — even at speed through a curb, Rosekind explained.</p>
<p>The four-wheel steering combined with the vehicle&#8217;s <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">symmetrical design allows for it to travel bidirectionally. The bidirectional capability means no more U-turns or three-point turns, two </span>maneuvers<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that are more complex, time consuming and can make occupants more vulnerable to oncoming traffic. </span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 12">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<h2>No single point of failure</h2>
</div>
<p>Rosekind said the company&#8217;s design objective was that there would be no single point of failure for its safety critical systems. For instance, the vehicle has two powertrains. The motors, drive systems and batteries work in conjunction with each other. If one component in the system fails, the other one will take over.</p>
<p>The vehicle also has two batteries as well as a safety diagnostics system that monitors all of the hardware, software and firmware. Sensors like lidar and radar are also placed on the four corners of the vehicle — each one provides a 270-degree field of view.</p>
<p>The diagnostic system goes beyond monitoring and will<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> mitigate a failure or performance problem that it identifies. For instance, if a sensor has degraded performance from damage or debris, it will activate a cleaning system on the vehicle or turn it from </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">bidirectional to unidirectional, placing the sensor in a position where it basically doesn&#8217;t matter if it is obscured, Rosekind explained. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fail-safe operational means it&#8217;s going to continue the ride, let you out, and then go take care of whatever the issue is, or pull over to a safe spot,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Rider protection</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2168801" style="width: 2810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168801" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2168801 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png" alt="Zoox Seatbelt Notification" width="2800" height="1575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png 2800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zoox-Seatbelt-Notification.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168801" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zoox</p></div></p>
<p>Zoox&#8217;s goal is for its vehicle to meet five-star crash protection for every seat in the vehicle. The vehicles are currently going through crash testing now, Rosekind said, adding that it is &#8220;going quite well and almost complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company also designed a new kind of airbag system that contains five different airbags. Curtain airbags are on each side of the vehicle, a frontal one is divided in two parts to protect the head, neck and chest. There are also rear and side seat airbags.</p>
</div>
<p>Within the system is an airbag control unit that can monitor where a collision is coming as well as the velocity and determine which airbags and in what order to deploy. Instead of every airbag deploying at once, they will inflate based on the collision location and the severity of the impact.</p>
<p>Finally, the vehicle has sensors in the seat, the buckle and even the coating on the webbing of the seatbelt to be able to tell if passengers are using the seatbelt. The vehicle will not start until everybody&#8217;s buckled up, Rosekind said.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherine-cat-c-6b077915b/">Cat Contillo</a> is a proud queer autistic and a Threat Analyst II at <a href="https://www.huntress.com/">Huntress</a>. She's passionate about LGBTQ+ rights, autism, neurodiversity, DEI and cybersecurity.	</div>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Addressing the skills gap and strengthening your own security team means bringing in different minds and perspectives — and that starts with embracing neurodiversity. To even have a chance at closing the cybersecurity skills gap, we need people with a variety of different abilities and thought processes. But did you know that there’s an untapped potential in individuals who are neurodivergent?</p>
<p><a href="https://ndpathways.org/neurodiversity-overview/">Neurodiversity</a> can mean different things to different people. It’s a concept that views the spectrum of neurological differences — like ADHD, autism, dyslexia, Tourette’s and other cognitive and developmental disorders — as natural variations of the human brain. In a nutshell, neurodiversity recognizes that brain differences are just that: differences.</p>
<p>I was always aware of the fact that I had a different operating system. It was like growing up on a Mac OS, but made specifically for Windows OS. It wasn’t until I was diagnosed as autistic that I understood why I am the way that I am. My diagnosis gave me a purpose. It’s a purpose I’ve taken with me into the working world, and it’s helped me realize how vital neurodiverse individuals can and will be to the cybersecurity industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>There are many inherent traits in people with autism that are well suited for working in cybersecurity. For example, many people with autism are pattern thinkers and are highly detail-oriented. This allows someone in a threat-hunting position to find those subtle differences between malicious and nonmalicious code and catch the threats that automated tools might miss. We also have the ability to hyperfocus, which allows us to concentrate on problem-solving and stick with complex issues that other people may abandon.</p>
<p>Of course, we all have a different set of skills, interests, strengths and weaknesses. But there are some characteristics that — when given the right support and environment — can translate to cybersecurity positively.</p>
<p>This is especially true when autistic adults are interested in technology and cybersecurity. Their interest can complement their attention to detail, which can make for a successful blue team cyber professional. The number and types of cyber threats are constantly changing. Some are obvious to hunt down, and some are much more subtle. Some malware even has the ability to &#8220;live off the land&#8221; by using already created applications or executables that live natively on a computer. Knowing this information, and knowing what to look for and where to hone in, allows a neurodivergent person to consistently inspect, investigate and hunt down even the most persistent threats.</p>
<h2>Embrace the benefits</h2>
<p>Instead of focusing on what makes a neurodivergent person “different,” we should embrace the benefits that different minds and viewpoints bring to the field of cybersecurity. Let’s face it: The world is going to need more cybersecurity professionals. Ensuring diversity in these teams includes embracing neurodiversity. Having a blend of unique talents provided by these detail-oriented, rule-bound, logical and independent-thinking individuals is — and will be — a competitive edge in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Having a career in cybersecurity typically requires logic, discipline, curiosity and the ability to solve problems and find patterns. This is an industry that offers a wide spectrum of positions and career paths for people who are neurodivergent, particularly for roles in threat analysis, threat intelligence and threat hunting.</p>
<p>Neurodiverse minds are usually great at finding the needle in the haystack, the small red flags and minute details that are critical for hunting down and analyzing potential threats. Other strengths include pattern recognition, thinking outside the box, attention to detail, a keen sense of focus, methodical thinking and integrity.</p>
<p>The more diverse your teams are, the more productive, creative and successful they will be. And not only can neurodiverse talent help strengthen cybersecurity, employing different minds and perspectives can also solve communication problems and create a positive impact for both your team and your company.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, the demand for Information Security Analysts — one of the common career paths for cybersecurity professionals — is expected to grow 31% by 2029, much higher than the average growth rate of 4% for other occupations. While vital jobs in cybersecurity are going unfilled, millions of smart people who&#8217;d be ideally suited for the work remain unemployed.</p>
<h2>Taking the first step</h2>
<p>It’s time to challenge the assumption that qualified talent equals neurotypicality. There are many steps companies can take to ensure inclusivity and promote belonging in the workplace. Let’s start all the way at the beginning and focus on job postings.</p>
<p>Job postings should be black and white in terms of the information they are asking for and the job requirements. Start by making job postings more inclusive and less constrictive in what is being required. Include a contact email address where an applicant can ask for accommodations, and provide a less traditional approach by providing these accommodations.</p>
<p>Traditional interviews can be a challenge for neurodivergent individuals, and this is often the first hurdle to employment. For example, to ease some candidates’ nerves, you could provide a list of questions that will be asked as a guideline. More importantly, don’t judge someone based on their lack of eye contact.</p>
<p>To promote an inclusive and belonging culture of neurodiversity in the workplace, the workplace should be more supportive of different needs. It is vital to ensure employees at all levels have the knowledge and understanding on how to empower a diverse team and create an open and inclusive workplace. This starts with diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging training for all employees. Companies should also consider changing their communication style. Neurodiverse individuals communicate differently and not altering the way you communicate could lead to a disconnect in the workplace.</p>
<p>My advice to other neurodivergent and/or autistic adults looking to break into the cybersecurity field is to continue your learning, connect with cybersecurity professionals for networking purposes and never give up. The more we push for awareness and inclusion in all aspects of all companies — small and large — the more opportunities there will be for success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This Thursday, Apple will <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-tower-theatre-opens-thursday-in-downtown-los-angeles/">mark the opening of a new store in downtown Los Angeles</a>. The space occupies the newly renovated Tower Theatre, which opened in DTLA’s Broadway Theater District in 1927. Among other milestones, the 900-seat theater was the first in LA to be wired for the talkies, hosting a premier of &#8220;The Jazz Singer&#8221; that same year. Not for nothing, it was also the first theater in the city with air conditioning.</p>
<p>Apple Tower Theatre is actually the company’s 26<sup>th</sup> store in greater LA. Obviously, though, moving into a 94-year-old theater takes a fair bit more work than, say, a shopping mall. The store has been in the works for a number of years, owing in part to having to work with the city to restore a space that had been declared a landmark.</p>

<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-apple-downtown-20180802-story.html#">an LA Times article back in 2018</a> noted that the space, “may also serve as a declaration that Apple intends to compete as a major Hollywood content creator.” In hindsight, fair enough. Apple TV+ launched late the following year.</p>

<p>The theater has actually been largely unoccupied since 1988, which clearly meant even more work had to go into shining up the walls and making the grand old theater presentable for that modern retail vibe &#8212; not to mention a seismic upgrade to help make it more earthquake proof.</p>
<p>The company also notes that it took care to maintain some of the space’s more iconic elements.</p>

<p>“Apple Tower Theatre anchors the corner of Eighth Street and Broadway, where visitors will immediately recognize the fully restored clock tower, recreated Broadway marquee, clean terra cotta exterior, and renovated historic blade sign,” Apple writes. “After walking through the Broadway doors, guests enter the monumental lobby inspired by Charles Garnier’s Paris Opera House, featuring a grand arched stairway with bronze handrails flanked by marble Corinthian columns.”</p>
<p>The store’s opening also marks the launch of Apple’s new <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-launches-today-at-apple-creative-studios/">Creative Studios initiative</a>. The LA store and a location in Beijing will be the first to get the program. In its initial form, it will run between eight and 12 weeks, providing a group of mentors from the creative arts.</p>

<p>“Creativity and access to education are core values for Apple, so we are absolutely thrilled to kick off today at Apple Creative Studios in Los Angeles and Beijing and to bring this meaningful program to several more cities this year,” SVP Deirdre O’Brien said in a press release. “Building on our long history of using stores as a venue to host local artists to educate and inspire, Creative Studios is one more way we’re providing free arts education to those who need it most.”</p>
<p>Last week, Google launched its first retail store in Manhattan&#8217;s Chelsea district. The Apple Tower Theatre location opens at 10 a.m. local time on Thursday, June 24. The company says it&#8217;s employing nearly 100 to keep the store running.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">purchase of MGM</a> must pass the scrutiny of the FTC, newly chaired by prominent Amazon critic Lina Khan, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-planned-purchase-of-mgm-to-be-reviewed-by-ftc-11624379614">the Wall Street Journal has reported</a>. While the $8.45M merger is not likely to be stopped, it may provide early indicators of how the agency is revising its approach to mega-corporations consolidating multiple industries with acquisitions like this one.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition was announced last month, and the addition of MGM&#8217;s 4,000 films and 17,000 shows to the Amazon library would be a potent shot in the arm for Prime Video, which like the Amazon storefront itself is meant to be its customers&#8217; default go-to for on-demand media.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="M95imZyEiM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">Amazon is buying MGM Studios for $8.45B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon is buying MGM Studios for $8.45B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/embed/#?secret=M95imZyEiM" data-secret="M95imZyEiM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As rights change hands and companies shift tactics, the landscape of streaming is ever-changing; while Netflix has focused on original content (and Amazon is not far behind) and Disney has its own stable of standbys, others have begun snapping up the disparate collections of shows and movies that make up the streaming industry&#8217;s lucrative long tail.</p>
<p>Yet there is a valid question among regulators of whether content companies like MGM should be owned by platforms like Amazon. As an independent producer of films and TV a company can secure its own licensing deals and operate in direct competition with similar businesses. As a subsidiary of Amazon, it would likely be in large part reduced to an in-house production company for the retail and web giant, not competing on the merits of its products but as part of a multi-industry empire.</p>
<p>FTC Chair Lina Khan — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">appointed just last week</a> — has been among the foremost critics of the latter business model. Her now famous &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox&#8221; paper asserted that Amazon uses dominance in one industry, like AWS in web hosting, to shore up other less successful arms, like its nascent delivery service. If the latter would fail without the support of the former, the argument (roughly) goes, the company is potentially engaging in anti-competitive behavior enabled by market power.</p>
<p>That the market power and the behavior are in different verticals excused it under the antitrust doctrine of the recent era (so long as consumers didn&#8217;t see price increases), but Khan aimed to challenge that doctrine with her paper — and now, as one of the most powerful regulators in the country, she has been given the chance to shape it firsthand.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2ccrSKF8c7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">Biden elevates tech antitrust crusader Lina Khan to FTC chair</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Biden elevates tech antitrust crusader Lina Khan to FTC chair&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/embed/#?secret=2ccrSKF8c7" data-secret="2ccrSKF8c7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Such large deals are always reviewed by federal authorities, and in this case the FTC is reportedly in charge, probably because it has already taken on the role of antitrust investigation into Amazon in other circumstances. It&#8217;s also handling Facebook (which it has tangled with repeatedly over the years), while the agency&#8217;s enforcement partners at the Justice Department took charge of looking into Google and Apple. (The FTC declined to comment, saying it does not confirm the existence of investigations.)</p>
<p>In this case it seems unlikely that the Amazon purchase of MGM will be blocked, seeing as there is certainly real competition in the space and MGM has not been able to make its own way — a sale is almost inevitable. But the review will take place nonetheless, and it will likely elucidate how the FTC has changed its approach to this type of merger.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible that even in a light-touch approval of this deal there will be opportunity to see new doctrine in play; for example, Amazon&#8217;s arguably monopolistic position in ostensibly unrelated markets is likely to take a greater role than under previous FTC leadership. It may even set the stage for more comprehensive and aggressive reviews to come, or perhaps even rewinding previously approved mergers, something Chair Khan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/lina-khans-timely-tech-skepticism-makes-for-a-refreshingly-friendly-ftc-confirmation-hearing/">has said is a distinct possibility</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Max Q is a weekly newsletter from TechCrunch all about space. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here to receive it weekly on Mondays in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>This week, China started staffing up its own space station, and Rocket Lab got the nod from NASA to develop small satellites for the purposes of exploring Mars. Meanwhile, space startups continue to raise money and it doesn&#8217;t look like the pace of that is going to slow much heading into summer.</p>
<h2>China delivers 3 astronauts to its space station</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2167461" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shenzhou-12.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167461" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2167461" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shenzhou-12.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shenzhou-12.jpeg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shenzhou-12.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shenzhou-12.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shenzhou-12.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shenzhou-12.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shenzhou-12.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/shenzhou-12.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2167461" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pT_btrIRqc&amp;ab_channel=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China News Service <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>China has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/china-launches-3-astronauts-to-its-new-space-station-core-module/">launched astronauts to its space station for the first time</a>, delivering three to the station&#8217;s core module, where they&#8217;ll remain for a mission that lasts until September. This is the first time China has flown a crewed mission since 2012, and it&#8217;s also going to set a record for the longest period of time a Chinese astronaut has remained in space continuously.</p>
<p>This will be a big step forward for China&#8217;s space program, and a key evolution of its ambitions to establish a continuous presence in low Earth orbit. China is not an International Space Station partner, and no Chinese nationals have ever set foot aboard that station. The European Space Agency had welcomed overtures for them to participate as a member nation in the ISS last decade, but the US refused.</p>
<p>China has sated outright that it will welcome participation in its space station from foreign astronauts, though there hasn&#8217;t been any specific agreements put in place for who those might be, or from what countries.</p>
<h2>Rocket Lab will build two orbital research spacecraft for a mission to Mars</h2>

<p>Rocket Lab has landed a contract of a different sort from its usual business, tapped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/rocket-lab-to-design-two-orbital-spacecraft-for-nasa-to-study-mars/">build small spacecraft that will go to Mars</a> and perform valuable science and exploration missions on behalf of NASA and its partners. These will make use of Rocket Lab&#8217;s Photon platform, which is a satellite platform that it originally developed as one of its value-add offerings for its launch customers.</p>
<p>This is unique for Rocket Lab because the spacecraft its developing won&#8217;t be launched aboard a Rocket Lab Electron spacecraft, and will instead fly them on a commercial rocket to be selected by NASA in a separate contract process that will happen later.</p>

<p>Some interesting funding rounds this week, including<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/hydrosat-raises-5m-seed-round-to-deliver-ground-temperature-data-to-customers/"> $5 million for Hydrosat,</a> a company that&#8217;s spotting ground temperature from space and providing that to customers for use in industries like agriculture, wildfire and drought risk, water table information and more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While Amazon's marketplace has proved a boon for businesses trying to get off the ground, many successful companies are now looking beyond the fences, spurred by a desire to compete on their own terms.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon commands a vast, dominating empire in the world of e-commerce. While its marketplace has proved a boon for businesses trying to get off the ground, many of the more successful companies are now looking beyond the e-commerce giant&#8217;s fences, spurred by a desire to compete on their own terms.</p>
<p>This trend has mushroomed as online shopping burgeoned over the past five years. Businesses such as mattress maker<a href="http://casper.com"> Casper</a>, men&#8217;s personal care brands<a href="https://www.harrys.com"> Harry&#8217;s</a> and<a href="https://www.dollarshaveclub.com/"> Dollar Shave Club</a>, footwear and apparel makers<a href="https://www.allbirds.com/"> Allbirds</a> and<a href="https://www.zaful.com/"> Zaful</a>, gadget store<a href="https://www.banggood.com/"> Banggood</a>, and power-bank maker<a href="https://us.anker.com/"> Anker</a> are just a few of the multitude of brands that choose to leverage their own web stores, social media presence and supply chains to build their business and identity without having a marketplace like Amazon get in the way.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Every investor and e-commerce exporter we spoke with noted the genius of Shein&#8217;s supply chain management.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a href="https://us.shein.com/">Shein</a>, an online-only apparel store that sells the latest in fashion at very affordable prices, is a shining example of this trend. It&#8217;s a rage among budget-conscious young adults across Europe, Asia and the Americas: The app was downloaded 14 million times in the United States in March, according to Apptopia, and currently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/shein-overtakes-amazon/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> dominates the shopping category in app stores</a> in over 50 countries.</p>
<p>Its success is proof of its belief in bringing the latest trends to the masses as quickly as it can. In the past couple of decades, brands like Zara, H&amp;M and Forever 21 earned themselves the &#8220;fast fashion&#8221; moniker when they turned the tables on global behemoths such as Gap and Calvin Klein by drastically shortening lead times — the time it takes for clothing to reach the store floor from the designer&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>Shein takes this fast fashion mindset one step further: While brands like Zara and H&amp;M take about three to four weeks to bring clothing from the ramp to the store, Shein uses a combination of real-time customer and predictive analytics, hyperaware fashion designers and an extremely quick and agile supply chain based in China to bring the latest fashion trends from Instagram, Facebook, Reddit and TikTok to its online store in just a week or two.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In Twitter&#8217;s latest appeal to one-up competitors from Clubhouse to Patreon, the company announced today that it will begin rolling out applications for Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces.</p>
<p>Twitter first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">teased the Super Follow feature</a> during an Analyst Day event in February. Super Follows allow creators on Twitter to generate monthly revenue by offering paywalled content to followers who subscribe to them for $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month. To be eligible, users over the age of 18 need to have 10,000 followers and at least 25 tweets in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Twitter will only take 3% of creators&#8217; revenue after in-app purchase fees – but, on the App Store and Google Play, in-app purchase fees are 30%, which means that creators will take home about two-thirds of what their followers are paying. Once they exceed $50,000 of lifetime earnings on Twitter, the app will take &#8220;20% of future earnings after fees.&#8221; When combined with the 30% in-app purchase fee, that leaves creators with about half of their followers&#8217; payments. Meanwhile, Patreon only takes between 5% and 12% of a creator&#8217;s earnings (it bypasses in-app purchase fees since it&#8217;s a web-based platform). While creators who primarily engage with their audience on Twitter might benefit from having a way to monetize without directing followers to another app, the difference in payout here is stark. Creators might not abandon their existing Patreon systems for Super Follows, but at the very least, this could offer a supplemental income stream.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to elevate people driving the conversations on Twitter and help them earn money,&#8221; said senior product manager Esther Crawford. &#8220;We updated our revenue share cuts after spending more time thinking about how we could support emerging voices on Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168627" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168627" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png 3308w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-20581_iOS_Static_EN_39_20210615.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168627" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Ticketed Spaces seem more promising though, since Clubhouse, Spotify Greenroom, and other competitors don&#8217;t offer similar options yet (Discord is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/discord-stage-discovery/">testing ticketed audio events</a> on its Stage Discovery portal, but they aren&#8217;t out yet). Through Ticketed Spaces, users can set their ticket price anywhere between $1 and $999. Creators can also limit how many tickets are sold, which might incentivize someone to actually use the $999 ticket price for a one-on-one conversation with a celebrity (still&#8230; yikes?). Twitter will remind attendees that the Ticketed Space is happening through push and in-app notifications. Users over the age of 18 that have hosted 3 Spaces in the last 30 days and have at least 1,000 followers are eligible to apply for access.</p>
<p>Clubhouse and Instagram have features that let listeners <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/clubhouse-payments/">tip speakers</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/">award badges</a> in a live audio space, but the apps don&#8217;t yet allow for advance ticket sales. Another way for top creators to make money on these apps is through Creator Funds. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Spotify Greenroom</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/clubhouse-announces-plans-for-creator-payments-and-raises-new-funding-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Clubhouse</a> have both announced plans for Creator Funds, but it&#8217;s not yet clear how the earning potential will compare with selling access to Ticketed Spaces on Twitter.</p>
<p>This slew of updates to Twitter comes after activist shareholders attempted to oust CEO Jack Dorsey last year. Now, Twitter is rapidly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitters-acquisition-strategy-eat-the-public-conversation/">adding new features and acquiring companies</a> like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a> (a newsletter platform), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-acquihires-creative-agency-ueno-to-help-design-new-products/">Ueno</a> (a creative agency), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">Breaker</a> (a social podcasting platform).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168625" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168625" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2168625" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-21783-How-to-apply-20210615.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="451" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-21783-How-to-apply-20210615.png 4992w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-21783-How-to-apply-20210615.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-21783-How-to-apply-20210615.png?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-21783-How-to-apply-20210615.png?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-21783-How-to-apply-20210615.png?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-21783-How-to-apply-20210615.png?resize=1536,1018 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-21783-How-to-apply-20210615.png?resize=2048,1357 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Copy-of-CB-21783-How-to-apply-20210615.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168625" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Applications to use Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces are only available on mobile (so, no avoiding the in-app purchase fees) and for people in the U.S. Currently, only iOS users can apply for Super Follows, but Ticketed Spaces applications are available on both iOS and Android. Twitter is adding a brand new Monetization button to the sidebar in the app, where users navigate to see if they&#8217;re eligible to apply to be part of the test groups for these features. These features will launch more broadly in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the country&#8217;s most powerful unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, confirmed today that it plans to make a nationwide push to unionize Amazon warehouse workers and drivers. And it won&#8217;t be a gentle one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg7pp/the-teamsters-announce-coordinated-nationwide-project-to-unionize-amazon">The news was first reported by Motherboard</a>, which obtained a video and resolution announcing the effort. As the organization explained, the plan to unionize Amazon&#8217;s growing logistics business has been underway for some time, and the failure in Bessemer to do so — after the grassroots effort faced intense opposition from Amazon itself — illustrates why such an endeavor is necessary.</p>
<p>As Teamsters National Director for Amazon Randy Korgan explained <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/06/14/amazons-labor-exploitation-is-a-return-to-the-1920s--and-unions-are-our-best-hope-out/">in a recent op-ed on Salon</a> that hinted at the effort:</p>
<blockquote><p>I see that Teamster locals across the country are already stepping up to meet the challenge by engaging members, building large volunteer organizing committees, building strong community-labor alliances and integrating transformative social justice organizing into their work.</p>
<p>As we saw in the closely-watched National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election at Amazon&#8217;s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse, the company is willing to violate the law and spare no expense to keep its workers from forming a union.</p>
<p>Building genuine worker power at Amazon will take shop-floor militancy by Amazon workers and solidarity from warehousing and delivery Teamsters.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Teamsters&#8217; plan, assuming a passing vote at this week&#8217;s 30th quinquennial International Convention, is to create a special Amazon Division that will fund and aid unionizing efforts in the company&#8217;s workforces around the country. In the words of the resolution (the full text of which you can read below):</p>
<blockquote><p>The IBT Convention recognizes the existential threat of Amazon to our members and commits all levels of the union to unite with core platforms of member engagement, worker and community engagement, antitrust enforcement and policy reform, and global solidarity</p></blockquote>
<p>While Amazon repeats loudly and at every possible occasion its commitment to safe and well paid jobs, reports continue to come out of workers in horrendous conditions, callous management, and stagnant wages. As to the last, while Amazon has established a $15 minimum wage at the company, others have pointed out that this is far less than many warehouse workers and drivers were making at other jobs — which have now lowered their compensation to follow Amazon&#8217;s lead.</p>
<p>The conflict at Bessemer, in which Amazon was accused of union-busting tactics and dirty tricks to sink a traditional union voting process, has prompted the Teamsters to adopt a different approach.</p>

<p>According to Motherboard, the organization is planning &#8220;a series of pressure campaigns involving work stoppages, petitions, and other collective action,&#8221; in the hopes that Amazon will find unionization and negotiation preferable. I&#8217;ve asked the company for comment on the matter and will update if I hear back.</p>
<p>This is one of the union&#8217;s highest priority efforts for the next few years, though it did not specify any particular timeline or budget — no doubt because much of that depends on the situation they find on the ground. But Amazon&#8217;s hundreds of thousands of workers represent an enormous untapped working group, the unionization of which could realize similarly enormous sums in benefits for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz has used the &#8220;best or nothing&#8221; tagline to market its vehicles for the last 21 years. To ensure its 2021 Mercedes-Benz S580 sedan ticks that &#8220;best&#8221; box, the German automaker has loaded its flagship vehicle with technology, including an infotainment system that learns to anticipate its owner&#8217;s needs, some new rear-steering tricks and upgrades to its advanced driver assistance features.</p>
<p>With a price tag that starts at a steep $110,850, it&#8217;s the luxury car for the exceedingly well-heeled executive who wants the top-of-the-line Mercedes sedan with all the bells and whistles modern driving and living requires — and then some.</p>
<p>In S-Class tradition, the sedan is still a big baller. The new version gets longer (by 1.3-inches) and taller (by 0.4-inches), making more space for passengers and cargo. The base 2021 Mercedes-Benz S500 comes with all-wheel drive and a new inline six-cylinder engine that makes 429 horsepower and 384 lb-ft of torque. That&#8217;s a 60-plus horsepower bump over the last generation model. The S580 that I drove also came with all-wheel drive and a smooth, powerful and quiet 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 that makes 496 horsepower and 516 lb-ft of torque. Both versions also get a 48-volt onboard mild hybrid system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Mercedes has always touted its &#8220;human-centered innovation&#8221; in its S-Class. Initially, the automaker used technology to improve safety (things like ensuring that the doors wouldn&#8217;t suddenly spring open in a crash in the 1950s and crumple zones in the1960s). Since the 1990s, the brand has focused on making driving, parking and navigation less clunky and difficult to use. For example, it had an optional voice recognition package in 1996 that allowed you to activate your carphone (remember those‽) with a voice command.</p>
<p>Mercedes has continued to push the technology envelope, most recently launching an all-electric counterpart to the S Class <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-stakes-its-claim-on-a-luxury-electric-future/">called the EQS</a>. The 2021 S-Class might mark a new generation of the executive hauler, and it has plenty of technology to offer, but it doesn&#8217;t quite outshine the all-electric EQS.</p>

<h2><span style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Mercedes has long been a player in the advanced driver assistance system space, debuting an adaptive cruise control feature called Distronic in 1998.</span></h2>
<p>In the 2021 S-Class, ADAS gets an upgrade (called Drive Pilot) that includes a total of 22 sensors and cameras all around the vehicle, which send information to five multicore processors that can analyze the driving situation 1,000 times per second and adapt the suspension accordingly.</p>
<p>All that&#8217;s to say, the car &#8220;sees&#8221; and responds to road conditions, other vehicles, road signs, pedestrians and cyclists, and then should respond like a human driver would.</p>
<p>On the drive from Los Angeles to Montecito (about 130 miles if you take the freeway the whole way), on both winding mountain and ocean roads and stop-and-go traffic on LA&#8217;s heinous, concrete block 405 freeway, I kept the S580 in adaptive cruise for most of the trip. The system worked as intended, with the S-Class accelerating and stopping at the appropriate times as I crept along in bumper-to-bumper traffic, from the 105 to the 101. What&#8217;s more: I wasn&#8217;t exhausted (and pissed off) when I arrived at my destination after a meandering six hours on the road.</p>
<p>Even when a texting Angeleno decided to change lanes, nearly side-swiped my car and narrowly avoided driving into the backseat of the vehicle ahead, the adaptive cruise system maintained control. I was paying attention as this incident unfolded, but Mercedes has designed its system to ensure drivers are attentive even as the ADAS features handle some of the driving tasks.</p>
<p>Touch sensors inside the car and on the steering wheel as well as eye-tracking and facial recognition cameras monitor the attentiveness of the driver. Take your hands off the sensors, and the driver&#8217;s display will alert you to your wandering ways, disengaging the ADAS system after a few seconds.</p>
<p>The eye detection and facial monitoring is used to recognize typical signs of drowsiness and driver inattention, and displays a warning message prompting the driver to take a break. There&#8217;s also a new microsleep warning that tracks the driver&#8217;s eyelid movements by a camera in the driver display.</p>

<p>Mercedes claims that the 2021 S-Class is prepped for Level 4 autonomous driving and, in their September announcement of the new vehicle, executives said that &#8220;Level 3 conditional driving is near.&#8221; The hardware in the vehicle is meant to support that ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Those 22 sensors and cameras are now capable of recognizing speed limit signs, construction zones and other road hazards, which, at times, I found a little annoying. There were some stretches where the posted speed limit dropped to 55, and when ADAS was engaged, the S-Class would suddenly slow to match the posted speed. That&#8217;s great when traffic around you isn&#8217;t still moving at 70-plus miles per hour, but in quick-moving traffic, it&#8217;s unnerving.</p>
<p>The new S-Class is also outfitted with a lane-changing assistant that helps the driver safely make a lane change without disengaging the ADAS system. Flip on the blinker while operating cruise control (and keeping your eyes up and hands on the wheel), and the S-Class will safely maneuver the sedan from one lane to the other, provided all is clear, centering it in the lane, with very little input from the driver.</p>
<p>In addition to the ADAS advancements, Mercedes has upgraded its parking assistant, as well. When optioned with its branded Intelligent Park Pilot, the S-Class &#8220;could&#8221; conceivably park itself in multilevel automated valet parking (AVP) structures without a human in the vehicle. As Mercedes notes, though, that would only be available in properly equipped parking structures and &#8220;provided that national legislation permits such operation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new S-Class has gotten so large (overall it&#8217;s as long as most midsized SUVs on the market today), Mercedes integrated new rear-axle steering, which can turn the rear wheels in both directions up to an angle of 10 degrees, which reduces the turning radius by nearly seven feet.</p>
<p>Mercedes has also paired this with an advanced air suspension system that acts both to soften the ride and adapt to float you over rough roads, while providing an additional layer of safety using those sensors and cameras around the car. If a side impact is impending, the system can lift the body of the car by about three inches in a few tenths of a second to protect passengers.</p>

<p>Unlike the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-stakes-its-claim-on-a-luxury-electric-future/">EQS that my counterpart, Tamara Warren</a>, drove, there was no <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mercedes-unveils-hyperscreen-a-curved-56-inch-screen-for-its-flagship-eqs-electric-vehicle/">56-inch Hyperscreen</a> in the $148,000-plus S580 I drove. Instead, a single 12.8-inch OLED screen that stretches from dash to armrest graces the center stack and is the control hub of the vehicle. Here you can do everything from control the fragrance that emanates from a diffuser in the glovebox to access Mercedes wellness features. The screen is bright and clear in high-noon sun with no glare and surprisingly not distracting at night.</p>

<p>However, one of the most impressive features in the new S-Class is the crystal clear and tremendously impressive 3D, augmented reality, head-up display projected onto the windshield. You can move your head around and still see the display from any angle in the driver&#8217;s seat. It&#8217;s even somewhat visible from the passenger seat. Use the infotainment system (known as MBUX, short for Mercedes Benz User Experience) to navigate to a destination of choice and as you approach offramps, turns and your final location, blue augmented-reality arrows pop up in the HUD and over a video feed of the road ahead in the center stack indicating which lane you should be in, where your turn is and showing exactly where the address you&#8217;re looking for is. You can also turn the feature off and change the driver&#8217;s instrument display if it gets too distracting, using the touch-capacitive buttons on the steering wheel.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 2022 Mercedes-Benz EQS stakes its claim on a luxury, electric future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-stakes-its-claim-on-a-luxury-electric-future/embed/#?secret=RTLhr7GLhf" data-secret="RTLhr7GLhf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mercedes says that the computing power of MBUX has increased by 50% compared to the system in the previous model, and the memory bandwidth is 41,790 MB/s powered by NVIDIA Xavier (versus the Tegra 3 in the last generation). That translates to almost no stuttering, load lag or confusion on the system&#8217;s part.</p>
<p>Plus, it also helps the very good, natural language voice recognition system work almost perfectly. You can use touch-capacitive buttons on the steering wheel to activate the voice assistant or simply say the key phrase, &#8220;Hey, Mercedes,&#8221; to activate voice commands. Do everything from ask the system to look something up for you (provided you have connectivity), change the temperature, run one of Mercedes preprogrammed wellness programs (changes lighting, temperature and massage settings), call your parents, or navigate to a new location and the system almost never misses a beat. The only trouble I had with it was when trying to use voice control to navigate to an address with more than four numbers in it. (e.g., 12345 West Elm Street). After a few tries, I resorted to plugging it in on the very intuitive, easy-to-use touchscreen on the center stack.</p>
<p>While I didn&#8217;t spend enough time with the new S-Class to try some of the more advanced AI features it offers, Mercedes says that MBUX can do everything from integrate your connected home into the system to navigate to your favorite spots, just like the one in the EQS. In theory, you can then ask the system to turn on your home lights, and it will learn when you like to start the espresso machine on your drive home., As you drive regular routes and ask the system to perform tasks like make calls, or navigate to a specific place each day, the AI will learn your habits. Eventually, it will simply ask you if you&#8217;d like to call your office at a specific time or set a route to your favorite restaurant.</p>
<p>Packed to the gills with tons of features, technology and amenities that make driving a lot more comfortable and a lot less stressful, it&#8217;s no wonder that the S-Class has already garnered several accolades, including World Luxury Car of the Year (Disclosure: I am a World Car Juror). If luxury is all about seamless and invisible technology that makes long drives feel more like a spa day, then the 2021 Mercedes-Benz S Class has it in spades.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Entrepreneurs’ mental health and stress management started to be more widely discussed amid the pandemic, but for many seasoned entrepreneurs, the topic is still taboo. Now that the world seems to be inching toward a new normal, some founders, investors and mental health experts find themselves asking whether we need to consider mental health moving forward if it wasn&#8217;t an issue before the pandemic.</p>
<p>We do. For one, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/30/investors-and-entrepreneurs-need-to-address-the-mental-health-crisis-in-startup-culture/">absolutely was an issue</a> before the pandemic. Furthermore, what drives the mental health epidemic among entrepreneurs is their propensity to accept risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entrepreneurs bring in a lot of vulnerability into their jobs, and when combined with the risks they are required to take, the vulnerability can be exacerbated when those risks don&#8217;t work out,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelfreemanmd/">Michael Freeman</a>, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and founder of <a href="https://econa.net/">Econa</a>. “And in most cases, it doesn&#8217;t work out, and so they are more vulnerable to feeling mental health symptoms and entering a downward spiral. The reverse is also true. When entrepreneurs are knocking it out of the park, they are vulnerable to a different set of mental health challenges.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</p>
<p>So how do we address these issues and train entrepreneurs to sharpen and maintain their mental acuity, particularly when things get tough while fundraising?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple: prevention and awareness. In terms of prevention, Freeman said it comes down to destigmatizing entrepreneur mental health differences, celebrating entrepreneur mental health superpowers and adopting a downside-prevention lifestyle.</p>
<p>&#8220;With mental health, as is true with many things medical, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,” Freeman said. “For entrepreneurs who want to prevent mental health issues, they need to start by taking a lifestyle risk factor assessment.”</p>
<p>According to Freeman, there are five ways entrepreneurs can support their mental health. (If you or someone you know is feeling hopeless and depressed, please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 800-273-8255.)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sleep</strong>. The most significant role of sleep is to help your brain power up and stay awake during the day. Allowing your mind and your body to recover can have a profound preventative effect. You can’t pitch if you can’t keep your eyes open.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise, and make sure you sweat</strong>. Entrepreneurs should get at least 45 minutes of exercise a day, including an intensity that makes you sweat twice a week. It not only has health benefits: It enhances <a href="https://www.understood.org/en/learning-thinking-differences/child-learning-disabilities/executive-functioning-issues/what-is-executive-function">executive functioning</a>, meaning it improves your ability to focus and get things done. It also helps you regulate your emotions when you&#8217;re listening to a VC completely shred your idea so you don&#8217;t become despondent after a call. When you&#8217;re fundraising, your ability to think clearly can be the difference between getting a yes and a no.</li>
<li><strong>Get and keep friends that have nothing to do with business</strong>. Entrepreneurship is a lonely profession at times. Aside from work, you want to have a small but engaged circle of friends and loved ones, and be careful not to let your relationships devolve into the blur of work. Keep those relationships and allow them to support you when work gets rough.</li>
<li><strong>Eat well, and eat strategically</strong>. Many entrepreneurs live at or below the poverty line at some point in their journey, and when you&#8217;re under pressure with limited resources, eating junk and fast food is the wrong tradeoff to make because they aren&#8217;t good for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/cognitive-functioning">cognitive functioning</a>, among many other health consequences.</li>
<li><strong>Address mental health concerns in weeks, not months</strong>. When entrepreneurs don&#8217;t manage concerns quickly, they can turn into adverse outcomes. &#8220;If mental health symptoms are prolonged … it can lead to more severe mental health consequences,” Freeman said. “The adverse personal outcomes include anything from experiencing more serious mental health issues to disrupting social relationships and performance falloffs at work. The adverse business outcomes that may result include bankruptcy, losing employees, alienating strategic alliance partners and scaring away potential investors.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Awareness begins by gaining an understanding of the factors that could exacerbate your stress levels and impact your ability to complete a successful raise, and then planning accordingly. Things that could raise your stress levels include everything from your pre-raise financial status and health history to gender, race, industry attitudes, institutional barriers and even citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Entrepreneurs of color, immigrants and women are far more conscious of the glass ceiling,” Freeman said. “It can be a factor in your mental health while you&#8217;re raising. … People from groups that have been otherized in one way or another have different obstacles that are difficult to overcome overall, as well as from a mental health perspective.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerryschrader/">Kerry Schrader</a>, the co-founder of SaaS platform <a href="https://www.mixtroz.com/">Mixtroz</a>, knows all too well how these things can impact you while fundraising. Although she and her daughter <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleeanneammons/">Ashlee Ammons</a> did eventually raise more than a million dollars, the pressure of potentially being the next Black women to do so was overwhelming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stopped holding onto the pressure of being the <a href="https://www.carolroth.com/blog/how-the-mother-daughter-founders-of-mixtroz-raised-more-than-1-million/">37th and 38th</a> Black women to raise over $1 million,” she said. “We got caught up thinking, if we&#8217;re not successful, then we will be the reason other Black women are not funded. Honestly, we decided to remove that additional layer of stress from our thinking and just focused on running a profitable business that people could get behind and hoping for the same grace the majority of our white male counterparts get upon failure: Another chance and more funding, which we knew was and still is not the norm.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Schrader, there was little information available about how to manage their mental health while fundraising, leading her and her daughter to try a variety of methods before finding something that made sense.</p>
<p>Based on her experience, here are five more ways entrepreneurs can manage their mental health while fundraising.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Find a counselor or therapist to help navigate your increased stress level</strong>. There&#8217;s a slow shift that has helped entrepreneurs reframe therapy from something that you do as a reaction to being overwhelmed to a preventative method that helps you thrive. &#8220;I leveraged <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/">BetterHelp</a> to talk with someone while I raised,” Schrader said. “By communicating to a third party, I could say anything. Venting privately allowed me to reframe my conversations with investors more effectively. By having a qualified professional to speak to, I was able to shift my mindset from, ‘You&#8217;re doing me a big favor’ to ‘I have an exciting opportunity and I&#8217;m allowing you to invest early.’ Counseling helped a lot.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Give yourself an out</strong>. Goal-setting is a great way to keep things on track, but it can create an illusion that you&#8217;re not going to be successful if you&#8217;re not constantly moving toward a finite endpoint. &#8220;Initially, we started putting criteria for what actions we would take if we did not hit certain milestones,” Schrader said. “Instead of feeling like we could put ourselves in a position of failure, we had rules for when it would be time to end the business and go back to our careers. Having an agreed-upon ‘out’ with my co-founder … was great for my mental health. And here we are, years later, still in the game and mostly sane.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Leverage your team</strong>. You can’t go it alone. Be willing to rely on your team to move your startup forward and preserve your health. &#8220;Shortly after we closed our friends and family round, I was diagnosed with breast cancer,” Schrader said. “I was going to radiation, surgery and treatments while I was raising. I was pitching from the hospital bed. But when you&#8217;re fundraising, it never stops. That&#8217;s when my daughter decided it was time to commit full time. As a family, we realized we needed to lean on each other if we were going to be successful long term.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Remain flexible with your plans</strong>. When you&#8217;re just starting, you focus too much on set plans. But when you dig into the backstories of prominent entrepreneurs, you&#8217;ll find that they pivoted as needed and learned on the go. &#8220;There were times during our raise when we had to be able to cope with weekly, daily and even hourly changes to our plan,” Schrader said. “I describe it as buying a plane, learning to fly the plane and then looking for a hangar to refuel all at the same time. You can try to organize all you want, but I don&#8217;t know how much planning you can do.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Be intentional about the type of stress you&#8217;re willing to deal with for money</strong>. When you&#8217;re fundraising, the obvious goal is to secure a check. But some entrepreneurs agree to untenable terms in order to receive capital. It&#8217;s important to know your limits before you walk into the room. &#8220;When someone thinks they have the upper hand they will try to see how much stuff they can push you for. Don&#8217;t forget your why. … When you know what you can take without losing yourself, stand your ground,” Schrader said. “And remember, even as an entrepreneur, declining is always an option, specifically if the decision to decline protects your sanity.&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.airbankos.com">Airbank</a>, a startup that is taking advantage of open banking regulation and related APIs to aggregate all your bank accounts. Focused on startups and small and medium companies, the company wants to build an all-in-one banking interface to access financial data, initiate payments, manage cash flow and more.</p>
<p>Airbank just raised a $3 million (€2.5 million) seed round led by Pia d&#39;Iribarne and Jean de la Rochebrochard at <a href="https://www.newwave.vc">New Wave</a>, with Speedinvest and Tiny VC also participating. A handful of business angels are also joining the round, such as Cris Conde (Executive in Residence at Accel), Luca Ascani (Accel scout) and Marc McCabe (Sequoia scout).</p>
<p>The startup’s value proposition is quite simple and can be easily explained in one screenshot. With Airbank, you can enter your login information for all the bank accounts and related accounts that you use. After that, you can view everything from your Airbank account:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168713" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168713" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landinghero-en.cabae4d.png" alt="" width="1024" height="635" class="size-full wp-image-2168713" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landinghero-en.cabae4d.png 4392w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landinghero-en.cabae4d.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landinghero-en.cabae4d.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landinghero-en.cabae4d.png?resize=768,476 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landinghero-en.cabae4d.png?resize=680,422 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landinghero-en.cabae4d.png?resize=1536,953 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landinghero-en.cabae4d.png?resize=2048,1270 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/landinghero-en.cabae4d.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2168713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Airbank</p></div></p>
<p>Many companies have to deal with multiple bank accounts for several reasons — you may have opened one bank account when you incorporated your company, another bank account to request a loan, a Wise Business account for low foreign transaction fees, a Revolut Business account to get debit cards for everyone, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to bank accounts, chances are you’re also generating revenue with Stripe, PayPal or Shopify. Many executives lose a ton of time connecting to web portals, exporting data as CSV files, importing those files in Microsoft Excel and consolidating all that information.</p>
<p>Airbank automatically refreshes your balances across several accounts. You can see your total balance in multiple currencies. It can also help you reconcile transactions with outstanding invoices as you can search across multiple accounts at once.</p>
<p>This is just a starting point as Airbank wants to become the only interface for all your banking needs. You can categorize transactions, see how much you’re spending with each supplier, track recurring payments and export everything to Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. Soon, you’ll be able to use Airbank for cash flow forecasting and automatic reconciliation with your Xero or Quickbooks data.</p>
<p>Open banking isn’t limited to account aggregation. With proper APIs, you should be able to initiate payments from a third-party product. And Airbank plans to take advantage of that as the company is working on payments. As you can manage access rights, Airbank could act as the payment portal for the finance team.</p>
<p>“Open banking has enabled smooth integrations with banks, which we can utilize to offer richer banking and payments experiences for our users. Our vision is to build an all-in-one finance hub that connects all your financial accounts in one place. Our integrations will bring bill payments, expense management, and FX all in a single product that is easy to use,” co-founder and CEO Christopher Zemina said in a statement.</p>
<p>Other startups have been working on cash flow management, such as <a href="https://agicap.com">Agicap</a>, and B2B payments, such as <a href="https://libeo.io">Libeo</a> and <a href="https://upflow.io">Upflow</a>. Airbank is starting with account aggregation and wants to tackle B2B finance in a holistic manner.</p>
<p>Vertical SaaS products have been booming lately. And there’s a reason why the space is quite competitive. There’s still a ton of stuff to do around B2B fintech and specialized software-as-a-service products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Quanergy Systems, the Sunnyvale, California-based lidar company, said Tuesday it has agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition fund CITIC Capital Acquisition Corp., a Chinese blank-check firm affiliated with the country’s largest state-owned investment conglomerate.</p>
<p>The deal, which puts an implied valuation on Quanergy at $1.4 billion, is expected to close in the second half of 2021. After closing, the transaction will inject the lidar company with around $278 million in pro forma net cash, including $40 million in private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding.</p>
<p>Lidar is an essential component of most autonomous driving systems – the notable exception being Tesla’s stack, which is attempting to develop a pure vision-based system to support its pursuit of automated driving (Tesla vehicles are not autonomous today and have what is considered a Level 2 advanced driver assistance system). Quanergy is a developer of solid state silicon lidar units, which pulses a low-power laser through an optical phased array to measure the distance and shape of objects. Historically, lidar sensors involved moving parts – generally some mechanism to rotate the laser so it can scan the surrounding area. The company also develops perception software that interprets the sensor data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Quanergy has had a bumpy road to the NYSE. The company generated a lot of hype after it announced in 2016 that it had developed a lidar that cost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/quanergy-s3/">$250 or less</a> (for reference, around the same time Velodyne was selling a lidar sensor for $75,000). The news shot the company to unicorn status and incited talks of a potential initial public offering, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-08-13/how-a-billion-dollar-autonomous-vehicle-startup-lost-its-way">Bloomberg reported</a>. But excitement was tempered after Quanergy hit technical roadblocks.</p>
<p>Then the company announced in January 2020 that CEO and co-founder Louay Eldada would be leaving the company. Kevin Kennedy took over as interim CEO, then became the permanent leader in April. Quanergy says it has more than 350 customers and 40 partnerships globally, across both the automotive and internet of things sectors. Its investors include automakers Daimler and Geely, as well as Samsung and Enterprise.</p>
<p>Quanergy says the proceeds from the SPAC transaction will be used to accelerate research and development, pay down debt and fund working capital. Upon closing, Quanergy will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “QNGY.”</p>
<p>The SPAC, CITIC Capital Acquisition Corp., is sponsored by CITIC Capital Holdings Limited, an investment firm backed by Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group. Quanergy must file for clearance with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The company anticipates CFIUS greenlighting the deal because CITIC would keep its stake in the company below 10%, and Quanergy does not record any personal driver data, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-quanergy-nears-china-backed-spac-deal-go-public-sources-2021-06-21/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p>Quanergy is not the first lidar company to go public via a SPAC merger. Others include AEye, which will merge with CF Finance Acquisition Corp. III <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/aeye-becomes-latest-lidar-company-to-go-public-via-spac/">at a $2 billion deal</a>, and Volvo-partnered Luminar at a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/lidar-startup-luminar-to-go-public-via-3-4-billion-spac-merger/">$3.4 billion valuation</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s antitrust watchdog has ordered an investigation into allegations that Google has abused the dominant position of Android in the country’s smart TV market. The news comes hours after the European Union <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/eu-is-now-investigating-googles-adtech-over-antitrust-concerns/">opened a formal antitrust investigation</a> into allegations that Google abuses its leading role in the advertising-technology sector.</p>
<p>In its initial review, the Competition Commission of India, which began looking into these allegations last year, said Google had breached certain anti-competitive laws. An investigation of this scale can take quarters, if not over a year, to resolve.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission is of the prima facie opinion that by making pre-installation of Google’s proprietary apps (particularly Play Store) conditional upon signing of ACC (Android Compatibility Commitments) for all Android devices manufactured/distributed/marketed by device manufacturers, Google has reduced the ability and incentive of device manufacturers to develop and sell devices operating on alternative versions of Android i.e. Android forks, and thereby limited technical or scientific development relating to goods or services to the prejudice of consumers in contravention of Section 4(2)(b) of the Act,&#8221; the watchdog said in its 24-page order.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Further, ACC prevents OEMs from manufacturing/ distributing/ selling any other device which operate on a competing forked Android operating system. Therefore, given the dominance of Google in the relevant markets and pronounced network effects, by virtue of this restriction, developers of such forked Android operating system are denied market access resulting in violation of Section 4(2)(c) of the Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google, which counts India as its largest market by users and last year committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">investing $10 billion in the country</a>, denied any wrongdoing. &#8220;We are confident that our smart TV licensing practices are in compliance with all applicable competition laws,&#8221; a company spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Competition Commission of India added that it found Google requiring television manufacturers pre-installing all its &#8220;must-have&#8221; apps and not having the ability to pick and choose from alternatives &#8220;amounts to imposition of unfair condition on the smart TV device manufacturers and thereby in contravention of Section 4(2)(a)(i) of the Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It also amounts to prima facie leveraging of Google’s dominance in Play Store to protect the relevant markets such as online video hosting services offered by YouTube, etc. in contravention of Section 4(2)(e) of the Act. All these aspects warrant a detailed investigation,&#8221; the competition regulator added.</p>
<p>About 8 million smart TV sets were sold in India in 2019, over 60% of which were powered by Google’s Android operating system.</p>
<p>It’s a tough week for American giants in India. On Monday evening, the world’s second largest internet market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/india-proposes-tougher-e-commerce-rules-following-widespread-cheating-and-unfair-trade-by-amazon-and-flipkart/">proposed tough e-commerce rules</a> that could hurt Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s order is the third ongoing antitrust case investigation that India has opened against Google. Late last year, India’s antitrust watchdog opened an investigation into Google for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/india-opens-antitrust-case-against-google-over-its-payments-app/">allegedly abusing the dominant position of its app store</a> to promote its payments service in the South Asian nation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The future of work is long on long-distance, and today a startup that&#8217;s built a platform to help organizations hire global talent and build out those remote workforces is announcing a round of funding on the heels of strong growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oysterhr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oyster</a> &#8212; which provides tools to help with hiring, onboarding, payroll, benefits and salary management services for both contractors and full-time employees working outside of an organization&#8217;s home country &#8212; has closed a Series B of $50 million.</p>
<p>We understand that the funding is coming in at a $475 million valuation, six times the company&#8217;s valuation when it last raised money &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/oyster-snaps-up-20m-for-its-hr-platform-aimed-at-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$20 million round just four months ago</a>. The company itself has seen business grow &#8220;exponentially&#8221; since then, said Tony Jamous, London-based Oyster&#8217;s CEO who co-founded the company with Jack Mardack. The company now works with 80 large businesses, he said, helping them fill knowledge worker roles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Stripes is leading the Series B, with previous backers Emergence Capital and The Slack Fund, as well as new investor Avid Ventures, also participating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jamous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/oyster-snaps-up-20m-for-its-hr-platform-aimed-at-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told me back in February</a> that the idea for building Oyster was first planted when he was working at his first startup, Nexmo (which eventually he sold to Vonage), after being faced with the challenges of hiring talent internationally, and specifically the millions the company invested to build out the infrastructure to do so itself, since every country has very specific procedures for employing people and handling all of the contractural, tax, and regulatory details related to that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oyster&#8217;s mission has been to  make it possible for any company to hire wherever they want, without going through that pain themselves, making the &#8220;world their oyster,&#8221; so to speak.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While that in itself is a great idea that definitely fills a need for businesses, it has also been compounded by recent changing tides. Not only are more people wanting to work further afield, but at &#8220;home&#8221;, many companies &#8212; especially those who need to fill knowledge worker roles &#8212; are facing talent shortages. All of this is driving even more demand for sourcing and hiring candidates from further afield, and a culture in the workplace that it&#8217;s possible to work well even if you are not in the same physical space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;What&#8217;s happening in the world is that there&#8217;s a talent shortage, and also there&#8217;s no need to be in the office anymore,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When it comes to tapping into the global talent pool, if you think about it, if you&#8217;re a London-based company, then the chances that your best talent is in London is less than 1%. So by tapping into the global talent pool, suddenly you&#8217;re dramatically increasing your chances, especially if you depend on talent as as a key source of your success.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of startups in the market today targeting the remote working opportunity &#8212; helping companies source and hire people wherever they happen to be located &#8212; and Oyster is not the only one of them raising big money to scale. Others include Deel, which is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/payroll-startup-deel-raises-funds-at-1-25-billion-valuation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now valued at $1.25 billion</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/turing-nabs-32m-more-for-an-ai-based-platform-to-source-and-manage-engineers-remotely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turing</a>; Papaya Global (now also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/papaya-global-raises-100m-more-at-a-1b-valuation-for-tools-to-hire-pay-and-manage-distributed-workforces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at over $1 billion</a>); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/remote-raises-35m-to-help-orgs-with-global-workforce-payroll-benefits-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remote</a>, and many more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oyster is not &#8212; yet? &#8212; in the business of helping to source or vet potential hires, but once someone is identified and an organization wants to make an offer, Oyster provides a seamless way to handle the rest, including giving advice on whether it&#8217;s best to hire the person as a contractor or full time employee (the trend here, he said, is full-time), how to handle benefits based on the country in which the talent is based; and other aspects of remuneration, again particular to each local market. Pricing ranges from $29 per person, per month for contractors, to $399 for working with full employees, to other packages for larger deployments.</p>
<p>The company also has a public service mission in all this. Jamous himself originally hails from Lebanon and has a particular mission to help people from less high-profile parts of the world, and emerging countries, also get on the career ladder. In this day and age, since relocation and migration are no longer a must-do, it opens up a lot of opportunities for people that didn&#8217;t exist before. Oyster applied for, and now has B-Corp certification, which it&#8217;s using to fill out that global employment and talent mandate.</p>
<p>This is not just for greater good, though. There are actual talent shortages, and a recent study from Korn Ferry, cited by Oyster, found that 1.5 billion knowledge workers will be entering the workforce in the next decade from emerging economies. Building tools to help hire and manage that talent makes business sense.</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to partner with Stripes for the next chapter of growth and positive impact for Oyster,” said Jack Mardack, co-Founder of Oyster, in a statement. “Investors like Stripes, Emergence, Slack Fund, Avid, and PeopleTech Partners among others, who share in our passion for the Oyster mission and vision for the future of work, give us the rocket fuel we need to change the world by unblocking access to job opportunities for everyone.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The transition to remote work is one of the most fundamental macro trends in business today and COVID-19 accelerated that transition by 10 years,” said Saagar Kulkarni, partner at Stripes, in a statement. “Oyster makes it seamless for any company to hire the best person for each job, removing location as a barrier. Tony and the team have built the best software product in the market and are poised to build a market-defining company. We are thrilled to join the entire Oyster team on their mission to level the playing field for the global workforce.”</p>

<p>&#8220;We were advertising ourselves as being an alternative AWS console with a focus on developer experience and cost transparency,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What was interesting is &#8212; even in the early days of early access before the formal GA launch in January &#8212; I would say more than 95% of the feedback that we were getting from customers was entirely around the cost features that we had in Vantage.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Like any good startup, the Vantage team looked at this and decided to double down on these features and highlight them in its marketing, though it kept the existing AWS Console-related tools as well. The reason the other tools didn&#8217;t quite take off, Schaechter believes, is because more and more, AWS users have become accustomed to infrastructure-as-code to do their own automatic provisioning. And with that, they spend a lot less time in the AWS Console anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;But one consistent thing &#8212; across the board &#8212; was that people were having a really, really hard time 12 times a year, where they would get a shocking AWS bill and had to figure out what happened. What Vantage is doing today is providing a lot of value on the transparency front there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last few months, the team added a number of new features to its cost transparency tools, including machine learning-driven predictions (both on the overall account level and service level) and the ability to share reports across teams.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2168622" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2168622" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2168622" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png" alt="" width="1024" height="702" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png 2484w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=1536,1054 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=2048,1405 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/VNTG_forecast@2x.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2168622" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vantage</p></div></p>
<p>While Vantage expects to add support for other clouds in the future, likely starting with Azure and then GCP, that&#8217;s actually not what the team is focused on right now. Instead, Schaechter noted, the team plans to add support for bringing in data from third-party cloud services instead.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number one line item for companies tends to be AWS, GCP, Azure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But then, after that, it&#8217;s Datadog, Cloudflare, Sumo Logic, things along those lines. Right now, there&#8217;s no way to see, P&amp;L or an ROI from a cloud usage-based perspective. Vantage can be the tool where that&#8217;s showing you essentially, all of your cloud costs in one space.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is likely the vision the investors bought into, as well, and even though Vantage is now going up against enterprise tools like Apptio&#8217;s Cloudability and VMware&#8217;s CloudHealth, Schaechter doesn&#8217;t seem to be all that worried about the competition. He argues that these are tools that were born in a time when AWS had only a handful of services and only a few ways of interacting with those. He believes that Vantage, as a modern self-service platform, will have quite a few advantages over these older services.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get up and running in a few clicks. You don&#8217;t have to talk to a sales team. We&#8217;re helping a large number of startups at this stage all the way up to the enterprise, whereas Cloudability and CloudHealth are, in my mind, kind of antiquated enterprise offerings. No startup is choosing to use those at this point, as far as I know,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The team, which until now mostly consisted of Schaechter and his co-founder and CTO Brooke McKim, bootstrapped the company up to this point. Now they plan to use the new capital to build out its team (and the company is actively hiring right now), both on the development and go-to-market side.</p>
<p>The company offers a <a href="https://www.vantage.sh/pricing">free starter plan</a> for businesses that track up to $2,500 in monthly AWS cost, with paid plans starting at $30 per month for those who need to track larger accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pro-privacy browser <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a>, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/brave-is-launching-its-own-search-engine-with-the-help-of-ex-cliqz-devs-and-tech/">testing its own brand search engine</a> for several months &#8212; operating a waitlist where brave (ha!) early adopters could kick the tyres of an upstart alternative in Internet search &#8212; has now launched the tool, Brave Search, in global beta.</p>
<p>Users interested in checking out Brave&#8217;s nontracking search engine, which is built on top of an independent index and touted as a privacy-safe alternative to surveillance tech products like Google search, will find it via Brave&#8217;s desktop and mobile browsers. It can also be reached from other browsers via <a href="https://search.brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://search.brave.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB4NzAgBdIdSTvM0yk0hGH1LyDtA">search.brave.com</a> &#8212; so doesn&#8217;t require switching to Brave&#8217;s browser to use.</p>
<p>Brave Search is being offered as one of multiple search options that users of the company&#8217;s eponymous browser can pick from (including Google&#8217;s search engine). But Brave says it will make it the default search in its browser later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As we reported back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/brave-is-launching-its-own-search-engine-with-the-help-of-ex-cliqz-devs-and-tech/">March</a>, the company acquired technology and developers who had previously worked on Cliqz, a European anti-tracking search-browser combo which closed down in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/cliqz-pulls-the-plug-on-a-european-anti-tracking-alternative-to-google-search/">May 2020</a> &#8212; building on a technology they&#8217;d started to develop, called Tailcat, to form the basis of the Brave-branded search engine.</p>
<p>The (now beta) search engine has been tested by more than 100,000 &#8220;early access users&#8221; at this point, per Brave. It&#8217;s made this <a href="https://vimeo.com/565464396/5eedcfd477">video ad</a> to tout its &#8220;all in one&#8221; alternative to Google search + Chrome.</p>
<p>The company recently passed 32M monthly active users (up from 25M back in March) for its wider suite of products &#8212; which, as well as its flagship pro-privacy browser, includes a news reader (<a href="https://brave.com/announcing-brave-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/announcing-brave-today/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHwxRHCu5kDlzKx2cczjrNR6Vdoqw">Brave News</a>), and a <a href="https://brave.com/brave-and-guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/brave-and-guardian/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEO0JCZEU0qwKpXWORyRcXvgQ3qGQ">Firewall+VPN service</a>.</p>
<p>Brave also offers privacy-preserving <a href="https://brave.com/brave-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/brave-ads/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbCTrFQx9JJNVYffsRBznC9cihtQ">Brave Ads</a> for businesses wanting to reach its community of privacy-preferring users.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brave is launching its own search engine with the help of ex-Cliqz devs and tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/brave-is-launching-its-own-search-engine-with-the-help-of-ex-cliqz-devs-and-tech/embed/#?secret=ZFANzSYunJ" data-secret="ZFANzSYunJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Growing public awareness of surveillance based business models has been building momentum for pro-privacy consumer tech for a number of years. And several players which started out with a strong focus on one particular pro-privacy product (such as a browser, search engine or email) have been expanding into a full suite of products &#8212; all under the same nontracking umbrella.</p>
<p>As well as Brave, there&#8217;s the likes of DuckDuckGo &#8212; which offers nontracking search but also a tracker blocker and an email inbox protector tool, among other products, and reckons it now has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/__trashed-13/">between 70M-100M users</a> overall; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/protonmail-gets-a-slick-new-look-as-privacy-tech-eyes-the-mainstream/">Proton, the maker of e2e-encrypted email service ProtonMail</a> but also a cloud calendar and file storage as well as a VPN. The latter recently confirmed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/__trashed-13/">passing 50M users globally</a>.</p>
<p>There is also Apple itself too, of course &#8212; a Big Tech giant that competes with Google and the adtech complex by promising users a privacy premium to drive sales of its hardware and services. (At the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021">start of this year</a> Apple said there are now over 1BN iOS users globally &#8212; and over 1.65BN Apple devices.)</p>
<p>Tl;dr: The market for privacy consumer tech is growing.</p>
<p>Still, even Apple doesn&#8217;t try to compete against Google search which perhaps underlines the scale of the challenge involved in trying to poach users from the search behemoth. (Albeit, Apple extracts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/14/google-paying-apple-3-billion-to-remain-default-search--bernstein.html">massive payments from Google</a> to preload the latter&#8217;s search engine onto iOS devices &#8212; which does conflict with (and complicate) its wider, pro-privacy, pro-user promises while also adding a nice revenue boost for Apple&#8230; ).</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo has, by contrast, been at the nontracking search coalface for years &#8212; and turning a profit since 2014. Though clearly not in the same profit league as Apple. But, more recently, it&#8217;s also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/duckduckgo-gets-10m-from-omers-for-global-privacy-push/">taken in rare tranches of external funding</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/on-a-growth-tear-duckduckgo-reveals-it-picked-up-100m-in-secondary-investment-last-year/">as its investors spy growing opportunity</a> for private search.</p>
<p>Other signs of expanding public appetite to protect people&#8217;s information from commercial snoopers include the surge of usage for e2e encrypted alternatives to Facebook-owned WhatsApp &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/">such as Signal</a> &#8212; which saw a download spike earlier this year, after the advertising giant announced unilateral changes to WhatsApp&#8217;s terms of service.</p>
<p>Credible players that have amassed a community of engaged users around a core user privacy promise are well positioned to ride each new wave of privacy interest &#8212; and cross sell a suite of consumer products where they&#8217;ve been able to expand their utility. Hence Brave believing the time is right for it to dabble in search.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave, said: “Brave Search is the industry’s most private search engine, as well as the only independent search engine, giving users the control and confidence they seek in alternatives to big tech. Unlike older search engines that track and profile users, and newer search engines that are mostly a skin on older engines and don’t have their own indexes, Brave Search offers a new way to get relevant results with a community-powered index, while guaranteeing privacy. Brave Search fills a clear void in the market today as millions of people have lost trust in the surveillance economy and actively seek solutions to be in control of their data.”</p>

<p>Brave touts its eponymous search offering as having a number of differentiating features vs rivals (including smaller rivals) &#8212; such as its own index which it also says gives it independence from other search providers.</p>
<p>Why is having an independent index important? We put that question to Josep M. Pujol, chief of search at Brave, who told us: &#8220;There are plenty of incentives for censorship and biases, either by design, or what is even more difficult to combat, unintentional. The problem of search, and how people access the web, is that it is a mono-culture, and everybody knows that while it’s very efficient, it’s also very dangerous. A single disease can kill all the crops. The current landscape is not fail-tolerant, and this is something that even users are becoming aware of. We need more choices, not to replace Google or Bing, but to offer alternatives. More choices will entail more freedom and also get back to real competition, with checks and balances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Choice can only be achieved by being independent, as if we do not have our own index, then we are just a layer of paint on top of Google and Bing, unable to change much or anything in the results for users’ queries. Not having your own index, as with certain search engines, gives the impression of choice, but in reality such engine &#8216;skins&#8217; are the same players as the big-two. Only by building our own index, which is a costly proposition, will we be in a position to offer true choice to the users for the benefit of all, whether they are Brave Search users or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although, for now, it&#8217;s worth noting that Brave is relying on some provision from other search providers &#8212; for specific queries and in areas like image search (where, for example, it says it&#8217;s currently fetching results from Microsoft-owned Bing) &#8212; to ensure its results achieve adequate relevancy.</p>
<p>Elsewhere it also says it&#8217;s relying upon anonymized contributions from the community to improve and refine results &#8212; and is seeking to live up to wider transparency claims vis-a-vis the search index (which it also claims has &#8220;no secret methods or algorithms to bias results&#8221;; and for which it will &#8220;soon&#8221; be offering &#8220;<a href="https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/goggles.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/goggles.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLB7RFV0dgjxk9pRQ0-1MQ27mH0Q">community-curated open ranking models</a> to ensure diversity and prevent algorithmic biases and outright censorship&#8221;).</p>
<p>In another transparency step Brave is reporting the percentage of users&#8217; queries that are independent by showing what it bills as &#8220;the industry’s first search independence metric&#8221; &#8212; meaning it displays the ratio of results coming exclusively from its own index.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is derived privately using the user&#8217;s browser as we do not build user profiles,&#8221; Brave notes in a press release. &#8220;Users can check this aggregate metric to verify the independence of their results and see how results are powered by our own index, or if third-parties are being used for long tail results while we are still in the process of building our index.&#8221;</p>
<p>It adds that Brave Search will &#8220;typically be answering most queries, reflected by a high independence metric&#8221;. Although if you&#8217;re performing an image search, for example, you&#8217;ll see the the independence metric take a hit (but Brave confirms this will not result in any tracking of users).</p>
<p>&#8220;[<a href="https://brave.com/transparency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brave.com/transparency/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1624365077980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEnUdHuInbNHjYiS__sy4b5fyhfVg">Transparency</a>] is a key principle at Brave, and there will also be a global independence metric for Brave Search across all searches, which we will make publicly available to show how we are progressing towards complete independence,&#8221; it adds.</p>

<p>On the monetization side, Brave says it will &#8220;soon&#8221; be offering both a paid ad-free version of search in the future and an ad-supported free version &#8212; while still pledging &#8220;fully anonymous&#8221; search. Though it specifies that it won&#8217;t be flipping the ad switch during the early beta phase.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will offer options for both ad-free paid search and ad-supported free search later,&#8221; it notes. &#8220;When we are ready, we will explore bringing private ads with BAT revenue share to search, as we&#8217;ve done for Brave user ads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Users of the search engine who do not also use Brave&#8217;s own browser will be served contextual ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Brave Search via the browser, strong privacy guarantees for opt-in ads are a norm and a brand value that we uphold,&#8221; adds Pujol, confirming that users of its search and browser are likely to get the same type of ad targeting.</p>
<p>Asked about pricing of the forthcoming ad-free version of the search engine he says: &#8220;Although we have not finalized the launch date or the price yet, our ad-free paid search will be affordable because we believe search, and access to information, should be available on fair terms for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interesting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">recent development in Europe</a>, Google &#8212; under pressure from antitrust regulators &#8212; has agreed to ditch a pay-to-play auction model for the choice screen it offers regional users of its Android platform, letting them pick a default search engine from list with a number of rivals and its own brand Google search. The move should expand the number of alternative search engines Android users in Europe are exposed to &#8212; and could help chip away at some of Google&#8217;s search marketshare.</p>
<p>Brave previously told us it would not participate in Google&#8217;s paid auction &#8212; but Pujol says that if the new model is &#8220;truly free to participate&#8221; it will likely take part in future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google and free-to-participate seem difficult to believe, given plenty of precedents but if this model is indeed truly free to participate, without contracts or nondisclosure agreements, then we would likely participate,&#8221; he says. &#8220;After all, Brave Search is open to everyone who would like to use it, and we are open and happy to put Brave Search on any platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have localized browsers throughout the European market, so in addition to growth via the Brave browser growing, we intend to grow Brave Search’s usage by marketing our best-in-class privacy on all media that reach prospective users,&#8221; he adds.</p>
