										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in 2018, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pinduoduo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pinduoduo">Pinduoduo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sent shock waves through the investor community when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/pinduoduo-is-raising-over-1-billion/">raised $1.6 billion</a> from a Nasdaq listing as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/26/the-incredible-rise-of-pinduoduo/">three-year-old company</a>. Online shoppers in China were excited to see its rise as an alternative to long-time market dominators Alibaba and JD.com.</p>
<p>But the startup founded by former Google engineer Colin Huang has ambitions well beyond e-commerce. It&#8217;s answering the Chinese government&#8217;s call to modernize the country&#8217;s agriculture and bolster the rural economy.</p>
<p>Life in China has become highly digital in many facets, from retail and entertainment to education and healthcare. But agriculture remains an exception. A McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Technology%20Media%20and%20Telecommunications/High%20Tech/Our%20Insights/Digital%20China%20Powering%20the%20economy%20to%20global%20competitiveness/MGI_Digital-China_Executive-summary_Dec-2017.pdf">report</a> from late 2017 showed that agriculture was among the least digitized industries in China. Pinduoduo saw an opportunity in the gap and started life by selling fruits online. Over time it has grown into a comprehensive e-commerce platform rivaling Alibaba, but agriculture &#8220;has always been close to the heart of Pinduoduo since its inception,&#8221; said Pinduoduo&#8217;s senior vice president Andre Zhu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Investing in smart agriculture is an extension of what we do and guided by our goal of promoting digital inclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of a standalone department, the firm&#8217;s agricultural endeavor is a company- and even society-wide effort. Its strategy and investment team takes the lead to identify solutions targeting all stages of agriculture that the company can help scale up. At the implementation stage, the team might then tap its operational colleagues for contacts at various local governments and traditional farms that want to try the technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least on the downstream distribution side, on e-commerce marketplaces for agricultural products, I would say we are relatively ahead compared to the rest of the world,&#8221; Xin Yi Lim, executive director of sustainability and agriculture impact at Pinduoduo, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>In 2019, nearly 600,000 merchants sold farm produce through Pinduoduo. That translated to some 12 million farmers who supplied their fruits and vegetables to the merchants. In August, Pinduoduo pledged to sell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/pinduoduo-145-billion-farm-produce-2025/">$145 billion worth of farm produce</a> annually by 2025. The number was $21 billion in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s really the upstream portion that we&#8217;re hoping to encourage and drive further investment in,&#8221; Lim added.</p>
<p>As such, the e-commerce giant has been traveling up the agricultural lifecycle, from building logistics infrastructure for distribution to equipping farmers with marketing know-how. In 2019, it trained close to 500,000 farm operators through its <a href="https://mms.pinduoduo.com/daxue/home">online e-commerce business institute</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087849" style="width: 666px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087849" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087849" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinduoduo-farmers.jpg" alt="" width="656" height="438" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinduoduo-farmers.jpg 656w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinduoduo-farmers.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinduoduo-farmers.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pinduoduo-farmers.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087849" class="wp-caption-text">Farmers in Yunnan Province learn how to open and operate a store on Pinduoduo at the Duo Duo University. / Photo: <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/corporate-blog/pinduoduos-ai-driven-duo-duo-farm-empowers-farmers-helping">Pinduoduo</a></p></div></p>
<p>When it comes to production, Pinduoduo is able to track purchase behavior from its hundreds of millions of buyers and tell farmers what they should plant and how much they should price their products, an approach in line with the firm&#8217;s larger direct-to-consumer strategy to cut traditional middlemen costs.</p>
<p>The e-commerce firm is also hoping to gather agronomic expertise for its farm suppliers. It kickstarted a <a href="https://smartagricompetition.com/en/information">smart farming competition</a> this year, calling teams from around the world to grow strawberries using artificial intelligence and connected devices. They were graded on criteria such as the fruit&#8217;s sweetness, energy and fertilizer use, and their AI strategy. The winner&#8217;s design would then be rolled out at one of the AI-powered <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/corporate-blog/pinduoduos-ai-driven-duo-duo-farm-empowers-farmers-helping">Duo Duo Farms</a>, a project jointly launched by Pinduoduo and the provincial government of Yunnan to let farmers sell directly on the e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>These examples are just the tip of the iceberg of Pinduoduo&#8217;s agricultural long game. The firm doesn&#8217;t disclose exactly how much it plans to <a href="https://investor.pinduoduo.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pinduoduo-raises-funds-invest-key-opportunities-agriculture">invest in the field</a>, though Lim said &#8220;compared to some of the other players in the industry, our involvement in agriculture is definitely more comprehensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company looks for investment opportunities outside China as well. While domestic players come with more affordable hardware applications, especially drones and sensors, more mature solutions around crop modeling and prediction are found in Western countries where large commercial farms prevail, Lim noted.</p>
<p>Agritech adoption among Pinduoduo farmers is still &#8220;relatively small&#8221; because the firm&#8217;s smart farming initiative is in the early stage. But the e-commerce upstart might be well-positioned to drive the development of agritech in China.</p>
<p>Different from the U.S. and Australia, China is dominated by small-scale farms that often can&#8217;t afford to buy advanced farming equipment. Lacking demand, agritech startups have had difficulty fundraising to subsequently invest in customer acquisition and lowering their price point, Lim explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinduoduo can already connect [agritech startups] with a wide pool of potential customers. I think that helps to ease a little bit of the initial pain point,&#8221; said Lim.</p>
<p>Finally, injecting technologies into farming could help retain talent in China&#8217;s vast rural hinterland, which is losing young labor to bigger, more affluent cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the long term, we [could] make farming more efficient and easier. There could potentially be a transformation in the whole structure of the farming industry. We could see young people feel that &#8216;I can actually be an entrepreneur. There are these tools that can give me more control over the output,'&#8221; Lim suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are potentially people who today are not farmers who could then start to see farming as a viable alternative.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yet more trouble brewing for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook: <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Australia&#8217;s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is suing the tech giant over its use, in 2016 and 2017, of the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/onavo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="onavo">Onavo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> VPN app to spy on users for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The ACCC&#8217;s case accuses Facebook of false, misleading or deceptive conduct toward thousands of Australian consumers, after it had promoted the Onavo Protect app &#8212; saying it would keep users personal activity data private, protected and secret and not use it for any other purpose, when it was being used to gather data to help Facebook&#8217;s business.</p>
<p>“Through Onavo Protect, Facebook was collecting and using the very detailed and valuable personal activity data of thousands of Australian consumers for its own commercial purposes, which we believe is completely contrary to the promise of protection, secrecy and privacy that was central to Facebook’s promotion of this app,” said ACCC chair Rod Sims in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Consumers often use VPN services because they care about their online privacy, and that is what this Facebook product claimed to offer. In fact, Onavo Protect channelled significant volumes of their personal activity data straight back to Facebook.”</p>
<p>“We believe that the conduct deprived Australian consumers of the opportunity to make an informed choice about the collection and use of their personal activity data by Facebook and Onavo,” Sims added.</p>
<p>The ACCC alleges that between February 1, 2016 to October 2017, Facebook and its subsidiaries Facebook Israel Ltd and Onavo, Inc. misled Australian consumers by misrepresenting the function of the free-to-download Onavo Protect app.</p>
<p>The regulator says it&#8217;s seeking declarations and pecuniary penalties.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the suit, a Facebook spokeswoman said: <i>“</i>When people downloaded <span class="il">Onavo</span> Protect, we were always clear about the information we collect and how it is used.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve cooperated with the ACCC’s investigation into this matter to date. We will review the recent filing by the ACCC and will continue to defend our position in response to this recent filing,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Facebook announced last year that it would shut the Onavo Protect app &#8212; after a backlash over how it had used the VPN app which it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/13/facebook-buys-mobile-analytics-company-onavo-and-finally-gets-its-office-in-israel/">back in 2013</a> to snoop on users.</p>

<p>Data gleaned via Onavo revealed WhatsApp to be a competitive threat to Facebook&#8217;s Messenger app. Shortly after gaining this market insight Facebook shelled out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/facebook-buying-whatsapp-for-16b-in-cash-and-stock-plus-3b-in-rsus/">$19BN to acquire the rival messaging app</a>.</p>
<p>The tech giant is now facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">a massive antitrust case on home soil</a>, where earlier this month 46 states accused it of suppressing competition through monopolistic business practices &#8212; with the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp cited as prominent examples.</p>
<p>The FTC and US lawmakers are calling for the unwinding of those mergers and the breaking up of Facebook&#8217;s social empire as a necessity.</p>

The social conglomerate said on Wednesday that it is testing the revamped Instagram Lite app in India, where it hopes to “gain valuable insights” about the new offering before “a global rollout” of the app [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is working to bring back the Instagram Lite app, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/instagram-lite-shuts-down-in-advance-of-a-relaunch/">months after it shut down</a> the light version offering worldwide.</p>
<p>The social conglomerate said on Wednesday that it is testing the revamped <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Lite app in India, where it hopes to “gain valuable insights” about the new offering before “a global rollout” of the app later.</p>
<p>The revamped Instagram Lite app weighs less than 2MB and delivers a “fast, reliable, and responsive” experience of the social service. The Android app supports Bangla, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu, but currently lacks a several core features of Instagram including Reels, Shopping and IGTV.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook quietly discontinued the previous iteration of Instagram Lite earlier this year. In July, Vishal Shah, VP of Product at Instagram, told TechCrunch that the company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/facebook-expands-instagram-reels-to-india/">identified some issues in the app</a> and was working to resolve those. In September, a new Lite app was <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/16/instagram-lite-is-back-and-barely-changed-after-a-4-month-hiatus-apk-download/">spotted in the wild</a>, though Facebook did not acknowledge it.</p>
<p>Lite apps are especially popular in emerging markets where most users don&#8217;t have access to high-end smartphones or fast and cheap mobile internet data. Facebook Lite app, for instance, had about 40 million monthly active users in India last month, while Messenger Lite app had about 13 million, according to mobile insight firm App Annie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch. (Instagram app had about 164 million users.)</p>
<p>Shah made the announcement about the revamped Instagram Lite app at Facebook Fuel for India event on Wednesday, where scores of Facebook executives including Mark Zuckerberg and Ajit Mohan outlined a number of other programs they were working on for the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Instagram also announced the second version of ‘Born on Instagram,’ a one-year-old program it has built for content creators to better understand and leverage ways to collaborate with one another and explore monetization opportunities.</p>
<p>“With the test of Instagram Lite, and the next edition of Born on Instagram, we’re aiming to democratize expression and creativity for a greater number of people in India,” said Shah.</p>
<p>At the event, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/whatsapp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="whatsapp">WhatsApp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> India head Abhijit Bose said that the company was working to launch sachet-sized health insurance offering to users in India this month. In July, WhatsApp had unveiled that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/whatsapp-to-pilot-projects-to-deliver-credit-insurance-and-pension-to-users-in-india/">working to pilot credit, insurance, and pension services</a> in India, the instant messaging app&#8217;s biggest market by users, over the next year and a half.</p>
<p>&#8220;WhatsApp has proactively been working on several pilots to help ensure that every adult has access to the most basic critical financial and livelihood services through their mobile device. By the end of this year, we expect that people will be able to buy affordable sachet sized health insurance through WhatsApp,&#8221; Bose said today. For insurance protection, WhatsApp has partnered with SBI General, and for pension, with HDFC Pension.</p>
<p>Facebook, which identifies India as its biggest market by users, is also working with telecom giant Jio Platforms to help tens of millions of small businesses establish online presence and sell digitally. The American giant, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms this year</a>, are collaborating to make Jio Platforms’ JioMart e-commerce service available through WhatsApp. Some new features are coming to JioMart’s WhatsApp channel in the “coming days,” Facebook and Reliance executives teased today.</p>

<p>Logistics is one of the biggest challenges in e-commerce, especially for smaller merchants. <a href="https://hk.pickupp.io/">Pickupp</a> helps them compete in the on-demand economy with flexible, customizable delivery services. Based in Hong Kong, Pickupp also operates in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, and claims it can save clients an average of about 28% in logistic costs.</p>
<p>Pickupp is able to do this with an asset-light business model. Instead of operating warehouses or its own fleets, it partners with logistics companies and uses proprietary software to make delivering batches of orders more efficient.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company, which currently serves about 10,000 e-commerce merchants, announced last month it closed an undisclosed amount in Series A funding from Vision Plus Capital, Alibaba Enterpreneurs Fund, Cyperport Macro Fund, Swire Properties New Ventures and SparkLabs Taipei.</p>
<p>Pickupp currently offers three kinds of door-to-door delivery services: on-demand couriers who deliver within a four hour window, same day deliveries, and one to three day deliveries. It can also customize logistics and last-minute delivery solutions for businesses.</p>
<p>In Singapore, Pickupp runs its own e-commerce platform. Called Shop On Pickupp, the platform enables merchants to move more of their retail operations online and has been used to digitize marketplaces like the Shilin Singapore Night Market during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Before starting Pickupp, co-founder and chief executive officer Crystal Pang, a software engineer by training, was part of the team that launched Uber in Hong Kong in 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;Around that time, I started looking into logistics, because I found out a lot of merchants were trying to use Uber cars to deliver other stuff, anything but people,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But unlike delivery services, merchants couldn’t bargain with Uber drivers—for example, negotiating discounted fees if they were able to wait longer for a vehicle. &#8220;That’s the gist of logistics, because everyone wants to get part of those cost savings,&#8221; Pang said. Sensing a market opportunity, Pang began using her software engineering background to think of a solution.</p>
<p>Pickupp was founded in December 2016 and began operating the next year. When it launched, Pickupp already had formidable rivals like Gogovan and Lalamove. But since those companies focused mainly on on-demand, point-to-point delivery, Pang saw an opportunity to tackle other parts of the supply chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;How we see ourselves compared to other logistics companies is that we fulfill all these e-commerce needs. We behave like a logistics company, but we don’t need to own anything. So we perform the function of a traditional logistics company, which in this area is SF Express or Ninja Van, that lease warehouses and operate their own fleets, but Pickupp choses a lightweight asset approach to getting it done,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Pickupp positions itself more as a data and tech company, Pang added.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can almost imagine us as a monitoring system,&#8221; she said. Pickupp partners with sorting facilities, cross-border freight forwarders and delivery vehicles, and gives merchants visibility into where orders are along the supply chain.</p>
<p>Its system keeps costs down by predicting when and where available delivery people will be available, so it can match them with batches of orders. This also prevents bottlenecks during demand spikes and makes sure couriers are used at the most capacity possible, which is especially important for holidays and major shopping events like Double Eleven and Black Friday.</p>
<p>One of Pickupp’s advantages is that its system is designed to be flexible so it can scale into new Asian markets quickly. Pang told TechCrunch that the round will be used to add more services, and invest in machine learning, predictive analytics and understanding customer purchasing behavior. The company also plans to expand into up to five new Asian markets over the next three years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.messagebird.com/">MessageBird</a>, the omnichannel cloud communications platform recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/messagebird-series-c/">valued at $3 billion</a> following a Series C round in October, has acquired London-based real-time web technologies company Pusher.</p>
<p>The acquisition price is $35 million, and sees <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pusher" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pusher">Pusher <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder and CEO Max Williams and the 25-person Pusher team join Amsterdam-headquartered <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/messagebird" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="messagebird">MessageBird <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. (In 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/real-time-developer-tool-startup-pusher-pulls-in-8m-in-series-a-funding/">Pusher told TechCrunch it had a team of 60</a>, so there has obviously been some cost-cutting in recent years.)</p>
<p>The Pusher product will be kept independent for existing customers, while Pusher&#8217;s tech, with its focus on in-app notifications and a developer-friendly API and SDKs built around &#8220;push,&#8221; will help plug a gap in MessageBird&#8217;s own communication platform, which is stronger in SMS and messaging-first channels such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Line and WeChat, etc. Specifically, Pusher is said to bring features like in-app messaging, push notifications and location tracking.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The deal opens up a host of new tools and features that will help MessageBird’s customers talk to their customers in even more ways than before,&#8221; says MessageBird.</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Pusher aimed to lower the barriers for developers who want to build real-time features into their websites and apps. This was originally delivered via a general purpose real-time API and supporting cloud infrastructure, enabling app developers to more easily build things like rich push notifications, live content updates and various real-time collaboration and communication features.</p>
<p>However, more recently the company had begun rolling out additional offerings dedicated to specific real-time functionality. The first of those was Chatkit, an API and SDK intended to do a lot of the heavy lifting required to add chat functionality to an app or service. This has since been extended to also include charts and location tracking/maps. Pusher customers include GitHub, Mailchimp, CodeShip and The Financial Times.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MessageBird was originally seen as a European or “rest of the world” competitor to U.S.-based Twilio — offering a cloud communications platform that supports voice, video and text capabilities all wrapped up in an API — but has since repositioned itself as an “Omnichannel Platform-as-a-Service” (OPaaS). The idea is to easily enable enterprises and medium and smaller-sized companies to communicate with customers on any channel of their choosing.</p>
<p>Out of the box, this includes support for WhatsApp, Messenger, WeChat, Twitter, Line, Telegram, SMS, email and voice. Customers can start online and then move their support request or query over to a more convenient channel, such as their favourite mobile messaging app, which, of course, can go with them. It’s all part of MessageBird founder and CEO Robert Vis’ big bet that the future of customer interactions is omnichannel.</p>
<p>Therefore the acquisition of Pusher looks like a good fit, overall. London and Amsterdam are close geographically and with similar time zones, while MessageBird is transforming into a remote-first company anyway. There is also arguably enough product overlap but also genuine gaps to make the pairing a no-brainer.</p>
<p>In a short call with MessageBird CEO and founder Robert Vis, he talked up Pusher’s tech and team and pressed home his belief that it is important that startups exiting find a “good home,” rather than simply being acquired and then disappearing without a trace. Likewise, if MessageBird wants to be truly omnichannel, a really good “push” API and product suite is needed. The next decision was then whether or not to acquire or build, and, in this instance, teaming up with Pusher was deemed the best way forward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vis advised me to expect a lot more M&amp;A in the omnichannel and messaging platform space. Not just from MessageBird as it heads toward a potential IPO, but also from competitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the midst of a major second wave of coronavirus infections across Europe, an Estonian startup that&#8217;s building an on-demand network to move food and people around in cars, on scooters and (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/bolt-launches-electric-bike-sharing-service-in-paris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recently</a>) bikes across developed and emerging markets in EMEA is announcing a major round of funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://bolt.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bolt</a>, which covers 200 cities in 40 countries with its delivery and transportation services, has raised €150 million ($182 million at current rates) in an equity round that CEO and co-founder Markus Villig said in an interview will be used to double down on geographic expansion and to help it become the biggest provider of electric scooters in Europe.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mtakso" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mtakso">Bolt <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> currently has some 50 million customers using its services, and Villig has built the business around two main areas to differentiate it from the Ubers of the world: strong capital efficiency (or &#8220;frugality&#8221; as he describes it) and putting a heavy emphasis on services for emerging markets, alongside launches in cities like London and Paris and, soon, Berlin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This round was the first time we raised with most of the previous round still in the bank, despite the pressures of Covid&#8221; he said. &#8220;This shows the frugality of the company. Due to lockdowns, we were not as aggressive as we would have liked to be, so financially we are now in a very good position for 2021.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round is being led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/d1-capital-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="d1-capital-partners">D1 Capital Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation also from Darsana Capital Partners. D1 has this year been a huge player in growth rounds for some of the very biggest startups: it has made investments in eyewear giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/warby-parker-valued-at-3-billion-raises-245-million-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warby Parker</a>, gaming engine maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/unity-now-valued-at-6b-raising-up-to-525m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity</a>, car sales portal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cazoo-the-uk-used-car-sales-portal-raises-another-311m-now-valued-at-over-2b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cazoo</a>, and fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/transferwise-five-unicorns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TransferWise</a>, collectively with valuations into the multiple billions of dollars.</p>
<p>On that note, Villig wouldn&#8217;t disclose what Bolt&#8217;s valuation is but said that it was closer to the multiples of 1.5x on gross merchandise value (GMV: the total figure transacted on Bolt&#8217;s platform), <em>a la</em> the recently listed DoorDash, than it is closer to &#8220;others&#8221; in the transport space that are seeing valuations closer to 0.5x GMV.</p>
<p>He also confirmed to me that Bolt is doing about €2 billion in GMV currently annually, which would give it a valuation, by his hinted calculations, of €3.5 billion ($4.3 billion). No comment from Villig on my number crunching, but he also didn&#8217;t dispute it.</p>
<p>For some context,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/bolt-the-european-on-demand-transport-company-raises-109m-on-a-1-9b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> in May of this year</a> Bolt was valued at $1.9 billion after raising just over $100 million. At the time, it said it had 30 million users, so it&#8217;s added 20 million in about six months.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s rise has been an interesting counterpoint to the likes of Uber, which built its business with early, aggressive &#8212; and as it turned out, very costly &#8212; growth into multiple markets and product areas, a number of which it has more recently been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">divesting</a> (see also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/11/uber-global-exits-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for other examples).</p>
<p>Founded originally as Taxify and slowly growing the business just around ride-hailing for a number of years in less-scrutinized emerging markets, the company rebranded in 2019 as it kicked its strategy into a higher gear, with launches in cities like London and a move into micro-mobility, primarily around electric scooters. Its current list of biggest markets reflects that mix: Villig said they were the UK, France, South Africa and Nigeria.</p>
<p>Not all of that has been smooth, with too-aggressive moves, such as a <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/taxify-stop-london-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed initial launch in London</a> &#8212; scuppered when regulators quickly responded to its attempt to exploit a loophole to get a license &#8212; quickly burning the company (and possibly teaching Villig a lesson he&#8217;s tried to remember going forward).</p>
<p>Even with the shift, Villig said that his aim is to keep the company operating on the same frugal ethos when it comes to considering new investments and how to grow. And that gives a potentially different cast to news of, say, Bolt rolling out <a href="https://blog.bolt.eu/en/bolt-launches-new-fourth-generation-scooter-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newer scooter models</a>, or <a href="https://blog.bolt.eu/en/climate-positive-by-the-end-of-2020-the-bolt-e-scooter-sustainability-pledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commitments</a> to carbon reduction.</p>
<p>He noted that in a year that has seen so many job losses, particularly in businesses that have seen massive drops in users and usage, Bolt has not laid off anyone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting, indeed, to see how and which companies choose to &#8220;zig&#8221; while others &#8220;zag&#8221; at the moment.</p>
<p>The food delivery business is a case in point. We are seeing a number of consolidations underway, with Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring Postmates</a>, and Just Eat Takeaway (itself a big <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/justeat-takeaway-7-6b-merger-approved-pair-pick-up-756m-in-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">merger</a>) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/just-eat-takeaway-confirms-its-gobbling-up-grubhub-in-a-7-3b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring Grubhub</a>. Alongside that there have also been a number of closures of smaller players that found it too costly to try to scale. Within that context, Bolt is doubling down on food delivery, with Bolt Food in 16 countries and 33 cities and plans for more cities in the coming year.</p>
<p>&#8220;What most people have not realized is that the food part is what we are most optimistic about,&#8221; Villig said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently we are adding restaurants by the day. There are cost synergies on a lot of fronts, including the supply side, where drivers can serve passengers and food. But also today we have had to decline some drivers for car-based services because they don&#8217;t have the right licenses, but now we can offer them to carry goods on bikes, which doesn’t require that license at all. We can offer something to drivers that we weren’t able to do. And what that means is no need to spend money on finding drivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Bolt was &#8220;lucky&#8221; to get into food, even as late as 2019 since restaurants that were already interested were augmented by a new wave of them in the wake of the health pandemic and forced closures and reduced diners overall in venues. &#8220;They were all keen to get additional income and were eager to try out new platforms,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That willingness to find the way ahead even in what looks like a murky or hard market is what has brought investors around this time. Villig said they were already talking to a lot of them, and so it made sense to close the round to prepare for 2021.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Bolt as they continue to build a market-leading mobility platform across Europe and Africa,&#8221; said Dan Sundheim, founder of D1 Capital, in a statement. &#8220;The team has executed incredibly well during a challenging year and continues to provide millions of users with safety, flexibility and great value. We are optimistic about the growth opportunity ahead for Bolt after the COVID-19 pandemic and look forward to supporting the team as they invest in innovation over the coming years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might not know yet of <a href="https://www.xyz.vc/">XYZ Venture Capital</a>, a four-year-old, San Francisco-based seed-stage venture firm, but many veterans of Palantir are surely aware of it. XYZ says it has already backed 22 startups whose founders came out of the data analysis company, including most notably, <a href="https://www.anduril.com/">Anduril</a>, Lucky Palmer&#8217;s defense tech startup. In fact, the founder of XYZ, Ross Fubini, says his firm wrote Anduril its first check.</p>
<p>It all dates back to a key introduction. Fubini is a Carnegie Mellon grad who cofounded an enterprise company, CubeTree, that a dozen years later, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/05/03/successfactors-acquires-social-enterprise-software-startup-cubetree-for-50-million/">sold</a> to SuccessFactors, which was itself <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2011/12/03/sap-acquires-successfactors-for-3-4-billion/">acquired</a> by SAP the next year, in 2011.</p>
<p>Then, like a lot of founders, he started writing checks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, Fubini linked up with Mitch Kapor, another software mogul turned investor and a friend of Fubini who bought him into his <a href="https://www.kaporcapital.com/">venture firm</a> and taught him the ropes. During his one year spent with the outfit, Fubini says, he wrote seed checks into the digital care company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/omada-health-secures-4-7m-from-usvp-nea-kapor-more-to-roll-out-its-online-diabetes-prevention-program/">Omada Health</a>, the optimization platform Optimizely (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/episerver-acquires-optimizely/">acquired</a> this fall), and LendUp, the payday loan company that was <a href="https://www.axios.com/fintech-company-lendup-splitting-up-be92e13b-ec9e-4526-9f3e-d1923c441229.html">split into two</a> businesses back in 2018.</p>
<p>From Kapor Capital, it was onto Canaan Partners as a venture partner and, just three years later, to <a href="https://www.villageglobal.vc/">Village Global</a>, the early-stage venture firm that was founded in 2017 with the backing of prominent founders like Bill Gates and Reid Hoffman. (Fubini <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/16/village-global-fund/">helped cofound</a> the outfit with a handful of others.)</p>
<p>At the same time, Fubini began raising his own pool of capital under the brand XYZ Ventures, eventually launching a<a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/13/venture-capitalist-and-palantir-advisor-ross.html"> $70 million fund.</a></p>
<p>Now he&#8217;s turning the enterprise into a bigger organization.</p>
<p>For starters, this year, XYZ closed its second fund with $80 million in capital commitments from what Fubini says is predominately institutional investors, and it has been investing actively. Fubini says the firm has already written checks to 30 different startups that range in size from $500,000 to $4 million in exchange for 12% to 20% ownership.</p>
<p>He also brought aboard a partner: Chauncey Kerr Hamilton, who spent more than five years as a partner operations manager with First Round and was looking for a new challenge when a mutual friend introduced her to Fubini. &#8220;I kept hearing about Ross from founders and other investors and we met for coffee, then we kept meeting week after week,&#8221; she says of their earlier conversations.</p>
<p>Hamilton says she realized over time that &#8220;we&#8217;re kindred spirits.&#8221; But she has also pushed Fubini to be more public for the sake of XYZ&#8217;s portfolio companies. As a former projects editor at Wired before leaping into venture capital, she half-kiddingly refers to the &#8220;mystique&#8221; of XYZ Ventures, but she also wondered if it might be easier for founders to discuss their lead investor if they could point to more than Fubini&#8217;s LinkedIn page.</p>
<p>Certainly, it makes sense as XYZ widens its aperture beyond Palantir, which was itself long known for keeping a low profile and where Fubini&#8217;s relationship began when he introduced Palantir&#8217;s first business hire to its first engineer. That business hire, a personal friend, is today Palantir&#8217;s chief operating officer, Shyam Sankar; the second, Akash (&#8220;Aki&#8221;) Jain, a former colleague of Fubini, is now Palantir&#8217;s president.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the highest value thing I&#8217;ve done,&#8221; Fubini says of bringing the two together, which led to an early and lasting advisor role at the company, where he helped develop senior talent and work through challenges (and received advisor shares in return).</p>
<p>Indeed, he has since become a first call for some who spin out of the company. In addition to Anduril &#8212;  cofounded by former Palantir execs Matt Grimm, Trae Stephens, and Brian Schimpf &#8212; XYZ has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/saltbox-raises-3-million-to-build-co-working-for-entrepreneurs-who-need-warehouse-space-300911386.html">more recently</a> backed the the San Diego-based financial planning platform <a href="https://www.mosaic.tech/">Mosaic.</a> Cofounder Bijan Moallemi is a former finance exec at Palantir.</p>
<p>XYZ also wrote the first check for <a href="https://www.joinsaltbox.com/">Saltbox</a>, an Atlanta-based startup that&#8217;s building co-working units for founders needing warehouse space. Saltbox&#8217;s founder, Tyler Scriven, previously spent more than seven years as a chief of staff at Palantir.</p>
<p>Fubini and Hamilton stress that while a meaningful portion of XYZ&#8217;s capital has flowed into the &#8220;Palantir diaspora,&#8221; the company has other areas of interest, too, mostly enterprise related.</p>
<p>XYZ is very focused, for example, on fintech, betting on <a href="https://www.bond.tech/">Bond Technologies</a>, a company that helps brands and banks integrate their offerings. It has insure-tech investments, like the brokerage <a href="https://www.newfront.com/">Newfront Insurance</a>. And it is focused on security and counts <a href="https://www.verkada.com/">Verkada</a> among its portfolio companies, a now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/verkada-security/">highly valued outfit</a> that poorly handled a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21535089/surveillance-company-verkada-harassed-female-employees">sexual harassment situation</a> but seems to have survived it.</p>
<p>XYZ even made a direct-to-consumer bet recently, though Fubini and Hamilton aren&#8217;t talking about it just yet.</p>
<p>Mostly, they say, they&#8217;re focused on &#8220;trends we believe are exploding,&#8221; says Hamilton. Think video, she says. Think fintech infrastructure, she adds. &#8220;For fintech that&#8217;s building a new bank, we think three companies will replace the crappy software&#8221; that supports them, says Fubini.</p>
<p>As for how they wins deals against VCs when it comes to founders to whom they aren&#8217;t already connected in some way, Fubini says it&#8217;s not so complicated. Being &#8220;bizarrely honest&#8221; has proved helpful, he says. But also, he says, &#8220;If you&#8217;re good, and you work goddamn hard, you start seeing more stuff.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just six month after raising its first bit of outside funding, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/clickup" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="clickup">ClickUp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clickup-raises-100m-series-b-as-demand-for-its-productivity-platform-soars-301192754.html">has closed $100 million</a> in new funding and reached a $1 billion valuation, a report in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/software-maker-clickup-reaches-1-billion-value-in-funding-round">Bloomberg</a> first reported.</p>
<p>The company has seen plenty of growth in the past several months to justify that new unicorn status, including doubling the amount of users to 2 million. In a press release the company also detailed it had grown revenue nine times over since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>This latest $100 million round was led by Canadian firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/georgian-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="georgian-partners">Georgian <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/craft-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="craft-ventures">Craft Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which led the startup&#8217;s $35 million Series A back in June. The high valuation showcases just how eager investors are to find winners in the productivity software space, which has seen massive customer gains as an industry this year, partially as a result of shifting corporate attitudes toward working from home.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xf2Nn057mq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/productivity-platform-clickup-raises-35-million-from-craft-ventures/">Productivity platform ClickUp raises $35 million from Craft Ventures</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Productivity platform ClickUp raises $35 million from Craft Ventures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/productivity-platform-clickup-raises-35-million-from-craft-ventures/embed/#?secret=xf2Nn057mq" data-secret="xf2Nn057mq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>ClickUp is aiming to further capitalize as it scales its team and product. The company of 200 has doubled in size since its last raise and is hoping to double again in the next several months, CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/zeb-brian-evans" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="zeb-brian-evans">Zeb Evans <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>ClickUp sells productivity software, but their main sell has been tying several products in that space into a single platform, aiming to reduce the number of tools their customers use. The team has recently begun integrating tools like email into their platform so that users can complete workflows inside the product.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just like a value play of using one app instead of three or four, it&#8217;s an efficiency play by saving so much time and frustration from having all the other different solutions,&#8221; Evans tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Even as the company continues scaling the product through weekly updates to the company&#8217;s apps, including a newly revamped iOS app which launched today (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/android" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="android">Android <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> launches tomorrow), the team is looking toward how they can build for the long-term.</p>
<p>As to how long this cash will last, Evans isn&#8217;t making any promises. &#8220;I think this will keep us going for a while, though to be honest with you I would&#8217;ve said the same thing with the Series A,&#8221; Evans says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> is tweaking its subscription plans with a new mid-tier offering called <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/revolut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="revolut">Revolut <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Plus — it costs £2.99 per month. Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/n26-launches-mid-tier-subscription-plan-for-e4-90-per-month/">N26 Smart</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/monzo-plus/">Monzo Plus</a>, the new plan is a pandemic-proof package that doesn’t focus as much on travel.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, challenger banks and alternatives to traditional bank accounts have been packaging additional services into paid plans. Essentially, those fintech startups are slowly becoming freemium software-as-a-service companies.</p>
<p>The majority of users don’t subscribe to paid plans. But a small portion is willing to pay a fixed monthly fee to access advanced features, get an insurance package and pay less in variable fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Revolut already has two paid plans — Premium and Metal. Premium increases limits on free ATM withdrawals and foreign exchange. You also get overseas medical insurance, delayed baggage and flight insurance and winter sports coverage. You can also access advanced features, such as disposable virtual cards and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/revolut-launches-revolut-junior-to-help-you-manage-allowance/">Revolut Junior</a> accounts</p>
<p>With a Metal plan, your insurance package is a bit more thorough, with purchase protection and car hire excess. You get a tiny bit of cash back on purchases (0.1% in Europe, 1% outside of Europe capped at the monthly subscription price) and higher limits across various products.</p>
<p>Another big selling point has been card designs. With the Metal plan, as the name suggests, you get a metal card. It’s not that useful but some people like it. Premium subscribers can also choose between premium card designs.</p>
<p>Revolut Premium costs £6.99 per month and Revolut Metal costs £12.99 per month (or €7.99 and €13.99, respectively in Europe). You pay a bit less if you pay upfront for a year.</p>
<p>So what is Revolut Plus? It costs £2.99 per month, which makes it a lot more affordable than Revolut Premium. The main selling point is purchase protection provided by Qover. All paid plans now get purchase protection with different limits on damaged or stolen goods (up to £1,000, £2,500 and £10,000 depending on your plan). You can get a refund on purchases up to 90 days after buying eligible products. If you book a ticket and your event is cancelled, you could also get a refund.</p>
<p>In addition to a new card design, Revolut Plus subscribers can also use virtual cards. You can also create junior accounts with the new mid-tier plan.</p>
<p>As you can see, there’s no overseas travel insurance. You also don’t get unlimited free currency exchange (other than spread). Revolut Plus is focused on people who mostly use their Revolut account in their home country.</p>
<p>Revolut is also tweaking other plans, so it’s going to be important to check the terms and conditions before you renew your paid plan. The new Plus plan is available today in the U.K. and will be rolled out next week in the European Economic Area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks, formerly of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pinterest" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pinterest">Pinterest&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> policy team, alleged racial and gender discrimination at Pinterest in June, the hope was for Pinterest to make them whole and address its culture of alleged discrimination, Ozoma told TechCrunch. But that&#8217;s not what happened.</p>
<p>Just two months later, former Pinterest COO Françoise Brougher sued Pinterest, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/former-coo-sues-pinterest-accusing-it-of-gender-discrimination-retaliation-and-wrongful-termination/">alleging gender discrimination, which yesterday resulted in a $22.5 million settlement. </a>As part of the settlement, Pinterest will pay $20 million to Brougher and her attorneys, <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001506293/3fef4e2e-328e-449a-8971-469b1f68011a.pdf">the company wrote in a filing</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about as plain a case of disparate treatment and discrimination as you can come up with,&#8221; Ozoma said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On a call with TechCrunch today, Ozoma and Banks described a double standard in their experiences compared to Brougher&#8217;s. While Brougher received a $20 million payout, Ozoma and Banks received less than one year&#8217;s worth of severance.</p>
<p>&#8220;This follows the time-honored tradition in America where Black women come forward, blazing a trail, revealing injustice and white women coming in and reaping all the benefits of that,&#8221; Banks told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/05/human-capital-googles-labor-stumbles/">Earlier this month</a>, a group of shareholders filed a lawsuit against Pinterest executives, including CEO Ben Silbermann, alleging they enabled a culture of discrimination. The complaint goes on to allege that culture of discrimination has harmed Pinterest’s reputation and led to financial harm.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bok2noK4ey"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/05/human-capital-googles-labor-stumbles/">Human Capital: Google&#8217;s labor stumbles</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Human Capital: Google&#8217;s labor stumbles&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/05/human-capital-googles-labor-stumbles/embed/#?secret=bok2noK4ey" data-secret="bok2noK4ey" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Ozoma and Banks, however, they say they&#8217;ve exhausted all of their legal options and will not pursue a lawsuit. Banks said it is important to keep in mind the fact that Brougher, a former COO, had far more resources to pursue litigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we, like in many, many, many other cases, Black women put ourselves on the line, shared absolutely everything that happened to us, then laid the groundwork for someone else to swoop in and collect &#8216;progress,&#8217; &#8221; Ozoma said. &#8220;No progress has been made here because no rights have been made with people who harm has been done to.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a part of the settlement, both Pinterest and Brougher will commit $2.5 million toward “advancing women and underrepresented communities” in the tech industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Francoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported,&#8221; Pinterest and Brougher said in a joint statement detailing the settlement.</p>
<p>Ozoma took issue with Pinterest and Brougher donating $2.5 million to charity. She said, &#8220;it smells rotten,&#8221; noting that she herself is an individual and not a charity.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Pinterest regarding Ozoma and Banks&#8217; recent statements. Pinterest declined to comment, saying the company doesn&#8217;t comment on legal matters. In June, however, Pinterest said in a statement to TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We took these issues seriously and conducted a thorough investigation when they were raised, and we&#8217;re confident both employees were treated fairly. We want each and every one of our employees at Pinterest to feel welcomed, valued, and respected. As we outlined in our statement on June 2nd, we’re committed to advancing our work in inclusion and diversity by taking action at our company and on our platform. In areas where we, as a company, fall short, we must and will do better.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/14/pinterest-employees-are-walking-out-today-in-light-of-discrimination-allegations/">Pinterest employees staged a walkout in August</a> shortly after Brougher filed her suit. In addition to the walkout, <a href="https://www.coworker.org/petitions/put-an-end-to-all-forms-of-discrimination-and-retaliation-at-pinterest-1">a petition circulated throughout the company demanding systemic change</a>. The change they sought entailed full transparency about promotion levels and retention, total compensation package transparency and for the people within two layers of reporting to the CEO to be at least 25% women and 8% underrepresented employees.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<p>Since then, Pinterest has made some changes at the board level. A couple of days after the walkout, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/pinterest-announces-first-black-board-member/">Pinterest announced Andrea Wishom as the company’s first-ever Black board member</a>. In October, Pinterest added its second Black board member, Salaam Coleman Smith.</p>
<p>Pinterest says it has also enhanced its hiring and interview processes to try to improve diversity at senior levels, updated its inclusion training and launched an internal wiki detailing how Pinterest makes compensation decisions.</p>
<p>Pinterest had long been considered a leader in diversity and inclusion. When asked about whether that has ever been true &#8212; if Pinterest had effectively enacted a solid DEI strategy &#8212; Ozoma was clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. If it were true, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d be having a conversation right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Discrimination, particularly toward Black women, is systemic in the tech industry. Earlier this month, Dr. Timnit Gebru <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">said Google fired her for an email speaking out about ethics in artificial intelligence</a>. Banks and Ozoma told TechCrunch they are worried about a chilling effect on other Black women coming forward.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="D4vmmx5OUd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">Google&#8217;s co-lead of Ethical AI team says she was fired for sending an email</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google&#8217;s co-lead of Ethical AI team says she was fired for sending an email&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/embed/#?secret=D4vmmx5OUd" data-secret="D4vmmx5OUd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One person reached out to her, Banks said, asking about what hope other Black women have.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we said something,&#8221; Ozoma said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not in a position that someone in the C-suite would have been. But our integrity means more than anything else, and if we can help other folks, we will.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nine months into the pandemic, one of the first states to institute a shut down is back at square one. Following a major spike in COVID-19 cases, California governor Gavin Newsom reinstituted major closures across the state, leaving many residents in search of new avenues to acquire essentials without leaving their home.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/robomart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="robomart">Robomart <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is seemingly still a long ways away from being a fully finalized offering, but the startup has begun offering limited service in Los Angeles’ West Hollywood neighborhood. Currently being offered as an invite-only beta, the service offers essential deliveries in the back of a van. Users purchase goods from the Robomart app and the vehicle will drive out to meet them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087712" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087712" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087712" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087712" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Robomart</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The offering is launching as a mobile pharmacy, offering 500 packs of 50 products. The list includes over-the-counter meds, toiletries and household and kitchen products, among others. A grocery version of the service is also set to launch in the neighborhood in “the coming weeks,” per Robomart.</p>
<p>The eventual plan is to make deliveries via autonomous vehicles when all of the necessary regulatory and technological hurdles have been cleared. For now, however, the startup is partnering with fleet leasing company Zeeba Vans for deliveries. The plan is to increase to 100 vans within two years. Checkouts are performed with RFID tags.</p>
<p>Investors include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/wasabi-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="wasabi-ventures">Wasabi Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> SOSV, HAX, Hustle Fund, Automation Fund and Archetype.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087714" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087714" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2087714" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087714" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Robomart</p></div></p>
<p>“The startup world has been a bit myopic on fully autonomous driving as the only path to profitable on-demand commerce,” HAX’s Garrett Winther says in a statement to TechCrunch. “The reality is that a few shifts in the underlying local distribution model and clever operational integrations allows for ‘store hailing’ to scale much sooner than everyone expects.”</p>
<p>At the very least, the company appears to be striking while the iron is hot on this one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket launch startup <a href="https://astra.com">Astra</a> has joined an elite group of companies that can say their vehicle has actually made it to orbital space &#8212; earlier than expected. The company&#8217;s Rocket 3.2 test rocket (yes, it&#8217;s a rocket called &#8220;Rocket&#8221;) passed the Karman line, the separation point 100 km (62 miles) up that most consider the barrier between Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and space, during a launch today from Kodiak, Alaska.</p>
<p>This is the second in this series of orbital flight tests by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astra-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astra-3">Astra; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> it flew its Rocket 3.1 test vehicle in September, but while that flight was successful by the company&#8217;s own definition, since it lifted off and provided a lot of data, it didn&#8217;t reach space or orbit. Both the 3.1 and 3.2 rockets are part of a planned three-launch series that Astra said would be designed to reach orbital altitudes by the end of the trio of attempts.</p>

<p>Astra is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/why-astra-built-a-space-startup-and-rocket-factory-in-silicon-valley/">small satellite launch startup that builds its rockets in California&#8217;s East Bay</a>, at a factory it established there which is designed to ultimately produce its launchers in volume. Their model uses smaller craft than existing options like either SpaceX or Rocket Lab, but aims to provide responsive, short turnaround launch services at a relatively low cost &#8212; a bus to space rather than a hired limousine. They compete more directly with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/25/virgin-orbits-first-orbital-test-flight-cut-short-after-rocket-released-from-carrier-aircraft/">something like Virgin Orbit, which has yet to reach space with its launch craft</a>.</p>

<p>This marks a tremendous win and milestone for Astra&#8217;s rocket program, made even more impressive by the relatively short turnaround between their rocket loss error in September, which the company determined was a result of a problem in its onboard guidance system. Correcting the mistake and getting back to an active, and successful launch, within three months, is a tremendous technical achievement, even in the best of times, and the company faced additional challenges because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Astra was not expecting to make it as far as it did today &#8212; the startup has defined seven stages of reaching orbital flight for its development program; today it expected to achieve 1) count and liftoff; and 2) reaching Max Q, the point of maximum dynamic pressure undergone by a rocket in flight in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Third, they were looking to achieve nominal main-engine cutoff for first stage &#8212; and this is where they would&#8217;ve pegged success today, but the &#8220;rocket continued to perform,&#8221; according to CEO and founder Chris Kemp on a call following the launch.</p>
<p>Rocket 3.2 then performed a successful stage separation, and then the second stage passed through the Karman line, reaching outer space. After that, it went farther still, achieving a successful upper-stage ignition, and a nominal upper-stage engine shut off six minutes later. Even then, the rocket reached 390 km, which is its target orbital height, but then reached a velocity of 7.2 km per hours, just one half km/hour less than the 7.68 km required for orbital velocity.</p>

<p>Astra emphasized that the mix for the propellant for this stage is basically only to be nailed down while testing in situ in space, so they say this will just require some upper-stage propellant mixtures to achieve that extra velocity, and Kemp said they&#8217;re confident they can do that in the next couple of months, and start reliving payloads early next year. This won&#8217;t require any hardware or software changes, the company noted, just a tweak in the variables involved.</p>

<p>He added that this is a big win for the underlying theory behind Astra&#8217;s approach, which focuses on using significant amounts of automation in order to reduce costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve only been in business for about four years, and this team only has about 100 people today,&#8221; Kemp said. &#8220;This team was able to overcome tremendous challenges on the way to this success. We had a member of the team quarantining, and tested positive on the way to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kodiak" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kodiak">Kodiak, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which meant they had to quarantine the entire team, and then sent an entire backup team to replace them.&#8221; This was possible because they only use five people on the launch team.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now are at a point where just five people can go up, and set up the entire launch site and rocket, and launch in just a couple of days,&#8221; Kemp said. The team is literally just five people &#8212; including labor, rocket unloading, setup and everything on-site &#8212; the rest is run remotely from mission control in California via the cloud.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Now they will do some tuning for Rocket 3.3, which is currently in California at the Astra factory, before soon attempting that final orbital test flight with a payload on board to deploy. After that, they intend to continue to iterate with each version of Rocket launched, focusing on reducing costs and improving performance through rapid evolution of the design and technology.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While it doesn&#8217;t appear to be completely down <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/gmail-youtube-google-docs-and-other-services-go-down-simultaneously-in-multiple-countries/">like it was yesterday morning</a>, we&#8217;re hearing many reports from Gmail users that the email service is having major issues right now.</p>
<p>Some users are reporting that Gmail is particularly slow, while others are reporting constant error messages. One TechCrunch writer, meanwhile, noticed that emails he was sending to Gmail accounts <strong>appeared to immediately bounce</strong>, with Gmail&#8217;s server responding with an error reading &#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-b88u0q r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">550-5.1.1</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> The email account that you tried to reach does not exist.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> confirms the issues on its <a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;v=issue&amp;sid=1&amp;iid=a8b67908fadee664c68c240ff9f529ab">services dashboard</a>, writing at 1:30 PM Pacific that they&#8217;re impacting a &#8220;significant&#8221; number of users:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re aware of a problem with Gmail affecting a significant subset of users. The affected users are able to access Gmail, but are seeing error messages, high latency, and/or other unexpected behavior.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a second update at 2:30 PM, Google says its teams are &#8220;continuing to investigate this issue&#8221;; as of 3:30 PM, the company says it expects the issues to be fixed by 4:00 PM while noting that time may change.</p>
<p><strong>Update, 4:15 PM Pacific: </strong>Google now says the problems have been resolved.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, encrypted email service ProtonMail tweets that the email bouncing issue mentioned above is widespread, with many emails sent to Gmail users bouncing permanently:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gmail is currently suffering a serious outage and permanently bouncing emails sent to Gmail users. The problem is on Google&#39;s side, and is impacting all email traffic (not specific to ProtonMail). We will continue monitoring the situation.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>If you&#8217;re sending an email of any importance to a Gmail user right now, you&#8217;ll want to wait until this is fully fixed; if you&#8217;ve sent one in the last few hours, double check it was actually received.</p>

<p>The deal, yet to close, is one of the largest enterprise buys of the year: Vista is getting an online training company that helps retrain techies with in-demand skills through online courses in the midst of a booming edtech market. Additionally, the sector is losing one of its few publicly traded companies just two years after it debuted on the stock market.</p>

<p>Investors and founders told Techcrunch that the Pluralsight acquisition is largely a positive signal that shows the strength of edtech’s capital options as the pandemic continues.</p>
<p>&#8220;What’s happening in edtech is that capital markets are liquidating,&#8221; said Deborah Quazzo, managing partner of GSV Advisors.</p>
<p>Quazzo, a seed investor in Pluralsight, said the ability to move fluidly between privately held and publicly held companies is a characteristic of tech sectors with deep capital markets, which is different from edtech’s &#8220;old days, where the options to exit were very narrow.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the icy tundra of Siberia in 2009, a derelict Russian military satellite, Kosmos-2251, slammed into an active communications satellite, Iridium 33, at speeds in excess of 26,000 miles per hour. Both were immediately smashed to smithereens.</p>
<p>As a result of this single collision, approximately 1,800 large pieces of space debris, each capable of destroying any spacecraft unfortunate enough to cross its path, remain in orbit to this day and for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Depending on who you ask, space debris is either a nonissue that will solve itself or a critical problem that threatens the future of space exploration. We interviewed dozens of experts across industry, academia and the regulatory landscape to better understand which of these viewpoints is closer to the truth, and to consider what ought to be done going forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What is space debris?</h2>
<p>Far from homogenous, space debris includes any nonfunctional human-made object in space, including rocket parts that have been abandoned in orbit after having completed their mission, defunct satellites, fragments from <a href="https://spacenews.com/u-s-satellite-destroyed-in-space-collision/">unintentional</a> and <a href="https://www.space.com/3415-china-anti-satellite-test-worrisome-debris-cloud-circles-earth.html">intentional</a> <a href="https://www.space.com/india-anti-satellite-test-significance.html">orbital collisions</a> and items released during operations. These sources have multiplied to create a large amount of space debris orbiting Earth.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			According to NASA, there are over 30,000 objects larger than a softball in orbit, traveling at speeds up to 18,000 miles per hour.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>This debris is spread across all three of the main regions of space around Earth: low-Earth orbit (LEO), medium-Earth orbit (MEO) and geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO). As its name suggests, LEO is the closest to us, extending up to 2,000 km from the Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>It is the most crowded region of the three and, in addition to hosting the International Space Station, it is the region where SpaceX, OneWeb and other well-funded companies are currently sending tens of thousands of new satellites as part of their constellations. Perhaps not surprisingly, LEO is the region with the most debris. As a result, it tends to be the focus of much of the discussion around the issue.</p>
<p>Above LEO, satellites in MEO and GEO are also threatened by space debris. This is important because these orbits host a number of crucial satellites, including navigation systems in MEO such as the American GPS and European Galileo, and critical GEO-based communication satellites. Satellites in GEO are able to maintain a single point above the Earth (this special orbit is possible because the satellite is orbiting around Earth at the same speed the Earth is rotating).</p>
<p>Given the altitude of both MEO (2,000 km-36,000 km) and GEO (~36,000 km), de-orbiting the satellite is not a viable option — the current solution when satellites retire is to move them to unused orbits called “graveyard orbits,” further contributing to the growth of space debris above us.</p>
<h2>Why does space debris matter?</h2>
<p>The existence of space debris is concerning for many reasons, with physical collisions being the most obvious. The possible risk caused by space debris is magnified by the incredible speed at which debris typically travels. According to NASA, there are over 30,000 objects larger than a softball in orbit, traveling at speeds up to 18,000 miles per hour. At that speed, any one of these objects is capable of completely destroying a spacecraft.</p>
<p>Even debris just 1 cm in diameter can disable an operational spacecraft, while even smaller fragments can cause huge problems as well. Indeed, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/05/12/tiny_space_trash_impact_cracks_window_on_international_space_station/">a fleck of paint</a> was enough to damage a window on the International Space Station, which has been forced into maneuvers to avoid larger, potentially catastrophic debris 28 times since 1999, including<a href="https://spacenews.com/space-station-maneuvers-to-avoid-debris/"> three times in 2020 alone</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, tracking all of this debris has proven to be an arduous challenge. For starters, only objects larger than 10 cm in diameter are currently tracked by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). However, there are likely 900,000 objects less than 10 cm but larger than 1 cm, and tens of millions of objects smaller than 1 cm that are not tracked by the current system but that are still capable of causing significant damage. Of particular concern is the range between 1 cm and 10 cm, which has appropriately earned the moniker of lethal nontrackable debris, or LNT.</p>
<p>Space junk poses other challenges as well. Astronomers lament that light pollution from objects in orbit hampers observation of the night sky. The reliance of observatories — often involving equipment costing hundreds of millions of dollars — on long exposures makes debris particularly problematic. Another worry is “Kessler syndrome,” which takes its name from NASA scientist Donald Kessler.</p>
<p>In 1978, Kessler postulated that more space debris would increase the likelihood of collisions, which in turn would lead to more space debris, and so on, in an exponential growth that may end up compromising orbital operations. In other words, the issue could evolve into a never-ending spiral that eventually renders LEO unusable and possibly impenetrable.</p>
<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
<p>Before considering how to respond, it is important to understand the landscape of those affected by space debris.</p>
<p>Launch providers are among the most crucial players — after all, their business models hinge on their ability to put payloads into orbit. They are also part of the problem. Launcher parts (i.e., spent upper stages) left in orbit have been, in the words of professor Lorenzo Casalino of the Polytechnic University of Turin, “piling up for decades.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Astroscale sets March 2021 for first commercial orbital debris removal demonstration&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/astroscale-sets-march-2021-for-first-commercial-orbital-debris-removal-demonstration/embed/#?secret=y559aM2071" data-secret="y559aM2071" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He believes launch providers have been “among the most critical contributors to space debris.” However, some newer launch companies, such as<a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/"> Rocket Lab</a>, do not leave any piece of their rockets in space. Instead, they de-orbit the stages, which causes them to burn up upon reentry into Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>Satellite operators are also a crucial component of the ecosystem. On one hand, they are the ones most responsible for the overcrowding of space; on the other, they are the most likely victims of space debris. Mike Safyan of Planet, which has over 150 satellites in orbit, notes that mitigating space debris is “in the interest of satellite operators,” and that many are already incorporating maneuverability and de-orbiting technologies into their satellites.</p>
<p>For example, OneWeb, a large constellation operator, is designing its satellites to be “de-orbit ready.” Darren McKnight, Technical Director at Centauri, a satellite operator, explains that operators are faced with a “significant decline in overall reliability” as their systems are increasingly affected by a constantly growing space debris cloud, and thus incentivized to act. Sara Spangelo, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://swarm.space/tracking/">Swarm Technologies</a>, says many private companies have already started to implement measures for space debris mitigation. Swarm Technologies has proven that it can consistently track its tiny satellites and recently added active attitude and propulsion control to maneuver out of the trajectory of debris.</p>
<p>These strategies help ensure that while the 10 cm by 10 cm by 2.8 cm (the size of a grilled cheese sandwich) satellites are providing connectivity around the world, they do not contribute to the growth of the space debris cloud.</p>
<p>An interesting role is played by insurance companies. Chris Quilty, a commercial space expert, notes that while satellite insurance remains relatively uncommon — fewer than a tenth of satellites in LEO are covered by insurance — insurers are likely to play an increasingly large role as the risk of collisions becomes more likely. Chris Kunstadter, global head of space at AXA XL, a major commercial insurance provider, adds that insurers have been active in terms of pushing for stricter regulation, as insurance is often a key component of regulatory proposals.</p>
<p>One group that is often overlooked, but that has the potential to strongly affect the future path toward the sustainable use of space, is comprised of the end users of space-based services. This encompasses anyone from telecommunications customers to users of imaging data to transportation companies relying on satellites to track their ships and planes. As OneWeb’s VP of Regulatory Affairs Ruth Pritchard-Kelly points out, if end users demand sustainability, as they have in other sectors (e.g., retail, mining, etc.), it would likely force launch providers and satellite operators to act.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a new stakeholder that is trying to solve the challenge of space debris. Startups such as <a href="https://astroscale.com/">Astroscale</a> and <a href="https://www.dorbit.space/">D-Orbit</a> are making progress toward commercializing the removal, or at least mitigation, of space debris. Another example is <a href="https://www.leolabs.space/">LeoLabs</a>, a ground-based space mapping provider, whose phased-array radars are capable of tracking debris as small as 2 cm. Dan Ceperley, founder and CEO of LeoLabs, believes his company’s advanced tracking capabilities will allow launch providers and satellite operators to be responsible for the objects they put into space. If mapping, mitigating and removing space debris turn out to be profitable endeavors, the private sector may already have the incentives it needs to clean up its act.</p>
<h2>Regulatory considerations</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding the promise of space debris mitigation technology, it is possible that regulators will be forced into action. Due to the intricacies of the space sector and the many stakeholders, regulatory bodies could provide stability and a guiding framework for companies around the world. However, the regulatory picture is uncertain given how decentralized space regulation tends to be.</p>
<p>While the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) exists to promote international cooperation in outer space, it is lacking in its ability to enforce regulations at the international level, being limited to providing secretarial support to the COPUOS (Committee for Peaceful Use of Outer Space). As a result, regulation in the industry has always been a tricky patchwork of country-level rules, with parties occasionally resorting to adopting “flags of convenience” in search of the nation offering the most favorable regulatory conditions.</p>
<p>In spite of this patchwork, the United States has emerged as the most powerful potential source of regulation given both its weight within the industry as well as its International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). ITAR is a U.S. regulatory regime controlling the manufacture, sale, distribution and use of defense and space-related articles that has made it costly and difficult — if not impossible — for U.S. players in the space industry to flag-shop or otherwise do business without adhering to U.S. regulations. As a result, any effective regulations governing space debris are likely to emerge from the U.S.</p>
<p>One of the many observations that has echoed through numerous interviews revolves around how U.S. regulations have not kept up with the rapid development of technology, with rules and guidelines dating back to a period when only NASA and the Soviet space program launched satellites into space, and when the idea of private entities possessing the ability to easily and inexpensively access space was “unthinkable,” in the words of Alessandro Rossi of the Italian National Research Council.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, launch costs have decreased by an order of magnitude; this, combined with the development of CubeSats and other miniature satellites, has dramatically lowered the cost of sending payloads to space. The private sector has responded by promising to send thousands of satellites into LEO over the next few years. It is unlikely that rules designed to regulate a handful of satellites the size of school buses will be adequate for this new reality.</p>
<p>Within the U.S., several agencies deal with the use of space, and the best source of future regulation remains a point of contention. A<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/space-policy-directive-3-national-space-traffic-management-policy/"> 2018 White House directive</a> sought to make the Commerce Department the “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/23/satellites-collisions-tracking-space/?hpid=hp_hp-more-top-stories_satellites-725am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans">traffic cop</a>” of space. Meanwhile,<a href="https://govmatters.tv/regulating-satellites-in-space/#:~:text=The%20White%20House%20has%20given,to%20the%20Federal%20Aviation%20Administration."> some believe</a> the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which already regulates launches and reentries, is in the best position to effect change. Another key player is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is responsible for regulating satellite transmissions.</p>
<p>According to Laura Montgomery, an expert in space law and the former head of the FAA’s space law branch, the FCC “certainly interprets its regulatory mandate as extending to space debris.”</p>
<p>The experts we spoke to generally seemed to believe that these agencies are unlikely to aggressively pursue new regulations in the near term. Professor Montgomery noted that regulators “tend to move slowly,” and that the collisions that have happened to date have “yet to lead to Congressional action” on this issue. Professor Zac Manchester of Carnegie Mellon University suggested regulatory agencies are “often understaffed and lacking the technical expertise” to address the problem of space debris anytime soon.</p>
<p>Others noted that while the<a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-363486A1.pdf"> FCC implemented new rules</a> to mitigate orbital space debris back in April, these rules did little to change the status quo — operators will now be required to submit more safety disclosures, but the body “<a href="https://spacenews.com/fcc-punts-controversial-space-debris-rules-for-extra-study/">stopped short of introducing stricter orbital debris criteria</a>.” To summarize, it appears that new overarching regulations are unlikely to be implemented anytime soon.</p>
<p>Where many see regulatory bodies as the ones holding the stick, there has been a push toward the creation of a carrot, an incentive for stakeholders to play an active role in addressing space debris. This is what the World Economic Forum (WEF), together with MIT’s Space Enabled Research Group at their Media Labs, European Space Agency, University of Texas at Austin, and Bryce Space and Technology, has been working on with the development of the Space Sustainability Rating (SSR).</p>
<p>WEF’s Nikolai Khlystov describes the SSR as a voluntary rating system for space (not dissimilar to what already exists for the energy class of home appliances or LEED for buildings) that aims at incentivizing good behavior. The hope is that the SSR, or a similar system, will be widely adopted by the industry. As an example, the WEF sees insurance companies making good use of the rating, as it could be used to determine premiums, offer discounts or even refuse insurance for underperformers.</p>
<h2>The case for action</h2>
<p>At this point, the space industry and its stakeholders have two options. They can either set up a framework that can address the problem of space debris, or continue on the current path, with little regulatory oversight and even less enforceability on a global level surrounding the sustainable use of space.</p>
<p>Looking at the history of space debris, we can safely assume that if nothing changes, the amount of debris will continue to grow, particularly within the more crowded LEO orbits. Without a comprehensive framework for end-of-life, it is only a matter of time before more collisions like the Kosmos-Iridium one will cause an order of magnitude increase in space debris, making it nearly impossible to clean up LEO.</p>
<p>There is a saying in aviation: “Regulations are written in blood.” The implication is that regulations are often founded on lessons learned from events that cost property or lives. One more major collision could force the hand of the international space community and lead to harsh regulations that could be negative for those within the private space industry that have not already adopted sustainability as a business imperative.</p>
<h2>The case for caution</h2>
<p>On the other hand, the space industry and regulatory bodies could come together to shape guiding transparent rules to deal with the challenges posed by space debris without hindering progress in the private space sector.</p>
<p>Any framework addressing the issue of space debris should be a cooperative, international effort. Regulatory bodies can leverage the fact that the sustainable use of space is in the interest of all market participants — after all, space debris is a costly problem, as well as a potential safety issue, for both operators and users. Today, many companies in the private space sector are in favor of greater accountability for this reason.</p>
<p>In addition, the case could be made that private companies would be more effective than governments at removing space debris from highly congested orbits. The technology of space debris removal is still in its early stages — Astroscale and other startups have not yet launched their services. However, they are<a href="https://astroscale.com/astroscale-takes-next-step-toward-launch-of-worlds-first-commercial-active-debris-removal-mission/"> beginning to make significant progress</a>, and it is hard to imagine a future where this industry will not be critical in cleaning up space debris.</p>
<h2>The path forward</h2>
<p>Ideally, we hope to see the private sector rise to the occasion. Surely market participants acknowledge the long-term importance of keeping space free of debris, and we believe this represents an attractive problem for startups to tackle. We would also welcome creative ideas, such as prizes for researchers who come up with the best solutions for removing space debris.</p>
<p>However, at some point, it is likely that the issue of space debris will need to be addressed with regulation. In particular, we would urge the regulators best-positioned to act — those in the United States — to tackle the issue, as they stand the best chance of crafting enforceable regulation.</p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles currently is that different agencies touch different parts of the satellite ecosystem (e.g., the Commerce Department, the FAA and the FCC) and responsibilities often overlap. We would encourage Congress to clarify this issue and empower a single agency to take the lead in setting rules to address the issue of space debris.</p>
<p>We would, however, caution against sweeping regulation that fails to consider the long-term consequences of such action. Professor Montgomery puts it best, “As a former writer of regulations, I know that they tend to get set in stone, and this has the potential to hamper innovation.”</p>
<p>This was the key issue with the debacle surrounding the Kicksat-2 project, says Professor Manchester. The project was meant to demonstrate the cutting-edge technology of microsatellites in a safe manner, but was delayed for years due to concerns from the FCC before being approved in 2019 with zero modifications to the original design. Montgomery adds that, “If regulators act too quickly, they run the risk of creating rules that are not ideal and that are almost impossible to fix.”</p>
<p>For this reason, we would encourage regulators to take their time to understand the issue and to work closely with other stakeholders to develop a set of guidelines over time, rather than rushing to a conclusion too soon.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we hope regulators and the commercial players can work together to find a lasting solution in the relatively near future, rather than waiting for a catastrophic failure before taking action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.boxcast.com/">BoxCast</a>, a Cleveland-based company aiming to make it easy to live stream any event, has raised $20 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Gordon Daily said that when the company first launched in 2013, &#8220;streaming wasn&#8217;t something that everyone understood,&#8221; and you needed professional help to live stream anything. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boxcast" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boxcast">BoxCast <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is supposed to make that process accessible to anyone.</p>
<p>The company has created several different video encoder devices, but Daily said the &#8220;small box&#8221; is just a one piece of BoxCast platform, which is designed to cover all your live-streaming needs, with support for 1080p broadcasting; streaming to Facebook Live, YouTube and your own website; analytics and more — plus there are add-ons like automatic scoreboard displays and event ticketing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pricing starts at $99 per month for the &#8220;essential&#8221; streaming plan, plus $399 for a BoxCast encoder. (You can also just stream from an iOS device.)</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s no surprise that 2020 has been a &#8220;watershed moment&#8221; for the company, as Daily put it, with BoxCast now live streaming millions of events per year — everything from sports to religious services to <a href="http://www.dailynews.lk/2020/11/24/finance/234279/sri-lanka-tourism’s-wildlife-streaming-event-“couch-safari’">virtual safaris offered by Sri Lanka&#8217;s tourism board</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2087627" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2087627" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2087627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?w=680" alt="BoxCast dashboard" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dashboard-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2087627" class="wp-caption-text">BoxCast dashboard</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;When you can&#8217;t even meet in-person &#8230; we knew that there was going to be higher usage,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What caught me off-guard was the volume increase — it’s new customers, it&#8217;s existing customers, at peak times there&#8217;s a 10x increase [from pre-pandemic usage].&#8221;</p>
<p>And while in-person events will hopefully become more common next year, Daily said live streams will still be a valuable tool to reach audiences who can&#8217;t attend, and to promote your business or organization with new kinds of programming.</p>
<p>COO Sam Brenner added that while BoxCast employed fewer than 40 people before the pandemic, the team has grown to 56, and will likely double within the next 12 months.</p>
<p>The Series A was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/updata-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="updata-partners">Updata Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from audio equipment manufacturer Shure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following recent reports, Periscope announced today that it will end operations as a standalone app by March 2021. The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-owned company referred to its current operations as &#8220;unsustainable&#8221; in an open letter <a href="https://periscope.medium.com/farewell-periscope-164db2742b7c">posted today</a>. It also cited a decline in usage in recent years as a driving factor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leaving it in its current state isn’t doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter,&#8221; the company noted.</p>
<p>Twitter, which acquired the livestreaming app back in 2015, has been building out its own video offerings in recent months, rendering much of Periscope&#8217;s features redundant as a standalone app. A line of code that popped up in the Twitter app last week appeared to point to periscope&#8217;s eventual closure. At the time, however, Twitter refused to comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Periscope was purchased in its infancy, as Twitter looked to address the rapid growth of competitor Meerkat. Of course, the live video landscape has evolved by leaps and bounds in recent years, and eventually it made the most sense to begin to incorporate such features directly into the native Twitter app. But even as livestreaming has grown, Periscope&#8217;s own fortunes as a standalone app have been diminishing for a number of years, as the company itself notes.</p>
<p>The company adds that all of this likely would have occurred even sooner, but the worst year ever got in way of those plans. &#8220;We probably would have made this decision sooner if it weren’t for all of the projects we reprioritized due to the events of 2020,&#8221; Twitter explains.</p>
<p>Sensor Tower notes that Periscope has had around 101 million installs over its life time, including the App Store and Google Play. It also tells TechCrunch, &#8220;Year-to-date, Periscope has seen approximately 6.8 million installs globally, down 7% year-over-year from about 7.3 million during the same period from January to December 14, 2019.&#8221;</p>
<p>Periscope will be removed from app stores in March, and the ability to create new accounts will be disabled with the next software update. Existing Broadcasts that were shared on Twitter will continue to exist on that app as replays. The company is also offering users the ability to download an archive of their content before it all goes away in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The past eight or so months have been profoundly difficult for musicians. With touring ground to a halt and streaming services offering fractions of cents, livelihoods have been utterly upended for countless artists. Since March, however, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bandcamp" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bandcamp">Bandcamp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been a rare beacon for many musicians.</p>
<p>On the first Friday of every month, the service has waved its fees, letting artists and labels reap the benefits in the process. Over the course of nine such Fridays, the service has generated some $40 million, as nearly 800,000 people have purchased music on those days. Artists have received, on average, 93% of the proceeds (transaction fees making up the remainder), versus 82% on normal days.</p>
<p>While the arrival of vaccines are a reason to be hopeful, it’s clear we’re not out of the woods yet. As such, the service announced today that Bandcamp Fridays will be extended at least through May of 2021. Those dates include, February 5, March 5, April 2, and May 7.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Other online services have been less proactive. In July, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told the media, “Some artists that used to do well in the past may not do well in this future landscape, where you can’t record music once every three to four years and think that’s going to be enough.”</p>
<p>In spite of criticism around music royalty payments, Spotify has spent hundreds of millions to bolster its library of exclusive podcasting content.</p>
