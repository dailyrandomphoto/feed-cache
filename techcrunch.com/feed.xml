										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year and a half has been a major eye opener for countless industries. As many white-collar employees have moved from offices to remote work, it has drawn into sharp focus just how ill-equipped many home setups are for hour after hour of Zoom calls.</p>
<p>Even as sales of PCs and tablets saw a major spike in 2020, consumer electronics companies weren’t particularly swift to react &#8212; not especially surprising, as the timeline to bring products to market is long, with many unannounced products still in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Arriving today, as a free update on compatible systems, macOS 12 Monterey (in part) introduces some key features introduced in an era of remote work &#8212; and life. And it’s likely not a coincidence that the new operating system arrives as Apple hardware, like the MacBook Pro and M1-powered iMac, is finally getting long-overdue upgrades to their camera and microphone setups.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223463" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For Apple, that means FaceTime. The company is in a bit of peculiar position on the teleconferencing front, in that &#8212; unlike, say Microsoft or Google &#8212; it doesn’t have a business teleconferencing platform. Last year, Apple added the ability to host up to 32 people on a call, which certainly opens things up, but as it stands, there’s no “FaceTime for Business.” This is a friends and family deal.</p>
<p>Apple’s video calling app gets some key upgrades this time around. The top of the list addition is SharePlay, which unfortunately has been delayed on desktop and is currently set for a release at some point later this fall. It’s also largely expected to arrive on the soon-to-drop iOS 15.1. The feature is effectively a built-in version of the watch-together features that rolled out last year for streaming services at the height of the pandemic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223465" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223465" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2223465" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="579" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg 2176w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=768,434 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=680,384 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=1536,868 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1158 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-12.56.27-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223465" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>The feature is custom made to support Apple’s own services TV+ and Apple Music, and will work with a handful of launch partners, including Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, the NBA app, Twitch, TikTok, MasterClass, Zillow, Paramount+ and ESPN+. It’s a healthy cross section of services, but there are some bigger names that are notably absent, including Netflix, Amazon and Spotify.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature effectively syncs up video and audio content, allowing users in the group to react to what they’re seeing/hearing in real time. Volume adjusts around speakers’ audio and playback is synced when a user plays/pauses/fast forwards/rewinds. Users will also be able to extend the feature onto a set with an Apple TV.</p>
<p>Also new is a share screen feature, similar to what you’ll find on a service like Zoom, letting you present windows to other viewers on the call. Spatial Audio comes to FaceTime, as well. I recently tried it out while testing the latest AirPods and dug the feature, which uses the position of a speaker’s window to place their audio in that approximate location. It’s a little gimmick for now, but it’s a neat one.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting additions this time out is the ability to join a FaceTime call outside of the Apple ecosystem. Functionality is still limited, but users can create a link, which others can join on Android or Windows devices, through the Chrome or Edge browser. Users don’t need an account to join the call, but someone needs to let them in after clicking the link.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223467" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223467" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2223467" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-9.13.15-AM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-9.13.15-AM.jpg 1559w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-9.13.15-AM.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-9.13.15-AM.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-9.13.15-AM.jpg?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-9.13.15-AM.jpg?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-9.13.15-AM.jpg?resize=1536,766 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-9.13.15-AM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223467" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Also new is Portrait Mode &#8212; which, again, works similarly to the blur background function we’ve seen on the leading teleconferencing services. Apple says the addition uses the Neural Engine found on the M1. Both this feature and Spatial Audio are only available on systems with the M1 chip, though the blurring of the line the new chips represent for developers seems to point to an acceleration in the adoption of iOS features on macOS. This is a nice change from the days of waiting a couple of updates to see mobile features hit the desktop.</p>

<p>Once again, Safari receives some of the biggest updates here, along with its rethink on mobile. The biggest aesthetic change is a fairly radical move away from the universal search bar.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223473" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png" alt="" width="840" height="350" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png 840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png?resize=768,320 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png?resize=680,283 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.34.16-AM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<p>The new “compact tab bar” moves tabs into small, discrete windows as a space saver. Given how much of a pain such a change can be, Apple is smartly leaving this something you can enable or disable in settings.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223472" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="259" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png?resize=300,76 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png?resize=768,194 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png?resize=680,172 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.31.30-AM.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Understanding that this is currently a browser tab world and we’re just living in it, Tab Groups lets users share them in bunches, so you can, say, have a “work” or “home” collection. Depending on how you work, that’s either a boon to creativity or another opportunity to cram a bunch of bookmarks away.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223474" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="458" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png 1844w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=768,343 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=680,304 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=1536,686 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.43.52-AM.png?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Highlighting and right clicking text on a page now lets you add a “Quick Note,” collating all of that information into a single place. It’s a nice addition for those who do a lot of online research.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223475" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="845" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png 2028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=768,634 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=680,561 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=1536,1268 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-11.48.01-AM.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Focus, which was announced as part of iOS 15, let’s you mediate distractions based on activities or times of day. You can, say, limit notifications when you’re meditating, reading, working, etc. These settings are automatically synced across Apple devices. Silenced notifications will also be noted in your messenger app, so people know when you don’t want to be disturbed.</p>
<p>AirPlay to Mac is a long-awaited new feature that, well, does what it says on the tin, effectively letting you cast music, movies and the like to a Mac using AirPlay 2. Makes sense, particularly if you’ve got an iMac and a perfectly good screen and speakers.</p>
<p>Universal Control &#8212; one of the more eagerly awaited additions here &#8212; is also coming later in the fall. The feature will further blur the line between iPadOS and Mac, letting users drag and drop items between the two for a more seamless AirDrop experience. The two devices can also be controlled by the same peripheral simultaneously, including a keyboard, trackpad or mouse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2223477" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="741" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png 1496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=300,217 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=768,555 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=680,492 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-25-at-1.02.52-PM.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The other big addition here is Shortcuts, the latest feature to be ported over from iOS. The app is effectively replacing long-time favorite Automator, which will be going away at some point in the future. As it stands, shortcut is simpler but may ultimately lack the sophistication of Automator, so Apple is cushioning the blow by letting users convert Automator sequences into Short Cuts. It will keep Automator around for a while, however, as it solicits feedback from users.</p>
<p>MacOS Monterey is available now for iMacs from 2015 and older, iMac Pro 2017 and later, MacBook Air/Pro early-2015 and later, Mac Pro 2013 and later, Mac mini 2014 and later and MacBook early-2016 and later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla&#8217;s market valuation hit the $1 trillion mark Monday, a milestone reached by the company 11 years after it became a publicly traded company. It also puts Tesla in select company with Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, all of which have market caps above $1 trillion.</p>
<p>Tesla shares hit $998.22 midday Monday. Shares are now trading at about $994, up about 9% from this morning&#8217;s open.</p>
<p>Shares pushed higher Monday on several news stories related to Tesla, including that rental giant Hertz, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, had agreed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/tesla-hertz-shares-rise-electric-vehicle-order/">buy 100,000 EVs</a> from the automaker. The deal, which will push the car rental giant’s EV offerings to 20% of its global fleet, is reportedly worth $4.2 billion. Tesla Model 3 vehicles will show up in the Hertz rental inventory as early as next month in major U.S. markets and select cities in Europe, according to the rental company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223471" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other news that provided bullish updates on Tesla also helped lift the share price, including a research note from Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas that the firm was raising its price target to $1,200 (from $900 previously) and reiterating its overweight rating.</p>
<p>Separately, a report from JATO Dynamics also determined that the Tesla Model 3 was the top-selling vehicle in Europe last month, making it the first time a full-electric car has outsold combustion engine models, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-model-3-becomes-first-ev-top-european-monthly-sales-2021-10-25/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy has called on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-charges-forward-with-a-third-quarter-profit-of-1-6-billion/">Tesla</a> to change the design of its advanced driver assistance system to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to the company&#8217;s CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p>The letter, which TechCrunch has viewed, expressed concern that Tesla has yet to implement two safety recommendations that the NTSB issued more than four years ago. The urgency to address those safety recommendations has increased now that Tesla is rolling out more automated driving functions through its so-called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/24/elon-musk-rolls-back-newest-full-self-driving-beta-due-to-software-issues/">&#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221;</a> software beta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our crash investigations involving your company&#8217;s vehicles have clearly shown that the potential for misuse requires a system design change to ensure safety,&#8221; Homendy wrote. Tesla has not responded to request for comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223416" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The NTSB can only make recommendations and does not have the authority to enforce existing laws or make policy.</p>
<p>While Homendy did thank Tesla for cooperating with NTSB investigators following various crashes and incidents that the agency has examined, she spent the bulk of the letter addressing her deep concerns on Tesla&#8217;s inaction to &#8220;implement critical NTSB safety recommendations.&#8221;</p>
<p>One excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>You have stated that &#8220;safety is always the primary design requirement for a Tesla.&#8221; Now that statement is undercut by the announcement that Tesla drivers can request access to &#8220;Full Self-Driving Beta technology,&#8221; operational on both highways and city streets, without first addressing the very design shortcomings that allowed the fatal Williston, Delray Beach, and Mountain View crashes to occur.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you are serious about putting safety front and center in Tesla vehicle design, I invite you to complete action on the safety recommendations we issued to you four years ago.</p>
<p>The NTSB has long advocated for implementation of myriad technologies to prevent tragedies and injuries and save lives on our nation&#8217;s roads, but it&#8217;s crucial that such technology is implemented with the safety of all road users foremost in mind. I look forward to receiving an update on our safety recommendations.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2017, NTSB issued two safety recommendations to the automaker based on its investigation of a fatal crash, in which Joshua Brown was killed when his Tesla Model S sedan struck a tractor-trailer that crossed his path. Tesla&#8217;s advanced driver assistance system, known as Autopilot, was engaged at the time. The agency found that Brown was using Autopilot on roadways that the system was not designed to handle and that he went extended periods of time without having his hands on the wheel. Autopilot is not a hands-free system.</p>
<p>NTSB determined that Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot system did not effectively monitor and respond to the driver&#8217;s interaction with the steering wheel to ensure driver engagement. The agency recommended Tesla establish safeguards that would limit Autopilot to conditions for which they were designed and to develop ways to more &#8220;effectively sense the driver&#8217;s level of engagement and alert the driver when engagement is lacking while automated vehicle control systems are in use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla has argued that operational design domain limits are not applicable for so-called Level 2 driver assist systems, such as Autopilot, because the driver determines the acceptable operating environment. Homendy pushed back on that argument in her email to Musk, noting that the agency&#8217;s crash investigations have &#8220;clearly shown that the potential for misuse requires a system design change to ensure safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>Homendy also noted that it sent five other automakers that have vehicles with Level 2 driving automation systems a recommendation to apply ways to engage and alert the driver. Those five manufacturers responded to NTSB and described the action they planned to take or were taking to better monitor a driver&#8217;s level of engagement, according to Homendy&#8217;s letter to Musk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tesla is the only manufacturer that did not officially respond to us about the recommendation,&#8221; she wrote.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the beginning of the pandemic, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RianPhin/videos"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rian Phin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, recently furloughed from her stressful job and struggling to create content, was living in a poorly lit townhome in Brooklyn with five roommates. When she moved into her own artist loft, replete with aesthetically pleasing high ceilings and big windows, natural sunlight filling the white room, she could finally create lifestyle content aestheticizing her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phin, who was a Tumblr-famous fashion blogger in her youth and presently boasts over 70,000 followers on YouTube, identifies as an aesthete. Aesthetic vlogging for her and others is a demonstrated savvy for infoglut &#8212; the ability to rapidly process a huge volume of information into an “aesthetic.” Some of the most popular aesthetic vlog titles follow the lifestyle formula: “Get Ready With Me,” “What I Eat in a Day,” </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pinterest+room+tour"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Room Tour,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Morning Routine,” and “My Quarantine Morning Routine.” At the core of these vlogs, whether categorized as </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXEr4t_QBZBk3qlIlc2HRg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">van life</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nkvi0UX8Os"><span style="font-weight: 400;">booktube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFezyvkeuFw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, wellness or fashion, is an aestheticization that rejects the more explicitly mediated, aspirational presence cultivated by mainstream influencers, even while their strategies and aims are similar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Phin’s personal style, Ssense-bought silhouettes and a lot of black, deviates greatly from her fellow aesthetic vloggers. Over email, she told me her sensibility still overlaps with other players in the space, but that she’s just made a conscious effort to avoid anything cute or girly because it’s inherently “marketable” and “saleable”: “Then, brands start developing products and digital and other ad campaigns around video styles.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222941" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we all occasionally note the way information and images are presented, most people tend to prioritize function over aesthetic value. But not aesthetic vloggers. Viewing and evaluating the internet as chiefly an aesthetic object &#8212; how aesthetically pleasing, beautiful or cute something is displayed/presented &#8212; is what unifies them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days of endless customizability (Myspace, Tumblr, Neopets, Live Journal), so aesthetes are tasked with creatively filling the content void left by mid-to-late aughts fashion bloggers (</span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93yawp/flookbooknu-to-home-renovation-the-evolution-of-the-millennial-influencer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lookbook.nu, The Sartorialist, Style Bubble, etc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) and 2010s beauty gurus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limitless content accelerated by the shorter trend cycles caused by fast fashion and the digital shopping experience no longer demand that fashion bloggers serendipitously document their outfits of the day in front of walls in public places or beauty vloggers exclusively discuss makeup. Aesthetic vlogging, a mutant form, combines all of these while overlapping with other fashion-focused corners of the internet, from subcultures like </span><a href="https://stayhipp.com/glossary/high-fashion-twitter-hft/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Fashion Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to seller platforms like Etsy and </span><a href="https://www.nylon.com/fashion/depop-captions-are-becoming-the-new-blogs-to-read"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea is to collage together new aesthetics from what’s out there, yet there is a unified underlying aesthetic: colorful thumbnail fonts that often mimic the exacting fine line script produced by mechanical pencils or chunky, finger-drawn cursive scribble; high-spirited color stories; and pretty garments and interiors. </span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpIQF07HOSI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=7&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among many aesthetic vloggers, there’s also an implied belief in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=camille+rowe+french+girl+"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the myth of French Girl coolness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/aug/02/athleisure-barre-kale-tyranny-ideal-woman-labour"><span style="font-weight: 400;">girlboss self-optimization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (see: the </span><a href="https://www.bustle.com/life/what-does-that-girl-mean-tiktok-viral-trend"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That Girl” trend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://youtu.be/9ZeF7njSQ3s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notion app tutorials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet it is dissatisfied with the hustle (the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=i+don%2527t+dream+of+labor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I Don’t Dream of Labor” trend)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> despite all manners of self-care being indistinguishable from productivity and work: the day-to-day labor of feminine preening and aspirational-yet-relatable “influencing” that captures daily tasks like eating, running errands, socializing, applying makeup and exercising on camera. What sets aesthetic vloggers apart from other kinds of influencers, the more explicit hustlers, is their sense of ease and a disavowal of labor that is in fact a form of labor, as it yields the same outcome: income.</span></p>
<p>Separated by age, geography and cultural milieu, the most visible aesthetic vloggers, Elena Taber, Jenny Welbourn and Orion Carloto, among others, present themselves as an aggregate of their commodities and interests, marrying sprezzatura (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprezzatura" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprezzatura&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635200115643000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFyJK5rhj2GkSjstNN6WnPzghXFOQ">“studied carelessness”</a>) with cuteness. The personality and history of their objects &#8212; whether thrifted, designer, upcycled or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0dLspavXXM" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dh0dLspavXXM&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1635200115643000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNpxYGSo2uk-R1Oj7orKMTCkKTYg">Coach-gifted</a> (like whimsical knickknacks or Detroit Floyd beds) &#8212; and interests like yoga, reading and film photography, amount to simulacrum.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sprezzatura communicates: “Oh, this intentional design and curation that looks like it requires the effort of a 15th century courtier, Alexa Chung and a cutting-edge design firm? I don’t know how any of that got here, haha.” Evidence of effort is failure, and the point is to appear like you didn’t try. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is achieved through the minimalist white walls contrasted against the dark wood trims of their dwellings; exposed brick; textures; a downtown-cool vibe; laminated glass tables; lacquered wood floors; </span><a href="https://twitter.com/fasshionlover/status/1441881702104719364?s=21"><span style="font-weight: 400;">books splayed and stacked across pine wood floors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; elements of 1960s-1980s Parisian and Italian modernist design; mid century-modern furniture and knick knacks; asymmetry; high ceilings; the organized nonchalance of Instagram “photo dumps”; layering; the hand drawn or handmade; film preservation; art collecting; record collecting; woven throw pillows; curated clutter; unfiltered, low-res selfies; the spectrum of browns and beiges; natural lighting; an appreciation for things found in nature like plants and flowers; </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22570006/cool-consumer-identity-gen-z-cheugy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hyperreal individualism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; trend-omnivorousness; and countersignaling with vintage clothes. </span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwhBTrzzqeg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cuteness is exemplified by personality-driven and fussily girly flourishes, intimate moments and commodities, as well as a marked lack of reticence when it comes to color—pinks, viridescent hues, yellows—never bordering on camp or kitsch, but flirting with maximalism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cute aesthetic objects like B21 Koya plush dolls and mushroom lamps juxtaposed next to the eclecticism and novelty of a bohemian design. It’s the documentation of their lives among their casually beautiful commodities, collaging and curating aesthetics; the “make Instagram casual again” movement; and the final, adult form of disparate styles of the alterna-girl aesthetics. (Aesthetic vloggers with a more educational than lifestyle bent to their channels have </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=types+of+aesthetics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obsessively limned and doggedly cataloged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every existing alterna-girl aesthetic.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most popular aesthetic vloggers, Madelynn De La Rosa, 29, who is known for her sublime video content, grew up in Europe. A childhood moving to a new military base every three years expanded De La Rosa’s perspective on beauty. She developed a geographically and culturally adaptable interest in all things makeup, film, fashion and art. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her YouTube channel often showcases her deeply aestheticized, hyper-stylized vlogs that artfully romanticize her life. They feature her sumptuously decorated Spanish-style apartment, beach outings with friends and well-spoken articulations of topics ranging from sustainable fashion to veganism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For De La Rosa, recording videos of herself might have begun as a way to document and aestheticize the mundanity &#8212; and the thrills &#8212; of womanhood, but an artful documentation materialized. </span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ES6qmNWmif8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">De La Rosa was delighted when, after amassing her first 100K followers, the Michelle Phan-owned company Ipsy gave her a three-year contract to do beauty content and moved her out to Los Angeles, where she has resided for the last six years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But last year, while under lockdown, De La Rosa struggled to produce beautiful content like Phin had. Was it frivolous &#8212; “now more than ever!” &#8212; to focus on what’s beautiful in her life? She believes that this unprecedented time was an opportunity for growth, a way of vlogging that emphasizes self-care, promoting a lifestyle that’s as health-conscious and socially distanced as it is beautiful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you make your life look like this?” De La Rosa told me over the phone, playfully mimicking the people who praise her for her idyllic content: “I’ve lived here my whole life and I’ve never seen L.A. like this!”</span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AMBdP85JY5U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=547&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, aesthetic vlogging migrated to TikTok and Instagram, gaining in popularity at the start of the global pandemic, especially the “main character energy” videos emphasizing romanticization of everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aesthetic vlogging content &#8212; mostly propagated by Gen Z kids &#8212; is a departure from the less-curated lifestyle vlogging that propelled Emma Chamberlain to the top. “Emma Chamberlain is almost the definition of, like,‘that girl” &#8212; but it’s as if it was something given to her that she didn’t even want,” </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/tiffanyferg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiffany Ferg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an expert on media and YouTube, tells me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And most of the aesthetics innovated by Gen Z also use lingo they’ve created and popularized: Cringe-y/“cringe” replaced </span><a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/182/cringe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cringeworthy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Aesthetic,” once a misnomer, now denotes beautiful, aesthetically pleasing, cute. If something is “aesthetic,” it’s not ugly, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">intentionally so</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And “</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/style/cheugy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheugy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” coined by Gaby Rasson, became interchangeable with the word “try-hard.” All of these terms correspond with aesthetics, as well as describe attitudes and people the same way that, say, the “starter pack” meme attached general descriptors to aesthetics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The usage of this new slang is confusing at first, but eventually, one adapts to the youths’ consensus reality driving the culture. One learns to reconfigure their subjectivity in favor of the thoughts, feelings, preoccupations, anxieties and tastes of Gen Z and Z-llenials, obliterating the long-opined generational divide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, millennials who observe the prevailing market trends dictated by people born in the mid-90s to early 2000s can reasonably pass, culturally speaking, for much younger. This has resulted in a mimesis predicated on young people influencing millennials &#8212; thus collapsing demographics &#8212; and an over-prioritization of femininity under late capitalism. </span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4IqNDlZmXs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The fixation on the cultural production of youth, in a culture that historically prizes youth, has exacerbated for women the already-fraught nature of femininity and beauty that exists along a continuum inextricable from youth. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cute-sprezzatura, while fundamentally feel-good, disrupts that a bit, privileging an affectedness that’s not usually associated with the feminine. This ultimately abates the inexorable modern crisis of fatigue and cringe brought upon by encountering &#8212; after scrolling to the bottom of our social media feed &#8212; an uncool or distasteful past version of ourselves by removing the appearance of effort, thus the sense of having failed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mass-produced design associated with the </span><a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/will-the-millennial-aesthetic-ever-end.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millennial aesthetic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like blush pink art prints and terrazzo, and the gaucheness of over-refinement, luxury and conspicuous consumption inevitably produces the opposite effect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the core, however, it’s still about easy consumption, especially when “cuteness” is interpolated. Rian Phin’s inclination to roughen up the cuteness to make her aesthetics less assimilable to marketers feels correct. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But cuteness is a lot more complex than meets the eye. According to theorist Sianne Ngai, who, in her book </span><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/our-aesthetic-categories-zany-cute-interesting/9780674088122"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Aesthetic Categories: Cute, Zany and Interesting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, asserts that cuteness &#8212; a highly consumable, copyable, uniquely feminine aesthetic category &#8212; “aestheticizes” and “eroticizes” powerlessness. The reason we find old people so cute &#8212; for their presumed frailty &#8212; is the same reason we foist cuteness upon girls and women, and girls and women package themselves as so, consciously and unconsciously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The titular character of Amelie played by Audrey Tautou, Hello Giggles’ creator Zoe Deschanel and Sanrio’s Hello Kitty, to name a few, have exceedingly accessible “cute” presentations. Anyone can be cute like them, really. Unlike with beauty, there’s no barrier to access, which is appealing to content creators trying to eke out space in an over-saturated creator economy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canonical cute-girl figures like the aforementioned fictional and real women coexist, with some friction, alongside “it girls” and influencers native to the internet now. One such purveyor of cuteness is the ribald, quirked-up YouTuber </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnQhwPVwcP-DnbUZtIMrupw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@Bestdressed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a.k.a. Ashley. Her channel is far from anodyne viewing, as it evokes rage from Gen Z scolds who don’t understand how an immigrant girl whose introduction to sustainable fashion was her frugal mother could take an </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/fans-upset-over-youtuber-bestdressed-amazon-prime-wardrobe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon brand deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market demands of an information-dense culture &#8212; and the reality that Gen Z is the savviest generation of consumers &#8212; has created an expectation of a sort of individuation that appears thoughtful and </span><a href="https://youtu.be/yRnnAAUJB3o?t=353"><span style="font-weight: 400;">well-rounded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s not enough for young would-be influencers to influence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also have to prove they’re “interesting,” which is another aesthetic category &#8212; “the aesthetic of information” &#8212; Ngai highlights in Our Aesthetic Categories, stating that a “tension between individual and system undergirds the interesting.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavi_Gevinson"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tavi Gevinson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a possible model for these young women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The verbally gifted, culturally astute Gevinson hit the scene first as a fashion blogger, and then as the Editor-in-Chief of Rookie Magazine, and obviously influenced equally smart, precocious stars like Yara Shahidi, Amandla Stenberg, Zendaya, Willow Smith, et al. (Smith and Stenberg are both members of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/arthoecollective/?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Art Hoe Collective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a collective of young artist femmes with strong visual identities who met on Tumblr and wanted to create a space for themselves similar to Rookie, but less centralized.) This coincided with an increase in awareness of social issues, as many young girls and women began developing leftist politics not typically found in mainstream media representation. Tavi represented the emergence of a new kind of “it girl” who is distinguished ultimately for the same reasons “it girls” have always been distinguished (her appearance, considered as a package) but also for tucking all sorts of information in with the package.</span></p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/86S8hWurquM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who aren’t naturally endowed with interestingness seem entitled to it. This has created an</span> <a href="https://electricliterature.com/how-ingrid-goes-west-deflates-joan-didion-the-original-millennial-white-girl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingrid Goes West</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-like standard for poseurs, across varying spheres of influence, for what I’ve started to call tastefishing: encrypting one’s philistine self with an added layer of imitation, heightening the gravity of mimesis already at play. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1xLBDnklmw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long-sleeved shirt under a short-sleeved shirt for one’s personality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case in point: Kendall Jenner recently adapted the persona of a tastemaker, someone in possession of “</span><a href="https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v8-12-230/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high consecration” or “high status” tastes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Posing alongside trendy experimental fiction and poetry books selected by her agent Ashleah Gonzales, Jenner </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPpTteb9gQU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">traffics in male attention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, gratuitously decorates her home with artifacts she’s brought back from Art Basel, and plays old songs on Zaza World, her very own Apple Radio show. What a difference from five years ago, in her Vogue 73 Questions, when the model cited </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsFPbgK1v9I"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marley and Me and The Notebook as films she likes and Tupac as her “spirit animal.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But can we blame her, when it’s no longer enough to be pretty and rich? Now, there&#8217;s pressure to be interesting, too, if she wants to keep up with booktubers, aesthetic vloggers, Tavi Gevinson, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/style/kaia-gerber-book-club-kendall-jenner-emily-ratajkowski-belletrist.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaia Gerber, Emily Ratajkowski, Emma Roberts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and countless other stylish, loquacious, bookish young women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The necessity of an interesting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">performance of sel</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f, of demonstrating one’s ability to stylishly cut through an infinite and rambling internet freighted with big ideas is a remarkable thing. It turns this abundance of information into something generative rather than overwhelming. And yet its small details &#8212; organized pixels, hex codes, fonts, still and moving images, etc. &#8212;  inform our perception of the aesthetic beauty it contains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stickiness of sight and sound, of memory, the accumulation of ephemeral sensory hunches and impressions, make it a generative experience for aesthetes, especially girls and women for whom there’s a higher expectation to perform their identities in an increasingly image-based culture via performance-based platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The lifestyle influencer is aspirational because of their ability to monetize it. Fans look up to them not only because they want to live the same way but because they want to monetize their own lives.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The aspirational bent to aesthetic vlogging is not only about desiring to live insouciantly among beautiful things; it’s also wanting that ability to cut through all the static, to make something beautiful yet saleable out of the glut. And who better equipped to alter and curate perceptions and experiences of aesthetics online than women and girls? Women and girls, after all, have the imagination to watch others watch us, the uncanny ability to gaze upon ourselves like we’re situated in another body and experience. Our gaze surveils better than the most advanced technology &#8212; or the male gaze.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The orbital real estate rush is just getting started as Sierra Space released more details on its plans to launch a private space station, with news that Blue Origin and Boeing would be joining the team to send the spacecraft to orbit in the second half of the decade.</p>
<p>The planned station, called “Orbital Reef,” will also include tech and services from Redwire Space, Genesis Engineering and Arizona State University. It’s the third announced commercial space station to date, coming just days after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">Voyager Space, Nanoracks and Lockheed Martin</a> laid out their own plans for a commercial space station, which the group says will launch in 2027. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/axiom-space-raises-130-million-for-its-commercial-space-station-ambitions/">Axiom Space</a> is also planning a commercial station.</p>
<p>Sierra Space originally announced its plans in April of this year, part of a growing chorus of private companies looking to replace the soon-to-be-retired International Space Station. The company, a division of Sierra Nevada Corporation, has been developing a large inflatable LIFE (Large Integrated Flexible Environment) habitat, which will be used for Orbital Reef.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223400" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Orbital Reef will operate as an “off-world mixed use business park,” Blue Origin’s senior VP of advanced development program, Brent Sherwood said during a media event Monday. The space station could be used for many commercial purposes, including scientific research, manufacturing, media, entertainment, and tourism, he mused.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223425" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223425" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Outside-Windows.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Outside-Windows.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Outside-Windows.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Outside-Windows.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Outside-Windows.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Outside-Windows.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Outside-Windows.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Orbital-Reef-Outside-Windows.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223425" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://blueorigin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orbital Reef <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Blue Origin will be providing core modules, utility systems, and crucially, the company’s heavy-lift New Glenn launch system. Boeing will conduct station operations, the science module and provide its Starliner crew spacecraft to ferry humans to and from the station. Redwire will provide microgravity research tech and in-space manufacturing, as well as payload operations and deployable structures.</p>
<p>Maryland-based Genesis Engineering is developing a single-person spacecraft for routine operations and tourism purposes, while Arizona State University will lead a consortium to offer research advisory services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The microgravity environment provides a whole new arena for scientific and commercial discovery,” Redwire’s executive VP for civil space and external affairs Mike Gold said. “We truly believe that the countries and companies that master microgravity research, development and manufacturing will be the global economic leaders of the future.”</p>
<p><em>Developing…</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You only get so many Hail Mary passes in consumer electronics. Even among the biggest companies. Take a look a Microsoft’s long-standing mobile phone ambitions. Even a $7.2 billion acquisition of the once-dominant Nokia couldn’t buy the company a place at the table with Apple and Samsung.</p>
<p>Some earlier false starts aside, Google’s mobile hardware ambitions have been &#8212; on the whole &#8212; more successful. But the Pixel line has never had the major hit the company needs to justify the resources spent on the category. The devices have largely felt like, at best, a showcase for some of the cool stuff Google is working on in mobile software and ML and, at worst, a kind of also-ran.</p>
<p>It’s frankly been strange to see the company struggle to make waves, though entering a field as crowded as smartphones was never going to be easy. And it’s doubly difficult to make a dent when, on the whole, flagship smartphones are all pretty good and continued dominance in the space is largely the result of forward momentum. Adding to Google’s troubles is a long-standing insistence that the true breakthroughs are all happening on the software side.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222347" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s an interesting thesis, to be sure, that Apple, Samsung and the like are essentially wasting their time waging a war of specs. There’s something to the idea, but in its current state, at least, it’s simply not possible to be hardware agnostic. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are, undoubtedly, growing in importance, but camera lenses, displays and processors all still matter. At least for now.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2219391" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0416.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Last May, it was revealed that key members of the Pixel team had left the company. It was part of a big rethink, one reaching back even further. This August, CEO Sundar Pichai noted that the company has been working on its own in-house silicon for four years. As far as Hail Mary passes go, weaning yourself off chipmakers like Qualcomm is a big one. And it needs a big phone to go with it.</p>
<p>Released this time last year, the Pixel 5 was the last vestige of the old way. Big changes don’t happen overnight &#8212; or even in a year when it comes to major electronics product lines. Unfortunately for Google, news of its minor restructuring got out ahead of the phone’s release, and even the company had to acknowledge that better days were ahead. The Pixel 6 isn’t make or break for the line, but after generations of uninspiring sales, it needs to prove that things are heading in the right direction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And by those standards, the phone is a rousing success.</p>

<p>It stands in opposition to Google’s spec agnosticism as a testament that great software still requires great hardware. The Pixel 6 isn’t a cutting-edge, overclocked spec machine, by any stretch, but it stands as an example of what Google’s ever-impressive software can do when given the proper hardware.</p>
<p>From the moment you grab the Pixel 6 Pro, it’s clear there’s something different here. The handset feels more like something produced by Samsung than of its Pixel predecessors. It’s got a size and a heft reminiscent of the Galaxy line, an aesthetic quality only enhanced by the curved glass edges.</p>
<p>One of the things that honestly surprised me most the day of the announcement was how polarizing curved glass is in the online community. Here, its usage is primarily aesthetic, rather than attempting to jam in any kind of edge functionality, à la Samsung. The biggest argument I’ve heard against it is the risk of accidentally triggering the touchscreen when picking up the phone by the sides. It’s not a problem I’ve encountered, and honestly, I’m fairly curved screen-agnostic on the whole.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219381" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219381" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2219381" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0456.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219381" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The 6 Pro display is 6.7 inches, a QHD+ (3120 x 1440) OLED at 512 ppi. It’s nice, big and bright, with a max refresh rate of 120 Hz. The standard 6 sports a 6.4-inch display at 411 ppi and 90 Hz. You can’t really go wrong either way, but the Pro is a nice upgrade on that front. The front-facing camera is a pinhole design, obscured by the default wallpaper.</p>
<p>There’s also an in-screen fingerprint reader at the bottom, which unlocks the phone quickly. The display is covered with Gorilla Glass Victus, with Gorilla Glass 6 on the rear. The upper-third of the back is monopolized by a large, distinct camera bar. I like it from a design standpoint &#8212; it’s a nice change from the standard square the competition has all gravitated toward.</p>
<p>It’s a significant bump, which means the phone sits at an angle while on its back. The addition of the standard case largely negates this effect, however. The one other concern with the camera placement is that you may have to be a bit more mindful of where you place your hands while shooting in landscape mode. Again, I didn’t run into any issues on that front, and if you do, it’s easily corrected.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2222899,2222903,2222904,2222894,2222895,2222893,2222896,2222897,2222898,2222900,2222902,2222905"]</p>
<p>There’s a slight color difference in the glass above and below the camera bar. It’s really just a fun little flourish &#8212; something the company did with the power buttons on older Pixel units. It’s clear Google is still working to develop to distinguish itself from the lookalike competition. Thankfully, it’s just a subtle touch. The whole of the design language tastefully rides the line between boring and outlandish.</p>
<p>The camera system is probably the ultimate example of how good software and hardware play off each other. I was testing the Pixel 6 Pro at the same time as the Surface Duo, and particularly in mixed or low light, it really was night and day (so to speak), in spite of the Microsoft device having a solid camera rig.</p>
<p>Turns out developing your own camera system for several generations pays dividends. I really liked the shots I was able to capture on this thing. The 4x optical zoom on the Pro is a nice touch, as well. It can go up to 20x digital, but even with Google’s computational photography, you start to introduce noise into the image quickly.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard suite of Pixel camera features comes some cool new tricks. Magic Eraser is similar in principle to Photoshop’s Content Aware Fill tool. Rub your finger on top of an unwelcome background image and it will use the surrounding settings to fill up the spot, effectively “erasing” the object. It’s far from perfect. A close look will generally spot the inconsistencies, and the more complex the surroundings, the worse job it does, generally. Even so, it does an impressive job for a new feature built into the app.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222889" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1101" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png 1786w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=140,150 140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=279,300 279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=768,826 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=633,680 633w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=1429,1536 1429w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot_20211023-132252-1.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Ditto for Action Pan. This works similarly to Portrait mode, adding a faux blur effect to the background of an object. It works well with larger, more geometrically simple objects like a car. Something like a person riding by on a bike, on the other hand, gives it more trouble around the edges &#8212; much like Portrait. Long Exposure is effectively the opposite, blurring the moving objects, while keeping the background stationary.</p>
<p>Not gonna lie, my hermetic pandemic lifestyle hasn’t afforded me the opportunity to shoot many humans. Top of the list there are Face Unblur, which cleverly uses two cameras and face detection to create a composite sharper image on a moving object. We’re going to be digging into the real tone feature a bit deeper soon, but it’s a much welcome effort to better capture a wide range of skin tones. This, again, relies on facial detection, which can occasional be an issue.</p>
<p>Also impressive are the slate of text tools arriving on the Pixel. Live translate worked will in my limited testing, and is an impressive addition to texting. Assistant voice typing works well, though it ran into occasional issues (perhaps my annunciation), including the addition of emojis via voice. All welcome addition to existing features like Recorder, which has since added German and Japanese to the mix.</p>

<p>The real star of the show is Tensor, of course. Google has joined an increasing number of companies that have eschewed Qualcomm&#8217;s silicon dominance, in favor of their own chips. This one was four years in the making, and probably as good a sign as any that the company is committed to the Pixel line for the foreseeable future. This time out, the company credits the first-party SoC with powering a number of the new features core to the Pixel 6 experience. It notes in a recent blog post,</p>
<blockquote><p>With Google Tensor, we’re unlocking amazing new experiences that require state of the art ML — including Motion Mode, Face Unblur, Speech enhancement mode for videos and applying HDRnet to videos (more on these later). Google Tensor allows us to push the limits of helpfulness in a smartphone, taking it from a one-size-fits-all piece of hardware into a device that’s intelligent enough to respect and accommodate the different ways we use our phones.</p></blockquote>
<p>In our Geekbench tests, the system scored a 1031 on single-core and 2876 on multi-core. That&#8217;s a dramatic improvement over the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">574 and </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">1522 average we saw for the Pixel 5 &#8212; but keep in mind, that system sported a middling Snapdragon 765G process. Not exactly flagship material there. Compare that to the 1093 and 3715</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> you get with the Snapdragon 888-powered Samsung Galaxy S21, and it&#8217;s clear that Google&#8217;s in-house chip has a ways to go, in terms of sheer processing firepower. Things get even worse placed against the 1728 and 4604 we got in our iPhone 13 Pro testing. </span></p>

<p>Battery was one of the biggest sticking points with earlier models, but Google has addressed that here, big time. The 6 and 6 Pro feature 4,614 and 5,003mAh batteries, respectively — representing a solid upgrade from Pixel 5’s 4,080mA. That, in turn, was a nice jump from the Pixel 4. Google says you should be able to get through 24 hours on a charge &#8212; I found I was at around 26 hours with moderate use, so good news on that front.</p>
<p>After several years of middling Pixel hardware and sales, Google really needed a device to point the way forward for a floundering mobile division. Four years of processor development, six generations of software and some shiny new hardware all come together nicely in one package. Google has long insisted that the Pixel line is more than just an opportunity to highlight new Android software, and for once, that really rings true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been half-a-decade since the original AirPods changed the game for Bluetooth earbuds. Mocked at launch by some for their long-stemmed design, it didn’t take long before they became virtually ubiquitous, the driving force in what was still an emerging category. They offered a form factor, design and user experience that tied the technology into a package that makes sense.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot can change in five years &#8212; especially in this industry. And frankly, I’m not sure I’ve seen a category come of age and capture the public imagination as quickly as Bluetooth earbuds. Every major hardware maker has at least one good or great pair of buds, and some, like Nothing, have popped up in their wake with the express mission of disrupting the status quo.</p>
<p>Apple’s line has been through its share of changes, too, of course. In 2019, a second-generation product added the H1 chip for hands-free “Hey Siri” and improved wireless functionality, a better battery and an optional wireless charging case. That same year, the company added a premium tier to the line, in the form of the AirPods Pro. The model adds active noise cancellation (plus a transparency mode), a standard wireless charging case and silicone tips &#8212; a long-standing request from Apple headphone devotees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222606" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222871" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0531.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>At the time of writing this, there are currently three AirPods buds models, plus the over-ear Max. Effectively every single model the company has sold since 2019 is currently availably for purchase on its site. Only the first-gen version has been discontinued. The newly introduced third-generation model best their predecessors with a new design, the addition of spatial audio, sweat and water resistance and an included MagSafe charging case (all shared features with the Pros).</p>
<p>They also get an added hour of battery life on the buds and six additional hours with the case, bringing the totals up to six and 30 hours of life, respectively. At $179, they’re in between the Pros ($249) and second-gen ($129), though a fair bit closer to the latter. With the Pros getting a little long in the tooth themselves, it’s not surprising that an updated standard AirPods have further blurred the lines between the two SKUs. Heck, the shorter stems and longer charger bring the design language far more in line with the Pros.</p>
<p>For the time being, the primary differentiators are: silicone ear tips, active noise canceling and, of course, pricing. The Pros are still priced at a premium and are, without question, the company’s best earbuds, along with being one of the best premium earbuds, period. But the last year or two have seen features like active noise canceling become increasingly ubiquitous among various price points.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222876" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0547.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The AirPods 3 exist in a sort of limbo, as a notable step up from their predecessors in terms of features and sound quality and a step down from the Pros that were introduced the same year. Price point, I think, is the most compelling case here. Seventy dollars is not an insignificant premium to move from the AirPods to the Pros. But as someone who has regularly used the Pros for the past couple of years, switching to the AirPods for day to day use has been a noticeable step down.</p>
<p>The more contoured third-generation buds are unquestionably more comfortable than their predecessors, but the gulf between them and the Pros feels like night and day. That’s likely to be even more the case for people with smaller ears &#8212; having different-sized, removable tips is a lifesaver for some. The seal those tips provide also create passive noise canceling through a physical seal that effectively keeps in more audio frequencies and blocks out ambient noise.</p>
<p>As a long-time proponent of the silicone tip, I was surprised to hear that there are still people out there who prefer molded plastic. But I’ve since been able to confirm that at least one TechCrunch staffer fits the description, preferring to insert anything into their ear. Fair enough, I guess &#8212; and certainly I won’t begrudge a company for offering options, even if one seemingly makes the other feel outmoded.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222874" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0544.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As a resident of New York City’s biggest borough, much of my life is spent immersed in street noise &#8212; and for that matter, a constant barrage of construction from the comfort of my home. The Pros’ active and passive noise cancelation make a world of difference when a street sweeper or above-ground subway train pass me on the street, not to mention a parade of emergency vehicle sirens. There were times when the podcast I was listening to was drowned out in the cacophony of city life. Though, again, there are reasons to appreciate this from a situational awareness standpoint.</p>
<p>Wireless charging is a welcome update here. You can top off the case with a MagSafe or standard Qi charger. The former has the advantage of snapping together manually. Spatial audio, meanwhile, is a nifty feature. On a FaceTime call with multiple people, their voices are assigned locations based on where their boxes sit on the call. The effect is also novel in an app like Apple Music, which adjusts sound based on your location to the source (your phone, tablet, etc.) almost as if it were the speaker.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222881" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg 970w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=146,150 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=291,300 291w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=768,792 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=660,680 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-23-at-12.56.54-PM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></p>
<p>The new AirPods also get support for the new Find My feature, which adds a Bluetooth beacon-style layer onto the existing functionality. That makes it easier to find the individual buds in close quarters. Anyone who’s had to rely on the beeping sound knows it can still be a headache to locate the buds in a messy room.</p>
<p>As ever, the earbuds work best with Apple products &#8212; as I tend to say in all of these reviews, your best bet is generally buying a pair of earbuds from the same company that made your phone. The pairing was certainly stronger on iOS, but the AirPods generally worked fine in use with an Android device.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-2222872" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0535.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Watching the lines blur between the AirPods and AirPods Pro, it seems almost inevitable that the products will eventually merge into one. For now, the new generation is definitely a step up from their predecessors, and the $70 difference between them and the Pros is something to be mindful of. If you don’t care about active noise canceling and/or prefer modeled plastic tips, then the choice is easy. For a fully premium experience, however, well, that’s an easy choice, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, Google unveiled a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">partnership with Shopify</a> that gave the e-commerce platform&#8217;s over 1.7 million merchants the ability to reach consumers through Google Search and other services. Now, Microsoft is <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/search/2021_10/Microsoft-partners-with-Shopify-to-expand-product-selection-for-shoppers-this-holiday">announcing</a> a similar deal. The company recently said it&#8217;s teaming up with Shopify to expand product selection across its own search engine, Microsoft Bing, as well as within the Shopping tab on its Microsoft Edge browser and on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/microsoft-launches-a-personalized-news-service-microsoft-start/">newly launched news service,</a> Microsoft Start.</p>
<p>The integration is being made available to Shopify merchants through an updated Microsoft Channel app where they&#8217;ll be able to make a few adjustments to expand their reach across Microsoft&#8217;s network. Once set up up, merchants&#8217; products will show across the Shopping tab in Bing, Microsoft Edge, and Microsoft Start as free product listings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223386" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223386" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2223386" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/msft-shopify.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223386" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223367" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like Google, Microsoft&#8217;s advertising revenues may be impacted by Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/29/amazons-ads-business-nears-7-billion-a-quarter-posts-77percent-growth.html">growing</a> ads business over time.</p>
<p>Google has been scrambling to address this challenge with a revamp of its own Google Shopping service, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">it pitched to online advertisers</a> during its Google I/O developer conference this spring. The company then described its &#8220;Shopping Graph,&#8221; which would pull together information across websites, price reviews, and product data to help consumers find where to find items, who had the best price, and more. The company had also last year<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/google-switches-its-shopping-search-service-to-mostly-free-listings/"> made it free for merchants to sell their products across Google </a> — a change that Google touted had driven an 80% increase in merchants on Google, with the “vast majority” being small to medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/27/microsoft-msft-earnings-q4-2021.html">has been seeing</a> its search advertising revenue <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/alphabet-facebook-rise-as-microsoft-ad-units-do-better-than-predicted.html">grow in recent quarters</a> as the overall advertising market rebounded. But Amazon has been rapidly increasing its market share. In the first half of 2021, Amazon reported $14.82 billion in ad sales, up 82% from the same period a year ago, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-battling-amazon-tries-an-e-commerce-makeover-to-win-back-advertisers-11632936601">The WSJ noted in a report</a> on Google&#8217;s e-commerce makeover.</p>
<p>As more consumers start their product searches directly on Amazon and not on the web, bypassing search engines and homepage portals, both Google and Microsoft&#8217;s revenue could take a hit. To make their respective offerings more competitive, a partnership with Shopify gives both tech giants more direct access to a host of online inventory to showcase and market, including many listings Amazon may not have.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shopify&#8217;s integration with Microsoft will also allow merchants to create new ad campaigns and view marketing performance via real-time reports in their Shopify store, Microsoft said when announcing the tie-up. The company also noted it had other &#8220;shopping enhancements&#8221; planned for the future, but didn&#8217;t detail what those new features may include.</p>
<p>Microsoft is one of many integrations Shopify has announced over the past year. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/spotify-partners-with-shopify-to-add-merch-to-artists-profiles/">just teamed up with Spotify</a> to allow artists to sell merchandise through their Spotify profiles <a href="https://news.shopify.com/scaling-social-commerce-shopify-introduces-new-in-app-shopping-experiences-on-tiktok">and has been working with TikTok</a> on e-commerce experiences.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Braze is growing nicely at scale with modest net losses and no smokescreen-y, fake profit numbers on display.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome to the week!</p>
<p>Sure, the technology and business worlds are busy digging through a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebooks-stock-shrugs-off-bad-news-deluge/">deluge</a> of Facebook-focused reporting ahead of the social media company&#8217;s earnings report, but we have other work to do.</p>
<p>Namely, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001676238/000119312521304909/d40379ds1.htm">the Braze IPO filing</a>. The New York City-based company focuses on customer engagement software. We&#8217;ll get into what that means in a little bit.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>For background, Braze raised around $175 million while private, most recently raising a September 2018 round that put $80 million into its account and afforded Braze an $850 million post-money valuation. PitchBook and Crunchbase agree on the numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Our task this morning is to understand what Braze does, get our hands around its financial performance, and then chat a bit about what the company may be worth. Sound good? Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<h2>What does Braze do?</h2>
<p>In broad terms, Braze links with customer software systems to collect consumer data, automatically sorting consumers into segments. From there, the company&#8217;s software can send &#8220;contextually relevant&#8221; notes to consumers, personalized based on what Braze has learned about the person or persons in question. Those messages can be sent both inside of customer products or outside through third-party channels.</p>
<p>The underlying logic is that consumers expect customization today, and that data is the way to pull off the task. Braze makes lots of noise in its filing about how many companies&#8217; customer data is siloed inside individual applications today. In contrast, Braze offers a method of centralizing consumer data, which, in theory, allows for a more holistic view of a customers&#8217; consumer base. With that view in hand, customers can make better marketing decisions, with Braze helping companies get tuned messages out to end users.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, we&#8217;re talking about a software-as-a-service product, though the company does have a dusting of on-demand revenues, which we&#8217;ll get to in the next section.</p>
<p>Braze&#8217;s service has a large in-market footprint. The company claims in its S-1 filing that it powered &#8220;interactions with 3.3 billion monthly active users via our customers’ apps, websites and other digital interfaces in July 2021.&#8221; That figure was 2.3 billion in January 2020 and 1.6 billion in January 2019.</p>
<p>How does that rising usage of the Braze platform translate into revenue? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Is that a good business?</h2>
<p>Braze is a pretty good business.</p>
<p>The company has released data through the July 31, 2021, quarter. We should get an early look at its October 31, 2021, quarter in a following S-1 filing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New Zealand-based cybersecurity company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/emsisoft/">Emsisoft</a> has been quietly helping BlackMatter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> victims recover encrypted files, preventing “tens of millions of dollars” in ransom payments and potentially signaling the end of the BlackMatter for good.</p>
<p>BlackMatter, a successor to the DarkSide ransomware operation responsible for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/colonial-pipeline/">Colonial Pipeline attack</a>, first emerged in July this year and was recently the subject of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/cisa-nsa-blackmatter-food-industry/">CISA warning</a> due to “multiple” attacks targeting organizations deemed critical infrastructure, including two in the U.S. food and agriculture sector. The ransomware as a service operation was also responsible for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">a recent attack on Olympus</a>, which forced the Japanese tech giant to shut down its EMEA operations.</p>
<p>Emsisoft discovered earlier this year that much like DarkSide, which had a flaw in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/end-to-end-encryption/">encryption</a> mechanism that allowed Emsisoft to decrypt files, BlackMatter’s encryption process also had a vulnerability that allowed it to recover encrypted files without having to pay the ransom. Emsisoft did not reveal the existence of the flaw until now, fearing it would allow the BlackMatter group to immediately roll out a fix.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223299" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Knowing DarkSide’s past mistakes, we were surprised when BlackMatter introduced a change to their ransomware payload that allowed us to once again recover victims’ data without the need for a ransom to be paid,” Emsisoft CTO Fabian Wosar said <a href="https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/39181/on-the-matter-of-blackmatter/">in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Once it had discovered the vulnerability, Emsisoft alerted law enforcement, ransomware negotiations firms, incident response firms, national computer emergency readiness teams (CERTs), and trusted partners with information about its decryption capabilities. This allowed these trusted parties to refer BlackMatter victims to Emsisoft to recover their files rather than pay a ransom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since then, we have been busy helping BlackMatter victims recover their data. With the help of law enforcement agencies, CERTs and private sector partners in multiple countries, we were able to reach numerous victims, helping them avoid tens of millions of dollars in demands,&#8221; Wosar said. Emsisoft also contacted victims found through BlackMatter samples and ransom notes publicly uploaded to various sites.</p>
<p>But Wosar said the ransom notes that were leaked or made publicly available made it possible for anyone to communicate with the threat actors as though they were the victim. BlackMatter later locked down its site, making it far more difficult for law enforcement and security researchers to gather vital intelligence.</p>
<p>Emsisoft said it can still help BlackMatter victims who were encrypted before the end of September. Brett Callow, a threat analyst at Emsisoft, said this decryption campaign could be BlackMatter&#8217;s demise.</p>
<p>“This may well be the end of the BlackMatter brand,&#8221; he said. This is the second time their errors have cost their affiliates money, and the affiliates will likely not be too pleased about that. Unfortunately, even if the brand does end, the operators will likely return with a new one.&#8221;</p>
<p>“In the past, the risk/reward ratio was heavily skewed to ‘reward.’ This effort demonstrates the public-private sector collaboration can swing the needle, and that’s a key element to combatting the ransomware problem. The less profitable it is, the less incentive the threat actors have,&#8221; Callow told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Emsisoft says it’s also found vulnerabilities in about a dozen active ransomware operations. The company advises victims of ransomware to report attacks to law enforcement, who can collect valuable indicators of compromise for investigative purposes and refer victims to Emsisoft if a decryption tool is available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banks control the circulation and supply of money globally, but the phenomenal rise of cryptocurrency poses a threat to their authority, control and power.</span></p>
<p>So central banks around the world are now producing their own digital currencies. In a groundbreaking move for the African continent, buffered by local activity and interest in cryptocurrency &#8212; after the U.S., it is the second-largest market for crypto trading &#8212; <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria joins that list this week.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being in the development phase for the last three years, its central bank is piloting the first digital currency in Africa today.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2210974" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It joins 14 other countries now in the pilot stages with their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), including China, Sweden and South Korea, with a total of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">81 countries</a> in other stages of exploring CBDCs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only five have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the Bahamas, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Lucia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The virtual money, dubbed the eNaira, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is backed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and issued by the country’s apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most governments, Nigeria is introducing a virtual currency because it is more cost-efficient than physical cash, helps the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unbanked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have easier access to money, and can, in some way, limit illicit activities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>But despite the advantages that come with central bank-issued digital currencies, there are fears surrounding how they could be used by governments with a track record of surveilling or attempting to surveil their citizens.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>What we know so far about eNaira</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heading up to this pilot launch, CBN <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/nigeria-partner-bitt-inc-launch-192731934.html">picked Barbados-based Bitt Inc</a> in August to develop and roll out the digital currency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a track record: It assisted the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) to design and launch DCash, the digital currency used by Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia &#8212; four of the five countries that have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched their own CBDCs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On September 27, the CBN <a href="https://punchng.com/enaira-website-goes-live-displays-cbn-digital-currency-features/">launched the eNaira website</a>, detailing necessary information on how Nigerians can access and use the virtual currency</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, Nigerians will have to download the eNaira mobile application on the Apple Store or Play Store. They can also opt to scan a QR code on the website to access the service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After registration, users must</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> register and create a wallet &#8212; called the Speed Wallet &#8212; to store, send and receive money. Several tiers of wallets are</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available on the platform catering to various users with or without bank accounts and different identification levels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website lists four main eNaira features: a unified payment system that allows customers to move money from their eNaira wallet; a bank account management feature that lets users check balances and transaction history;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a contactless payment service so users can make in-store payments by scanning QR codes; and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> P2P payments, in which users send money to each other via a linked bank account or card</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency to give way to CBDCs</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin highlight the potential of money’s digital future despite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being created</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outside the confines of the traditional global banking system. And its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sharp rise in adoption has led to a scuffle with legacy institutions in determining the future of money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument against cryptocurrencies has typically focused on concerns around fraud and volatility. That hasn’t stopped some countries, like El Salvador, from using bitcoin as a legal tender</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thers that see bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a threat to their national banking and financial systems, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CBDCs act as direct replacements for rising interest in something other than fiat.</span></p>
<p>“The concept of CBDCs has become a necessity for central banks. Money is a tool for controlling people. They do not want to allow the primary tool of control to be eroded because the entrance of privately issued cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum is a direct challenge to central banks’ authority everywhere in the world. CBDCs come in as their response, albeit weak ones,” Chimezie Chuta, founder and coordinator of Blockchain Nigeria User Group, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While cryptocurrencies are pretty independent, digital currencies hold the same value as their paper counterparts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Nigeria’s case, the eNaira will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be pegged</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the naira, with its value fluctuating against the U.S. dollar, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the naira does.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another significant difference between CBDCs and cryptocurrencies is that the former </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is subjected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to regulation and control &#8212; common themes at the heart of governments in China and Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2014, China has been working on a national digital currency (digital yuan), an effort championed by its central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC),</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year after the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-05/china-s-pboc-bans-financial-companies-from-bitcoin-transactions">Chinese government banned banks and payments companies</a> from providing bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, China banned mining, initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency trading platforms from converting legal tender into cryptocurrencies and vice versa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the bans, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gained significant traction in the Asian country since then, so it made <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies-barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/">tighter laws</a> this May by banning fintech companies from offering services around account openings, registration, trading, clearing and settlement to crypto platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China says all cryptocurrency-related transactions are illegal and must be banned&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/embed/#?secret=fFlAun5ogD" data-secret="fFlAun5ogD" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until now, China had targeted only local crypto platforms and had not barred individuals from holding cryptocurrencies in offshore exchanges</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that changed last month when the Chinese government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/">declared</a> all transactions involving cryptocurrencies (including mining) illegal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also stated that it was illegal for offshore crypto exchanges like Binance to provide services to people in mainland China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whilst this is not a surprise as China has ‘banned’ crypto many times in the past, this time there is no ambiguity,” PwC crypto leader Henri Arslanian <a href="https://twitter.com/henriarslanian/status/1441463323342647296">tweeted</a>. “Crypto transactions and crypto services of all kinds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are banned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in China. No room for discussion. No grey area.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some analysts have said these bans and restrictions by China </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are geared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward the Asian country’s full release of the digital yuan in 2022</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s plausible, despite the Chinese government’s claims that it launched the digital yuan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to replace some cash in circulation in a country where WeChat and Alipay are responsible for four out of five payments </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">carried</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2>More crypto crackdown and surveillance?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PBOC, with the help of the government, might be attempting to take back some online payments market share from the duopoly (Alipay and WeChat) with the digital yuan, whose trials and rollout started from April 2020 in Shanghai, Chengdu and Beijing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the eNaira, users can only access the digital yuan by downloading a mobile app developed and controlled by the central bank. So far, there are more than 7 million individual digital wallets and 1 million company wallets using the digital yuan. Transactions totaling $5.3 billion have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the trials, according to <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/china-digital-currency-yuan-cbdc-banks-cryptocurrency-lenders-investment-insurance-2021-8">Business Insider</a>.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s digital yuan tests leap forward in Shenzhen&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/china-digital-yuan-shenzhen/embed/#?secret=9CNpF5iJVp" data-secret="9CNpF5iJVp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Nigeria isn’t a crypto mining country, its people are heavy crypto users. The West African country is second only to the U.S. for bitcoin trading, <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1947769/nigeria-is-the-second-largest-bitcoin-market-after-the-us/">according to Paxful</a>, as many Nigerians use the cryptocurrency to protect their savings against naira depreciation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Nigerians <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jul/31/out-of-control-and-rising-why-bitcoin-has-nigerias-government-in-a-panic">traded</a> $2.4 billion worth of traceable crypto, per data from Chainalysis. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an astonishing figure, considering that in February, the Nigerian government via the CBN <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/nigerian-central-bank-orders-closure-of-cryptocurrency-accounts">banned cryptocurrency transactions</a>, prohibited banks from taking part in such transactions, and ordered them to close accounts of Nigerians using cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, similar to China, Nigeria’s following action tilted toward piloting its digital currency. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But unlike China, Nigeria is a cash-dominated society. It’s one of the main reasons (including the potential to improve financial inclusion) why smaller countries such as the Bahamas have rolled out digital currencies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these purposes, the introduction of a digital currency in Nigeria makes sense on paper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, m</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">any Nigerians have reservations about its usefulness, while others understand that it’s the government’s ploy to reduce incentives for people who want to use crypto. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, there are other subtle factors to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be worried</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about: surveillance and a full-scale crackdown on crypto activities in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Typically, governments use Financial Intelligence units to monitor financial transactions and collect information on suspicious or unusual monetary activity. But CBDCs might take things up a notch.</p>
<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="d2l7g" data-offset-key="ernng-0-0">
<div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="ernng-0-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several publications have alluded that China’s government could use the digital yuan t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o advance surveillance of its people. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to its central bank, the PBOC, agencies operating digital yuan services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “submit transaction data to the central bank via asynchronous transmission on a timely basis,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which will allow the bank to “track data and crackdown on laundering and criminal offenses.”</span></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CBN has a similar </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">objective</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has said before that the eNaira will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fraudulent activities and money laundering because of the “trackable unique ID of each eNaira</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="ernng-2-0">“</span></span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="ernng-6-0">Banks and telcos already have our necessary information via verification processes,” said Chuta. “But CBDCs will increase that monitoring and surveillance because now they can actually follow money flow in a digital environment and carry out a forensic analysis of each user’s transaction on the ledger that they are deploying.”</span></span><span data-offset-key="ernng-7-0"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, a report from a local press said Nigeria was in <a href="https://fij.ng/article/exclusive-presidency-meets-with-chinas-cyber-regulator-to-build-nigerian-internet-firewall/">talks</a> with China to build an internet firewall. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the publication, China’s “Great Firewall” is the center of the government’s online censorship and surveillance effort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hough Nigeria lacks the resources to build such a firewall for surveillance, some believe the eNaira might have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been designed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the same purpose, albeit on a lesser scale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CBDCs are trackable and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it might come in handy for the government if they decide to carry out unwarranted surveillance,” a crypto user who withheld his name told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, as with the case of China, more crypto crackdowns could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be triggered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if, for instance, the adoption of eNaira does not take off as planned or if the government enforces the eNaira as the sole digital currency to be traded in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case in point: China’s new orders made two of the world’s largest crypto exchanges &#8212; Huobi and Binance &#8212; halt new registrations for users, and Huobi says it will retire current accounts by the end of the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear if the Nigerian government can exercise such powers. Still, should</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it ban offshore crypto platforms from servicing and employing Nigerians and succeed, peer-to-peer activities (which has made crypto thrive in Nigeria) will take a severe hit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The government, in general, poses a threat to crypto. It’s situations like this where someone has real-world power and [can] put you in jail for trading crypto,” said a growth lead at a Nigerian cryptocurrency exchange platform. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a government </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decided to outlaw the use of crypto within their borders, crypto would be stifled such that at some point, it might not be worth it to use anymore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, though, it seems Nigeria and its apex bank have noble intentions with the eNaira. According to the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, the eNaira will lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow and increase cross-border trade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For remittances, the eNaira </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is assumed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to provide a better alternative for Nigerians in the diaspora to send money home, in the long run increasing remittances into the country, which <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2021/09/06/diaspora-remittances-into-nigeria-fall-by-24-in-q1-2021/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20Nigeria%20reported%20about,to%20%2423.4%20billion%20in%202019.">reached $17 billion last year</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://saharareporters.com/2021/09/22/chinese-banks-set-establish-operations-nigeria">News</a> about Chinese banks expanding operations in Nigeria made the rounds last month and could prove pivotal to the effectiveness of cross-border trade between both countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">China is Nigeria’s biggest trade partner (volume transacted between them has passed $20 billion this year, increasing from $19.2 billion in 2020). Three years ago, both countries tried a <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1346766/chinas-yuan-trades-in-nigeria-africa-top-economy/">currency swap agreement</a> for better trade and, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lthough nothing materialized, Chuta holds that the countries’ digital currencies can act as perfect substitutes.</span></p>
<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="d2l7g" data-offset-key="b9ka3-0-0">
<div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="b9ka3-0-0"><span class="qualifier"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-0-0">“I think</span></span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-1-0"> there can be interoperability that can be beneficial to both countries. When you want to transfer money from Nigeria to China, you would have to go through at least four different hoops and it takes like three or four days,” said Chuta.</span></span><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-2-0"> “</span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-3-0">But let’s say China and Nigeria’s CBDCs interoperate, it means that if I want to send money to a Chinese supplier, I </span></span><span class="adverb"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-6-0">simply</span></span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-7-0"> swap eNaira to Chinese yuan on my app and push it to the supplier who gets it at a fraction of the amount I would’ve </span></span><span class="adverb"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-8-0">typically</span></span><span class="veryhardreadability"><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-9-0"> done with the traditional transfer bodies</span></span><span data-offset-key="b9ka3-10-0">.”</span></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Nigeria’s central bank, the eNaira would also improve “payment efficiency, revenue and tax collection, and targeted social interventions.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Nigeria’s apex bank achieve all this? It’s too early to say, since no country, either in pilot or fully launched mode, has achieved success at a massive scale yet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eNaira’s staggered rollout is expected to take place across four cities in the country &#8212; Port Harcourt, Abuja, Kano and Lagos. But</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"> given how similar government-led initiatives have fared in the past, the odds of achieving full-scale rollout are slim.</span></p>

<div class="contributor-byline__bio">This story was reported in partnership with video surveillance news site <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/lorex-box?code=xybl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPVM.</a></div>
</div>
<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. retail giants Home Depot and Best Buy have pulled the Chinese video surveillance technology makers Lorex and Ezviz from their stores over links to human rights abuses.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Home Depot said it&#8217;s &#8220;committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical sourcing and we immediately stopped selling products from Lorex when this was brought to our attention.&#8221; Home Depot also stopped selling Ezviz products, a spokesperson confirmed. Best Buy said it was &#8220;discontinuing its relationship&#8221; with both Lorex and Ezviz.</p>
<p>Lowe&#8217;s, which did not comment, also removed Lorex from its shelves following inquiries from TechCrunch and <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/lorex-box?code=xybl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video surveillance news site IPVM</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222929" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Lorex is a subsidiary of Dahua Technology, and Ezviz is a video surveillance camera brand owned by Hikvision. Dahua and Hikvision, both headquartered in China, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/eight-chinese-tech-firms-placed-on-u-s-entity-list-for-their-role-in-human-rights-violations-against-muslim-minority-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were added</a> to the U.S. government’s economic blacklist in 2019 after the companies were linked to China’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/china-surveillance-app/">ongoing efforts to suppress ethnic minorities</a> in Xinjiang, where most Uighur Muslims live.</p>
<p>The U.S. government says Beijing relies heavily on Hikvision, Dahua and other technology companies to supply the surveillance equipment to surveil the Uighur population. The Biden administration <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called</a> the human rights abuses in Xinjiang a “genocide,&#8221; and blamed Chinese video surveillance manufacturers of having &#8220;been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.”</p>
<p>United Nations watchdogs say Chinese authorities have detained over a million Uighurs in internment camps in recent years. China has long denied the allegations.</p>
<p>But as the sanctions neither cover Dahua and Hikvision subsidiaries like Lorex and Ezviz and don&#8217;t apply outside the federal government, consumers are still broadly free to buy the technology.</p>
<p>Until last week, Lorex listed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211014184354/https://www.lorex.com/pages/authorized-resellers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on its website</a> Home Depot, Best Buy, Lowe&#8217;s, Walmart and Costo as its five authorized national retail outlets.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, a Lorex spokesperson said: “Lorex is fully transparent with our retail partners about our ownership and have been since the acquisition in 2018. We are also regularly in touch with representatives of those companies in regard to various regulatory and compliance issues, including addressing any questions they have about the FCC’s proposed rulemaking.”</p>
<p>Lorex did not respond to follow-up emails after its products were removed. Lorex removed the logos of the five retail giants from its website, though it still lists the companies — except Walmart — as retailers of its technology.</p>
<p>Walmart and Costco, which still stock Lorex and Ezviz technology, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Dolkun Isa, the president of the World Uyghur Congress, welcomed the &#8220;meaningful actions&#8221; by the U.S. government with bans on forced labor and sanctions for Chinese companies, but said that it&#8217;s &#8220;unacceptable that there are still American companies directly helping further the repression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hikvision did not respond to requests for comment by TechCrunch and IPVM.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://selfbook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selfbook</a>, a hotel payment software startup, announced today that it has raised $25 million in a Series A round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valia Ventures, Fin Venture Capital, early Stripe employee turned investor Lachy Groom and “strategic” angel investors also participated in the financing, which values the company at $125 million and brings its total funding raised to $30 million. The valuation represents a nearly “16x” increase from the company’s valuation when it raised a $2 million seed round last quarter, according to Khalid Meniri, co-founder and CEO of Selfbook. Investors such as Better Tomorrow Ventures, Abstract Ventures, TenOneTen Ventures and 9Yards Capital participated in this latest round, as well &#8220;with super pro rata.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selfbook claims that its software gives hotels a way to accept “one-click” payments directly on their websites while eliminating fraud and reducing chargebacks.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222709" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in September 2020 as a pivot from a consumer travel app to a B2B company, New York-based Selfbook describes itself as the “Shopify for travel” and says it operates at the intersection of hospitality and fintech. Hotels can implement its technology, according to Meniri, “with a single line of code” to improve their booking experience directly on their existing reservation systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selfbook launched with one hotel in April and has subsequently signed contracts representing nearly 90 hotels, with 15 so far having gone live. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its customers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">span a range of geographies and include Le Pigalle in Paris, Eden Rock St Barths and The LINE’s locations in Los Angeles, Austin, Texas and Washington, D.C. Selfbook is primarily focused on the U.S. and EU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past six months, the startup has seen a “10x” increase in Selfbook users using single sign-on and digital wallets. Additionally, 67% of bookings were made using digital wallets on mobile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selfbook claims that its software is the only payment technology for hotels that supports digital wallet use, including Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal and buy now, pay later. It also supports traditional debit and credit card payments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides allowing for “one-click” payment, Meniri says Selfbook&#8217;s software also provides direct booking links and smart merchandising.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the software can also group multiple services such as restaurant reservations, spa appointments and activities into a “single payment flow.” This, the company says, can drive more upsells for the hotels and as a result, increase revenue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Selfbook has 50 full-time employees, up from only four employees at the beginning of the year. It plans to use its new capital in part to do more hiring in addition to expanding partnerships with fintech partners and existing hospitality systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, Selfbook formerly operated as a B2C business that gave hotel guests a way to book reservations at over 3,000 hotels using its SIX Travel app. In order to facilitate those bookings, the company created its own “modern” transaction software after discovering there were no existing API partners with a simple hotel booking function on the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When the pandemic hit and deeply impacted the hospitality industry, we decided to democratize</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our unique payment and transaction engine and improve the direct hotel booking process for all,” Meniri told TechCrunch. “We relaunched as Selfbook to offer our payment solution directly to hotels” with the goal of helping the hotel industry more easily recover from the negative effects of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Tiger Global partner Alex Cook, Selfbook is not only modernizing the hotel booking experience, it has the potential to increase conversion for hotel operators and improve the booking experience for guests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for investor Groom, who is the former head of Stripe issuing, Selfbook aims to solve a very real pain point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone who&#8217;s booked a hotel online knows how bad the state of payments in hospitality is,” he said in a statement. “Selfbook is a joy to use, and is obviously the future.”</span></p>
<p>Side note: After booking a hotel earlier this year through a third-party provider and having a nightmare experience to just cancel the booking, I can appreciate the need for this sort of technology. It was shocking to me that it was so complicated and difficult. So anything that can make directly booking with a hotel more convenient and safer, I&#8217;m all for.</p>
<p>Last week, we reported on Citcon, a mobile wallet payment provider, closing on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/citcon-raises-30m-to-make-paying-with-mobile-wallets-as-easy-as-paying-with-a-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30 million in funding</a> in a Series C round co-led by Norwest Venture Partners and Cota Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Celeb video site <a href="https://www.cameo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cameo</a> is making its first acquisition. The company will buy Represent, a marketing and merch company that helps celebrities and brands set up individualized online storefronts. It&#8217;s a natural fit for Cameo, which invites fans to pay celebrities of all stripes for short, customized videos.</p>
<p>Represent counts Jennifer Lopez, Ed Sheeran, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matthew McConaughey and Kendall Jenner among the members of its pool of partnered talent, so Cameo will be bringing those relationships into the fold through the acquisition.</p>
<p>The company is also bringing Represent&#8217;s leadership on board and the acquisition will double the size of Cameo&#8217;s team in Europe. Cameo did not disclose the terms of the deal.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223304" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cameo says that its users won&#8217;t see changes right away, but in the future they might be able to purchase &#8220;gift bundles&#8221; that would pair a traditional Cameo video with related merch. The company also hopes that weaving merch into its revenue streams will boost the fundraising efforts that many on-platform celebrities do to raise money for nonprofits.</p>
<p>Most of Cameo&#8217;s users visit the celeb video site to procure gifts for friends and loved ones to celebrate birthdays and other occasions. The company said it facilitated more than 1.3 million videos last year, with the company&#8217;s top 150 figures earning north of $100,000.</p>
<p>The company has also added a few new products, including Cameo Calls — short one-on-one video calls with celebrities — and Fan Clubs, sort of a VIP section of the site that helps dedicated fans stay in the loop on the talent they follow.</p>
<p>Cameo has raised money from a number of traditional sources like Google Ventures and SoftBank, but also from celebrity investors like Snoop Dogg and Tony Hawk. In March, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/celebrity-video-request-site-cameo-reaches-unicorn-status-with-100m-raise/">Cameo raised a $100 million Series C</a>, bringing the company&#8217;s valuation to upward of $1 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After social media company Snap reported earnings last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">the value of its cohort of public companies fell sharply</a>.</p>
<p>Snap shed more than 20% of its value after telling investors that it expects a far smaller fourth quarter than the street anticipates. Privacy changes to technology platforms and weak advertiser demand thanks to supply-chain issues are likely to weigh on Snap&#8217;s Q4 top-line expectations.</p>
<p>Facebook stock fell around 5% on the Snap news on Friday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223279" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>And then Facebook had a difficult weekend of coverage, a period that flowed into a <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/211025/p4#a211025p4">Monday-morning news dump</a> concerning the company as dozens of media organizations began reporting on a trove of documents released by a whistleblower. Facebook is in the midst of what is perhaps its most damning reporting cycle to date, a bit of a high-water mark given the social company&#8217;s history of scandal.</p>
<p>This morning, however, shares of Facebook are essentially flat, trading up or down 0.2% to 0.3%. Investors are shrugging off the reporting, it appears.</p>
<p>It would be easy to make a somewhat cynical comment that public-market investors were more concerned about potentially lackluster business results than they are about, say, the company&#8217;s inability to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/23/technology/facebook-india-misinformation.html">handle misinformation and political manipulation in India</a>. But a good chunk of today&#8217;s reporting deals with things that <em>do </em>matter in business terms, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-files-show-growth-struggles-as-young-users-in-u-s-decline">like Facebook&#8217;s slowly declining grip on younger users. </a>So, what&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>It may be that today&#8217;s reporting was priced into Facebook&#8217;s stock already; the company, worth just under $326 per share this morning, is far from its all-time high of $384.33 that it set earlier this year, indicating that it has already given up quite a lot of value.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But it may be most fair to say that Facebook investors are simply reacting to <em>new</em> disclosures &#8212; like Snap&#8217;s bad news &#8212; more than historical documents outlining longer-term issues. That would explain why Facebook fell Friday and is flattish today.</p>
<p>Regardless of why Facebook&#8217;s shares are holding steady this morning, any gains in the wake of an ocean of negative reporting based on the company&#8217;s own descriptions of its problems &#8212; leaked documents are powerful for that very reason &#8212; must feel like a win inside of Facebook&#8217;s halls.</p>
<p>Facebook reports earnings today after the bell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Car rental giant Hertz has placed an order for <a href="https://newsroom.hertz.com/2021-10-25-Hertz-Invests-in-Largest-Electric-Vehicle-Rental-Fleet-and-Partners-with-Seven-Time-Super-Bowl-Champion-Tom-Brady-to-Headline-New-Campaign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100,000 Tesla vehicles</a> to be delivered by the end of 2022 in the largest single purchase of EVs ever. The deal, which will push the car rental giant&#8217;s EV offerings to 20% of its global fleet, is reportedly worth $4.2 billion, according to sources <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/hertz-said-to-order-100-000-teslas-in-car-rental-market-shake-up?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_content=business&amp;sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cited by Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>Tesla Model 3 vehicles will show up in the Hertz rental inventory as early as next month in major U.S. markets and select cities in Europe, according to the rental company.</p>
<p>The order will likely represent a notable portion of Teslas manufactured and delivered over the next 14 months. The EV maker delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, with the vast majority of these being its most popular Model 3 sedan. Production and deliveries have risen this year. Tesla delivered 627,572 through the first three quarters of 2021. The company produced around 624,582 vehicles in that same nine-month time period.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223284" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Hertz also announced plans to install thousands of chargers throughout its network to support the increase in EVs, in addition to a “premium and differentiated rental experience” for customers renting a Tesla that includes educating drivers on how to use and charge the car. Customers who rent a Tesla Model 3 will also have access to Tesla&#8217;s supercharging stations, infrastructure that is already under pressure in some locations as sales of the Tesla EVs skyrocket.</p>
<p>Tesla shares rose more than 5% following the news, pushing the stock price to $960 shortly after the market opened. Hertz stock also saw an 11% increase, to around $27.</p>
<p>Like other companies in the travel and tourism industry, Hertz had a rocky pandemic, with decreased rentals pushing the company to file for bankruptcy protection in May last year. The deal with Tesla comes just four months after Hertz <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/30/business/hertz-bankrupcty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emerged from bankruptcy</a>, amidst a remarkable rebound for the rental car industry. Investment firms Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management took over Hertz earlier this year.</p>

The company is not having a good month, let alone quarter, from a PR perspective. It reports earnings later today.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://www.y42.com/">low-code data platform Y42</a> today announced that it has raised a $31 million Series A funding round co-led by Atomico and Insight Partners. La Famiglia, which led the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/no-code-business-intelligence-tool-y42-raises-2-9m-seed-round/">seed round</a>, and Data Community Fund also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to date to just under $34 million.</p>
<p>Y42 wants to provide its users with an end-to-end data platform that can replace the various tools they are using today to integrate, transform, orchestrate and visualize their data. And yes, that means it wants to be able to give its users a single tool that can, for the most part, replace existing services like Fivetran, Airbyte, dbt and Tableau.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223016" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223016" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223016" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="591" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg 1459w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=768,443 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132959.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223016" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Y42</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;It is a very crowded market,&#8221; Y42 founder and CEO Hung Dang said. &#8220;But this is why the way we&#8217;re trying to approach this is by having a very different hypothesis than most point-to-point tools out there. [&#8230;] I come into this game with the mindset that I don&#8217;t care how long it takes me to build this product, but if I have a clean slate, how would I build this product? We are taking all the best practices of the modern data stack of these point-to-point tools, but apply them to one consistent platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>This means Y42 wants to give business intelligence teams and data analysts a single tool that helps them bridge the gap between doing some basic data analysis and hiring multiple full-time data engineers who can maintain a modern data stack. That&#8217;s an area where the company is winning a lot of new customers, but it also means that Y42 has to be able to scale with those users as they build up their data practices, something Dang is optimistic the company can do (especially given some of the features it has on its roadmap for next year).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223014" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223014" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2223014" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="586" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg 1451w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg?resize=680,389 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-24-132616.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2223014" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Y42</p></div></p>
<p>“Every business leader today knows they need to extract more value from their data, but the data talent to adopt and maintain a modern stack is scarce; demand for data engineers is growing 50% annually. Y42 unlocks this bottleneck and democratizes access to data tools beyond a select few. In that, they are creating a new category.” said Atomico partner Irina Haivas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dang also noted that a number of bigger players in the industry, including the likes of Snowflake, are very interested in partnering with Y42. That&#8217;s in part because the service functions a bit like a gatekeeper for new customers who may not even yet have a data warehouse in use. Since Y42 itself sits on top of Google Cloud, BigQuery was always a natural recommendation for these customers, but it&#8217;s obviously not the only one.</p>
<p>The company currently has about 70 employees, up from 25 in March. Its customers include the likes of <a href="https://www.lifemd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lifemd.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHGF1J01xU9lwGPsAn0hLL6Cn0QYg">LifeMD</a>, <a href="https://thepetlabco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thepetlabco.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDUzlxtUx7seE8InbBS4ZyKEtOFw">Petlab</a> and <a href="https://www.everdrop.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.everdrop.de/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616452120912000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHLzJlfl3V1yIw8lWpDtwEF7ZeVw">Everdrop</a>. Unsurprisingly, Y42 plans to use the new funding to accelerate the development of its platform, scale its team and expand its go-to-market efforts. Y42 has already started building out a U.S.-based team, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After already targeting verticals like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/19/amazon-launches-an-alexa-system-for-hotels/">hotels</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/amazon-launches-an-alexa-service-for-property-managers/">apartment complexes</a>, Amazon <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-brings-alexa-senior-living-communities-and-healthcare">announced</a> today it&#8217;s now rolling out new solutions for healthcare providers and senior living centers. The solutions, which are a part of Alexa Smart Properties, are designed specifically to meet the needs of deploying Alexa devices at scale and will allow the facility&#8217;s administrators to create customized experiences for their residents or patients.</p>
<p>In senior living centers, the residents would be able to use Alexa devices to call their family members and other loved ones, as well as keep up with the goings-on at their community and other community news. The devices could also be used to make announcements, allow the residents to communicate with each other through direct audio messages, make voice and video calls, and they can streamline other center activities &#8212; like check-ins, maintenance requests, and various administrative tasks. Amazon believes this could help make facilities more efficient and productive.</p>
<p>Amazon says senior living communities include Atria and Eskaton will integrate with its new solution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223267" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The market for using Alexa in senior living communities was already being explored by third-party providers, like K4Connect, which last year<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/k4connect-a-startup-bringing-tech-to-senior-living-centers-closes-its-21m-series-b/"> closed on $21 million in Series B</a> funding to bring newer technologies, including Alexa&#8217;s voice assistance, to older adults and those living with disabilities. Companies like K4Connect and others, including Lifeline Senior Living, Aiva, and Vocera, can now tap into Alexa Smart Properties&#8217; tools and APIs to make it easier for them to roll out their own, customized solutions and software.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2223278" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2223278" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2223278" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg 2550w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Image-13.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2223278" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amazon had already piloted putting Alexa in patient rooms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/25/cedars-sinai-puts-amazon-alexa-in-patient-rooms-as-part-of-a-pilot-program/">in a test with Cedars-Sinai,</a> which allowed patients to use voice commands for performing basic tasks, like changing TV channels, as well as communicating with caregivers. The idea was that, by offloading some of the everyday tasks to Alexa, it could free up nurses to focus more on medical care.</p>
<p>With Amazon&#8217;s new solution for hospitals, patients will be able to use Alexa to communicate with care staff, control the devices in their room, and stay entertained with news and music. Healthcare providers can also communicate with their patients using Alexa features like calling and Drop-In, without having to enter the patient rooms. This could also help hospitals be more productive and conserve their medical supplies and protective equipment like gloves, masks, and gowns, notes Amazon. (PPE shortages had been an ongoing issue in some locations as Covid spiked during the pandemic.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cedars-Sinai is among those officially rolling out the Alexa Smart Properties solution, following its pilot program, and is joined by BayCare and Houston Methodist, Amazon says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Voice is intuitive for patients, regardless of age or tech-savviness,&#8221; said Peachy Hain, executive director of Medical and Surgical Services at Cedars-Sinai, in a statement. &#8220;Since it&#8217;s so easy to operate, patients can use Alexa to connect with their care team and stay entertained as soon as they settle in, while care providers can streamline tasks to make more time to care for those patients. It&#8217;s a total gamechanger for enhancing our hospital experience,&#8221; Hain added.</p>
<p>Though Amazon has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/amazon-responds-to-a-u-s-senators-inquiry-confirms-alexa-voice-records-are-kept-indefinitely/">struggled</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/alexa-user-gets-access-to-1700-audio-files-from-a-stranger/">with</a> privacy issues related to its use of voice recordings and transcriptions, the healthcare and senior living center solutions will not save the voice recordings and don&#8217;t require users to share personal info with Alexa to use the device, the company explains. Users can also mute the Echo&#8217;s microphone at any time with the button on top. Amazon also claims it safeguards protected health information received through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/amazon-alexa-launches-its-first-hipaa-compliant-medical-skills/">HIPAA-eligible Alexa skill</a> interactions.</p>
<p>Amazon has been working to bring Alexa to healthcare facilities for some time. A report <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/10/amazon-is-building-a-health-and-wellness-team-within-alexa.html">in 2018 by CNBC</a> had said the company was building out a healthcare team with Alexa in order to make the voice assistant useful in the industry. This included working through the complex HIPAA regulations that would be required to do so. The following year, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/04/amazon-alexa-launches-its-first-hipaa-compliant-medical-skills/">announced</a> its first HIPAA-compliant medical skills and began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/25/cedars-sinai-puts-amazon-alexa-in-patient-rooms-as-part-of-a-pilot-program/">piloting</a> its devices in hospitals. Elsewhere across Amazon, the company has invested in healthcare solutions in other ways, including through solutions like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Comprehend Medical</a>, a machine learning tool that gathers information from things like doctors’ notes and patient health records, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/amazons-2018-acquisitions-totaled-1-65b-led-by-pillpack-and-ring/">acquisitions</a> like online pharmacy PillPack.</p>
<p>Both of the new Alexa Smart Properties solutions will roll out in the U.S. starting next month, Amazon says.</p>
