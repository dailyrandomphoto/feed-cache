										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many of the highest-profile English tutoring platforms focus on children, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/vipkid/">VIPKID</a> and Magic Ears. <a href="https://www.ringleplus.com/en/student/landing/home">Ringle</a> created a niche for itself by focusing on adults first, with courses like business English and interview preparation. The South Korea-based startup announced today it has raised an $18 million Series A led by returning investor Must Asset Management, at a valuation of $90 million. Ringle is preparing to launch a program for school kids later this year, and also has plans to open offine educational spaces in South Korea and the United States.</p>
<p>Other participants in the round, which brings Ringle’s total raised to $20 million, include returning investors One-asset management and MoCA Ventures, along with new backer Xoloninvest. Ringle claims its revenue has grown three times every year since it was founded in 2015, and that bookings for lessons have increased by 390% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Ringle currently has 700 tutors, who are pre-screened by the company, and 100,000 users. About 30% of its students, who learn through one-on-one live video sessions, are based outside of Korea, including in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and Singapore.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ringle’s co-founders are Seunghoon Lee and Sungpah Lee, who both earned MBAs from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business. They developed Ringle based on the challenges they faced as non-native English speakers and graduate students in the U.S. The startup was first created to serve professionals who are already established in their careers or in academia. Its students include people who have worked for companies like Google, Amazon, BCG, McKinsey and Samsung Electronics.</p>

<p>Seunghoon Lee told TechCrunch that Ringle creates <a href="https://www.ringleplus.com/en/student/landing/english-learning-materials">proprietary learning materials</a> based on current events to keep its students interested. For example, recent topics have included blockchain NFT tech, how the movie “Parasite” portrayed class conflict and global inequalities in vaccine access.</p>
<p>Ringle’s tutors are recruited from top universities and need to submit proof of education and verify their school emails. The company’s vetting process also includes a mock session with Ringle staff. Lee said applicants are asked to familiarize themselves with some of Ringle’s learning materials and lead a full lesson based on its guidance. Ringle assesses candidates on their teaching skills and ability to lead engaging discussions that also hone their students’ language skills.</p>
<p>Part of Ringle’s new funding is earmarked for its tech platform. It is currently developing a language diagnostics system that tracks the complexity and accuracy of students’ spoken English with researchers at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology).</p>
<p>The company already has an AI-based analytics system that uses speech-to-text and measures speech pacing (or words spoken per minute), the amount of filler words and range of words and expressions in lessons. It delivers feedback that allows students to compare their performance with the top 20% of Ringle users in different metrics.</p>
<p>The new language diagnostics system that is currently under development with KAIST will start releasing features over the next few months, including speech fluency scoring, a personalized dictionary and auto-paraphrasing suggestions.</p>
<p>The funding will also be used to create more original learning content, and hire for Ringle’s offices in Seoul and San Mateo, California. Ringle also plans to diversify its revenue sources by providing premium content on a subscription basis, and will launch its junior program for students aged 10 and above later this year.</p>

		<a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/people/staff/guy-martin/">Guy Martin</a> is the executive director of OASIS Open, one of the most respected nonprofit standards organizations in the world. He brings more than 25 years of experience as both a software engineer and an open-source strategist to OASIS Open, where he helps the organization realize the tremendous advantage in integrating the best of open-standards and open-source communities.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Our world has big problems to solve, and something desperately needed in that pursuit is the open-source and open-standards communities working together.</p>
<p>Let me give you a stark example, taken from the harsh realities of 2020. Last year, the United States experienced nearly <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF10244.pdf">60,000 wildland fires</a> that burned more than 10 million acres, resulting in more than 9,500 homes destroyed and at least <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/01/reviewing-the-horrid-global-2020-wildfire-season/">43 lives</a> lost.</p>
<p>I served as a volunteer firefighter in California for 10 years and witnessed firsthand the critical importance of technology in helping firefighters communicate efficiently and deliver safety-critical information quickly. Typically, multiple agencies show up to fight these fires, bringing with them radios made by different manufacturers that each use proprietary software to set radio frequencies. As a result, reprogramming these radios so that teams could communicate with one another is an unnecessarily slow — and potentially life-threatening — process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If the radio manufacturers had instead all contributed to an open-source implementation conforming to a standard, the radios could have been quickly aligned to the same frequencies. Radio manufacturers could have provided a valuable, life-saving tool rather than a time-wasting obstacle, and they could have shared the cost of developing such software. In this situation, like so many others, there is no competitive advantage to be gained from proprietary radio-programming software and many priceless benefits to gain by standardizing.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Open source and open standards are obviously different, but the objectives of these communities are the same: interoperability, innovation and choice.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The benefit of coherent standards and corresponding open-source implementations is not unique to safety-critical situations like wildfires. There are many areas of our lives that could significantly benefit from a better integration of standards and open source.</p>
<h2>Open source and open standards: What’s the difference?</h2>
<p>“Open source” describes software that is publicly accessible and free for anyone to use, modify and share. It also describes a collaborative, community-oriented software development philosophy, with an open exchange of ideas, open participation, rapid prototyping, and open governance and transparency.</p>
<p>By contrast, the term “standard” refers to agreed-upon definitions of functionality. These requirements, specifications and guidelines ensure that products, services and systems perform in an interoperable way with quality, safety and efficiency.</p>
<p>Dozens of organizations exist for the purpose of establishing and maintaining standards. Examples include the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS Open</a> belongs in this category as well. A standard is “open” when it is developed via a consensus-building process, guided by organizations that are open, fair and transparent. Most people would agree that the standard-building process is careful and deliberate, ensuring consensus through compromise and resulting in long-lasting specifications and technical boundaries.</p>
<h2>Where’s the common ground?</h2>
<p>Open source and open standards are obviously different, but the objectives of these communities are the same: interoperability, innovation and choice. The main difference is how they accomplish those goals, and by that I’m referring primarily to culture and pace.</p>
<p>Chris Ferris, an IBM fellow and CTO of Open Technology, recently told me that with standards organizations, it often seems the whole point is to slow things down. Sometimes it’s with good reason, but I’ve seen competition get the best of people, too. Open source seems to be much more collaborative and less contentious or competitive. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t competitive projects out there that are tackling the same domain.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UigwbeJGjz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/the-human-focused-startups-of-the-hellfire/">The human-focused startups of the hellfire</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The human-focused startups of the hellfire&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/the-human-focused-startups-of-the-hellfire/embed/#?secret=UigwbeJGjz" data-secret="UigwbeJGjz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Another culture characteristic that affects pace is that open source is about writing code and standards organizations are about writing prose. Words outlive code with respect to long-term interoperability, so the standards culture is much more deliberate and thoughtful as it develops the prose that defines standards. Although standards are not technically static, the intent with a standard is to arrive at something that will serve without significant change for the long term. Conversely, the open-source community writes code with an iterative mindset, and the code is essentially in a state of continuous evolution. These two cultures sometimes clash when the communities try to move in concert.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, why try to find harmony?</p>
<h2>Collaboration between open source and open standards will fuel innovation</h2>
<p>The internet is a perfect example of what harmony between the open-source and open-standards communities can achieve. When the internet began as ARPANET, it relied on common shared communications standards that predated TCP/IP. With time, standards and open-source implementations brought us TCP/IP, HTTP, NTP, XML, SAML, JSON and many others, and also enabled the creation of additional key global systems implemented in open standards and code, like disaster warnings (OASIS CAP) and standardized global trade invoicing (OASIS UBL).</p>
<p>The internet has literally transformed our world. That level of technological innovation and transformative power is possible for the future, too, if we re-energize the spirit of collaboration between the open-standards and open-source communities.</p>
<h2>Finding harmony and a natural path of integration</h2>
<p>With all of the critical open-source projects residing in repositories today, there are many opportunities for collaboration on associated standards to ensure the long-term operability of that software. Part of our mission at OASIS Open is identifying those open-source projects and giving them a collaborative environment and all the scaffolding they need to build a standard without it becoming a difficult process.</p>
<p>Another point Ferris shared with me is the necessity for this path of integration to grow. For instance, this need is particularly prevalent if you want your technology to be used in Asia: If you don’t have an international standard, Asian enterprises don’t even want to hear from you. We’re seeing the European community asserting a strong preference for standards as well. That is certainly a driver for open-source projects that want to play with some of the heavy hitters in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Another area where you can see a growing need for integration is when an open-source project becomes bigger than itself, meaning it begins to impact a whole lot of other systems, and alignment is needed between them. An example would be a standard for telemetry data, which is now being used for so many different purposes, from observability to security. Another example is the software bill of materials, or SBOM. I know some things are being done in the open-source world to address the challenge of tracking the provenance of software. This is another case where, if we’re going to be successful at all, we need a standard to emerge.</p>
<h2>It’s going to take a team effort</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the ultimate goals of the open-source and open-standards communities are the same: interoperability, innovation and choice. We also have excellent proof points of how and why we need to work together, from the internet to Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) and more. In addition, major stakeholders are carrying the banner, acknowledging that for certain open-source projects we need to take a strategic, longer-term view that includes standards.</p>
<p>That’s a great start to a team effort. Now it&#8217;s time for foundations to step up to the plate and collaborate with each other and with those stakeholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, a 17-year drought in the world of Alzheimer’s drugs ended with the FDA approval of Biogen’s Aduhlem (aducanumab). The controversy behind the FDA’s decision was considerable, but it doesn’t seem to be spooking drug developers who are now narrowing in on the degenerative brain disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, the approval of Aduhelm came after conflicting results from clinical trials. In </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/health/aducanumab-alzheimers-drug-fda-panel.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">November 2020 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">an independent FDA advisory board did not recommend that the agency endorse the drug, but in June, the agency approved the drug anyway via an Accelerated Approval Program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aduhelm is now the first novel treatment to address one underlying cause of Alzheimer’s – beta-amyloid plaques that accumulate in the brain. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drug received support from </span><a href="https://www.alz.org/news/2021/alzheimers-association-fda-approval-aducanumab"><span style="font-weight: 400;">patient and industry groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the FDA also </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fdas-decision-approve-new-treatment-alzheimers-disease"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the “need for treatment is urgent”, in a statement explaining the agency’s choice). Still, there have been a number of doctors who have expressed concern. One member of the expert committee that voted not to recommend the approval of Aduhelm back in November has </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/08/fda-expert-panel-resigns-alzheimers-approval/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resigned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the inconsistency of the science and highly public debate around the approval of Aduhelm doesn’t seem to have halted enthusiasm within the pharmaceutical industry. Rather, it may signal a new wave of additional treatments in the next few years, which will piggyback off of the approval of Aduhelm (however controversial that approval may be).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is great news for investors and for drug companies that are working towards new drugs,” says </span><a href="https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/staff/alison-sexton-ward-phd/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alison Ward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a research scientist at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically there have been a few factors that have made the development of a drug for Alzheimer’s an uphill battle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first, is a 17-year history of failure to bring a drug through clinical trials. Even Biogen’s clinical trials for Aduhelm were halted in 2019 because it wasn’t clear that they would reach their clinical endpoints (effectively, the target outcomes of the trial). In fact, Aduhlem was approved based on a “surrogate endpoint,” the decline of beta-amyloid, not the primary endpoint, cognitive function. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trials for Alzheimer’s drugs have also historically been expensive. A 2018 paper in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alzheimer’s and Dementia: Translational Research and Clinical Interventions </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a journal run by the Alzheimer’s Association)</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated that the cost of developing an Alzheimer’s drug was about </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235287371830026X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5.6 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By comparison, the mean investment needed to bring a new drug to market is about </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762311"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.3 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to analysis of SEC filings for companies that applied for FDA approval between 2009 and 2018 (though the median cost was about $985 million). Older estimates have put the costs of bringing a drug to market at </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235287371830026X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.8 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Alzheimer’s specifically, Phase 3 trials are still largely sponsored by industry, but over the past five years, trials sponsored solely by the industry have </span><a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trc2.12185"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decreased</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Government grants and funding via public-private partnerships have made up an i</span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-05-27/theres-been-a-shift-in-whos-funding-alzheimers-research"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ncreasing share</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of available funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin Tolar, the founder CEO of </span><a href="https://alzheon.com/medicines-alzheimers-disease/alzheon-management-team/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alzheon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, another company pursuing an oral treatment for Alzheimer’s (currently in a phase 3 clinical trial), says that attracting other forms of funding was a challenge. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was impossible to finance anything,” he says. “It was impossible to get Wall Street interested because everything was failing one after the other after the other.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He expects this recent approval of Aduhelm to change that outlook considerably. Already, we are seeing some increased interest in companies already in phase 3 clinical trials: After the FDA announcement, </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=eli+lilly+stock&amp;oq=eli+lilly+stock+&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i131i433l2j0l8.6233j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shares of Eli Lilly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also running a phase 3 clinical trial, </span><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-eli-lilly-stock-soared-today-2021-06-07"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surged by 10 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve had probably hundreds of discussions, of calls, from bankers, investors, collaborators, pharma, you name it,” Tolar says. “Alzheimer’s is open for business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With renewed interest and what appears like a pathway to approval at the FDA, the environment for the next generation of Alzheimer’s drugs seems to be ripening. Right now, there are about </span><a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results/map?recrs=adef&amp;cond=Alzheimer%27s+Disease&amp;phase=2&amp;map="><span style="font-weight: 400;">130</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> phase 3 clinical trials on Alzheimer’s drugs that are either completed, active or recruiting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tolar sees the FDA decision, based on imperfect data, as a “signal of urgency” to approve new treatments that are imminent arrivals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Ward pointed out in a </span><a href="https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/research/impacts-of-first-in-class-drug-approvals-on-future-in-class-innovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">white paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on in-class drug innovation, “follow on” drugs go on to become leaders in the industry, especially if they demonstrate better safety or efficacy than the drug that was first to market.  That, the paper argues, suggests drug approval may “pave the way” for more effective drugs in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Alzheimer’s, it might not be one drug that dominates, even as more get approved, she notes. Rather, a cadre of new, approved drugs may go on to compliment one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way that the medical community is thinking of AD [Alzheimer’s Disease] now is that it’s likely going to be a combination of drugs or a cocktail of drugs that comes together to have true success at delaying progression,” she says.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we’re looking to treat AD with a cocktail of drugs, history suggests it’s individually approved drugs that come together to make those drug cocktails.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are still some potential pitfalls for future drugs to consider. </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/30/if-the-fda-approves-biogens-alzheimers-treatment-i-wont-prescribe-it/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One argument is</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that with an approved drug available, it may be more difficult to recruit participants in clinical trials, slowing the pace of drug discovery. In that respect, Ward argues that this will ultimately be dwarfed by patients who will now look into a potential diagnosis for Alzheimer’s now that there’s something to treat it with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also the fact that Aduhelm’s costs are high (about </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/biogen-faces-tough-questions-over-56k-a-year-price-of-newly-approved-alzheimers-drug.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$56,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a year’s supply, the brunt of which will be </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/aduhelm-biogen-drug-price-medicare-44628fff-6564-453f-9e01-2b04e80ff8f2.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">borne by Medicare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and the data remains questionable. Those factors may push patients towards other drugs, even if they’re in clinical trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, there is the question of how well Aduhelm actually performs during the critical followup study mandated by the FDA as a condition of the drug’s approval. Whether Aduhelm can truly slow cognitive decline, as well as help address levels of beta-amyloid from the brain, remains questionable based on current data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Tolar doesn’t see the results of that study as particularly relevant because the industry will have moved on. Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos has said it may not share results of this trial for as many as </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/first-on-cnbc-cnbc-transcript-biogen-ceo-michel-vounatsos-speaks-with-cnbcs-power-lunch-today.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nine years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though he noted the company would try to deliver data sooner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “There will be better drugs by then,” Tolar predicts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tolar’s phase 3 clinical trial just began dosing this week, and is scheduled to </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04770220"><span style="font-weight: 400;">end by 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biogen and Esai will likely </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">also </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have another drug ready for evaluation by then, as two phase 3 clinical trials for another beta-amyloid antibody treatment called lecanemab are scheduled for completion </span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03887455?term=ban2401&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2024</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04468659?term=ban2401&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=4"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2027</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The signal sent by Monday’s approval may be a pathway for future drugs, rather than an end itself. The data is imperfect, the costs high, and the controversy considerable, but the band-aid has been ripped off. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While electric vertical take-off and landing passenger aircraft startup Joby Aviation is targeting North America for its initial commercial launch, founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt expects the company to have an early presence in Asia and Europe as well.</p>
<p>Bevirt, who joined the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021?promo=leftrail&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> on June 9, didn&#8217;t give away the first location; although recent announcements suggest it is narrowed down to Los Angeles, Miami, New York and the San Francisco Bay Area. But he did weigh in on what those first cities will look like.</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine that we will have early markets in each of the three regions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our initial launch market will be in North America just for proximity to the nexus of where most of our team is currently. But there are incredible opportunities and cities around the world and we want to provide as much benefit to as many people as quickly as we possibly can. And so that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re so focused on scaling manufacturing.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Joby Aviation<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> is expected to </span>begin construction on a 450,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, designed in conjunction with Toyota, later this year. The company has completed a pilot manufacturing facility already.</p>
<p>Joby, once a secretive startup, has had a far more public six months of late. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/joby-aviation-takes-flight-into-the-public-markets-via-a-spac-merger/">reached a deal to</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> merge with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners, formed by</span> well-known investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Michael Thompson and Zynga founder Mark Pincus. Hoffman also joined Bevirt at the TC Sessions: Mobility event.</p>
<p>Prior to its SPAC deal, Joby had gained attention and investors over the years as it developed its eVTOL. Toyota became an important backer and partner, leading a $620 million Series C round of funding in January 2020. Nearly a year later, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/">Joby acquired Uber’s air taxi moonshot Elevate</a> as part of a complex deal.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Uber sells air taxi business Elevate to Joby Aviation, shedding its last moonshot&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/uber-sells-air-taxi-business-elevate-to-joby-aviation-shedding-its-last-moonshot/embed/#?secret=jjAOTEGTWv" data-secret="jjAOTEGTWv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, Joby is focused on certification, which it has been working on with the FAA since 2018, as well manufacturing its eVTOL aircraft. The company is also starting to put the pieces together for how and where it will operate. And that&#8217;s adding to its size. In the past year, Joby has doubled its workforce, which now sits at about 800.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Joby Aviation announced a partnership with REEF Technology, one of the country&#8217;s largest parking garage operators, and real estate acquisition company Neighborhood Property Group to build out its network of vertiports, with an initial focus on Los Angeles, Miami, New York and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">When 2024 arrives, Bevirt anticipates launching in one to two cities in that first year of operation. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We do want to provide sufficient depth of coverage that consumers get to experience the transformative experience,&#8221; Bevirt said. &#8220;There have been cases where if a new service launches, and there&#8217;s not enough supply, consumers can be frustrated, right. And so we want to make sure we can, that we can really service, at least a portion of the demand and provide a really gratifying experience to our customers. I think that that&#8217;s the piece that we really care about as a company, is making customers into raving fans.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the upcoming release of<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/"> iOS 15</a> for Apple mobile devices, Apple&#8217;s built-in search feature known as Spotlight will become a lot more functional. In what may be one of its bigger updates since it <a href="https://tidbits.com/2015/09/16/explaining-siri-suggestions-and-spotlight-search-in-ios-9/">introduced</a> <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210658">Siri Suggestions</a>, the new version of Spotlight is becoming an alternative to Google for several key queries, including web images and information about actors, musicians, TV shows and movies. It will also now be able to search across your photo library, deliver richer results for contacts, and connect you more directly with apps and the information they contain. It even allows you to install apps from the App Store without leaving Spotlight itself.</p>
<p>Spotlight is also more accessible than ever before.</p>
<p>Years ago, Spotlight moved from its location to the left of the Home screen to become available with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/18/a-few-tricks-all-the-new-ios-7-users-should-know/">swipe down in the middle of any screen</a> in iOS 7, which helped grow user adoption. Now, it&#8217;s available with the same swipe down gesture on the iPhone&#8217;s Lock Screen, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can access spotlight from the lock screen <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iOS15?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#iOS15</a> (locked or unlocked) <a href="https://t.co/rVC1DqvBkA">pic.twitter.com/rVC1DqvBkA</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Alex Fife (@alextfife) <a href="https://twitter.com/alextfife/status/1402682130979823616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple showed off a few of Spotlight&#8217;s improvements during its keynote address at its Worldwide Developer Conference, including the search feature&#8217;s new cards for looking up information on actors, movies and shows, as well as musicians. This change alone could redirect a good portion of web searches away from Google or dedicated apps like IMDb.</p>
<p>For years, Google has been offering quick access to common searches through its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Knowledge_Graph">Knowledge Graph</a>, a knowledge base that allows it to gather information from across sources and then use that to add informational panels above and the side of its standard search results. Panels on actors, musicians, shows and movies are available as part of that effort.</p>
<p>But now, iPhone users can just pull up this info on their home screen.</p>
<p>The new cards include more than the typical Wikipedia bio and background information you may expect &#8212; they also showcase links to where you can listen or watch content from the artist or actor or movie or show in question. They include news articles, social media links, official websites, and even direct you to where the searched person or topic may be found inside your own apps. (E.g. a search for &#8220;Billie Eilish&#8221; may direct you to her tour tickets inside SeatGeek, or a podcast where she&#8217;s a guest).</p>

<p><div id="attachment_2164070" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164070" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164070" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="571" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?resize=150,126 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?resize=300,252 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?resize=768,645 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?resize=680,571 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9609.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164070" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> iOS 15 screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Your personal searches have been upgraded with richer results, too, in iOS 15.</p>
<p>When you search for a contact, you&#8217;ll be taken to a card that does more than show their name and how to reach them. You&#8217;ll also see their current status (thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-refines-ios-15-notifications-with-focus-summary-features/">another iOS 15 feature</a>), as well as their location from FindMy, your recent conversations on Messages, your shared photos, calendar appointments, emails, notes, and files. It&#8217;s almost like a personal CRM system.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164045" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164045" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164045" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg 3354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=1536,858 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1144 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.25-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164045" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Personal photo searches have also been improved. Spotlight now uses Siri intelligence to allow you to search your photos by the people, scenes, elements in your photos, as well as by location. And it&#8217;s able to leverage the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-live-text-lets-you-interact-with-text-in-your-photos/">new Live Text feature in iOS 15</a> to find the text in your photos to return relevant results.</p>
<p>This could make it easier to pull up photos where you&#8217;ve screenshot a recipe, a store receipt, or even a handwritten note, Apple said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164046" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164046" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2164046" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="381" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg 3330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=1536,860 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1146 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-09-at-3.11.16-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164046" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>A couple of features related to Spotlight&#8217;s integration with apps weren&#8217;t mentioned during the keynote.</p>
<p>Spotlight will now display action buttons on the Maps results for businesses that will prompt users to engage with that business&#8217;s app. In this case, the feature is leveraging <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/">App Clips</a>, which are small parts of a developer&#8217;s app that let you quickly perform a task even without downloading or installing the app in question. For example, from Spotlight you may be prompted to pull up a restaurant&#8217;s menu, buy tickets, make an appointment, order takeout, join a waitlist, see showtimes, pay for parking, check prices and more.</p>
<p>The feature will require the business to support App Clips in order to work.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164054" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164054" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2164054" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/IMG_9606.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164054" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> iOS 15 screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>Another under-the-radar change &#8212; but a significant one &#8212; is the new ability to install apps from the App Store directly from Spotlight.</p>
<p>This could prompt more app installs, as it reduces the steps from a search to a download, and makes querying the App Store more broadly available across the operating system.</p>
<p>Developers can additionally choose to insert a few lines of code to their app to make data from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10098/">app discoverable within Spotlight</a> and customize how it&#8217;s presented to users. This means Spotlight can work as a tool for searching content from inside apps &#8212; another way Apple is redirecting users away from traditional web searches in favor of apps.</p>
<p>However, unlike Google&#8217;s search engine, which relies on crawlers that browse the web to index the data it contains, Spotlight&#8217;s in-app search requires developer adoption.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s clear Apple sees Spotlight as a potential rival to web search engines, including Google&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spotlight is the universal place to start <em>all</em> your searches,&#8221; said Apple SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi during the keynote event.</p>
<p>Spotlight, of course, can&#8217;t handle &#8220;all&#8221; your searches just yet, but it appears to be steadily working towards that goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Machine learning models have already mastered Chess, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/24/alphago-beats-planets-best-human-go-player-ke-jie/">Go</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/deepminds-agent57-ai-agent-can-best-human-players-across-a-suite-of-57-atari-games/">Atari games</a> and more, but in order for it to ascend to the next level, researchers at Facebook intend for AI to <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/launching-the-nethack-challenge-at-neurips-2021/">take on a different kind of game</a>: the notoriously difficult and infinitely complex NetHack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to construct what we think is <a href="https://nethackchallenge.com/">the most accessible &#8216;grand challenge&#8217;</a> with this game. It won&#8217;t <em>solve</em> AI, but it will unlock pathways towards <em>better</em> AI,&#8221; said Facebook AI Research&#8217;s Edward Grefenstette. &#8220;Games are a good domain to find our assumptions about what makes machines intelligent and break them.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may not be familiar with NetHack, but it&#8217;s one of the most influential games of all time. You&#8217;re an adventurer in a fantasy world, delving through the increasingly dangerous depths of a dungeon that&#8217;s different every time. You must battle monsters, navigate traps and other hazards, and meanwhile stay on good terms with your god. It&#8217;s the first &#8220;roguelike&#8221; (after Rogue, its immediate and much simpler predecessor) and arguably still the best — almost certainly the hardest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(It&#8217;s free, by the way, and you can <a href="http://nethack.org/">download and play it on nearly any platform.</a>)</p>
<p>Its simple ASCII graphics, using a g for a goblin, an @ for the player, lines and dots for the level&#8217;s architecture, and so on, belie its incredible complexity. Because Nethack, which made its debut in 1987, has been under active development ever since, with its shifting team of developers expanding its roster of objects and creatures, rules, and the countless, countless interactions between them all.</p>
<p>And this is part of what makes NetHack such a difficult and interesting challenge for AI: It&#8217;s so open-ended. Not only is the world different every time, but every object and creature can interact in new ways, most of them hand-coded over decades to cover every possible player choice.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164028" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NetHack_level2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164028" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2164028" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NetHack_level2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="272" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NetHack_level2.jpg 1264w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NetHack_level2.jpg?resize=150,40 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NetHack_level2.jpg?resize=300,80 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NetHack_level2.jpg?resize=768,204 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NetHack_level2.jpg?resize=680,181 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NetHack_level2.jpg?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2164028" class="wp-caption-text">NetHack with a tile-based graphics update &#8211; all the information is still available via text.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Atari, Dota 2, StarCraft 2&#8230; the solutions we&#8217;ve had to make progress there are very interesting. NetHack just presents different challenges. You have to rely on human knowledge to play the game as a human,&#8221; said Grefenstette.</p>
<p>In these other games, there&#8217;s a more or less obvious strategy to winning. Of course it&#8217;s more complex in a game like Dota 2 than in an Atari 800 game, but the idea is the same — there are pieces the player controls, a game board of environment, and win conditions to pursue. That&#8217;s kind of the case in NetHack, but it&#8217;s weirder than that. For one thing, the game is different every time, and not just in the details.</p>
<p>&#8220;New dungeon, new world, new monsters and items, you don&#8217;t have a save point. If you make a mistake and die you don&#8217;t get a second shot. It&#8217;s a bit like real life,&#8221; said Grefenstette. &#8220;You have to learn from mistakes and come to new situations armed with that knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drinking a corrosive potion is a bad idea, of course, but what about throwing it at a monster? Coating your weapon with it? Pouring it on the lock of a treasure chest? Diluting it with water? We have intuitive ideas about these actions, but a game-playing AI doesn&#8217;t think the way we do.</p>
<p>The depth and complexity of the systems in NetHack are difficult to explain, but that diversity and difficulty make the game a perfect candidate for a competition, according to Grefenstette. &#8220;You have to rely on human knowledge to play the game,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>People have been designing bots to play NetHack for many years that rely not on neural networks but decision trees as complex as the game itself. The team at Facebook Research hopes to engender a new approach by building a training environment that people can test machine learning-based game-playing algorithms on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164029" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nethack-logic.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164029" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2164029" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nethack-logic.png" alt="" width="1024" height="336" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nethack-logic.png 1129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nethack-logic.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nethack-logic.png?resize=300,99 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nethack-logic.png?resize=768,252 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nethack-logic.png?resize=680,223 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nethack-logic.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2164029" class="wp-caption-text">NetHack screens with labels showing what the AI is aware of.</p></div></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/nle">NetHack Learning Environment</a> was actually put together last year, but the NetHack Challenge is only just now getting started. The NLE is basically a version of the game embedded in a dedicated computing environment that lets an AI interact with it through text commands (directions, actions like attack or quaff)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tempting target for ambitious AI designers. While games like StarCraft 2 may enjoy a higher profile in some ways, NetHack is legendary and the idea of building a model on completely different lines from those used to dominate other games is an interesting challenge.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also, as Grefenstette explained, a more accessible one than many in the past. If you wanted to build an AI for StarCraft 2, you needed a lot of computing power available to run visual recognition engines on the imagery from the game. But in this case the entire game is transmitted via text, making it extremely efficient to work with. It can be played thousands of times faster than any human could with even the most basic computing setup. That leaves the challenge wide open to individuals and groups who don&#8217;t have access to the kind of high-power setups necessary to power other machine learning methods.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to create a research environment that had a lot of challenges for the AI community, but not restrict it to only large academic labs,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For the next few months, NLE will be available for people to test on, and competitors can basically build their bot or AI by whatever means they choose. But when the competition itself starts in earnest on October 15, they&#8217;ll be limited to interacting with the game in its controlled environment through standard commands — no special access, no inspecting RAM, etc.</p>
<p>The goal of the competition will be to complete the game, and the Facebook team will track how many times the agent &#8220;ascends,&#8221; as it&#8217;s called in NetHack, in a set amount of time. But &#8220;we&#8217;re assuming this is going to be zero for everyone,&#8221; Grefenstette admitted. After all, this is one of the hardest games ever made, and even humans who have played it for years have trouble winning even once in a lifetime, let alone several times in a row. There will be other scoring metrics to judge winners in a number of categories.</p>
<p>The hope is that this challenge provides the seed of a new approach to AI, one that more fundamentally resembles actual human thinking. Shortcuts, trial and error, score-hacking, and zerging won&#8217;t work here — the agent needs to learn systems of logic and apply them flexibly and intelligently, or die horribly at the hands of an enraged centaur or owlbear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After making investments in 57 startups together, Superhuman CEO Rahul Vohra and Eventjoy founder Todd Goldberg are back at it with a new $24 million fund and big ambitions amid a venture capital renaissance with fast-moving deals a plenty.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.toddandrahulangelfund.com/">Todd and Rahul&#8217;s Angel Fund</a>&#8221; announced their first $7.3 million fund just weeks before the pandemic hit stateside last year and they were soon left with more access to deals than they had funding to support; they went on raise $3.5 million in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/angellist-pioneers-rolling-vc-funds-in-pivot-to-saas/">rolling fund</a> designed around making investments in later stage deals beyond Seed and Series A rounds.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We closed right before Covid hit and we had one plan but then everything accelerated,&#8221; Goldberg tells TechCrunch. &#8220;A lot of our companies started raising additional rounds.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With their latest raise, Vohra and Goldberg are looking to maintain their wide outlook with a single fund, saying they plan to invest three-quarters of the fund in early stage deals while saving a quarter of the $24 million for later stage opportunities. Still, the duo know they likely could&#8217;ve chosen to raise more.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of our peers were scaling up into much larger funds,&#8221; Vohra says. &#8220;For us, we wanted to stay small and collaborative.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the firm&#8217;s investments from their first fund include NBA Top Shot creator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/nba-top-shot-maker-dapper-labs-is-now-worth-2-6-billion-thanks-to-half-of-hollywood-the-nba-and-michael-jordan/">Dapper Labs</a>, open source Firebase alternative <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/supabase-raises-6m-for-its-open-source-firebase-alternative/">Supabase</a>, D2C liquor brand <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/haus-raises-4-5-million-to-replace-your-wine-club-membership/">Haus</a>, alternative asset platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sports-trading-card-platform-alt-launches-with-31-million-in-funding-and-plenty-of-market-hype/">Alt</a>, biowearable maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/levels-raises-12m-from-a16z-and-others-to-bring-its-biowearable-to-market/">Levels</a> and location analytics startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/location-data-analytics-startup-placer-ai-raises-50m-series-b/">Placer</a>. Their biggest hit was an early investment in audio chat app Clubhouse before Andreessen Horowitz led its buzzy seed round at a $100 million valuation. Clubhouse most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">raised at $4 billion</a>.</p>

<p>The pair say they&#8217;ve learned a ton through the past year of navigating increasingly competitive rounds and that fighting for those deals has helped the duo hone how they market themselves to founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never want to be a passive check,&#8221; Goldberg says. &#8220;We do three things: help companies find product/market fit, we help them super-charge distribution.. and we help them find the best investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>A big part of the firm&#8217;s appeal to founders has been the &#8220;operator&#8221; status of its founders. Goldberg&#8217;s startup Eventjoy was acquired by Ticketmaster and Vohra&#8217;s Rapportive was bought by Linkedin while his current startup Superhuman has maintained buzz for its premium email service and has raised $33 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and First Round Capital.</p>
<p>Their new has an unusual LP base that&#8217;s made up of over 110 entrepreneurs and investors, including 40 founders that Vohra and Goldberg have previously backed themselves. Backers of their second fund include Plaid&#8217;s William Hockey, Behance&#8217;s Scott Belsky, Haus&#8217;s Helena Price Hambrecht, Lattice&#8217;s Jack Altman and Loom&#8217;s Shahed Khan.</p>

			The logistics of setting up a startup should be simple, because over the long run, complicated equity setups and cap tables cost more money in legal fees and administration time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>My company, Pulley, has helped more than a thousand founders build their cap table and equity structure.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a tactical guide to get your startup running in just four days.</p>
<h2>Day 1: Incorporate</h2>
<p>It is now standard to incorporate your company at the seed stage itself. In the U.S., startups incorporate as Delaware C Corporations with 10 million authorized shares. This is the standard setup when you use services like Stripe Atlas or Clerky.</p>
<p>Post incorporation, you need to answer a few questions on how to grant equity to founders and future employees.</p>
<p>First, you should determine how you want to split the equity between the founders. There is no standard for doing so — some founders split shares equally, while others do 49/51 splits for control. Some founders even may have an 80/20 equity split because one founder spent an extra year on the idea.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a good equity split is one that all founders find fair. If you can&#8217;t agree on a structure, you should have a deeper discussion on whether this is the right team to work with for the next decade or more.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every time there is a rumor of a Google algorithm update, a general panic ripples through the SEO community. There is a collective holding of breath while the numbers are analyzed and then a sigh of relief (hopefully) when they survive the algorithm update unscathed.</p>
<p>After the update is released, and especially if it is confirmed by Google, a slew of articles and pundit analyses attempt to dissect what Google changed and how to win in the new paradigm.</p>
<p>I believe all this angst is entirely misplaced.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Google algorithm is made out to be some sort of mystical secret recipe cooked up in a lab designed to simultaneously rob and reward sites at the whims of a magical, all-knowing wizard. In this outdated schema, the goal of every SEO and webmaster is to dupe this wizard and come out on the winning side of every update.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Join us on Thursday, June 10 at 12:30 p.m. PDT/3:30 p.m. EDT for <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1MnxnlQMVajGO">a Twitter Spaces chat</a> with author Eli Schwartz.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We&#8217;ll discuss SEO and growth marketing, so bring your questions!</p>
<hr />
<p>This idea is rooted in a fundamental misunderstanding of what happens in a Google algorithm update — and a fundamental misunderstanding of Google. The reality is, algorithms are not your enemy. They are designed to help create a better, more accurate user experience. Here are a few pieces of perspective that should help reframe your relationship with algorithms.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Google’s algorithms are extensive and complex software programs that constantly need to be updated based on real scenarios.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Google is just trying to help</h2>
<p>First, let’s establish this: Google is only trying to help. The company wants to ensure a pleasurable, high-quality user experience for the searcher. Nothing more, nothing less. It is not a wizard, and its system is not meant to rob and reward sites arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Keep that in mind as we continue.</p>
<p>Google’s algorithms are extensive and complex software programs that constantly need to be updated based on real scenarios. Otherwise, they would be totally arbitrary. Just as bugs are reported and fixed in a software program, search engines must discover what’s not working and create solutions.</p>
<p>Google, like any other software company, releases updates with big leaps forward to its products and services. However, in Google’s case, they are called “major algorithm updates” instead of just product updates.</p>
<p>You are now armed with the knowledge of exactly what a Google algorithm update is. Is it not, then, gratifying to know there is never a reason to panic?</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">Respond to our survey</a> and help us find the best startup growth marketers!</p>
<hr />
<h2>A drop in search traffic isn’t necessarily hurting you</h2>
<p>If a site experiences a drop in search traffic after a major algorithm update, it is rarely because the entire site was targeted. Typically, while one collection of URLs may be demoted in search rankings, other pages likely improved.</p>
<p>Seeing the improved pages requires taking a deep dive into Google Search Console to drill into which URLs saw drops in traffic and which witnessed gains. While a site can certainly see a steep drop off after an update, it is usually because they had more losers than winners.</p>
<p>Any drop is most definitely not because the algorithm punished the site.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XELFua4lwF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/even-startups-on-tight-budgets-can-maximize-their-marketing-impact/">Even startups on tight budgets can maximize their marketing impact</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Even startups on tight budgets can maximize their marketing impact&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/even-startups-on-tight-budgets-can-maximize-their-marketing-impact/embed/#?secret=XELFua4lwF" data-secret="XELFua4lwF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>If you see a drop, in many cases, your site might not have even lost real traffic; often, the losses represent only lost impressions already not converting into clicks. With a recent update, Google removed the organic listing of sites that had a featured snippet ranking. I saw steep drops in impressions, but the clicks were virtually unchanged. Gather and study your granular data for a clearer rendering of information rather than assuming the site has become a winner or loser after an update.</p>
<h2>Focus on a great user experience, just like Google</h2>
<p>Websites that focus on providing an amazing and high-quality experience for users shouldn’t fear algorithm updates. In fact, updates can provide the needed impetus to excel. The only websites that have something to fear are those that should not have had high search visibility in the first place because of a poor user experience.</p>
<p>If your website provides a great experience for users, updates are actually likely to help you because they winnow those poorer quality sites out of the running.</p>
<p>If you focus on a good user experience, there will be pages that may lose some traffic in algorithm updates, but in aggregate, the site will typically gain traffic in most scenarios. Digging into the granular data of what changed will likely support the idea that websites do not suffer or benefit from algorithm updates &#8212; only specific URLs do.</p>
<h2>Updates are a fact of search life</h2>
<p>Google will, and should, continuously update its algorithms. Google’s primary motivation is to have an evolving product that will continue to please and retain its users.</p>
<p>Consider that if Google leaves its algorithm alone, it risks being overrun by spammers that take advantage of loopholes. A search function that provides too many spammy results will soon go the way of AOL, Excite, Yahoo and every other search engine that is functionally no longer in existence. Google stays relevant by updating algorithms.</p>
<p>Updates are a part of search life.</p>
<h2>Chase the user, not the algorithm</h2>
<p>Instead of chasing the algorithm, which will inevitably change, I believe that every website that relies on organic search should train its focus somewhere more important: on the user experience.</p>
<p>The user is the ultimate customer of search. If your site serves the user, it will be immunized from algorithm updates designed to protect the search experience. There is no algorithm wizard — only SEO masters who have figured out how to apply best processes, best procedures and actions for your website.</p>
<p>Algorithms and updates have only one purpose: help a user find exactly what they seek. Period. If you are helpful to the user, you have nothing to fear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To succeed, every startup needs to find and keep more users, but our attention spans get shorter every year. Eventually, your company will hire someone who&#8217;s up to speed with the latest problems and solutions in growth.</p>
<p>In the meantime, TechCrunch is here to help.</p>
<p>We’re asking founders to <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">share a brief recommendation</a> for talented growth marketers who have made a difference for them. We’ll use your responses to feature the best growth experts to our audience through our articles, events, and soon, a free database list.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whether you worked with a great individual or an agency, we want to know who helped you figure out great solutions in SEO, social media, content marketing, analytics and other growth mechanisms.</p>
<p>There are a million marketers out there, most of whom have never worked with serious startups before. The types of people we want to spotlight will be proven experts in using product management, engineering, data and marketing techniques specifically for ambitious companies like yours.</p>
<p>If you are a growth marketer, we encourage you to share this survey with your clients (but completely discourage self-recommendations).</p>
<p>Founders and other startup leaders, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">please fill out this nomination form</a>, and be on the lookout for more from top marketers in the next few weeks (with a few more things in store). If you had filled out our email marketing survey from a few weeks ago, thank you! We’re putting your responses to work as part of this project already.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today launched the second beta of Android 12. The first beta, which launched at Google&#8217;s I/O conference in May, introduced us to the first glimpses of Google&#8217;s new &#8220;Material You&#8221; design system, though many of the promised new features and design tweaks weren&#8217;t part of this first beta yet. With this new beta, Google is bringing more of these to its testers (you can sign up for the beta <a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">here</a>), including its new privacy dashboard that makes it easier for users to see which apps recently used a phone&#8217;s microphone, camera and location.</p>
<p>Other new features available in the beta are the addition of microphone and camera indicators that show users if an app is using those, as well as new Quick Setting toggles to disable app access to them. When access is toggled off, apps will receive blank audio and camera feeds. Related to this, Google is also bringing a clipboard read notification to Android that shows readers when an app is reading from the clipboard.</p>

<p>Also new in beta 2 is a new Internet Panel that makes it easier for you to switch between internet providers, Wi-Fi networks, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2163859" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2163859" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2163859" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1026" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png 2044w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=768,770 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=1533,1536 1533w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Untitled.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2163859" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>With this release, Google is now one release away from reaching platform stability in August. As the company notes, now would be a good time for developers to finish their compatibility testing and release compatible versions of their apps, SDK and libraries. Given the current monthly release cadence, we&#8217;ll likely see a final release of Android 12 in September.</p>

<p>Like before, you&#8217;ll need a compatible device to try out the beta. Unlike with some the earlier preview releases, this list includes a lot of non-Google devices, with Sharp joining the beta program today, for example. You can find a full list of supported devices &#8212; and instructions for how to get started on non-Google devices &#8212; <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/devices">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I started a tech company about two years ago, and ever since I’ve dreamed of expanding my company in the United States. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I would love to have a green card. Someone mentioned that I should apply for a diversity green card. Would you please provide me with more details about it and how to apply?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Technical in Tanzania</strong></p>
<p>Dear Technical,</p>
<p>As a startup founder from Tanzania, you have several immigration options available to you, including the Diversity Immigrant Visa (green card) Program.</p>
<p>My law partner, Anita Koumriqian, and I recently discussed the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Diversity-Visa/DV-Instructions-Translations/DV-2022-Instructions-Translations/DV-2022-Instructions-and-FAQs_English.pdf">Diversity Immigrant Visa Program</a> (DV Program) on a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/074-diversity-immigrant-visa-program/">podcast episode</a>. Take a listen for how to apply and tips for applying. Each year, the U.S. Department of State, which oversees the DV Program, reserves 50,000 green cards for individuals born in countries that have low rates of immigration to the United States. The State Department publishes instructions each year, which includes the countries whose natives are eligible to register for the annual diversity lottery. Here is <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Diversity-Visa/DV-Instructions-Translations/DV-2022-Instructions-Translations/DV-2022-Instructions-and-FAQs_English.pdf">the latest version</a>.</p>
<h2>How does the diversity lottery work?</h2>
<p>You must register online in the fall — usually from early October through early November — for the annual random lottery by completing the Electronic Diversity Visa Entry Form (DS-5501). There is no cost to register for the lottery, but be aware that you will be automatically disqualified if you register yourself more than once, and incomplete forms will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Once you complete the online registration form, you will get a confirmation number. Do not lose this number! It is the only way to access the online system that will tell you whether you were selected in the lottery and are eligible to submit a green card application. In May, registrants can log into the online system to find out whether they’ve been selected. No notification will be sent by email or snail mail; checking online by entering your confirmation code is the only way to find out. After you enter your confirmation code online, you will receive a diversity visa number, which you will use to determine when you can file your green card application.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German electric air mobility company Lilium has partnered with aerospace manufacturer Honeywell to develop the electronics and mechanical systems for the 7-seater Lilium Jet, the company’s debut eVTOL.</p>
<p>Honeywell will supply its compact fly-by-wire system, a flight control component that will be responsible for controlling all of the Jet’s moving parts, and the aircraft&#8217;s avionics system. eVTOL company Vertical Aerospace is also using Honeywell’s compact fly-by-wire system in its aircraft, but the avionics system for the version Lilium will be using was designed to suit the specific technical requirements of the Lilium Jet.</p>
<p>Honeywell is a giant in the aerospace manufacturing industry, and one of the first to create a dedicated Urban Air Mobility team. The company has also become an investor in Lilium by participating in the common stock private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering announced in connection with Lilium’s SPAC merger with Qell Acquisiton Corp.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two companies have been in discussion and collaboration since February 2019, Lilium’s chief program officer Yves Yemsi told TechCrunch. He said Lilium identified core competencies it wanted to keep in-house — the design and assembly of the propulsion and battery systems and the final aircraft assembly, for example — and will partner with experienced suppliers for other parts of the aircraft.</p>
<p>“Collaborating with experts, aerospace partners, is a deliberate choice for us,” he said. “It will help us to reduce our time to market and still be safe.”</p>
<p>A key advantage of the partnership is how it will help the certification process, Yemsi explained. Some of Honeywell&#8217;s components have achieved a Technical Standard Order (TSO), which is a minimum performance standard recognized by the FAA. Using TSO-authorized components could help save time in the certification process.</p>
<p>Lilium already has teams of people working on getting Design Production Approval and Production Organization Approval, two types of approvals issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) that essentially verify the company is able to bring a product to market. These approvals complement the type certification that Lilium aircraft (and all other eVTOL) must achieve with both the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the EASA before the company can start commercial operations.</p>
<p>The partnership with Honeywell, an established aerospace manufacturer, marks a major point of progress for Lilium. The next step after Honeywell starts delivering components is to develop and test the aircraft in a system integration laboratory, which tests on the ground that the avionics and electronic systems, Yemsi said.</p>
<p>“Now the hard work begins,” he said.</p>

<p>The round was led by WestCap. Existing investors were joined by 01 Advisors and Gary Vaynerchuk&#8217;s VaynerFund in the Series B funding. The startup has raised a whopping $120 million to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has been building a title called Blankos Block Party that seems to be Fall Guys meets Roblox meets Funko Pop. The PC game capitalizes on a number of big social gaming trends around user-created content, while adding in a marketplace where users can buy avatar figures and accessories crafted by a variety of artists and designers that Mythical has partnered with. Users can buy or sell the limited run or open edition items through their marketplace. Unlike some other NFT platforms, the goods live on a private blockchain so they can&#8217;t be re-sold on public marketplace platforms like OpenSea.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NFT marketplace OpenSea raises $23 million from a16z&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/embed/#?secret=rbte61BZ00" data-secret="rbte61BZ00" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mythical Games is part of a growing movement to bring blockchain-based game mechanics mainstream while leaving behind elements of crypto platforms that are seen as less ready for primetime. Users can purchase avatars on the platform with cryptocurrency through BitPay but they can also pay with a credit card. Users don&#8217;t need to walk through the mechanics of setting up a wallet or writing down a seed phrase either.</p>
<p>While the company has big hopes for Blankos as it onboards more users, the bigger investor opportunity is likely in the game engine that the team is building. The startup&#8217;s &#8220;Mythical Economic Engine&#8221; is being designed to help budding game builders create NFT-based marketplaces that won&#8217;t get them in any regulatory trouble, marrying compliance across geographies and tools that help creators comply with anti-money laundering laws and know-your-customer frameworks.</p>
<p>&#8220;With any new market like [NFTs], it goes through all these different cycles,&#8221; Mythical Games CEO John Linden tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We think this will actually change gaming for the long haul. The more we talk to game studios, we’re finding more and more potential use cases.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After co-founding Insomnia Consulting, Stacey Abrams and Lara O’Connor Hodgson started Nourish to address a personal problem.</p>
<p>“We were at a meeting, I think for one of my campaigns,” explains Abrams, the Georgia-based lawyer and politician whose voting rights work became a focal point for the country in 2020. “[O’Connor Hodgson] needed to put together a baby bottle and had to trust the waiter to take the bottle back and wash it. She said, ‘I just wish there was a Dasani for babies.’ ”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2163871" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="81" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png?resize=150,40 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png?resize=300,81 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Now-logo.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Ultimately, however, Nourish ran into an issue. The company was a victim of its own successes, to hear Abrams describe it &#8212; or, more accurately, a victim of a system that didn’t provide it the right tools to grow. A problem with invoicing ultimately stopped the childcare in its tracks. But it was precisely those failings that planted the seed for their next company, the simply named Now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We started looking for a loan. All we needed was the money to meet the order. This was during the credit crunch, and we could not get it,” Abrams tells TechCrunch. “We went from bank to credit union to factoring, and every time we got near the end, the credit model changed and we got kicked out of the program. Finally, unfortunately, we had to let our business die. We grew to death. We got too big to meet the needs and didn’t have a solution.”</p>
<p>Abrams and O’Connor Hodgson founded Now in 2010 to provide small businesses a quicker method for getting invoices paid. When a business submits an invoice through NowAccount, the service pays 100% of the invoice, minus a 3% merchant fee.</p>
<p>“We sell bonds in the capital market, just like American Express does,” O’Connor Hodgson explains. “We have very low-cost capital that we’re able to give that small business their revenue immediately. And then we’ve built a system that allows us to manage the cost and risk of that, because we’re going to then wait 30+ days to get paid.”</p>
<p>Today the Georgia-based company announced that it has raised $9.5 million in Series A funding. The round, led by Virgo Investment Group and featuring Cresset Capital Partners, will be used to help scale Now’s offerings. It comes as the pandemic has put even more of a strain on invoices for many companies. O’Connor Hodgson says the average wait time for invoice payment expanded from around 50 days to between 70-80.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have served over 1,000 small businesses and we have processed over $700 million in transactions,&#8221; says O’Connor Hodgson. &#8220;So that’s $700 million of their capital that they have received sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus far, Now&#8217;s growth has largely been a product of word of mouth. The new influx of funding will go, in part, to market and advertising to get the product in front of more small businesses.</p>
<p>“When you&#8217;re a small business and someone tells you we have a solution to a problem that no one has been willing to solve, we sound like magic,” says Abrams. “And what we want people to understand and a big part of our scaling challenge has been, you have to experience it to believe it. And getting companies to understand that this actually does work the way we say that it does actually benefit you in the way we imagine, and that it works.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TechCrunch Disrupt</a> has a long history of bringing leading venture capitalists to the stage to yammer about their industry. Our impending <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TC Disrupt conference happening on September 21-23</a> is no different. This time around one of our investor guests is <a href="https://twitter.com/ammathew?lang=en">Arun Mathew</a> of <a href="https://accel.com/">Accel</a>, a venture capitalist that you might recall from his recent participation in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/webflow-raises-140m-pushing-its-valuation-to-2-1-billion/">Webflow&#8217;s huge $140 million Series B</a>.</p>
<p>But we aren&#8217;t merely asking Mathew out to the event to chat low-code, or SaaS, or simply current intra-venture capital investing dynamics. Instead, he&#8217;ll be taking part in our panel on alternative financing (alt-finance) with a few folks that aren&#8217;t venture capitalists, but still deploy capital into startups.</p>
<p>Having an Accel partner take part in the panel makes good sense, as the venture firm has an interesting way of approaching bootstrapped companies. Namely that it is willing to show up to pretty large companies and write huge checks. That&#8217;s how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/12/qualtrics-waits-on-that-ipo-raises-180-million-at-a-2-5-billion-valuation-instead/">Accel got into Qualtrics</a>, for example, a deal that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/11/sap-agrees-to-buy-qualtrics-for-8b-in-cash-just-before-the-survey-software-companys-ipo/">worked out pretty well</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Accel invests <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel/recent_investments">from seed through super-late stage</a>, making Mathew the perfect person to bring the venture perspective to the conversation.</p>
<p>The chat should hit on revenue-based financing, other more exotic forms of alt-finance and where the venture world may see capital partnerships, and funding rivalries. Our goal won&#8217;t be to incite an argument, but instead to unfold the private capital markets in a manner that helps fans of traditional VC &#8212; if there is still such a thing in today&#8217;s Tiger Global-led world &#8212; and believers in newer methods of capital deployment learn from each other. And so that founders can carve the most reasonable path for themselves as they seek to grow their businesses.</p>
<p>All told it should be a bop and I will see you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virgin Orbit is getting ready to launch its next mission to space, with a <a href="https://www.virgin.com/about-virgin/latest/virgin-orbits-reveals-launch-window-for-next-mission-to-space">target window at the end of this month</a>. This will be the first time Virgin Orbit is flying after its first successful orbital launch in January, and it&#8217;s carrying seven small satellites on behalf of clients including the U.S. Department of Defense and the Royal Netherlands Air Force. It&#8217;s also going to be the first time everyone can watch along live as Virgin Galactic makes the trip to space, since the company is streaming the mission via YouTube.</p>
<p>Previously, Virgin Orbit has opted not to provide live video of its flights, choosing instead to provide a feed of text updates via its social media channels. The YouTube stream should provide unprecedented views of the Virgin launch process, which includes transporting its small Launcher One rocket on to a high altitude for a midair launch from the wing of a modified Boeing 747 carrier aircraft.</p>
<p>Livestreaming launches is pretty much de rigueur in the space industry at this point, especially among the crop of so-called &#8220;new space&#8221; companies that includes SpaceX, Rocket Lab and Blue Origin. SpaceX has even been doing it throughout its Starship development process, which is unusual because it&#8217;s broadcast a number of failures on top of its successes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Virgin Orbit&#8217;s novel aircraft-assisted launch process should mean its streams provide some unique perspective versus the vertical take-off group, so it&#8217;s probably worth keeping an eye on this one.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AI rounds are particularly hot or at least as hot as the larger SaaS market, which is itself enjoying historically rich multiples as more capital pours into the aggregate startup world.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The startup investing market is crowded, expensive and rapid-fire today as venture capitalists work to preempt one another, hoping to deploy funds into hot companies before their competitors. The AI startup market may be even hotter than the average technology niche.</p>
<p>This should not surprise.</p>
<p>In the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">the Microsoft-Nuance deal</a>, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">reported that it would be reasonable</a> to anticipate an even more active and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/why-its-not-surprising-to-see-nine-figure-ai-rounds/">competitive market</a> for AI-powered startups. Our thesis was that after Redmond dropped nearly $20 billion for the AI company, investors would have a fresh incentive to invest in upstarts with an AI focus or strong AI component; exits, especially large transactions, have a way of spurring investor interest in related companies.</p>
<p>That expectation is coming true. Investors The Exchange reached out to in recent days reported a fierce market for AI startups.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But don’t presume that investors are simply falling over one another to fund companies betting on a future that may or may not arrive. Per a <a href="https://www.signal-ai.com/">Signal AI survey</a> of 1,000 C-level executives, nearly 92% thought that companies should lean on AI to improve their decision-making processes. And 79% of respondents said that companies are already doing so.</p>
<p>The gap between the two numbers implies that there is space in the market for more corporations to learn to lean on AI-powered software solutions, while the first metric belies a huge total addressable market for startups constructing software built on a foundation of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Now deep in the second quarter, we’re diving back into the AI startup market this morning, leaning on notes from <a href="https://twitter.com/davidblumberg?lang=en">Blumberg Capital’s David Blumberg</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rudina11?lang=en">Glasswing Ventures’ Rudina Seseri</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/benblume?lang=en">Atomico’s Ben Blume</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jgoldfein?lang=en">Jocelyn Goldfein of Zetta Venture Partners</a>. We’ll start by looking at recent venture capital data regarding AI startups and dig into what VCs are seeing in both the U.S. and European markets before chatting about applied AI versus &#8220;core&#8221; AI &#8212; and in which context VCs might still care about the latter.</p>
<h2>Hot, expensive, crowded</h2>
<p>The exit market for AI startups is more than just the big Microsoft-Nuance deal. CB Insights <a href="https://t.yesware.com/tt/2f1386565598f726094ae2a168a6fbd1bf787596/87febc0caed6d0e2c8e834f740f5a703/b99969f3c71b842d45dcc08ca9c599c2/www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Tech-Giants-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf">reports that</a> four of the largest five American tech companies have bought a dozen or more AI-focused startups to date, with Apple leading the pack with 29 such transactions.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Apple hosts their annual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/WWDC-2021/">Worldwide Developers Conference</a>, Instagram and Facebook chose this moment to pilot their first-ever Creator Week. This three-day event is geared toward aspiring and emerging digital creators, complete with 9:45 AM virtual DJ sets and panels on &#8220;Algorithm Mythbusting&#8221; and raising &#8220;zillions for a nonprofit you care about.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the first day of the event, Mark Zuckerberg made an announcement introducing <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/creator-week-2021-new-ways-for-creators-to-make-a-living">new ways for creators to make money</a>. In the coming months, Instagram will start testing a native affiliate tool, which allows creators to recommend products available on checkout, share them with followers and earn commissions for sales their posts drive. When creators make these posts, the text &#8220;eligible for commission&#8221; will appear beneath their username in the same way that sponsored content labels appear.</p>
<p>Available immediately, creators will be able to link their shops to their personal profiles, not just business ones. By the end of the year, eligible creators in the U.S. will be able to partner with one of Instagram&#8217;s merchandise partners (Bravado/UMG, Fanjoy, Represent and Spring) to drop exclusive product launches on the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>During live Instagram videos, viewers can tip creators by sending them a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/">Badge</a>, which costs between $0.99 and $4.99. Facebook Gaming has a similar feature called Stars, in which one Star is valued at $0.01. Starting this week, creators can earn bonuses for accomplishing certain challenges, like going live with another account. In a promotional image, for example, Facebook offers a bonus of $150 for creators who earn 5,000 Stars, the equivalent of $50.</p>

<p>&#8220;To help more creators make a living on our platforms, we&#8217;re going to keep paid online events, fan subscriptions, badges, and our upcoming independent news products free for creators until 2023,&#8221; Zuckerberg wrote in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113127348899371">a Facebook post</a>. &#8220;And when we do introduce a revenue share, it will be less than the 30% that Apple and others take.&#8221;</p>

<p>These updates mark the latest push by Instagram toward affiliate marketing and in-app shopping, like its redesigned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/instagram-launches-its-redesigned-shop-now-powered-by-facebook-pay/">Instagram Shop</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/instagram-launches-shopping-in-reels-its-tiktok-rival/">Shopping in Reels</a>, which debuted within the last year.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to be the best platform for creators like you to make a living. And if you have an idea that you want to share with the world, you should be able to create it and get it out there easily and simply &#8212; across Facebook and Instagram &#8212; and then earn money for your work,&#8221; Zuckerberg added during Creator Week.</p>
<p>Creators may be drawn to experiment with these affiliate and shop features, since for now, they won&#8217;t lose a cut of their profits to Instagram. But platforms like TikTok and YouTube offer monetization strategies that extend beyond e-commerce.</p>
<p>Last July, TikTok announced its $200 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">TikTok Creator Fund</a>, which allows popular posters to earn money from their videos. It&#8217;s unclear exactly how TikTok determines <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/tiktok-creator-fund-your-questions-answered">how much money</a> to dole out, but it depends on the number of views, engaged views and other factors. In August 2020, the YouTuber-turned-TikToker Hank Green estimated that he would bring home <a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1296866360908107776">about $700 from 20,000,000 TikTok views</a> in one month, averaging to about 3.5 cents per 1,000 views.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, YouTube announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/">a $100 million fund</a> last month for top creators on YouTube Shorts, its TikTok competitor. The platform pointed out that over the last three years it has paid $30 billion to content creators. Snapchat has been paying <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/20/snapchat-paying-1-million-a-day-to-video-creators.html">$1 million per day to creators</a> on their own TikTok competitor, Spotlight.</p>
<p>For users who don&#8217;t have millions of followers, these creator funds might not pay the rent. Still, it offers an income stream based on views, outside of e-commerce or viewer tips. For now, Instagram can&#8217;t say the same.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://segment.com/?ref=nav">Twilio Segment</a> announced a tool, which is available starting today, to help marketers create fine-grained customer journeys. Until now the company has enabled marketers to build buyer personas and broader audiences, but this enables users to have much greater control of their interactions with a customer.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Peter Reinhardt says that marketers have been craving the ability to build more customized customer journeys and this tool gives them that. &#8220;It&#8217;s basically taking the power that existed in personas and audiences and actually putting it fully in marketers&#8217; hands to build their dream journeys across every channel with the best data,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This enables marketers to stitch together a whole sequence of audiences. &#8220;Say when someone comes to the top of the funnel, they want to do X, then if they want to branch it and use X or Y, then do two different things, and you can keep branching and personalizing via this whole journey to cover the whole lifecycle.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says this capability has existed in some tools, but the Twilio Segment offering enables it to be used in more than 300 tools in the Segment ecosystem. &#8220;This is the first time that we&#8217;re going to be able to really do that and orchestrate this way, not just for a limited subset of channels, but across all of the channels,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Customer experience and digital transformation concepts are merging during the pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic/embed/#?secret=8xH29Oyl5R" data-secret="8xH29Oyl5R" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Marketers can build branching by dragging and dropping journey components to send people on different paths depending on things like if they are a regular customer or a first-time customer or just about anything you can think of. Reinhardt says that flexibility is a key attribute of the new feature.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s competing with some major players like Adobe and Salesforce in this space, Reinhardt believes this capability really gives Twilio a leg up over the competitors. &#8220;I think if you look at more of the legacy journey builders, [their products] are not built on real-time data, meaning that they&#8217;re actually missing basically all of the interesting behavioral data that marketers actually build on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Segment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">was acquired by Twilio last year</a> for $3.2 billion, and part of the reason for that was to increase its customer engagement capabilities. Segment gives Twilio a customer data platform to build on top of its other communications tooling, and today&#8217;s announcement expands on that capability.</p>
