										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is giving its users a tiny bit more power to see what they want — and not see what they <em>don&#8217;t</em> want — in its content discovery hub. The company introduced a new toggle called &#8220;Sensitive Content Control&#8221; on Tuesday that allows anyone to screen posts that it thinks could be offensive, hiding them from the Explore tab.</p>
<p>The new feature appears in the settings menu and lets users choose to either allow more content that could be &#8220;upsetting or offensive,&#8221; limit that content or &#8220;limit even more.&#8221; The phrasing is kind of weird but it acknowledges that the company&#8217;s moderation efforts aren&#8217;t perfect, and that&#8217;s realistic at least.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can think of sensitive content as posts that don’t necessarily break our rules, but could potentially be upsetting to some people – such as posts that may be sexually suggestive or violent,&#8221; Instagram explained in the <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-sensitive-content-control">announcement</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch asked the company to expand on what kinds of posts are screened out under each category and if human or algorithmic moderation determines what is sensitive, but did not receive a response.</p>
<p>We also asked if the company has any plans to create separate toggles for violence and sexual content, considering that a lot of people comfortable with the latter might be less inclined to see violence bubble up among the app&#8217;s makeup tutorials and influencer junkets.</p>
<p>On Instagram, &#8220;sensitive&#8221; content is a massive catch-all category for stuff it allows but doesn&#8217;t want to be seen as directly promoting. In its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/313829416281232">own guidelines on content it recommends</a>, Instagram states that sexually suggestive content like &#8220;pictures of people in see-through clothing&#8221; aren&#8217;t eligible for the Explore tab. Instagram&#8217;s definition of sensitive content also includes dangerous forms of content like &#8220;exaggerated health claims&#8221; and posts promoting weight loss supplements.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Instagram&#8217;s newest test mixes &#8216;Suggested Posts&#8217; into the feed to keep you scrolling&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/instagram-suggested-posts-test-topics/embed/#?secret=ff07NbpbIH" data-secret="ff07NbpbIH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Instagram is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/arts/design/instagram-free-the-nipple.html">notorious</a> for over-policing content that the platform deems to be sexual. A campaign from Black plus-size model Nyome Nicholas-Williams <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/25/instagram-row-over-plus-size-model-forces-change-to-nudity-policy">successfully pressured the platform</a> into relaxing one of its overly restrictive nudity rules last year.</p>
<p>Instagram contextualized the new content controls as part of a new effort to give users more power to determine what shows up in their feed. &#8220;We believe people should be able to shape Instagram into the experience that they want,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post, noting that recent changes like being able to disable comments also give users more choice.</p>
<p>While the company is giving users more control over its algorithm in some small ways, it&#8217;s also considering giving them less. Last month, Instagram<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/instagram-suggested-posts-test-topics/"> began testing algorithmic suggestions mixed into the main feed</a>, a design choice that would let the company inject the platform with even more of what it wants you to see.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 20, 2021. The markets have been active in the last few days, with stocks dropping yesterday before rebounding today. Cryptos have also been suffering from ups and downs. A bit like Jeff Bezos, though his were planned. More on that in a second. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">Bezos blasts off:</a> </strong>The billionaire space race reached its second stage today, as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos left the planet for a few minutes. There was a livestream, though the Blue Origin space company was a bit more salesy than I was comfortable with. Regardless, the humans went up and came down, and the rocket and everyone aboard survived. The crew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/bezos-and-crew-host-a-giddy-press-conference-after-blue-origins-inaugural-crewed-launch/">was pretty stoked about it all</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/the-european-vc-market-is-so-hot-it-may-skip-its-summer-holiday/">European startups are thriving:</a> </strong>Of all the startup markets in the world, Europe’s is among the very hottest. And according to venture capitalists that TechCrunch spoke with, the pace of investing activity on the continent is not set to slow much in the back half of 2021. This year will set all-time records in the European startup market for capital raised.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/square-launches-business-bank-accounts/">Square builds a business bank:</a> </strong>What has lots of small-biz customers and big fintech aspirations? Well, a lot of tech companies, but also Square. The company has put together a business bank for its business customers. How long until Square is simply a bank for individuals and companies alike? A good rule of thumb for fintech: No matter where a startup <em>starts</em> in financial technology, it will end up doing all things. Or die trying.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Holy heck there were a lot of funding rounds announced today. TechCrunch covered a huge chunk of the total, so many that we can’t get to them all here. But after checking in on China, we have your speed-read all the same. Let’s go!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/china-roundup-data-security-clampdown/"><strong>All about the Chinese startup scene:</strong></a> Are you a little behind on China’s technology regulatory crackdown? Don’t worry if so. Our own Rita Liao is on the case and has a brilliant roundup of what’s going on with Didi and other China-based companies that went public on the U.S. market. The gist is that data may not be the new oil, as some liked to say a few years back, but data is proving to be a geopolitical flashpoint. As it turns out, the Europeans were early on this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the venture capital rundown, in brief format to allow for the inclusion of more items:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/rxall-grabs-3-15m-to-scale-its-drug-checking-and-counterfeiting-tech-across-africa/"><strong>Taking on counterfeit drugs in Africa:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s what RxAll is doing, and it has landed $3.15 million to pursue its vision. Launched in 2016, the company wants to combat fake drugs and the health problems that they cause.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/chargepoint-to-buy-european-charging-software-startup-for-295m/">Charging consolidation:</a> </strong>TechCrunch covered the deal between ChargePoint and the frustratingly punctuated has·to·be, in which the first company spent $295 million to buy the latter. Our read is the deal will allow ChargePoint “a boost in its pursuit to gain market share beyond North America” in the EV charging market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/titan-valued-at-450m-as-a16z-leads-58m-series-b/"><strong>Titan raises $58M to bring active wealth management to the masses:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If Robinhood did a good job making retail investing open to the masses by cutting fees to zero, Titan wants to pull a similar trick with the active-management world of wealth management. The company raised a $12.5 million Series A earlier this year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/little-spoon-scoops-up-44m-to-grow-its-childrens-nutrition-delivery-service/"><strong>$44M for Little Spoon’s baby food mission:</strong></a> Feeding children is a daily challenge. Finding good things for them to eat that they will actually consume is even harder. Little Spoon wants to solve the matter by helping parents of young kids subscribe to D2C baby foods while also selling vitamins and the like.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/path-robotics-raises-another-100m/"><strong>Path Robotics raises (again):</strong></a> The Ohio-based Path Robotics is back at the fundraising well this week, picking up a $100 million Series C. The round comes after the startup raised a $56 million Series B in May. What does it do? Welding robots!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/capchase-raises-280m-to-scale-its-financing-platform-for-subscription-businesses/"><strong>More money raised to buy SaaS revenue:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Capchase has put together a $280 million round of funding (debt and equity) to grow its business of buying future software revenues for present-day cash. It’s a big market that Pipe also plays in.</li>
</ul>
<p>To close out our startup and venture capital news, some updates on venture capitalists that want to fund startups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/hyper-is-a-new-fund-that-offers-300k-checks-and-promises-of-a-media-slingshot-for-founders/"><strong>Hyper’s $60M concept:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Part venture firm, part venture-funded media group, the Product Hunt sister company is looking to put capital and connections to work. TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino has the details.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/pillar-vc-closes-192m-for-two-funds-targeting-saas-crypto-biotech-manufacturing/"><strong>New Boston funds:</strong></a> Pillar VC has raised new capital in two chunks, including $169 million for its Pillar III capital pool and a $23 million second fund. The VC firm intends to invest broadly, including into SaaS, hardware and other categories. The investing group is perhaps best known for buying <em>common</em> stock in companies it backs.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the operators out there, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/marketing-cube-founder-maya-moufareks-lessons-for-customer-focused-startups/">TechCrunch has a chat</a> with Maya Moufarek, the founder of Marketing Cube, who spent more than 15 years working for companies like Google and American Express before launching her own growth consultancy about startup marketing. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>How we built an AI unicorn in 6 years</h2>
<p>Few startups go to market with the exact product their founders first envisioned.</p>
<p>Today, Tractable is known for developing tech that allows drivers to upload photos of their vehicles after a collision so its AI can assess the damage. Its first paying customer, however, used Tractable to inspect plastic pipe welds.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, that customer also fired them just as the founders were raising their first round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We struck gold with car insurance,&#8221; says co-founder Alex Dalyac, as it was &#8220;a huge and inefficient market in desperate need of modernization.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an Extra Crunch guest post, he shares several takeaways from the last six years spent scaling a unicorn that have value founders of all stripes. Step one?</p>
<p>&#8220;Search for complementary co-founders who will become your best friends,&#8221; advises Dalyac.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/facebook-onboards-another-31-newsletter-writers-on-bulletin/">Facebook is really doing the newsletter thing:</a></strong> The newsletter push is not slowing down, with Facebook’s Bulletin service bringing on 31 new writers. That’s a pretty big haul. Of course, Facebook is using the service as a way to drive Facebook Pay usage, among other goals. But as a writer, seeing major companies argue over my professional cohort is certainly a turn of the tables.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/venmo-removes-its-global-public-feed-in-a-significant-app-redesign/">Venmo admits that its default-public feed was bad:</a></strong> Ah, the public Venmo activity feed. It never made sense, but Venmo stuck to it through thick and thin until now. Now you will merely see a more friend-focused feed. Progress!</li>

You will be able to thanks to a new feature on the social video service called Super Thanks. It’s a one-time tip of between $2 and $50. Hopefully this helps musical groups that use the platform for distribution.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Tesla in full self-driving mode makes a left turn out of the middle lane on a busy San Francisco street. It jumps in a bus lane where it’s not meant to be. It turns a corner and nearly plows into parked vehicles, causing the driver to lurch for the wheel.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/the-station-rimac-bugatti-is-born-tesla-releases-fsd-beta-v9-and-ola-raises-500m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla began sending out over-the-air software updates for its Full Self-Driving </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(FSD) beta version 9 software, an advanced driver assist system that relies only on cameras, rather than cameras and radar like Tesla’s previous ADAS systems.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reaction to videos displaying unsafe driving behavior,</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrHCz4wnW8g&amp;ab_channel=ChuckCook"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like unprotected left turns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other reports from Tesla owners, </span><a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-software-lacks-safeguards-a6698414036/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer Reports issued a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday saying the software upgrade does not appear to be safe enough for public roads, and that it would independently test the software update on its Model Y SUV once it receives the necessary software updates. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Running preproduction software is both work &amp; fun. Beta list was in stasis, as we had many known issues to fix. </p>
<p>Beta 9 addresses most known issues, but there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid.</p>
<p>Safety is always top priority at Tesla.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1413306409693892613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consumer organization said it’s concerned Tesla is using its existing owners and their vehicles as guinea pigs for testing new features. Making their point for them, Tesla CEO Elon Musk did urge drivers not to be complacent while driving because “there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid.” Many Tesla owners know what they’re getting themselves into because they signed up for Tesla’s Early Access Program that delivers beta software for feedback, but other road users have not given their consent for such trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla’s updates are shipped out to drivers all over the country. The electric vehicle company did not respond to a request for more information about whether or not it takes into account self-driving regulations in specific states &#8212; 29 states have enacted laws related to autonomous driving, but they differ wildly depending on the state. Other self-driving technology companies like Cruise, Waymo and Argo AI told CR they either test their software on private tracks or use trained safety drivers as monitors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Car technology is advancing really quickly, and automation has a lot of potential, but policymakers need to step up to get strong, sensible safety rules in place,” says William Wallace, manager of safety policy at CR in a statement. “Otherwise, some companies will just treat our public roads as if they were private proving grounds, with little holding them accountable for safety.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, the </span><a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-orders-crash-reporting-vehicles-equipped-advanced-driver-assistance-systems"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued a standing general order that requires manufacturers and operators of vehicles with SAE Level 2 ADAS or SAE levels 3, 4 or 5 automated driving systems to report crashes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“NHTSA’s core mission is safety. By mandating crash reporting, the agency will have access to critical data that will help quickly identify safety issues that could emerge in these automated systems,” said Dr. Steven Cliff, NHTSA’s acting administrator, in a statement. “In fact, gathering data will help instill public confidence that the federal government is closely overseeing the safety of automated vehicles.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FSD beta 9 software has added features that automates more driving tasks, like navigating intersections and city streets with the driver’s supervision. But with such excellent graphics detailing where the car is in relation to other road users, down to a woman on a scooter passing by, drivers might be more distracted by the tech that’s meant to assist them at crucial moments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tesla just asking people to pay attention isn’t enough — the system needs to make sure people are engaged when the system is operational,” said J</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ake Fisher, senior director of CR’s Auto Test Center in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We already know that testing developing self-driving systems without adequate driver support can — and will — end in fatalities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fisher said Tesla should implement an in-car driver monitoring system to ensure drivers are watching the road to avoid accidents like the one involving </span><a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUXnii6LS7sDGCMIPJONh4V1D0fnMzDRUvpVdpPv-2FA8zLFIOyL4ZNTne7il-2FvdpaFup37499oGJr3Kc8TkVcKiuBj-2F-2Bk8snUtzg-2Fm2dJHXo8I5CzmD8Zi2jZ923vWJgUh2Kvdi-2BgZcSqBbFCYq56Ru2yzv8Yd7iKn6i-2F9lN2zk79Wy29D_YXLroU-2F9DCpI7O51hK6BzZhp-2BHFw-2Ff1p-2FQqgy5BN7zlbXXU3QuI5uWV4cLwI8tyismDjxrzyJEupSggHlXXKI1YHTmavNgrfFl9mPxOK2tcTqI7edyTBdQopaOGCOHv8B2k48sSG3rrSKNel9vp-2BP3OBvyDOc1QzeHZch7pLFiqGwuRSzMZA-2BeSfneGiX9LX-2FJDTQuJAHA3Fpr2kyz6NQd8ESN4gGV1cwNJPTna-2F1-2FTm9Oil3DI3Vu6luqUpPYVQXUIZRc9UZaUWlLuGmCouwDoQ-2BayQ7N7L0qbto4LYc-2FrXFisJ3Q5wCBRPaMqtH0FE8HHFcH-2Bq044BMHIdq1Jdw-2F0ScanX7zmbrr6AEo-2BIxic-3D"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s self-driving test vehicle, which struck and killed a woman in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Phoenix as she crossed the street. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pivot Bio makes fertilizer — but not directly. Its modified microorganisms are added to soil and they produce nitrogen that would otherwise have to be trucked in and dumped there. This biotech-powered approach can save farmers money and time and ultimately may be easier on the environment — a huge opportunity that investors have <a href="https://blog.pivotbio.com/press-releases/series-d">plowed $430 million into in the company&#8217;s latest funding round</a>.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is among the nutrients crops need to survive and thrive, and it&#8217;s only by dumping fertilizer on the soil and mixing it in that farmers can keep growing at today&#8217;s rates. But in some ways we&#8217;re still doing what our forebears did generations ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fertilizer changed agriculture — it&#8217;s what made so much of the last century possible. But it&#8217;s not a perfect way to get nutrients to crops,&#8221; said Karsten Temme, CEO and co-founder of Pivot Bio. He pointed out the simple fact that distributing fertilizer over a thousand — let alone ten thousand or more — acres of farmland is an immense mechanical and logistical challenge, involving many people, heavy machinery and valuable time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not to mention the risk that a heavy rain might carry off a lot of the fertilizer before it&#8217;s absorbed and used, and the huge contributions of greenhouse gases the fertilizing process produces. (The microbe approach seems to be considerably better for the environment.)</p>
<p>Yet the reason we do this in the first place is essentially to imitate the work of microbes that live in the soil and produce nitrogen naturally. Plants and these microbes have a relationship going back millions of years, but the tiny organisms simply don&#8217;t produce enough. Pivot Bio&#8217;s insight when it started more than a decade ago was that a few tweaks could supercharge this natural nitrogen cycle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all known microbes were the way to go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re naturally part of the root system — they were already there. They have this feedback loop, where if they detect fertilizer they don&#8217;t make nitrogen, to save energy. The only thing that we&#8217;ve done is, the portion of their genome responsible for producing nitrogen is offline, and we&#8217;re waking it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other agriculture-focused biotech companies like Indigo and AgBiome are also looking at modifying and managing the plant&#8217;s &#8220;microbiome,&#8221; which is to say the life that lives in the immediate vicinity of a given plant. A modified microbiome may be resistant to pests, reduce disease or offer other benefits.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not so different from yeast, which as many know from experience works as a living rising agent. That microbe has been cultivated to consume sugar and produce a gas, which leads to the air pockets in baked goods. <em>This</em> microbe has been modified a bit more directly to continually consume the sugars put out by plants and put out nitrogen. And they can do it at rates that massively reduce the need for adding solid fertilizer to the soil.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken what is traditionally tons and tons of physical materials, and shrunk that into a powder, like baker&#8217;s yeast, that you can fit in your hand,&#8221; Temme said (though, to be precise, the product is applied as a liquid). &#8220;All of a sudden managing that farm gets a little easier. You free up the time you would have spent sitting in the tractor applying fertilizer to the field; you&#8217;ll add our product at the same time you&#8217;d be planting your seeds. And you have the confidence that if a rainstorm comes through in the spring, it&#8217;s not washing it all away. Globally about half of all fertilizer is washed away&#8230; but microbes don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, the microbes just quietly sit in the soil pumping out nitrogen at a rate of up to 40 pounds per acre — a remarkably old-fashioned way to measure it (why not grams per square centimeter?), but perhaps in keeping with agriculture&#8217;s occasional anachronistic tendencies. Depending on the crop and environment, that may be enough to do without added fertilizers at all, or it might be about half or less.</p>
<p>Whatever the proportion provided by the microbes, it must be tempting to employ them, because Pivot Bio tripled its revenue in 2021. You might wonder why they can be so sure only halfway through the year, but as they are currently only selling to farmers in the northern hemisphere and the product is applied at planting time early in the year, they&#8217;re done with sales for the year and can be sure it&#8217;s three times what they sold in 2020.</p>

<p>The microbes die off once the crop is harvested, so it&#8217;s not a permanent change to the ecosystem. And next year, when farmers come back for more, the organisms may well have been modified further. It&#8217;s not quite as simple as turning the nitrogen production on or off in the genome; the enzymatic pathway from sugar to nitrogen can be improved, and the threshold for when the microbes decide to undertake the process rather than rest can be changed as well. The latest iteration, Proven 40, has the yield mentioned above, but further improvements are planned, attracting potential customers on the fence about whether it&#8217;s worth the trouble to change tactics.</p>
<p>The potential for recurring revenue and growth (by their current estimate they are currently able to address about a quarter of a $200 billion total market) led to the current monster D round, which was led by DCVC and Temasek. There are about a dozen other investors, for which I refer readers to <a href="https://blog.pivotbio.com/press-releases/series-d">the press release</a>, which lists them in no doubt a very carefully negotiated order.</p>
<p>Temme says the money will go toward deepening and broadening the platform and growing the relationship with farmers, who seem to be hooked after giving it a shot. Right now the microbes are specific to corn, wheat and rice, which of course covers a great deal of agriculture, but there are many other corners of the industry that would benefit from a streamlined, enhanced nitrogen cycle. And it&#8217;s certainly a powerful validation of the vision Temme and his co-founder Alvin Tamsir had 15 years ago in grad school, he said. Here&#8217;s hoping that&#8217;s food for thought for those in that position now, wondering if it&#8217;s all worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic affecting every aspect of life and industry, it&#8217;s no surprise that digitization is coming to construction fast. Construction suppliers are increasingly under the same pressure as other sectors to perform at a higher level. We’ve seen the rise of companies like Dozer, Reno Run and Toolbox try to address this, but often the model is closer to a vertical integration rather than something more open. Even with that, it’s still the case that to order concrete or bricks, construction companies have to negotiate each time, with simultaneous record keeping.</p>
<p>This is the argument of <a href="https://brokrete.com/">Brokrete</a>, which bills itself as the “Shopify of construction.”</p>
<p>The startup has now raised a $3 million seed financing round led by Xploration Capital, which was joined by unnamed new strategic investors and existing investors. The startup graduated from Y Combinator’s winter cohort last year. Other strategic investors include Ronald Richardson, Avlok Kohli (CEO of AngeLlist Ventures) and the MaRS Investment Accelerator Fund (IAF). The funding will be used to expand in North American and European markets. Brokrete also launched Storefront, an e-commerce platform for suppliers in the construction industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jordan Latourelle, the company’s founder and CEO said: “Construction today is a largely offline, $1.2 trillion market where legacy commerce is the norm. Brokrete’s Storefront product equips suppliers with the tools required to enhance their operations by orders of magnitude. I founded Brokrete after seeing an industry left behind by e-commerce giants. Now we are becoming the operating system for e-commerce in the construction industry, while staying easy and affordable at the same time.”</p>
<p>Brokrete says its platform is code-free, white-labeled, multi-channel and industry-specific to sell and manage orders online. Suppliers get an iOS and Android app for e-commerce to receive offline orders from more &#8220;traditional&#8221; customers. It then provides order management, payouts, dispatching, logistics and real-time delivery. There are also financial and operational ERP integrations. Brokrete claims to work with 1,000+ contractors and to have a 250+ supplier network.</p>
<p>Latourelle told me: “We&#8217;re giving the construction industry an opportunity to use it on a Shopify way, and create their own store. It’s like a branded storefront for suppliers.”</p>
<p>Eugene Timko, managing partner at Xploration Capital said: “Construction is one of the few remaining large industries with mostly undigitized supply chains. Historically the key problem was the lack of real-time access to actual stocks which prevented producers and distributors from going online. Now with Brokrete’s end-to-end solution, these businesses can not only sell through Brokrete’s marketplace but can also enable their own direct online channels. Similar to Shopify, this has allowed many thousands of previously offline businesses to start accepting orders online.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Biden administration tripled down on its commitment to reining in powerful tech companies Tuesday, proposing committed Big Tech critic Jonathan Kanter to lead the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division.</p>
<p>Kanter is a lawyer with a long track record of representing smaller companies like Yelp in antitrust cases against Google. He currently practices law at his own firm, which specializes in advocacy for state and federal antitrust enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout his career, Kanter has also been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/20/president-biden-announces-jonathan-kanter-for-assistant-attorney-general-for-antitrust/">White House press release</a> stated. Progressives celebrated the nomination as a win, though some of Biden&#8217;s new antitrust hawks have enjoyed support from both political parties.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jonathan Kanter&#39;s nomination to lead <a href="https://twitter.com/TheJusticeDept?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheJusticeDept</a>’s Antitrust Division is tremendous news for workers and consumers. He’s been a leader in the fight to check consolidated corporate power and strengthen competition in our markets. <a href="https://t.co/mLQACA0c4j">https://t.co/mLQACA0c4j</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1417544362972655617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The Justice Department already has a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328941/download">major antitrust suit against Google</a> in the works. The lawsuit, filed by Trump&#8217;s own Justice Department, accuses the company of &#8220;unlawfully maintaining monopolies&#8221; through anti-competitive practices in its search and search advertising businesses. If successfully confirmed, Kanter would be positioned to steer the DOJ&#8217;s big case against Google.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/30/opinion/dont-hand-our-tvs-over-to-google.html">2016 NYT op-ed</a>, Kanter argued that Google is notorious for relying on an anti-competitive &#8220;playbook&#8221; to maintain its market dominance. Kanter pointed to Google&#8217;s long history of releasing free ad-supported products and eventually restricting competition through &#8220;discriminatory and exclusionary practices&#8221; in a given corner of the market.</p>
<p>Kanter is just the latest high-profile Big Tech critic that&#8217;s been elevated to a major regulatory role under Biden. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lina-khan-ftc-confirmed/">Biden named fierce Amazon critic Lina Khan</a> as FTC chair upon her confirmation to the agency. In March, Biden named another noted Big Tech critic, Columbia law professor Tim Wu, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/tim-wu-white-house.html">to the National Economic Council</a> as a special assistant for tech and competition policy.</p>
<p>All signs point to the Biden White House gearing up for a major federal fight with Big Tech. Congress is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/technology/antitrust-overhaul-congress.html">working on a set of Big Tech bills</a>, but in lieu of — or in tandem with — legislative reform, the White House can flex its own regulatory muscle through the FTC and DOJ.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/20/politics/white-house-section-230-facebook/index.html">new comments to MSNBC</a>, the White House confirmed that it is also &#8220;reviewing&#8221; Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a potent snippet of law that protects platforms from liability for user-generated content.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, R-Zero, a pandemic-era biosafety company, announced the acquisition of CoWorkr &#8212; a company that develops room occupancy sensors. The acquisition marks a shift in focus for R-Zero as people return to work, vaccines are rolled out and companies that sprung up in response to the COVID-19 adapt to another phase of the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When R-Zero was founded in April 2020, the company primarily focused on developing hospital-grade UVC disinfection systems, or lights that can neutralize certain types of viruses (more on this later). As companies scrambled for ways to sanitize buildings, the company racked up a total of $58.8 million in funding at a $256.5 million valuation. R-Zero now has about 1,000 private and public sector clients that range from correctional facilities to the Brooklyn Nets and Boston Celtics, to the South San Francisco Unified School District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoWorkr was founded in 2014 and had totaled about $200,000 in seed funding, </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coworkr"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the acquisition of CoWorkr, R-Zero plans to develop an internet of things-style sensor network to manage both personnel and cleaning in the workplace, says R-Zero founder Grant Morgan. The company is moving beyond simply disinfecting air and surfaces, and will focus on managing the flow of people (and the viruses and bacteria) in public spaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like an OS for the workplace. That’s what we’re building: Tools that help both create and maintain indoor environments with health and productivity at their core,” Morgan tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Redmond and Keenan May, both co-founders of CoWorkr, will remain on in full-time roles, where they will run a corporate real estate initiative, and develop an IoT capacity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve spent a lot of time with our customers and understanding our customers’ initiatives, especially in commercial real estate,” Redmond tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority are moving to a hybrid working scenario and that means you know they really need occupancy information,” she continues. “Our initiative in joining with R-Zero is very much highlighted by what the future of hybrid work looks like and what the future of commercial real estate looks like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-CoWorkr, R-Zero’s flagship product was a UVC light called Arc &#8212; a rectangular light that can be wheeled into an office space once janitorial staff leave the office. It also offered a product called Arc Air, an air filter that also uses UVC light to kill germs, and that could be used in occupied spaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVC lights had a brief moment of fame in mid-2020 for several reasons: they seemed like powerful ways to disinfect communal spaces, and there were certain incentives for companies to apply tech-based solutions to COVID-19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVC lights have been used in hospitals for decades to sanitize surfaces like scanners, or to sanitize air when inserted into UV air ducts. Studies have shown it can inactivate </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85425-w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flu viruses in the air</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Limited evidence also noted that UVC can also inactivate </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85425-w"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SARS-CoV-2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67211-2.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other coronaviruses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by destroying the virus’ outer protein coating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These lights were also used in real-life during the pandemic. The New York Metropolitan Transport Authority, for example, purchased </span><a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/05/19/mta-invests--1-million-in-uv-light-machines-to-clean-subways"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worth of UVC lights to disinfect subway cars each evening. The CARES act passed in March 2020 was to allow companies and public sector institutions to use government loans to </span><a href="https://www.pandemicoversight.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/GSA%20CARES%20Act%20Spend%20Plan%20%281%29.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purchase cleaning services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including UV lights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, some consumer-facing lamps drew their fair share of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/health/coronavirus-transmission-indoors.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For one, they can cause eye injuries or burns if people are exposed to them for a long period of time. </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7571309/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of UVC disinfection (notably, written by two scientists with ties to a UVC disinfection company) offered a blunt assessment noting that “nonscientific performance claims” were “widespread” in the nascent industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, R-Zero’s Arc does have third-party testing to its name &#8212; it was shown to reduce 99.99% of two viruses: a common cold coronavirus, and a surrogate for norovirus on surfaces. It was also 99.99% effective in killing off </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">E. Coli </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and Methicillin-resistant </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staphylococcus aureus </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(MRSA). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite back-and-forth over the utility of some UVC lights as disinfection technology, some analysts suggest this industry isn’t going anywhere (for one, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/lg-uv-robots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LG has entered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the UV-based cleaning space). Tim Mulrooney, a commercial services equities analyst for William Blair, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/lg-uv-robots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told The</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that we’re living through a “paradigm shift” in how people think about hygiene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polling from 2020 suggests that cleaning procedures were top of mind for employees and customers alike. Of 3,000 people </span><a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/content/dam/deloittedigital/us/documents/offerings/offering-20200626-safety-cleanliness-covid.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveyed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Deloitte, 64% of employees said that regular cleaning of shared spaces was important to them and 62% of customers wanted surfaces cleaned after every interaction. (This is despite evidence that surfaces aren’t thought to be a way that COVID-19 spreads.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, it’s unclear how the rise of vaccines might impact perceptions of office cleanliness. But Morgan is betting that companies (and employees) are now more aware of the germs in our midst than they might have been pre-pandemic, and will be eager for ways to control their spread &#8212; that includes managing the flow of people within an office. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amid pandemic, returning to offices remains an open question for tech leaders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/amid-pandemic-returning-to-offices-remains-an-open-question-for-tech-leaders/embed/#?secret=xLw0TOkT3Z" data-secret="xLw0TOkT3Z" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For R-Zero that means moving beyond UVC disinfection to focus on occupancy management, with the acquisition of CoWorkr. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan calls CoWorkr’s sensors R-Zero’s “eyes and ears.” R-Zero plans to announce two UVC-based products that address air cleanliness in occupied spaces, and will use CoWorkr&#8217;s sensors to ensure “full automation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, CoWorker&#8217;s battery-powered thermal sensors allow employers to know which rooms in an office are being occupied. That information, he says, could help trigger the use of a UV-based air filter or other cleaning products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That information could also tell janitorial staff to clean the room more thoroughly that evening — or conversely, to forgo cleaning a room that hasn&#8217;t been touched all day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What our customers are seeing is that they’re getting an immediate ROI. Our customers are reducing labor costs by 30-40%,” says Morgan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, says Morgan, the company is bullish on the idea that people will still crave clean workspaces; perhaps due to some lingering “scar tissue” from the pandemic, he notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“​​In almost 100% of cases, our customers are looking at this as a long term investment,” Morgan adds. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">A report last week hinted at some of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1">Netflix&#8217;s gaming ambitions</a>. In <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">its Q2 2021 earnings report</a>, the company confirmed some things. First, Netflix says it &#8220;will be primarily focused&#8221; on mobile at first, looking to expand on its interactivity projects like <em>Black Mirror Bandersnatch </em>and its Stranger Things games. The upcoming titles will be available at no additional cost as part of your subscription and the company was clear it will keep up the pace on movies and television.</p>
<p>&#8220;We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,&#8221; the company said in a letter to its shareholders.</p>
<p>2020 was a big year for Netflix. With everyone stuck at home and movie theaters closed, the streaming service attracted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">16 million new customers in three months</a>. As expected, in 2021 that pace has dramatically slowed and the new customer numbers continue to be a struggle. In its earnings report, the company says it added 1.5 million subscribers in Q2, which was actually a bit better than its forecast mark of one million. However, that&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2021-201731732.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">lower than Q1 2021</a>, which saw the company tack on 3.98 new customers globally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Netflix says it forecasts new customer additions to hit 3.5 million in Q3 2021, up from 2.2 million during the same three-month a year ago. If it does so, the company explains that would bring the total new subscriber tally to 54 million over the last two years. The pace may have slowed for Netflix, but overall it&#8217;s doing just fine. Revenue was still up 19 percent year-over-year at $7.3 billion for the quarter.</p>
<p>According to Netflix&#8217;s own numbers, <em>Shadow and Bone </em>was a popular series this quarter, streaming to over 55 million &#8220;member households&#8221; in less than a month. The show has already been renewed for a second season based on those numbers. <em>Sweet Tooth, </em>a series based on a DC comic, was streamed by 60 million households the first month it was available. Unscripted series like <em>Too Hot to Handle </em>and <em>The Circle </em>were popular selections as well, as was true crime docuseries <em>The Sons of Sam. </em>In terms of movies, Zac Snyder&#8217;s <em>Army of the Dead </em>hit 75 million households in the first month. Netflix also explained that <em>The Mitchells vs. The Machines </em>is now its biggest animated film to date, streaming to 53 million households.</p>
<p>Netflix says COVID-related production delays led to a &#8220;lighter&#8221; first half of 2021 in terms of content, but the pace will pick up throughout the rest of the year. The company&#8217;s Q3 lineup includes new seasons of <em>La Casa de Papel</em> (<em>Money Heist</em>), <em>Sex Education</em>, <em>Virgin River</em> and <em>Never Have I Ever</em> in addition to live action films like <em>Sweet Girl</em> (Jason Momoa), <em>Kissing Booth 3 </em>and <em>Kate</em> (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Plus, there&#8217;s the animated film <em>Vivo</em>, which will feature new music from Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A famous poem advises us not to compare ourselves with others, &#8220;for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same holds true for startup fundraising; the size of your seed round will be determined solely by your company&#8217;s immediate needs and the investors you&#8217;re working with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/founders-how-well-do-you-really-understand-seed-stage-financing/">fundraising is not the goal</a>,&#8221; says three-time YC alum Yin Wu. &#8220;Building a successful business is.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Duolingo’s IPO could cast golden halo on edtech startups</h2>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Natasha Mascarenhas look into recent figures from U.S. edtech giant Duolingo.</p>
<p>It announced a first price range of $85 to $95 per share, which Alex and Natasha note “feels strong.”</p>
<p>“If Duolingo poses a strong debut, consumer edtech startups will be able to add a golden data point to their pitch decks,” they write. “A strong Duolingo listing could also signal that mission-driven startups can have impressive turns.”</p>
<p>But if it struggles?</p>
<p>“The wave of consumer edtech apps may lose some enthusiasm about going public.”</p>

<p>Seven years ago, ad executive Jen Young and tech entrepreneur Jeff Cavins stepped away from the careers they&#8217;d built to launch Outdoorsy, an RV rental marketplace.</p>
<p>Last month, they announced a partnership with high-end camping company Collective Retreats and raised a $90 million Series D and $40 million in debt to speed up an already impressive rate of growth.</p>
<p>To learn more about their approach to building a transportation company that caters to people who crave a taste of nomadic existence, Rebecca Bella interviewed Young and Cavins for Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>Their conversation explored the impacts of COVID-19, their business strategy and why they decided to take on $30 million in debt financing:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jeff Cavins:</strong> We like to look at macro trends as a business and I think U.S. monetary policy is going to get us all in a little bit of trouble. So we wanted to lock in a credit facility for the company at advantageous terms.</p></blockquote>

<p>This post rounds up a few favorite excerpts from the chat, starting with Kunst’s notes on how to make a killer pitch deck.</p>
<p>She also offered advice regarding incorporation, how to find a co-founder and when startups are too large to join an accelerator.</p>

<p>The good news for biotech startups is that investment in the sector is soaring.</p>
<p>“Along the way, founders will need to procure additional investments, develop strategic partnerships and stave off competition,” Kevin A. O&#8217;Connor, a partner in the Intellectual Property practice group at Neal Gerber Eisenberg, writes in a guest column. “All of which starts by protecting the fundamental asset of any biotech company: its intellectual property.”</p>

<p>At our recent Early Stage event, we had the opportunity to talk with Arvind Purushotham, the managing director and global head of Citi Ventures, about how startups should think about corporate venture arms, including what a check from an enterprise like Citi can mean, and how to leverage that kind of goliath once it’s already a financial partner.</p>
<p>For founders trying to understand the benefits and potential pitfalls of working with a corporate venture arm versus a more traditional venture team, it’s worth zipping through this discussion.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm considers what Robinhood’s first IPO price range ($38 to $42 per share) means for the U.S. consumer fintech giant and whether we can expect it to raise the range again before it debuts.</p>
<p>In picking apart Robinhood’s latest filing, Alex noticed an aside about decreased crypto trading volume.</p>
<p>“Because Robinhood deals with consumers, who might decide to trade less in time, it has more uncertainty in its future growth than, say, Zoom,” he notes.</p>

<p>Zoom plans to spend a little less than a sixth of its value on Five9, which sells software that allows users to reach customers across platforms and record notes on their interactions.</p>
<p>Alex Wilhelm notes “that Five9’s revenue growth rate is a fraction of Zoom’s.”</p>
<p>“The larger company, then, is buying a piece of revenue that is growing slower than its core business. That’s a bit of a flip from many transactions that we see, in which the smaller company being acquired is growing faster than the acquiring entity’s own operations.</p>
<p>“Why would Zoom buy slower growth for so very much money?”</p>

<p>Few companies have deeper insights into the day-by-day state of venture capital than AngelList.</p>
<p>According to the company’s data, over 51% of the “top tier U.S. VC deals” involve their platform and tools, giving them a remarkably expansive view of everything going on.</p>
<p>AngelList Venture CEO Avlok Kohli joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage to discuss topics ranging from the state of the market to his thoughts on why there’s suddenly so much money flooding into VC (sending valuations to the sky), and where AngelList could go from here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417499555122323457">announced</a> today it will begin testing a new set of features for TweetDeck, the company&#8217;s often-ignored social media dashboard aimed at Twitter&#8217;s power users, which Twitter <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content">may soon turn into</a> a new subscription service. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1417501900409171971">a post from </a>Twitter Product Lead Kayvon Beykpour, the revamped version of the Twitter client will include a full tweet composer, new advanced search features, new column types and a new way to group columns into clean workspaces.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re testing new features in TweetDeck for a small group in the U.S., Canada and Australia. These include a full Tweet Composer, new advanced search features, new column types, and a new way to group columns into clean workspaces. <a href="https://t.co/7bTiwBPmea">https://t.co/7bTiwBPmea</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1417501900409171971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Beykpour earlier this year had teased Twitter&#8217;s plan to introduce an overhauled version of TweetDeck. In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder">an interview with The Verge</a>, he admitted that Twitter hadn&#8217;t &#8220;given TweetDeck a lot of love recently,&#8221; but said that would soon change with a revamp, which he then described as a &#8220;pretty big overhaul from the ground up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The update appears to be making good on that promise with a handful of notable changes.</p>
<p>For example, Twitter tells TechCrunch the new tweet composer will allow you to add GIFs, polls or emojis to your tweets, including scheduled tweets, not just photos and videos, as before. You also will be able to write threads and tag your images.</p>
<p>In addition to the large list of existing column options, users will be able to access new column types, including Profile, Topics, Explore, Events, Moments and Bookmarks. Unfortunately, this seems to have come at the expense of other column types, including Activity, Followers, Likes and Outbox, which have been removed.</p>
<p>The new advanced search feature lets you use Boolean queries. And you can now choose between viewing either the top tweets or the latest tweets in the first columns.</p>
<p>But one of the app&#8217;s more clever new additions is a feature called &#8220;Decks,&#8221; which will allow you to organize sets of columns into separate workspaces. This could help users who want to create different workspaces associated with different themes or interests. Or, for social media managers, it could help them keep up with tweets related to their many different clients, perhaps.</p>
<p>Despite the benefits some of the changes could provide, a number of responses from testers who gained access to the new TweetDeck weren&#8217;t all that positive. Users are complaining in particular about the loss of<a href="https://twitter.com/mike_the_maggot/status/1417529744157982723"> the &#8220;Activity&#8221; </a>column option that shows whenever anyone you follow on Twitter favorites a tweet or follows another user, as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/warnvod/status/1417578434226753540">the missing messages column</a>.</p>
<p>Others are annoyed that the Timeline <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_the_maggot/status/1417529744157982723">defaults to top tweets</a> instead of new tweets, that <a href="https://twitter.com/FredEOwens/status/1417553149049643017">you can&#8217;t create</a> a column for <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanBarkan/status/1417515620774580231">your direct messages</a> and that <a href="https://twitter.com/natethenate/status/1417565485898493956">collections are gone.</a> Some said it&#8217;s<a href="https://twitter.com/redgypsee/status/1417528004444491781"> too difficult</a> to resize the columns and they couldn&#8217;t figure out how to <a href="https://twitter.com/RohitAlexander/status/1417553207614640130">use it with multiple accounts</a>. Others said it needed<a href="https://twitter.com/luca/status/1417558362858864644"> a bottom scroll bar and the ability</a> to turn off images. <a href="https://twitter.com/natethenate/status/1417565489052585986">As one user put it</a>, &#8220;[This] isn&#8217;t a new TweetDeck. It&#8217;s a multi-column Twitter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worse, a post from TweetDeck itself about the update appeared to show a completely different type of app than what people were used to &#8212; with wide columns and a very large photo image taking up too much space. These would be the sort of changes that would ruin the information-dense experience most TweetDeck users prefer.</p>
<p>However, a <a href="https://twitter.com/EricZuck/status/1417531258201063424">more reassuring screenshot</a> from Twitter employee Eric Zuckerman, who works in news partnerships, showed off a version of the new TweetDeck that looks very much like the app people know and love, with tight columns, smaller images a smaller font size.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve been using the new TweetDeck preview for 9 months. If you&#39;re a longtime user and thrown off by the image below, rest assured you can customize your columns to look and behave very much like the version you know and love. For example, here&#39;s mine: <a href="https://t.co/i9bT1Mkfr8">pic.twitter.com/i9bT1Mkfr8</a> <a href="https://t.co/16dHgdVXAQ">https://t.co/16dHgdVXAQ</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s post also promoted the updated TweetDeck as something that would &#8220;incorporate more of what you see on Twitter.com,&#8221; which further confused and concerned <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417499555122323457">many TweetDeck users</a> who replied by pointing out that they use TweetDeck because it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> look or operate like Twitter&#8217;s web app <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetDeck/status/1417499555122323457">and is free of the many extra features</a> Twitter introduces.</p>
<p>A Twitter engineer, Angelo Tomasco,<a href="https://twitter.com/angetomasco/status/1417544518795243523"> clarified</a> that the changes aren&#8217;t only about making TweetDeck &#8220;look more like Twitter&#8221; &#8212; they&#8217;re about a shared infrastructure that will bring health and safety updates to TweetDeck and allow Twitter developers to spend less time playing catch-up with Twitter so they can instead build out new features and address user feedback.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s not only about making it &quot;look more like Twitter&quot;. The shared infrastructure brings all sort of health and safety features out of the box, and we as developers have to spend less time to play catch-up and more time to develop new features and address feedback.</p>
<p>&mdash; Angelo Tomasco (@angetomasco) <a href="https://twitter.com/angetomasco/status/1417544518795243523?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Whatever your opinion, you can at least be assured that the version of TweetDeck arriving today to testers is not the final product.</p>
<p>Twitter says it will roll out the new version to a small group of randomly selected people in the U.S., Canada and Australia to start. (Of course, app researcher Jane Manchun Wong has <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1417520652634836992">already found a workaround</a> for that limitation, if you&#8217;re interested!)</p>
<p>And Twitter says it will listen and respond to user feedback about the changes.</p>
<p>It will have to, in fact, as Twitter tells us this test is about exploring how it could make TweetDeck a part of its subscription offerings in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this test, we hope to gather feedback to explore what an enhanced version of TweetDeck could look like within Twitter’s subscription offerings later on,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson said. &#8220;We’ll have more to share later as we learn from this test,&#8221; they noted.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Maine has joined a growing number of cities, counties and states that are rejecting dangerously biased surveillance technologies like facial recognition.</p>
<p>The new law, which is the strongest statewide facial recognition law in the country, not only received broad, bipartisan support, but it passed unanimously in both chambers of the state legislature. Lawmakers and advocates spanning the political spectrum &#8212; from the progressive lawmaker who sponsored the bill to the Republican members who voted it out of committee, from the ACLU of Maine to state law enforcement agencies &#8212; came together to secure this major victory for Mainers and anyone who cares about their right to privacy.</p>
<p>Maine is just the latest success story in the nationwide movement to ban or tightly regulate the use of facial recognition technology, an effort led by grassroots activists and organizations like the ACLU. From the Pine Tree State to the Golden State, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/topic/stopping-face-recognition-surveillance/?redirect=facerecognition">national efforts</a> to regulate facial recognition demonstrate a broad recognition that we can’t let technology determine the boundaries of our freedoms in the digital 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facial recognition technology poses a profound threat to civil rights and civil liberties. Without democratic oversight, governments can use the technology as a tool for dragnet surveillance, threatening our freedoms of speech and association, due process rights, and right to be left alone. Democracy itself is at stake if this technology remains unregulated.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Facial recognition technology poses a profound threat to civil rights and civil liberties.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We know the burdens of facial recognition are not borne equally, as Black and brown communities &#8212; especially Muslim and immigrant communities &#8212; are already targets of discriminatory government surveillance. Making matters worse, face surveillance algorithms tend to have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/12/19/federal-study-confirms-racial-bias-many-facial-recognition-systems-casts-doubt-their-expanding-use/">more difficulty</a> accurately analyzing the faces of darker-skinned people, women, the elderly and children. Simply put: The technology is dangerous when it works &#8212; and when it doesn’t.</p>
<p>But not all approaches to regulating this technology are created equal. Maine is among the first in the nation to pass comprehensive statewide regulations. Washington was the first, passing a weak law in the face of <a href="https://www.aclu-wa.org/story/we-need-face-surveillance-moratorium-not-weak-regulations-concerns-about-sb-6280">strong opposition</a> from civil rights, community and religious liberty organizations. The law passed in large part because of strong backing from Washington-based megacorporation Microsoft. Washington’s facial recognition law would still allow tech companies to sell their technology, worth millions of dollars, to every conceivable government agency.</p>
<p>In contrast, Maine’s law strikes a different path, putting the interests of ordinary Mainers above the profit motives of private companies.</p>
<p>Maine’s new law prohibits the use of facial recognition technology in most areas of government, including in public schools and for surveillance purposes. It creates carefully carved out exceptions for law enforcement to use facial recognition, creating standards for its use and avoiding the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html">potential for abuse</a> we’ve seen in other parts of the country. Importantly, it prohibits the use of facial recognition technology to conduct surveillance of people as they go about their business in Maine, attending political meetings and protests, visiting friends and family, and seeking out healthcare.</p>
<p>In Maine, law enforcement must now &#8212; among other limitations &#8212; meet a probable cause standard before making a facial recognition request, and they cannot use a facial recognition match as the sole basis to arrest or search someone. Nor can local police departments buy, possess or use their own facial recognition software, ensuring shady technologies like Clearview AI will not be used by Maine’s government officials behind closed doors, as <a href="https://data.aclum.org/public-records/frt-ma/private-companies/clearview_ai/">has happened</a> in other <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement">states</a>.</p>
<p>Maine’s law and others like it are crucial to preventing communities from being harmed by new, untested surveillance technologies like facial recognition. But we need a federal approach, not only a piecemeal local approach, to effectively protect Americans’ privacy from facial surveillance. That’s why it’s crucial for Americans to support the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/7356/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded">Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act</a>, a bill introduced by members of both houses of Congress last month.</p>
<p>The ACLU supports this federal legislation that would protect all people in the United States from invasive surveillance. We urge all Americans to ask their members of Congress to join the movement to halt facial recognition technology and support it, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobileye, a subsidiary of Intel, has expanded its autonomous vehicle testing program to New York City as part of its strategy to develop and deploy the technology.</p>
<p>New York City joins a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/mobileye-is-bringing-its-autonomous-vehicle-test-fleets-to-at-least-four-more-cities-in-2021/">number of other cities</a> including Detroit, Paris, Shanghai and Tokyo where Mobileye has either launched testing or plans to this year. Mobileye launched its first test fleet in Jerusalem in 2018 and added one in Munich in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we want to build something that will scale, we need to be able to drive in challenging places and almost everywhere,&#8221; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Mobileye president and CEO Amnon Shashua</span> said during a presentation Tuesday that was streamed live. As part of the announcement, Mobileye also released a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/resources/press-kit-mobileye-new-york-city.html?cid=em&amp;source=elo&amp;campid=smg_WW_bracbu_EMPR_EN_2021_0720_Mobileye_Now_Testing_C-MKA-22955_T-MKA-25848&amp;content=smg_WW_bracbu_EMPR_EN_2021_0720_Mobileye_Now_Testing_C-MKA-22955_T-MKA-25848&amp;elq_cid=1494219&amp;em_id=71560&amp;elqrid=3d46c6de890543179e4aad43e5930f23&amp;elqcampid=45621&amp;erpm_id=4074574">40-minute unedited video</a> of one of its test vehicles equipped with a self-driving system navigating New York&#8217;s city streets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These vehicles, which began testing in New York City last month, are driving autonomously with a safety operator behind the wheel using only cameras. The vehicles are equipped with 8 long-range and 4 parking cameras powered by its fifth generation system on chip called EyeQ5.</p>
<p>That does not mean that Mobileye is taking a camera-only approach to autonomy once it deploys. The company has also developed another subsystem with lidar and radar, but no cameras that also drives autonomously. The two subsystems of sensors and software will be combined and integrated to provide redundancy in robotaxis. The camera-only subsystem is what Shashua described as at &#8220;the cost level for consumers&#8221; and one that will be used to evolve driving assist systems. Later this year, Mobilieye&#8217;s camera-only system using the EyeQ5 SoC will be launched in a Geely Auto Group vehicle.</p>
<p>New York City has been in Shashua&#8217;s sights for more than six months. He<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> first mentioned a desire to test on public roads in New York during the virtual 2021 CES tech trade show in January with the caveat that the company would need to receive </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">regulatory approval. Now, with that regulatory approval in hand, Mobileye is the only company currently permitted to test AVs in the state and city. GM&#8217;s self-driving subsidiary Cruise outlined in 2017 a plan to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/17/cruises-self-driving-chevrolet-bolts-are-coming-to-new-york-next-year/">test AVs in New York</a> and even mapped parts of lower Manhattan. The company never scaled up the test program in NYC, deciding instead to focus on its primary target for commercial deployment: San Francisco. </span></p>
<p>Mobileye applied for a permit through New York State&#8217;s autonomous vehicle technology demonstration and testing program. The company met the requirements outlined in the program which includes compliance with all federal standards and applicable New York State inspection standards as well as a law enforcement interaction plan, according to Mobileye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything special about receiving approval you simply need to go through this process, Shashua said, who described it has lengthy and in some ways similar to the stringent requirements to test in Germany. &#8220;I think what is special is that it&#8217;s very very difficult to drive here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mobileye is perhaps best known for supplying automakers with computer vision technology that powers advanced driver assistance systems. It’s a business that generated nearly $$967 million in sales for the company. Today, 88 million vehicles on the road are using Mobileye’s computer vision technology.</p>
<p>Mobileye has also been developing automated vehicle technology. Its full self-driving stack &#8212; which includes redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology — is combined with its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy.</p>
<p>Mobileye&#8217;s REM mapping system crowdsources data by tapping into consumer and fleet vehicles equipped with its so-called EyeQ4, or fourth generation system on chip, to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems. That data is not video or images but compressed text that collects about 10 kilobits per kilometer. Mobileye has agreements with six OEMs, including BMW, Nissan and Volkswagen, to collect that data on vehicles equipped with the EyeQ4 chip, which is used to power the advanced driver assistance system. On fleet vehicles, Mobileye collects data from an after-market product it sells to commercial operators.</p>
<p>Mobileye&#8217;s technology is mapping nearly 8 million kilometers day globally, including in New York City.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The strategy, Shashua contends, will allow the company to efficiently launch and operate commercial robotaxi services as well as bring the technology to consumer passenger vehicles by 2025. Shashua explained this dual approach in an interview with TechCrunch in 2020. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;There was realization that dawned on us awhile ago,&#8221; he said at the time. &#8220;The Holy Grail of this business is passenger car autonomy: where you buy a passenger car and you pay an option price and with a press of button it can take you autonomously to wherever you want to go. The realization is that you can’t reach that Holy Grail if you don’t go through the robotaxi business.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Shashua said Mobileye was the only company that has its foot in both camps. (Although it should be noted that Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet does have some strategic overlap.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building our technology in a way that supports scale, especially geographic scale, using our crowdsourced mapping technology and building new sensors such that the entire package — the entire system — will be under $5,000 cost to allow consumer AVs, and on the other hand, we have a division building a mobility-as-a-service or robotaxi service,&#8221; Shashua said Tuesday. &#8220;This is one of the reasons why we purchased Moovit last year, to enable the customer facing of all the layers above the self-driving system to enable mobility-as-a-service business.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tech boom in Southeast Asia isn’t just seeding a wave of new entrepreneurs building the next generation of unicorns, it’s also ushering young talent into the roles of first-time managers. And NewCampus, a Singapore-based startup co-founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hellowillfan/?originalSubdomain=sg">Will Fan</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaofei?originalSubdomain=sg">Fei Yao</a>, announced today that it has raised millions of dollars to help coming of age companies train their maturing workforce to help them grow into those new, larger roles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newcampus.co/">NewCampus</a> is an online, live learning platform that hopes to train rising managers within hyper-growth organizations. Its leadership “sprints” focus on topics like retaining knowledge, and what goes into curating a safe environment for teams. The company was part of SuperCharger Ventures’ inaugural edtech accelerator, and today announced that it has attracted millions of dollars in investor interest.</p>
<p>The startup has closed a seed financing round of $2.5 million in a round led by Juvo Ventures’ Maia Sharpley. Other investors include Zanichelli Venture, M Venture Partners, 27V, Pavan Katepalli, the former chief learning officer at Trilogy Education, along with existing investors SOSV and 500 Startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While first describing itself as a membership gym for<strong> </strong>learning experiences, the 2019-founded startup raised capital to further invest in its latest iteration: an up-skilling platform for SMBs.</p>
<p>Currently, NewCampus builds content in-house, and then asks industry experts to come in and add in their flair of expertise. Users are expected to dedicate between four to five hours a week for work, with 90 minutes of that time devoted to live, instructor-led workshops. The material differs from other online programs by focusing on more philosophical skills, like how to create a safe environment for teams or how to retain knowledge, instead of topics like like Finance 101. Currently, its content looks more general, serving the emerging manager in tech, not the first-time manager handling a fintech startup during a pivot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179909" style="width: 812px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179909" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2179909" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png" alt="newcampus-ux-seed" width="802" height="452" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png 1640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Classes.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179909" class="wp-caption-text">NewCampus offers live classes for first-time managers. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> NewCampus</p></div></p>
<p>There’s a lot of workforce training tools on the market right now: Udemy, BetterUp, Skillshare, Udacity; but NewCampus is confident that it can win by selling to a market it believes is underserved: Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>NewCampus targets companies that have a presence of between 500 to 1,000 people in the Southeast Asia region. Fan mentioned how companies like Grab, GoJek and Carousell still turn to local trainers in countries like Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore &#8212; giving his company an opportunity to come in and bring more advanced pedagogy and branding.</p>
<p>While India’s frenzy of hiring and retaining talent is not to be missed, the co-founder says that the startup is looking in other, less-crowded markets.</p>
<p>“[The customer] may be a 600-person fintech company with an HQ in Hong Kong, but their management team is sitting in Hong Kong, their sales teams in Sydney, Melbourne, their dev team is in Indonesia and their sales team is in Philippines, and already that breakdown of managing remote teams is sophisticated and nuanced in its own way,” Fan said.</p>
<p>Yao likened the momentum around improving diversity and inclusion efforts in the United States to the momentum around enhancing cross-cultural communication in Southeast Asia, “because of how fragmented the market is and how fast teams are growing across the region.” She added that a lot of United States-based upskilling products “don’t speak to the rest of the world,” which gives NewCampus a chance to curate an instructor pool, time zone focus and product for its end users.</p>
<p>Smaller organizations can buy annual subscriptions for their managers to take general content courses, while larger organizations can pay for in-house programs that NewCampus will then manage and run themselves. As with any B2B business model, selling to an institution versus an individual appears to be more lucrative over time when the startup starts serving hundreds and thousands of managers. However, Yao stressed that NewCampus’ strategic advantage is more in helping upskill smaller organizations.</p>

<p>“It actually really does serve underserved businesses that don&#8217;t have access to traditional training facilities at those price points,” Yao said. “At the same time, a lot of the companies that we’re currently working with are more familiar with keeping something that’s within their company, it’s a bit of a balance of both.” The split between individual programming and in-house programming is currently 50/50.</p>
<p>Currently about 80% of NewCampus’ learners and 60% of its instructors identify as women.</p>
<h2>Testing the tester</h2>
<p>The test for NewCampus is if it can scale its content to be effective and inclusive of hundreds of thousands of emerging managers. This will require the company to niche down its content to specific managerial paths depending on profession, or grow bigger and serve seasoned managers as well.</p>
<p>NewCampus is pursuing university accreditation, which suggests that it sees itself eventually becoming a replacement for traditional degrees. Fan likened it to how fintech startups acquired banking licenses half a decade ago, in an attempt to build brand awareness and trust.</p>
<p>Per a number of investors who had seen NewCampus’ pitch deck, the university licensing move is a nod to NewCampus’ initial bet: that it could become an alternative to the MBA.</p>

<p>The issue with modern business schools is that much of the utility in higher-ed isn’t the content, but the network and brand name making its way to a student&#8217;s resume. While NewCampus may thus lean on accreditation as differentiation, it really needs to lean on different ways to signal to society that its content &#8212; and consumers of its content &#8212; matters. Yao thinks that investors may be off on NewCampus’ interpretation of replacing the business school degree.</p>
<p>“They’re thinking of big names, like Stanford and Harvard,” she said. “We’re taking on the vertical of business education as a whole, the people who come to us, they’re not the people who haven’t gotten into Harvard, they’re 100% the people who had never considered Harvard to begin with.”</p>

		Alex Dalyac is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://tractable.ai/">Tractable</a>, which develops artificial intelligence for accident and disaster recovery. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today, Tractable is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/tractable-raises-60m-at-a-1b-valuation-to-make-damage-appraisals-using-ai/">worth $1 billion</a>. Our AI is used by millions of people across the world to recover faster from road accidents, and it also helps recycle as many cars as Tesla puts on the road.</p>
<p>And yet six years ago, Tractable was just me and Raz (Razvan Ranca, CTO), two college grads coding in a basement. Here’s how we did it, and what we learned along the way.</p>
<h2>Build upon a fresh technological breakthrough</h2>
<p>In 2013, I was fortunate to get into artificial intelligence (more specifically, deep learning) six months before it blew up internationally. It started when I took a course on Coursera called &#8220;Machine learning with neural networks&#8221; by Geoffrey Hinton. It was like being love struck. Back then, to me AI was science fiction, like &#8220;The Terminator.&#8221;</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Narrowly focusing on a branch of applied science that was undergoing a paradigm shift which hadn’t yet reached the business world changed everything.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But an article in the tech press said the academic field was amid a resurgence. As a result of 100x larger training data sets and 100x higher compute power becoming available by reprogramming GPUs (graphics cards), a huge leap in predictive performance had been attained in image classification a year earlier. This meant computers were starting to be able to understand what’s in an image — like humans do.</p>
<p>The next step was getting this technology into the real world. While at university — Imperial College London — teaming up with much more skilled people, we built a <a href="http://whatplant.github.io">plant recognition app</a> with deep learning. We walked our professor through Hyde Park, watching him take photos of flowers with the app and laughing from joy as the AI recognized the right plant species. This had previously been impossible.</p>
<p>I started spending every spare moment on image classification with deep learning. Still, no one was talking about it in the news — even Imperial’s computer vision lab wasn’t yet on it! I felt like I was in on a revolutionary secret.</p>
<p>Looking back, narrowly focusing on a branch of applied science undergoing a breakthrough paradigm shift that hadn’t yet reached the business world changed everything.</p>
<h2>Search for complementary co-founders who will become your best friends</h2>
<p>I’d previously been rejected from <a href="https://www.joinef.com">Entrepreneur First</a> (EF), one of the world’s best incubators, for not knowing anything about tech. Having changed that, I applied again.</p>
<p>The last interview was a hackathon, where I met Raz. He was doing machine learning research at Cambridge, had topped EF’s technical test, and published papers on reconstructing shredded documents and on poker bots that could detect bluffs. His bare-bones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150520105005/https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rr463/">webpage</a> read: &#8220;I seek data-driven solutions to currently intractable problems.&#8221; Now that had a ring to it (and where we’d get the name for Tractable).</p>
<p>That hackathon, we coded all night. The morning after, he and I knew something special was happening between us. We moved in together and would spend years side by side, 24/7, from waking up to Pantera in the morning to coding marathons at night.</p>
<p>But we also wouldn’t have got where we are without Adrien (Cohen, president), who joined as our third co-founder right after our seed round. Adrien had previously co-founded Lazada, an online supermarket in South East Asia like Amazon and Alibaba, which sold to Alibaba for $1.5 billion. Adrien would teach us how to build a business, inspire trust and hire world-class talent.</p>
<h2>Find potential customers early so you can work out market fit</h2>
<p>Tractable started at EF with a head start — a paying customer. Our first use case was … plastic pipe welds.</p>
<p>It was as glamorous as it sounds. Pipes that carry water and natural gas to your home are made of plastic. They’re connected by welds (melt the two plastic ends, connect them, let them cool down and solidify again as one). Image classification AI could visually check people’s weld setups to ensure good quality. Most of all, it was real-world value for breakthrough AI.</p>
<p>And yet in the end, they — our only paying customer — stopped working with us, just as we were raising our first round of funding. That was rough. Luckily, the number of pipe weld inspections was too small a market to interest investors, so we explored other use cases — utilities, geology, dermatology and medical imaging.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our kids can&#8217;t read. As of 2019, roughly a third of U.S. fourth graders were <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=147">unable to read at the level expected of them</a>. The scores have barely changed in decades. Something isn&#8217;t working here.</p>
<p><a href="https://litnerd.com">Litnerd</a>, a company out of New York City, wants to try something new. They&#8217;re writing books and building lesson plans with a twist: professional actors, streamed into the class, to recreate scenes from each book and — hopefully! — help keep students engaged.</p>
<p>Litnerd programs are built as four one-hour, once-a-week sessions. Students read the book between sessions; once a week, an actor is streamed to the class to re-enact scenes, bring everything together and move the story along. Sometimes this actor&#8217;s segment is pre-recorded. Other times it&#8217;s live, with choose-your-own-adventure elements mixed in to let the students steer the ship.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Something about the whole thing just tugs at my heart strings. It reminds me of &#8220;auditorium day&#8221; in school; those rare days in which our school brought in a special performer — a singer, a motivational speaker, a puppet show, whatever — to somehow wrangle our collective attention. Those days felt so unique, so special. Even decades later, fond memories of those days stick with me.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s currently basing its lesson plans around existing stories and content, Litnerd has its own publishing operation in the works. The goal is to identify the categories and genres that best catch each age group&#8217;s (Pre-K through fifth grade) attention, then write books that, as the team puts it, &#8220;help celebrate diversity and inclusion so that all children can see themselves in the stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Litnerd began its life during the pandemic under a different name: TinyBroadway. TinyBroadway shared a lot of its DNA with what would eventually become Litnerd — actors, beamed in through the magic of the internet, work through lessons and crafts with a handful of kids at a time. Litnerd shifts the concept from B2C to B2B; whereas TinyBroadway&#8217;s customer was the parent looking to fill their own kid&#8217;s schedule, Litnerd dramatically expands its audience (and hopefully deepens its impact as a result) by working with schools.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179964" style="width: 680px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179964" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2179964 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/litnerd-2.jpg?w=670" alt="" width="670" height="414" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/litnerd-2.jpg 670w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/litnerd-2.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/litnerd-2.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/litnerd-2.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179964" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Litnerd</p></div></p>
<p>I asked ( via email) Litnerd CEO and founder Anisa Mirza for her thoughts on the shift:</p>
<p>&#8220;The reality is, the majority of Americans, some 95%, cannot afford homeschooling. Especially when it comes to K-5 years. And doubly when it comes to parents of children belonging to Title 1 schools (majority of NYC schools),&#8221; she writes. &#8220;This isn’t simply because parents can’t pay out of pocket. Rather, because for 95% of Americans, school represents free daycare (if both parents have to work a typical 9-5, they cannot afford to stay home and watch little Anisa, no matter how fabulous the online homeschool teacher is!). This is when I realized that if we truly want to disrupt K-12 (esp K-5) education, we need a solution that works from the outside in &#8211; being part of classroom time and funded by schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>Working with schools introduces new challenges and processes, varying a bit from city to city and state to state. In many regions, schools can&#8217;t just bring in a company like this on a whim — they&#8217;ve got to work with pre-approved, contracted vendors. Since becoming an approved vendor with the New York City Department of Education earlier this year, Anisa tells me more than 14,000 students have taken part in Litnerd&#8217;s programs. She expects that number to double in the coming months.</p>
<p>Litnerd&#8217;s books, workshops and lesson plans are built around the social and emotional learning (<a href="http://www.p12.nysed.gov/sss/documents/NYSSELBenchmarks.pdf">or SEL</a>) practices that most U.S. states expect, bringing in topics like self-awareness, responsible decision making and social awareness to help students grow more than just their ability to read.</p>
<p>Each book comes with its own lesson plan, complete with worksheets and activities for the students and suggested dialogue to help teachers identify and highlight the intended learnings from the stories.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwWy2UGT0_Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Importantly, the company seems quite mindful about how it all plays out from the teacher&#8217;s perspective. They know that most teachers already have far too much to do, and design lesson plans with the goal of minimizing the amount of work they&#8217;re adding to a teacher&#8217;s day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need SEL for the teachers, too,&#8221; Mirza tells me. &#8220;We need a social and emotional break for them, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a pretty dang cool gig for actors, particularly as the live acting industry works to recover from the pandemic. Actors currently perform and record all their sessions from home; as Litnerd grows, the company hopes to open up co-working space-style drop-in studios.</p>
<p>Litnerd is currently focused on expanding to more schools in New York City, growing beyond that as the varying regional processes allow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Maya Moufarek, founder of <a href="https://marketingcube.co/">Marketing Cube</a>, spent more than 15 years working for companies like Google and American Express before launching her own growth consultancy. Today, her London-based firm works with startups around the world — and her startup clients have raved about the results, based on what we&#8217;ve heard in our <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">TechCrunch Experts growth marketing survey</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;She&#8217;s an absolute powerhouse who knows growth better than anyone I know,&#8221; according to Alice at <a href="https://theldown.com/">The Lowdown</a>. Nikki O’Farrell of <a href="https://katkin.club/">KatKin</a> told us that &#8220;[She has an] expert ear and eye from the world of startups/scaleups and growth. Her functional and direct approach allows you to execute at speed and see results quickly.&#8221; Constance at <a href="http://www.getluko.com">Luko</a> said that they &#8220;[r]eally liked her mindset, both hands-on, no bullshit while also super strategic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>We interviewed Moufarek to get her take on lessons she’s learned from working with larger companies, how she applies them to smaller companies, her approach to optimizing her clients’ success, trends she’s seeing in growth marketing and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>(This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.)</em></p>
<p><strong>We received many testimonials about you through our<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/"> TechCrunch Experts</a> project that mentioned your direct approach and hands-on experience. How do you think those qualities contribute to your success in working with startups and forming strategies?</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, a lot of the time ambitious founders and executive teams don’t have a marketing background, so they need to outsource to find the right support to deliver on huge growth ambitions &#8212; usually within very limited time frames.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;Choose a marketer or agency with no direct experience and you may simply get the wrong answer for your situation.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In that situation, experience is everything &#8212; there’s no one-size-fits-all marketing approach for startups. Marketing strategies that help find product-market fit are very different from acquiring your first 100 customers, which is very different from scaling your customer acquisition or lead generation. There are also a lot of intricacies to this sort of role, which makes it pretty unique &#8212; choose a marketer or agency with no direct experience and you may simply get the wrong answer for your situation.</p>
<p>Having gained 15+ years of experience in a range of businesses &#8212; from startups to conglomerates, and experience of Series A to private equity &#8212; I’ve had the opportunity to actually apply the tried-and-tested practices of hypergrowth, as well as offer the full stack of C-level support. That’s why I founded<a href="http://marketingcube.co/"> MarketingCube.co</a>, a boutique strategic growth consultancy for innovative startups and scaleups.</p>
<p>Being direct is critical, because by their very nature, startups are after fast and transformative outcomes, not never-ending presentations and lengthy processes, so a hands-on approach is crucial. You need to get straight to the beating heart of the business, understand the culture, involve the right people &#8212; and be comfortable telling founders and exec teams things they don’t always want to hear. In return, they get a solid foundation, ambitious deliverables, and the right tools to hit the ground running and continue to do so after you leave the room.</p>
<p><strong>What lessons did you learn from working with larger companies such as Google and American Express that you use when working with startups?</strong></p>
<p>Now, everyone sees Google as this huge company with endless products and expansive teams, but back in 2005 when I worked there, it didn’t seem like a megacompany. It was post-IPO hypergrowth, but the EMEA and emerging markets I contributed to were like regional startups within a scaleup. At the other end of the scale, American Express was a more traditional and established corporation with legacy systems and processes that was beginning to go through a digital transformation.</p>
<p>So the lessons learnt from these companies vary widely &#8212; but there are some universal principles that are always relevant.</p>
<p>One lesson &#8212; which was especially true at Amex &#8212; is to always be prepared for shifting markets that may disrupt your business. That may seem strange advice for a new startup, but the economy is volatile and things change very fast. It’s hard to prepare for every situation, but you need to have the vision and drive to lead the market, as well as the means to execute it.</p>
<p>In terms of CX/UX, I tell everyone I work with that less is <em>always</em> more. It might be a cliché, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true. By this I mean, customers want fewer clicks, fewer words and simpler, more direct steps to reach their end goal.</p>
<p>Google really understood that it’s essential to provide your customers with a seamless experience and to delight them throughout &#8212; after all, customers are the lifeblood of any successful business.</p>
<p>If your organization is truly customer-centric, it’s always possible to deliver a digital transformation successfully or adapt to a changing market. Amex has shown how a brand and business can reinvent itself many times over.</p>
<p>Finally, always agree on a clear set of objectives and key results (OKRs) to ensure focus, prioritization and collaboration. Agility and speed are the competitive advantages of young businesses and OKRs help deliver that, as well as create accountability.</p>

<p><strong>When looking at your portfolio, you’ve worked with companies in various areas, like Pexxi/Tuune in health tech, YuLife in insurtech and Andjaro in HR tech. How does your approach to each client differ to make sure you’re optimizing your clients&#8217; success in their field?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing is that &#8212; regardless of their specialism &#8212; every company is at a different stage and has different needs. So asking the right questions, setting the right goals, and including the right people and teams at the start is key.</p>
<p>Beyond that, each business model, industry and audience has its own principles, best practices and proven strategies. For instance, in health and finance, credibility and trust are critical. Whereas for an HR SaaS brand, the challenge is all around driving adoption because the market they are creating is totally new.</p>
<p>So, I always start with an audit of their customer base or target audience:</p>
<ul>
<li>What role are they hiring the business to do?</li>
<li>What problem are they solving?</li>
<li>What value do they add?</li>
</ul>
<p>I find Clayton Christensen’s <a href="https://marketingcube.co/the-framework-every-start-up-should-consider-jtbd/">jobs to be done</a> (JTBD) framework very powerful because it’s relevant to the product, marketing <em>and</em> strategy teams. It’s built on the assumption that consumers don’t buy products, they “hire” solutions … and they can “fire” them just as quickly if they’re not doing the job properly. It shifts the focus away from the “ideal” customer persona to the real issue and how to solve it.</p>
<p>Understanding the business levers and <a href="https://blog.growthhackers.com/finding-your-north-star-metric-fc1c1f71cbcb">Sean Ellis’ North Star metric</a> is vital for growth. It’s about focusing on the metric that directly reflects the value that your company and products bring to your customers. For example, for Airbnb that may be the number of nights booked; for Spotify, minutes listened to. It’s all about simplifying your strategy into something that is digestible, memorable and applicable.</p>
<p>The North Star metric is not a revenue metric. Revenue is the result of the value you deliver. Not the value itself.</p>
<p><strong>What do startups continue to get wrong? </strong></p>
<p>All too often startups don’t truly know their audience or make the mistake of thinking that brand-building can wait.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/"> CB Insights</a>, “no market need” is the main reason startups fail, coming in at 42%. For me, this shows that too often founders do not fully understand the market potential and its alternatives, their customers’ pain points and anxieties, what’s pushing the audience away from their current solutions, and what the pull points are for the business.</p>
<p>This is why I really love the JTBD framework &#8212; it stops you from seeing the customer like a strict “persona” and lets you start seeing the solutions they need to find instead.</p>
<p>No matter what maturity stage or success level of the startup/scaleup, we often end up going back to customer insights and really stress-testing how well they know their audience to help elevate their value proposition, messaging and growth opportunities.</p>
<p>When it comes to brand-building, a brand really exists in the hearts and minds of consumers, which makes it hard to quantify. So founders often delay the brand-building process or laying the foundations for one. But an established brand helps increase perceived value, unlocking incredible margins or market share, depending on a firm’s pricing strategy.</p>
<p>Strong, effective brands are not built overnight. Many founders think that brand-building means costly advertising, which is not the case. Brand-building occurs at every interaction between a brand and its customer base across the purchase lifecycle &#8212; pre (advertising), during (how and where the purchase happens) and post (CRM, warranties, customer service).</p>
<p><strong>On the other side, what are startups doing better now than ever before?</strong></p>
<p>Right now, startups are working on bolder, more diverse and more impactful issues.</p>
<p>I started angel investing and it gave me exposure to a fantastic and wide variety of founders and innovative ideas. I have been fascinated by how far and wide founders are spread to help reshape our lives and change the future.</p>
<p>A few recent businesses that have inspired me are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.fairhq.co/">FairHQ</a> blends scientific research, data-driven insights and best practices to help you embed D&amp;I into your business.</li>
<li><a href="https://thefertilitycircle.com/">Fertility Circle</a> helps find the best tailored fertility information for parents. With one in six struggling to conceive, they connect individuals with a supportive community and provide access to expert medical professionals.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hapiplan.com/">Hapi plan</a> empowers family and friends to invest in their children to ensure their financial security for the present and in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What major trends are you seeing right now with hiring growth marketers?</strong></p>
<p>I often hear founders say that “growth is the new engineering.” Tech companies have been fighting over engineering talent for as long as I can remember, and now it’s the same for growth talent.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I think there are multiple reasons: One being the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as businesses heavily impacted by the crisis are now hiring at the speed of light. A lot of small businesses applied the “cut deep and early” recommendations to manage their cash flow, so they now need to rebuild entire marketing and growth functions.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a lot of funding going into startups at the moment, so there has been a huge spike in demand for growth talent. Lastly, as we’ve all seen, the crisis catapulted the digitization of businesses and purchase funnels for more established businesses that now need digital growth marketing talent to help maintain their sustainability.</p>
<p>During times of disruption, there is a great opportunity for innovation, and from what I’ve seen, this has made hiring managers and recruiters quite creative about how they go about sourcing and attracting growth talent. Lots have expanded their geographical search thanks to remote working becoming the norm. Some even applied account-based marketing best practices by building target lists of talent and creating automated sequences to reach out to them. It’s been really interesting to see.</p>
<p><strong>In your “<a href="https://marketingcube.co/hiring-growth-marketers-where-to-begin/">Hiring Growth Marketers — Where to Begin</a>” post on your website, you mention the T-shaped growth marketer. How has the shift in company’s priorities during the pandemic changed the skills that growth marketers consider essential in their T?</strong></p>
<p>During the pandemic, we had two categories of businesses: (a) those seriously impacted by the restrictions and (b) those who saw a spike in demand for services, like Deliveroo and Netflix.</p>
<p>Those severely affected had to pivot and pivot quickly to survive. A great example is Airbnb, launching digital tours and online experiences to support their hosts and ensure they continue connecting with guests. Another is Oxwash, previously exclusively washing laundry within the hospitality industry, who shifted their business to cleaning scrubs and bedding for NHS hospitals during the height of the pandemic. By adapting, they learned to clean to clinical NHS standards and help keep a strained health service afloat. For these businesses, the flexibility and customer development were the essential elements of the T in their growth teams, as they had to build an entirely new proposition on the fly.</p>
<p>On the flip side, businesses who thrived through lockdown saw an increase in requirement for CRM skills and merchandising. To find the right tone to match the mood of the nation &#8212; and curate relevant recommendations or services to engage with existing and new customers &#8212; was the name of the game. Data and analytics became an essential skill to make sense of the changing behaviors, and understanding how to manage pandemic demand levels, especially as companies like Ocado early in the pandemic struggled to meet customer demand and so allocated limited slots for delivery.</p>
<p>The wealth of knowledge and adaptability of the growth teams in both of these types of businesses shows how valuable T-shaped marketers are to whether businesses big and small fail or succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PayPal-owned payments app Venmo will no longer offer a public, global feed of users&#8217; transactions, as part of a significant redesign focused on expanding the app&#8217;s privacy controls and better highlighting some of Venmo&#8217;s newer features. The company says it will instead only show users their &#8220;friends feed&#8221; &#8212; meaning, the app&#8217;s social feed where you can see just your friends&#8217; transactions.</p>
<p>Venmo has struggled over the years to balance its desire to add a social element to its peer-to-peer payments-based network, with the need to offer users their privacy.</p>
<p>A few years ago, the company was forced to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/the-ftc-settles-with-venmo-over-a-series-of-privacy-and-security-violations/">settle a complaint with the FTC</a> over its handling of privacy disclosures in the app along with other issues related to the security and privacy of user transactions. One of the concerns at the time was a setting that made all transactions public by default &#8212; a feature the FTC said wasn&#8217;t being properly explained to customers. As part of the settlement, Venmo had to inform both new and existing users how to limit the visibility of their transactions, among other changes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, privacy issues have continued to follow Venmo over the years. More recently, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo">BuzzFeed News</a> was able to track down President Biden&#8217;s secret Venmo account because of the lack of privacy around Venmo friend lists, for example. Afterwards, the company <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/venmo-private-friends-list">rolled out friend-list privacy controls</a> to address the issue.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179774" style="width: 398px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179774" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2179774" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png?w=388" alt="" width="388" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png 601w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png?resize=171,300 171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png?resize=388,680 388w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Home_phone141.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179774" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>In the newly updated app, Venmo will still highlight this friend-list privacy setting so users can choose whether or not they want to have their profile appear on other people&#8217;s friends&#8217; lists. Users will also still be able to remove or add contacts from their friend list at any time, block people and set their transaction privacy either as they post or retroactively to public, private or friends-only. It&#8217;s unclear what advantage posting publicly has though, as the global, public feed is gone. Instead, public transactions would be visible to a users&#8217; nonfriends only when someone visited their profile directly.</p>

<p>In addition to the privacy changes, Venmo&#8217;s redesign aims to make it easier for people to discover the app&#8217;s new features, the company says.</p>
<p>Now, a new bottom navigation option will allow users to toggle between their social feed, Venmo&#8217;s products like the Venmo Card and crypto, and their personal profile. The newly elevated &#8220;Cards&#8221; section will allow Venmo Credit and Debit cardholders to manage their cards and access their rewards and offers, as before. Meanwhile, the &#8220;Crypto&#8221; tab will let users learn and explore the world of crypto, view real-time trends and buy, sell or hold different types of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179776" style="width: 398px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179776" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2179776" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png?w=388" alt="" width="388" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png 601w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png?resize=171,300 171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png?resize=388,680 388w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/You_phone111.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179776" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>Venmo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">first added support for crypto</a> earlier this year, following parent company PayPal&#8217;s move to do the same, and now offers access to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. Before, the option appeared as a small button next to the &#8220;Pay or Request&#8221; button at the bottom of the screen, which contributed to Venmo&#8217;s cluttered feel.</p>
<p>The updated app will also include support for new payment types and expanded purchase protections, which Venmo <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-06-28-A-New-Way-to-Buy-and-Sell-with-Confidence-on-Venmo">announced</a> last month, and said would arrive on July 20. Customers will now be able to indicate if their purchase is for &#8220;goods and services&#8221; when they transact with a seller, which will make the transactions eligible for Venmo&#8217;s purchase protection plan &#8212; even if the seller doesn&#8217;t have a proper &#8220;business&#8221; account.</p>
<p>Because this now charges sellers a 1.9% plus 10-cent fee,<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/07/02/fact-check-claim-venmos-fee-changes-missing-context/7844100002/"> there had been some</a> backlash from users who either misunderstood the changes or just didn&#8217;t like them. But the move could help boost Venmo revenue.</p>
<p>PayPal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venmo-to-charge-users-for-selling-goods-and-services-11624705202">said in February</a> that Venmo grew users 32% over 2020 to reach 70 million active accounts, and expects the app to generate nearly $900 million in revenue this year &#8212; likely in part thanks to this and other new initiatives, like its crypto transaction fees.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179773" style="width: 398px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179773" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2179773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png?w=388" alt="" width="388" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png 601w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png?resize=171,300 171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png?resize=388,680 388w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GnS_phone121.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Venmo</p></div></p>
<p>Beyond the more functional changes and the privacy updates, Venmo&#8217;s redesign also modernizes the look-and-feel of the app itself, which had become a little dated and overly busy. As Venmo had expanded its array of services, the hamburger (three line) menu in the top right of the old version of the app had turned into a long list of options and settings. Now that&#8217;s gone. The app uses new iconography, an updated font, and lots of white space to make it feel fresh and clean.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s changes also somewhat de-emphasize the importance of the social feed itself. Although it may still default to that tab, other options now have equal footing with tabs of their own, instead of being hidden away in a menu or in a smaller button.</p>
<p>Venmo says the redesigned Venmo app will begin to roll out today to select customers and will be available to all users across the U.S. over the next few weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Bezos was so triumphant he was practically glowing at a press conference following the Blue Origin’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/">first crewed mission to space</a>, 21 years after he founded the company in 2000. The billionaire talked about the future of the company and his role in it, and then casually gave away a couple hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>Bezos was one of four that rode in the RSS First Step capsule; the others were his financier brother, Mark; aviation legend and Mercury 13 veteran Wally Funk; and 18-year-old Oliver Daemen, the son of the second-highest bidder on the Blue Origin seat auction. (The $28 million dollar winner postponed his seat due to scheduling conflicts.)</p>
<p>The company now joins a very tiny circle of companies that have sent private citizens to space, in the biggest boost yet for the nascent space tourism industry. Tuesday also marks the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, the next step in space travel paying homage to the very first.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The press conference opened with the grinning foursome being pinned with astronaut &#8220;wings,&#8221; a badge traditionally granted to those that have gone to space. “I’m so happy,” said Bezos at the press conference, donning the same cream cowboy hat he wore moments after emerging from the capsule a little over two hours earlier.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard carries Jeff Bezos and three crew members to space and back&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/blue-origins-new-shepard-carries-jeff-bezos-and-three-crew-members-to-space-and-back/embed/#?secret=RMzFmuNQcG" data-secret="RMzFmuNQcG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Bezos also thanked the city of Van Horn, acknowledging Blue Origin has made “a dent in it,” and followed by thanking every Amazon employee, plus its millions of customers: “Seriously, you paid for this.”</p>
<p>They also showed a brief video of the four crew members cavorting in four minutes of microgravity, including footage of the crew members catching floating Skittles in their mouths.</p>
<p>This is the second suborbital mission crewed entirely by private citizens this month alone, a first in history. The first was accomplished by Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity, a rocket-powered spaceplane, on July 11; its founder, billionaire Richard Branson, was aboard, which helped foment a truly petty spat between the two ultrawealthy founders. That aside, the two flights have helped make space tourism more of a reality than ever before.</p>
<p>The flight will also likely be a boost for Blue Origin’s commercial heavy-lift rocket launch arm, which for the moment is largely occupied by Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The same technologies that are used to perfect New Shepard’s reusability could come in handy for the development of New Glenn, the company’s massive orbital launch. Bezos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/blue-origin-pushes-new-glenn-orbital-rockets-first-flight-to-q4-2022/">said in February</a> that the company was pushing the inaugural launch of New Glenn from late 2021 to the latter quarter of 2022.</p>

<p>“The fact of the matter is, the architecture and the technology we’ve chosen is complete overkill” for space tourism, Bezos said. Instead, Blue Origin chose it “because it scales [ … ]  the whole point of this is to get practice” for larger and heavier missions.</p>
<p>On why Blue Origin chose liquid fuel, he reiterated that it’s practice for future launches. “Every time we fly this tourism mission, we practice flying the second stage of New Glenn.”</p>
<p>In December 2020, NASA added Blue Origin to its roster of space companies eligible to compete for contracts under its Launch Services II program. While it doesn’t guarantee that New Glenn or any other Blue Origin rocket would be awarded a launch contract, it’s the first step to getting there.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos confirmed that Blue Origin will fly two additional crewed launches this year alone, but it has yet to announce the price per seat. “We want the cadence to be very high [ … ] We’re approaching $100 million in private sales already.” When asked how to get the cost per seat down, Bezos said the space tourism industry would follow the trajectory of commercial space travel, now widely used by millions of travelers each year.</p>
<p>At the end of the conference, Bezos announced he was starting a $100 million Courage and Civility Award, with CNN contributor Van Jones and Michelin star chef José Andrés as the first two recipients. The winner will give that money away to the charities of their choice. The award is for people who apparently demonstrate civility and resist ad hominem attacks. Reading between the lines (frankly, you don’t even really have to do that) it seems like a commentary on contemporary political discourse, especially the emphasis on civility in disagreement.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the Amazon founder said he would split his time between Blue Origin and the Bezos Earth Fund, a $10 billion investment fund focused on climate change.</p>
<p>“This is not about escaping Earth. The whole point is, this is the only good planet in the solar system,” Bezos said. “We have to take care of it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Even though Europe has a reputation for lengthy summer vacations, investors don’t expect much -- if any -- slowdown to come in Europe during this sun-drenched quarter.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The startup market is having a moment around the world, but few regions can brag as much as Europe when it comes to venture capital investment. Yes, the United States is putting up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">impressive numbers</a> and Indian startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/india-poised-for-record-vc-year-as-unicorns-head-for-decisive-ipos/">are booming</a>. But Europe is such a bright spot in the larger world of private startup investment that it deserves more solo attention.</p>
<p>The data coming out of the continent is staggering: According to a <a href="https://dealroom.co/reports/startup-cities-in-the-entrepreneurial-age">Dealroom report</a>, some €49 billion was raised by European startups in the first six months of 2021. That’s 2.9x as much as was raised by the region’s technology upstarts in the first half of 2020 and easily crests previous full-year records set in 2020 and 2019.</p>

<hr />
<p>The epic start to 2021 for European startup fundraising crushes any preceding year that The Exchange has data for, erasing concerns that the continent simply won’t be able to create breakout tech companies that compete globally.</p>
<p>There are other signals that things are red-hot in Europe, including the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/wise-formerly-transferwise-confirms-direct-listing-on-the-lse-in-early-july-reportedly-at-a-6b-7b-valuation/">direct listing of Wise</a> on the London Stock Exchange. The company was valued at a huge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/wise-shares-indicated-open-10-bln-valuation-auction-2021-07-07/">$11 billion</a> price when it did so.</p>

Naturally, we wanted to learn more about where venture dollars may point in the future. What follows is a synthesis of market data and notes from <a href="https://twitter.com/dianakoziarska">Diana Koziarska</a>, a partner at SMOK Ventures; <a href="https://twitter.com/vinothj?lang=en">Vinoth Jayakumar</a>, a partner at Draper Esprit; <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/simon-schmincke">Simon Schmincke</a>, a partner at Creandum; and <a href="https://twitter.com/JavierSantiso">Javier Santiso</a>, a partner at Mundi Ventures.</p>
<p>The picture that emerges is one of sustained optimism, an expectation that venture investment is going to blast through traditional lulls and sustain a rapid-fire cadence during the rest of 2021. Records shall be smashed. But inside the various superlatives, a few sectors may do better than others. And Europe’s comparative gains in the venture capital world aren’t without impacts. Let’s explore what data says about the first half of 2021 in Europe’s startup market, and what its in-crowd expects for the rest of the year.</p>
<h2>Inside Europe’s epic start to 2021</h2>
<p>The European startup market is putting up notable results for both early-stage and super-late-stage funding. Dealroom reports that in the first half of 2021, some €18.1 billion was raised by European startups in the form of rounds greater than €250 million. For reference, the entire European startup market raised €16.7 billion in the first half of 2020.</p>
<p>But there’s also solid data indicating that Europe is doing a better job than ever in getting smaller companies off the ground. The same Dealroom report indicates that while Europe has created 15% of new global unicorns since 2020, it created 20% of new Series-A-stage startups and a huge 35% of seed-stage tech upstarts.</p>
<p>China, in contrast, is the opposite; the country has 8% of new unicorns since 2020, 6% of Series-A-stage startups and just 3% of the world’s seed-stage tech upstarts.</p>
<p>The interesting China dynamic is repeated in other statistics. Dealroom reports that Latin American venture capital is up 5.5x on a year-over-year basis in H1 2021. Asia excluding China is up 2.3x, as is investment in the United States. In China, a far smaller 1.6x growth rate was seen in the half-year period. But inside that data is the fact that every region we just listed set records in H1 2021, while China posted a figure that was sharply down from prior peak results.</p>
<p>This shows that regions that see a boom in investment can later see declines. But at least in the near term, that doesn’t seem to be in the cards.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There are many things I wish I knew when starting out with my small customer support team at RingCentral, but in the end, we figured it out. I’m going to share some critical lessons I learned along the way that I wish I had known at the outset, so that when it comes to scaling your own support team, you’ll have an idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>When I first started with RingCentral, we were working with a small-scale support team undergoing rapid growth. Our main goal was to maintain an excellent level of customer service with smart operational decisions.</p>
<p>You have some choices when it comes to scaling up customer support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase your employee headcount to cover the increase in customers. This is an expensive option, and onboarding employees too quickly can result in lower-quality training that results in lower-quality customer service.</li>
<li>Operate with a reduced staff and rely on decreased customer interaction. This increases wait times and can prove catastrophic to customer satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Hiring the right employees is critical. You want to find people with the right foundational skill sets and not necessarily the technical know-how to execute the job.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But the real strategy to embrace, and the one we instituted at RingCentral, was investing in the employees we were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/poor-onboarding-is-the-enemy-of-good-hiring/">onboarding</a> and ensuring all our existing processes were running efficiently.</p>
<p>While automating processes and developing new strategies to address customer support is essential, building an efficient and empowered support team is the real key to scaling your customer support operation.</p>
<p>Hiring the right employees is critical. You want to find people with the right foundational skill sets and not necessarily the technical know-how to execute the job.</p>
<p>A foundational skill set combined with robust training enables employees to thrive with whatever is thrown at them, like adapting to remote support in the past year. An enabled employee can resolve support issues faster, making your whole operation more efficient. That’s a real win-win.</p>
<p>As you scale and onboard employees, make sure they know their importance — emphasize the stakes in their role related to the business and value that responsibility. We want our employees to feel engaged, so we offer them opportunities to pursue passion projects tied to business initiatives and the opportunity to shadow across different organizations.</p>
<p>As you adapt to growth by scaling your support team, you’ll develop operational elements and firm work streams that increase efficiency, enabling you to further grow without the need to hire additional support.</p>
<p>It’s been a team effort to get to where we are now, so keep that in mind as you plan your growth scaling. Your support team is your most important asset.</p>
<h2>Lesson 1: Go beyond simplistic support</h2>
<p>While it’s convenient to buy into the accepted truth that customer support consists of only two departments — inbound and outbound, at RingCentral, I encouraged diversity within our support teams.</p>
<p>With different skill sets come support agents who bring something unique to the table. While developing our support frontline, I soon learned that talents could be utilized in a query-specific function. By placing the support associate in the most suitable role, we increased job satisfaction for employees while remaining highly focused on the customer experience.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of the teams we developed:</p>
