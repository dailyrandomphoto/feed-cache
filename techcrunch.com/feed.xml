										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the company&#8217;s AR/VR-focused Connect event this morning, Mark Zuckerberg announced that despite a name change, <del>Facebook</del> Meta&#8217;s mission will remain the same and that its existing brands wouldn&#8217;t be changing.</p>
<p>“To reflect who we are and what we hope to build, I am proud to announce that starting today, our company is now Meta. Our mission remains the same — it’s still about bringing people together. Our apps and our brands — they’re not changing either,” Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that&#8217;s not so true. In a lengthy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491">Facebook post</a>, CTO-in-waiting Andrew Bosworth detailed about 15 minutes later following the completion of the keynote that as part of the new rebrand, they will be killing off the Oculus brand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225989" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Oculus phrasing was conspicuously absent from the presentations today and features like the Oculus Store were consistently referred to as the Quest Store. In his post, Bosworth details that starting early next year the process to rename the Oculus app to the Meta app and the Oculus Quest to the Meta Quest will begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all have a strong attachment to the Oculus brand, and this was a very difficult decision to make. While we’re retiring the name, I can assure you that the original Oculus vision remains deeply embedded in how Meta will continue to drive mass adoption for VR today,&#8221; Bosworth wrote.</p>
<p>Facebook bought Oculus VR back in 2014.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sure looks like Zuckerberg made it about 15 seconds into his company rebrand before his first lie as Meta CEO</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.swap.financial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swap</a>, a São Paulo-based BaaS startup, announced today it has raised $25 million in a Series A led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing was “heavily oversubscribed,” according to the company, which has now raised $28 million since its October 2018 inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Endeavor, Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen, partners of DST Global, ONEVC, Global Founders Capital and Flourish Ventures all participated in the latest round. Previous backers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Canary Ventures and other angels such as Ariel Lambrecht, co-founder of 99 &#8211; the first Brazilian unicorn and Guilherme Bonifácio, iFood’s co-founder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Douglas Storf, Ury Rappaport and Alexandre Takinami, Swap aims to empower companies to transform their financial operations via its APIs, which it says offers users “the infrastructure for various financial solutions, allowing them to monetize their platforms.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225980" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inspiration behind Swap came from Storf and Rappaport&#8217;s own experience at 99 (formerly known as 99Taxis), where the two sought to create a series of financial products for the transport app&#8217;s partner drivers. It was there that the pair recognized the opportunity for an infrastructure service that would help any company provide financial products for their customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap’s growth as of late has been impressive. Over the past year, it has seen its customer base expand by 300%. During that same timeframe, it has been consistently growing 30% per month and 7,500% year-over-year with profitable results in the third quarter, according to Swap CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Douglas Storf. (Of course, we don’t know the base from which it grew, but the multiples are noteworthy).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve demonstrated product-market fit and are helping more and more companies embed finance offerings into their products,” Storf said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap operates in its home country of Brazil, and is looking to use its capital to expand the use cases it serves there. The company aims to specialize by segment, from a market and a technological perspective. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have always sought to be a fully integrated solution that truly allows companies to launch their fintechs quickly and efficiently,” said Storf. “Rather than being just a card processor, we specialized in providing the full solution to specific segments, being at the same time their bin sponsor, their card processor, their partner bank and providing all the core infrastructure to make them operational.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO says that full-service approach sets Swap apart from other BaaS companies in the market. The company also has a strategy around solving the pains of specific segments. For example, it launched Multiflex in early 2021, an offering aimed at flexible benefits companies and in September 2021, the Swap Credit platform, aimed at companies in that segment. In short, the company aims to be “LatAm’s fintech factory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently working with 15 customers such as</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Swile, Portão 3, Z1, BMP Money Plus and A55. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Storf notes that its customers are expanding to other Latin American countries so it will be a natural evolution to grow into new markets outside of Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap started 2021 with 27 employees and today it has 60 employees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It expects to double that number in 2022 with its new capital hiring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">across product development, operations and sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global Partner Alex Cook notes that the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">number of fintech companies and use cases in Latin America has “increased dramatically, lowering costs and improving experiences for consumers and businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are thrilled to partner with Doug, Ury, and the Swap team as they build a modern card issuing and banking infrastructure platform for the next generation of financial services companies in Brazil,” he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest financing marks Global Founder Capital’s third time investing in Swap. Says Partner  Fabricio Pettená: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Swap has completely reinvented banking as a service in Brazil, going beyond card</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acceptance and into credit and vertical solutions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno Yoshimura, general partner and co-founder of ONEVC points out that Swap today, has two major products: card-as-a-service and infrastructure for credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, they plan to listen to their customers&#8217; needs to develop the other building blocks,” he said. “With three former CTOs in the core team, I believe they have the right DNA to build AWS for fintechs in Latam.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook (aka &#8220;Meta&#8221;) CEO Mark Zuckerberg today took several thinly veiled shots at Apple and the overall app ecosystem when detailing his plans for the metaverse during today&#8217;s keynote speech at the company&#8217;s Facebook Connect 2021 event. Specifically, he called out app platforms and their associated fees for &#8220;stifling innovation,&#8221; while simultaneously justifying Facebook&#8217;s plans [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">aka &#8220;Meta&#8221;</a>) CEO Mark Zuckerberg today took several thinly veiled shots at Apple and the overall app ecosystem when detailing his plans for the metaverse during today&#8217;s keynote speech at the company&#8217;s Facebook Connect 2021 event. Specifically, he called out app platforms and their associated fees for &#8220;stifling innovation,&#8221; while simultaneously justifying Facebook&#8217;s plans to keep some of its own fees higher as it further invests in its burgeoning VR ecosystem and its Oculus Quest Store.</p>
<p>His statements follow Apple&#8217;s recent app privacy changes that have <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-q-3-earnings-investors-eye-fallout-from-whistleblower-apple-privacy-changes-175203219.html">taken a toll on</a> Facebook&#8217;s ads business. With the release of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">App Tracking Transparency</a>, Apple now allows consumers to stop apps from tracking them across other apps and websites. But this change has dragged down Facebook&#8217;s revenue, the company has admitted.</p>
<p>Now, Facebook sees the potential in building out its own app platform with Oculus to create a new stream of revenue &#8212; one where it becomes the platform that profits, instead of the developer having to pay the commissions. And one where its business can&#8217;t be destroyed at the whims of another company&#8217;s shift in strategy.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zuckerberg acknowledged that it&#8217;s time to make this change, saying that he&#8217;s learned in recent years that &#8220;building products isn&#8217;t enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We also need to help build ecosystems so that millions of people can have a stake in the future can be rewarded for their work and benefit as the tide rises &#8212; not just as consumers, but as creators and developers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This period has also been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we&#8217;ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,&#8221; Zuckerberg continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of all, I&#8217;ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>These comments seem directly pointed at Apple and Google, on whose platforms Facebook&#8217;s core products largely reside. Facebook has to pay fees on in-app purchases to the app stores &#8212; including when users subscribe to creators, buy badges, or tip streamers directly, for example. While both Apple and Google have been bringing their commissions down for smaller businesses, media providers, and subscription apps, the standard split is still 70/30 (platform/developer).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>App Store rules have also prevented Facebook from building out other products where it could have increased revenues &#8212; as with its newer gaming service.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358355/facebook-apple-app-store-policies-comments-facebook-gaming-ios">slammed Apple&#8217;s policies last year</a> as it launched Facebook Gaming on iOS without games, for example. Apple doesn&#8217;t allow apps that contain other apps or games, as that would cut into its own ability to generate revenues from third-party developers. So instead of being able to play mini-games as on Android, Facebook Gaming iOS users could only watch streams.</p>
<p>However, the real concern for Facebook&#8217;s future is one where its ad revenues are threatened by platform policy changes out of its control.</p>
<p>Those revenues over the years have allowed Facebook to invest in other sectors, in addition to keeping its apps free, Zuckerberg noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We offer our creator and commerce tools either at cost or with modest fees to enable as much creation and commerce as possible. And it&#8217;s worked. Billions of people love our products,&#8221; he touted. &#8220;We have hundreds of millions of businesses on our platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company now plans to take the same approach to build its metaverse ecosystem &#8212; by either subsidizing devices or selling them at cost, to make them more broadly available to consumers, Zuckerberg said. And unlike with Apple&#8217;s App Store, Facebook says it plans to support sideloading and linking to PCs to provide consumers and developers with choice, instead of locking them into its platform. (Of course, many developers will choose to launch on the Quest Store for discovery&#8217;s sake, which is why Facebook knows it can make this promise.)</p>
<p>He also said that Facebook would keep developer and creator service fees low, when possible. However, Zuckerberg &#8212; sketching out the company&#8217;s next business model &#8212; warned that won&#8217;t always be the case. Given the size of its investment in this new ecosystem, some fees would remain higher, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;To keep investing in this future, we&#8217;ll need to keep some fees higher for some period to make sure that we don&#8217;t lose too much money on this program overall,&#8221; Zuckerberg explained. &#8220;After all, while a growing number of developers are already profitable, we expect to invest many billions of dollars for years to come before the metaverse reaches scale. Our hope, though, is that if we all work at it that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, Facebook&#8217;s plan is to become more like Apple by tapping into developer revenues at scale and making its own rules.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia hosted a private, sponsored AMA for founders in Startup Battlefield and Startup Alley at the virtual Disrupt SF last month. Stephanie Zhang, Konstantine Buhler, George Robson and Josephine Chen shared some key insights and best practices. It was good stuff, so we wanted to share. We took some highlights from the session and chatted with a couple more partners to dive deeper into what founders need to know &#8212; how to ask for help, fundraising principles, how to build company culture and more.</span></p>
<p><b>Fundraising requires the stars to align</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve sat on both the founder side and investor side, what is one thing you wish you could have told your founder self</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225808" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaun Maguire: I think most founders don’t appreciate how random fundraising is. Having sat in the room for five years now, it really requires the stars to align for an investment to happen. It requires finding a champion &#8212; in order to find a champion you have to find them at the right time. Maybe they have done two other investments this year. They feel too busy. They take on board seats and don’t have the bandwidth when you meet with them. Or you’re catching them on a bad day. Or it’s an industry they had invested in previously with a company that didn’t work. There is a lot of randomness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm can feel like their investment pace is too high because they invested in three companies the week prior. So now the week you’re pitching them, they feel like the pace is too high, so the bar is now higher than it was a week ago. Ninety percent of the time it’s randomness and it’s not you. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are things a founder can do to prepare for when the stars align?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaun Maguire: If someone is going to join the board of your company, it’s a long-term partnership. It’s a 10+ year commitment. A lot of founders think they should only meet VCs in the fundraising process. They want to hold the meetings when they have the deck ready. Of the 15 boards I’ve been on, I’ve only invested in one founder, where I met them within the month of the investment process. All of the others, I met them three months before they came to raise. Personally, if I’m entering into a long-term relationship, I want to know them as a person and get longitudinal data. I want to see how they have been performing over time. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would you say to founders who are not “typical founders”? How do you break through the pattern-matching framework some VCs have in their head?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaun Maguire: Identify your high-level ambition to start a company, and then work backwards. If that’s my goal, what are the stepping stones I need to get there? I personally had a 1.0 GPA in high school and had to recover from that. I thought a lot about stepping stone paths. I wanted to go to a good college&#8230;so I went to community college first. I thought about: How am I going to stand out? I need to go do something crazy and stand out. I need to do something different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reverse engineer it. Are there any immediate things I, as a founder, can do that are stepping stones to the bigger goals. Second piece, be really persistent. And it’s not what people want to hear. With Escape Dynamics [Shaun Maguire’s first company], we had to pitch 100 investors and eventually found one that would work with us. </span></p>
<p><b>Tactics to prepare for fundraising</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a challenge to raise. What do you do when you don’t have a lead and you need a lead? How do you cross that bridge?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Zhang: Treat fundraising as you would recruiting critical team members. It’s invaluable to find the right partner, especially at the very beginning of the company. I like to think of it as a compass: A small degree change in the direction of your company in month one has an outsized impact on where you will be 10 years out. If it&#8217;s a challenge to raise and you don&#8217;t have a lead investor, I would evaluate whether additional capital is absolutely necessary, and if so, how much the company truly needs. The earliest rounds are the most expensive dilution for a founder — and will only compound over the years — so it’s important to raise as much as the company requires to grow and strive for a lead investor that can have a transformative impact over the long term. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When should a founder turn down an investment even if they are running out of runway?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Zhang: The value of having the right partners — a strong brand and network, a team who rolls up their sleeves alongside you, and someone who cares about you as a person and founder — compounds over time and provides incredible signaling for your company. The reverse is also true. There are lots of options for capital these days; it&#8217;s up to founders to recognize the ones who offer real value, not valuation. Always ask yourself: Can this partner truly add value and help me bend the arc of my company? Cut through the marketing noise by talking to founders who have worked with that partner over years. Ask about the good and bad times, as well as the successful and less successful outcomes  — this will help you truly discern the differences among investors. Think about which partner you want by your side for the next 10-20 years and who you want to turn to during the highs and lows of your company-building journey. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What recommendations do you have for founders who are on the cutting edge of things that investors may not know how to invest in or may not understand the space of?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaun Maguire: It’s really important to understand the [min rule decision making] psychology and that’s what you’re dealing with as a founder because it can change the tactics that you use. It’s hard when you are doing something cutting edge because there is less pattern matching for everyone in the partnership. First you need to find a champion and then you need to find the most negative person in the firm and try to win them over. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does a previous startup failure factor into your decision to invest in a new company?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaun Maguire: A startup can fail for a variety of reasons, so we check any bias at the door by decoupling the success or failure of a business from the quality of the team. When we partner with a second-time founder, we talk a lot about their former experience to gauge their ability to reflect and carry those learnings into a new chapter. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are other success markers outside revenue that you look for in early-stage startups?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Zhang: We look for founders who are building companies that will become generational and shape history. The most important thing we look for is a special team: one that deeply understands the problem they are solving, has a unique and compelling insight that’s shaped their way of going about the problem, has grit and ambition to take them through the long haul, and has commercial instincts to understand how a compelling product can be over time to become an enduring, independent business.</span></p>
<p><b>Running a successful startup</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s one of the hardest parts for founders building companies in the early stage?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Robson: Early-stage startups have an abundance of choice, yet they also have finite resources. It’s important for founders to prioritize in a thoughtful way. For example, when looking to expand internationally, focus on the key questions that matter, such as: ‘who are your customers?’ and ‘where can you build a repeatable GTM function?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When should a founder talk to an investor about issues/red flags/problems?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Robson: Similar to other relationships in life, the connection between an investor and founder is built on trust. Founders should be transparent with their investors and feel safe flagging issues early so they can help troubleshoot. If we&#8217;ve done our job well, nothing we discuss at a board meeting should ever be a surprise, as we&#8217;re supporting our founders to build their businesses everyday.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">At what point does someone deserve a co-founder title?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jess Lee: There’s no ‘one path’ to finding or becoming a co-founder. I was retroactively made a co-founder of Polyvore as the founders felt I deserved it based on my contributions — and that’s always meant a lot to me. I was technically the first hire and not there from day one, but I acted like an owner, poured my heart and soul into the work and helped shape the culture. In the end, I was also just lucky that Pasha, Guangwei and Jianing were generous people who went out of their way to give me the title and even some of their own shares. I&#8217;ll always be grateful for that.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Culture comes up a lot. Thoughts? What are the two main tactical steps companies can take to build a strong culture in the beginning?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Robson: Don&#8217;t compromise on people. Put culture first at your company and codify your culture early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jess Lee: It’s never too early to define your culture. In fact, in our Company Design Program — which gives early-stage founders the learnings and community to build an enduring company — we provide founders with a framework for culture: values → behaviors → stories. Values are the fundamental beliefs and guiding principles of the company, ideally stated in a pithy, memorable way. Behaviors are how you want to see people act, based on those values. Stories are the real-life anecdotes of when your company lived those values. The stories are especially important, since that&#8217;s what people remember. They help make the company culture tangible and easier to operationalize. As an example, people know the story of the Airbnb founders selling cereal to make ends meet or of Jeff Bezos using doors for desks, which embody their values of entrepreneurship and frugality, respectively.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">International travel is slowly opening up again, but that also means business and leisure travelers alike will once again have to think about visa restrictions as they take to the air. Nobody has ever enjoyed the process of applying for a visa, but <a href="https://www.atlys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlys</a> promises to take the hassle out of the process. The company today announced that it has raised a $4.25 million seed funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Pinterest co-founders Ben Silbermann and Evan Sharp also participated in this round, together with The Chainsmokers’ Mantis VC (yes, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io0fBr1XBUA">those Chainsmokers</a>), Long Journey Ventures, South Park Commons Fund and Ari Emmanuel’s Endeavor.</p>
<p>Atlys argues that it can take travelers up to 13 hours to work through the visa process for various countries &#8212; and that&#8217;s without trying to figure out the ever-changing COVID testing and vaccination requirements. While most business travelers work with agencies that speed up this process by quite a bit, especially for repeat applications, Atlys promises to bring the process down to five minutes.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/atlys-simplify-travel/id1514036839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s iPhone app</a>, travelers answer a few questions about their travels (where you are, where you are going, why you are traveling, etc.) and scan their documents. There are some smart integrations here, too, with the ability to take passport photos and then pick them up at Walgreens (or get delivery) or to ask your manager for a letter of employment signed through DocuSign.</p>
<p>Pricing depends on where you are and where you are going, but it tops out at about $50.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Mohak Nahta, who came to the U.S. as an immigrant himself. &#8220;I am thrilled to have such an incredible group of investors supporting <span class="il">Atlys</span> and our mission,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is with their invaluable experience and guidance that will propel us further in our quest to simplify travel and create a seamless process for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to build out its team and expand its coverage across more country pairs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we look for in founders is &#8216;founder-product fit&#8217;, meaning does the founder have a unique insight into the market or problem they are trying to solve? As an immigrant myself, I immediately appreciated how deeply and personally Mohak also understood the cumbersome visa process, and how he was leveraging his insights to build Atlys,&#8221; said Sriram Krishnan, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz. &#8220;The magic of Atlys lies in its ability to connect many disparate systems behind the scenes, while offering a simple, streamlined end-customer experience.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well, it&#8217;s official. After 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus has a new name.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s corporate entity is now Meta.</p>
<p>Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company&#8217;s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company&#8217;s core ambition: to build the metaverse.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225747" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;To reflect who we are and what we hope to build, I am proud to announce that starting today, our company is now Meta. Our mission remains the same &#8212; it&#8217;s still about bringing people together. Our apps and our brands &#8212; they&#8217;re not changing either,&#8221; Zuckerberg said. &#8220;From now on, we&#8217;re going to be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="O0x3x29QYd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-errr-meta-unceremoniously-kills-off-oculus-brand/">Company formerly known as Facebook unceremoniously kills off &#8216;Oculus&#8217; brand</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Company formerly known as Facebook unceremoniously kills off &#8216;Oculus&#8217; brand&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-errr-meta-unceremoniously-kills-off-oculus-brand/embed/#?secret=O0x3x29QYd" data-secret="O0x3x29QYd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The name change comes at a&#8230; convenient time for Facebook, which has seen a sustained backlash to its brand, particularly in recent weeks after a former employee leaked a trove of documents to the media and government bodies detailing the missteps Facebook has made over the years in building out its platform responsibly. Facebook had been laying the groundwork for this change for months, seemingly in an effort to move its core branding further from the relentless negative headlines surrounding its most popular product, which has been a lightning rod for angst among consumers.</p>
<p>In July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">Verge</a> profile that Facebook was betting it all on the metaverse. It was a surprise announcement for the trillion-dollar company, mainly because while Facebook has spent plenty of money and effort on virtual reality hardware, its social VR products have largely been short-lived failures and it had said barely anything about its beta Horizons social platform since announcing it more than a year-and-a-half earlier.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In August, Facebook organized an unusually large press push around a VR app designed to let people take meetings in VR. Zuckerberg hit the morning shows and dedicated a surprising amount of effort toward showcasing the small VR app.</p>
<p>In September, in a blog post called &#8220;Building the Metaverse Responsibly,&#8221; Facebook announced a $50 million fund dedicated toward investment in research &#8220;to ensure these products are developed responsibly.&#8221; This month, Facebook announced a smaller $10 million creator fund for developers on its nascent Horizon Worlds platform, and also detailed that it planned to hire a whopping 10,000 employees in the EU specifically to build out their metaverse platform.</p>
<p>Last week, a story in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> floated that Facebook was mulling a name change to their corporate entity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, distancing the company&#8217;s core business from a product associated with the most problems is an unsurprising move for them, but changing its name to Meta will require Facebook to align its core brand with a product that could be years from relevancy and could encounter many failures on the way to potential mainstream success. Facebook still has 2.5 billion users, while their metaverse products likely have a few thousand users, at most.</p>
<p>A major name change from one of tech’s biggest companies isn’t without precedent. In 2015, Google rolled out a new corporate structure of its own, creating a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/02/google-becomes-alphabet/">parent company known as Alphabet</a>. Google remains a subsidiary of Alphabet, but colloquially most people still call anything having to do with the company or its subsidiaries &#8220;Google,&#8221; for better or worse. After almost two decades of building its brand and growing its products to almost three billion monthly users, Facebook can probably expect the same treatment.</p>
<p>While Google wasn’t trying to put distance between itself and its own name, Facebook has very different reasons for a rebrand. The company’s business continues to soar, but its brand has taken a beating in recent years, from Russian election disinformation in 2016, to major privacy lapses like the Cambridge Analytica scandal and now the flurry of ongoing revelations from Frances Haugen, a former member of Facebook’s civic integrity team turned Facebook whistleblower.</p>
<p>Facebook is also arguably under more regulatory scrutiny at the moment than any other company in the tech industry. In Congress, where lawmakers seldom agree on anything, Republicans and Democrats have united in their shared distaste for the company’s unfettered growth, cutthroat business tactics and concerns over Instagram’s detrimental effects on teen mental health.</p>
<p>During a Senate hearing last week with TikTok, Snap and YouTube, each social media company scrambled to explicitly contrast their own business practices with Facebook. YouTube posited that it didn’t “prioritize profits over safety.” Snap pointed to its own focus on ephemeral conversations, while TikTok argued that it thinks carefully about the wellbeing of teen users. But the efforts by Facebook’s peers appeared to be in vain.</p>
<p>“Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Senator Richard Blumenthal said. “That bar is in the gutter.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tenways.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tenways</a> is an e-bike maker which has launched its first model, the CGO 600, on Indiegogo. Priced at around $1,400 this is a relatively affordable e-bike in the scheme of things, and has plenty of features to satisfy even the most discerning of customers.</p>
<p>Now before we get into it, it behooves me to say that there is always an inherent risk when buying into new products promoted on crowdfunding platforms like Indiegogo, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tenways-ebike-the-best-urban-ride-ever#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where the CGO 600 is listed</a>.</p>
<p>However, the good news is that Tenways is adamant that its bikes are already rolling off production, and this, evidently, appears to be the case. Certainly, the review model I was sent attested to this claim, as it came with all the full and final hardware listed on the site. Furthermore, Tenways is an established company that uses Indiegogo in a marketing manner, largely to advertise its bike, rather than raise money to develop and build it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225896" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2225913" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225913" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225913 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg 1807w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=768,508 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=1536,1017 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tenways1.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225913" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tenways</p></div></p>
<p>So, is this urban electric bicycle worth your consideration? The short answer is yes.</p>
<p>Here’s the longer answer:</p>
<p>First of all, we are talking about an e-bike optimized for the urban environment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It certainly looks like it’s built for the city. The electric motor and battery are more discreet than in other e-bikes, giving it that cool, messenger-bike styling. The carbon belt-drive system means it is quieter and more maintenance-free, as these do not need oiling or adjusting. Similarly, the hydraulic disc brake system is not going to require much maintenance.</p>

<p>The bike rides well, and at only 33 lb (15 kg), it is easy to pick up to carry up or downstairs. As there is no throttle, the pedal assist is activated by a torque sensor, which works well.</p>
<p>The 250W motor is enough to give you that extra boost as you ride up a hill or on the flat, but you also have three power levels to pick from.</p>

<p>With its relatively small 252 Wh battery, Tenways claims the bike has a range of 80 miles (130 km) per charge in “ideal conditions”, which is probably optimistic. But then who rides 130 km on a commute? After all, this is really what this bike is designed for. Removing the battery for charging is not easy, so it will be simpler to charge the bike in situ.</p>
<p>Tenways has been shipping from September, and who wouldn’t want a good-looking e-bike with these features, be they an &#8220;urban&#8221; hipster or an average commuter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook wants the Quest 2 to be known as more than a game console for your face.</p>
<p>At the company&#8217;s Facebook Connect developer conference, CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted the company&#8217;s efforts to make the Quest a fitness platform for third-party apps like Supernatural and FitXR. He compared it directly to the Peloton as a connected fitness device.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of you are already using Quest to stay fit, it lets you work out in some completely new ways,&#8221; Zuckerberg said in the keynote. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like a Peloton, but instead of your bike you just have your VR headset and with it, you can do anything from boxing lessons to sword-fighting to even dancing.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is leaning further into this classification with its hardware detailing that next year they will release an &#8220;Active Pack&#8221; that allows users to customize their Quest 2 headset to make it better featured for working out. The pack will add grips to the controllers and a facial pad that addresses the issue of sweaty headsets.</p>
<p>In recent years, the company began pushing fitness harder in-headset, showcasing a product called Oculus Move that measures activity and calorie-burning tracking into the Quest 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are lots of startups now working on modular home design. Among the most interesting is <a href="https://buildcover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cover</a>, a seven-year-old, LA-based company that says it manufactures fully complete wall, floor and roof panels in its factory, then transports them on a standard truck and assembles them on site &#8212; without a crane.</p>
<p>The materials it is using are lightweight steel for the building frame and aluminum for the ceilings. The panels are made of a rubber composite because, as founder and CEO Alexis Xavier Rivas explains, &#8220;drywall is not designed for manufacturing or transport &#8212; it&#8217;s too brittle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, a lot of thought has been invested in how these buildings are designed. For example, the company installs all plumbing and electrical wiring in the ceiling, so that if an owner wants to run a new wire or pipe, she or he need only pop off the ceiling to do it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It sounds strange, but it&#8217;s a lot less strange than sawing a series of holes in a wall, then patching them up and repainting them to achieve the same end. (It also requires less help from the kind of craftspeople like plumbers and electricians that is in short supply right now.)</p>
<p>Other materials used include real wood and wood composites for the floors and exterior, and solid surface countertops and bathroom floors that are nonporous, meaning they&#8217;re more hygienic, as these things go, which matters increasingly to homeowners as the world emerges from a pandemic.</p>
<p>How the materials come together is naturally even more crucial, given that with Cover, much of the focus &#8212; and the promise &#8212; is on both quick assembly and customization.</p>
<p>According to Rivas, the process works as follows: A customer works with the company to create a design. Right now, that design is limited to single-story units that are 1,200-square-feet or smaller but which take into account factors such as where windows should be placed to minimize energy waste. (Rivas also notes here that the glass, made by Cover, is LEED-certified, and that its homes are airtight, vastly improving their energy efficiency.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cover then takes the agreed-upon design, at a price that&#8217;s established up front and includes permitting fees, city fees, foundation fees and the home itself &#8212; think $200,000 for 400-square foot studio; $250,000 for a one-bedroom, 600-square-foot unit; and up to $500,000 for a three-bedroom, 1,200-foot dwelling &#8212; and it gets to work engineering the pieces.</p>
<p>Somewhat amazingly, it says that after the foundation is complete, it can have the building built and installed within 30 days, down from the 120-window that it used to promise customers.</p>
<p>It also offers a 100% money-back guarantee if it can&#8217;t obtain the <a href="https://www.hcd.ca.gov/building-standards/manufactured-modular-factory-built/factory-built-housing.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessary permits</a>, along with a lifetime structural warranty and a one-year warranty for everything else.</p>
<p>These buildings are &#8220;not going to rot,&#8221; says Rivas. &#8220;They aren&#8217;t going to be eaten by termites.&#8221; If a customer needs new air filters, on the other hand, &#8220;we&#8217;ll change them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rivas, who grew up in Toronto, studied architecture in college and bounced briefly around a number of architectural firms before founding Cover, takes pride in being able to attract engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to the mission, and at various points during a conversation earlier this week, likened Cover&#8217;s processes to that of the automaker.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s seemingly not the only one who sees similarities. The company is today announcing that it has raised $60 million in Series B funding led by Gigafund, an investment firm that was founded by two former Founders Fund investors who have bet heavily on SpaceX.</p>
<p>Joining the round are Valor Equity Partners and Founders Fund &#8212; both of which are also early investors in SpaceX and Tesla &#8212; and a whole bunch of other notable backers, including General Catalyst, Lennar, Fifty Years, AngelList cofounder Naval Ravikant, Lowercase Capital founder Chris Sacca, Marathon Asset Management CEO Bruce Richards and Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, among others.</p>
<p>Certainly, there&#8217;s no dearth of demand for what Cover is building, given the national housing &#8212; and construction &#8212; shortage. In fact, asked about Cover&#8217;s sales team, Rivas says that there is so much inbound interest that just &#8220;one-third of one person&#8217;s time is in sales&#8221; right now.</p>
<p>As for what people are ordering, Rivas says that most of the company&#8217;s customers have bought dwellings to accommodate either family moving in (an aging parent, a kid coming back from college); to create a home office apart from their house; or to establish a way to drum up rental income.</p>
<p>Still, beyond the roughly 20 backyard homes it has already built, the company &#8212; which has now raised $75 million altogether &#8212; very much intends to begin building bigger, multilevel homes, as well as multifamily units.</p>
<p>It mostly boils down to using more panels, Rivas says, which the company will be able to produce from the 100,000-square-foot factory into which it&#8217;s moving from the 25,000-square-foot warehouse it operates currently. (That&#8217;s where some of that $60 million is headed.)</p>
<p>Indeed, he says, if all goes as planned, sometime soon, even existing customers will be able to easily enlarge the homes they&#8217;ve already bought using the Cover app. It&#8217;ll be a snap, by his telling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go on the app, you&#8217;ll click on the room to which you want to add, then schedule it, pay online, and get your renovation done in two to three days.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of curtain raiser for which Elon Musk is known. Now to see if Cover can pull it off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">announced</a> last month it would soon introduce an option that allows hosts to record their live audio sessions in Twitter Spaces to make them available for replay. While the company at the time said the feature would launch in a &#8220;few months,&#8221; it&#8217;s not surprising that, given Twitter&#8217;s accelerated pace of development, the company is rolling out its first iteration of the feature starting today.</p>
<p>Initially, the Spaces Recording option will be will made available to a limited number of Twitter Spaces hosts on iOS and all listeners on iOS and Android worldwide. Twitter says the first users to receive access will be those who were in the original Spaces Beta. It will then roll out the feature to the rest of the Twitter audience in a few more weeks, the company says.</p>
<p>To use the feature, a Spaces host will create their live audio room by giving their Space a title and selecting up to three tags to describe what the room&#8217;s about, as usual. They can then toggle on the new setting, &#8220;Record Space,&#8221; before tapping on the &#8220;Start a Space&#8221; button to begin their live audio session.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225636" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If in a Twitter Space that&#8217;s being recorded, participants will see a &#8220;Rec&#8221; button with a red dot next to it at the top of the Space as an indication that the recording is underway.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225666" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225666" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2225666" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pasted-image-0.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225666" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>When the host is ready to end the Space, they&#8217;ll tap on the &#8220;End&#8221; button at the top-right as they would otherwise, and will then be presented with a pop-up box that asks them to confirm they want to end both the Space and stop the recording.</p>
<p>Once wrapped, the recording of the Space can be shared across Twitter&#8217;s platform, allowing listeners to play it back at any time or re-share it themselves. Twitter does not yet have an audio export option available, we&#8217;re told. Instead, users would have to <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterMedia/status/1405262233299345413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">request a download of their data</a> to access the recordings directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Live audio grew in popularity as the COVID-19 pandemic surged, as it gave something for locked-down users to do while stuck at home. But the appeal has <a href="https://variety.com/vip/clubhouse-has-cooled-off-in-the-u-s-heres-why-it-shouldnt-panic-1235050042/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">somewhat</a> dwindled as COVID restrictions lifted and people began to venture back out. Popular live audio app Clubhouse, for example, saw app <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/06/22/clubhouse-app-over/">installs decline</a> earlier this year, but <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/clubhouse-downloads-pace-jump-179-230212153.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jump again</a> with an Android release. However, the app also faced lagging engagement in some emerging markets, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/has-clubhouse-plateaued-before-it-hit-the-peak-11631816511362.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like India</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696403/clubhouse-creators-first-sponsorship-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggled</a> with its creator program.</p>

<p>Recently, Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">expanded</a> its feature set to offer options that would allow for asynchronous listening, including support for clips, replays and audio exports &#8212; tools that are pushing the app closer to being a podcast creation platform, rather than just a live audio network. (It&#8217;s actually a wonder Apple hasn&#8217;t snatched it up to become an in-house rival to Spotify&#8217;s Anchor.)</p>
<p>Other Twitter Spaces&#8217; competitors, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1322627964798415/?helpref=related" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook&#8217;s Live Audio Rooms</a> and newer startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/mark-cuban-backed-live-entertainment-app-fireside-launches-to-creators/">Fireside</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/callin-david-sacks-social-podcasting-app-launches-and-announces-a-12m-series-a-round/">Callin</a>, also support audio recordings.</p>
<p>With so much of the live audio landscape now embracing recordings, Twitter had to catch up.</p>
<p>The release follows shortly after a few other updates to Twitter Spaces, including <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1453449025877942288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday&#8217;s launch</a> of a Spaces test that brings the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">dedicated Spaces Tab</a> to Android users and <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1447639305397194755" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an update bringing easier DM invites</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vsc.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VSC</a>, a public relations firm that has helped the likes of startups such as ClearCo, Poshmark and Tile craft their stories, has raised millions to invest in the companies they work with. While <a href="http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2767/186454721000002/filing-main.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its bigger fund is estimated to close at $20 million</a>, VSC confirmed that it has raised a $7 million tranche for climate tech startups to start.</p>
<p>VSC Ventures will back early-stage companies with checks between $250,000 to $500,000, and also provide media relations and multimedia content development as a service. The venture arm will be run by VSC CEO Vijay Chattha and General Partner Jay Kapoor, who was recently hired by VSC off of his six-years investing experience.</p>
<p>For VSC, which has helped more than 500 venture-backed startups through 50 exits, 20 unicorns and four IPOs, the argument for its venture arm is that cutting through the noise can help folks get coveted cap table spots.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225856" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>VSC Ventures’ debut focus, climate, is related to its competitive advantage of knowing a thing or two about telling stories.<a href="https://vsc.co/climb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Climb</a>, also announced today, is VSC’s practice dedicated to building awareness and action around sustainability-focused startups. The duo thinks that, as every major VC fund begins to invest in the thorny and complicated world of climate, startups will need help explaining why their solutions make sense.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not just about hyping up on Twitter &#8212; that is something everybody can do,&#8221; Kapoor said. “It&#8217;s about actually having experience working with the founders to help them with their messaging, to help them with their positioning, and actually have done that consistently over time. Maybe some platform services have a person here and there that can help companies, but that isn’t their core competency and it’s not what they&#8217;re designed for.”</p>
<p>The investors’ own personal track records don&#8217;t hurt either. Before the fund, both Chattha and Kapoor made a slew of climate-focused investments on their own, including Revel, Modumate, Zume, Poshmark, Molekule and Rocean. The firm will eventually back startups in future of work and wellness, as well.</p>
<p>As every venture firm appears to be going the full-stack approach, offering a suite of services beyond simply capital, VSC’s move feels warranted. These days, founders want valuable services from their investors, such as hiring help, or simply, hype. Those within the media have found themselves in a fortuitous, and potentially lucrative spot, as the storytelling skill set skyrockets in demand from aspiring entrepreneurs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, Harry Stebbings, the well-known podcaster behind “20 minute VC,” recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/harry-stebbings-turns-up-the-volume-on-20vc-with-new-140m-fund/">$140 million for his venture capital fund</a> launched off of his show’s success. Morning Brew CEO Austin Rief <a href="https://angel.co/austin-riefs-rolling-fund/syndicate?utm_campaign=syndicate_direct_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a fund</a> of his own. It’s happening in reverse too. Andreessen Horowitz, a more traditional fund, has put significant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/andreessen-horowitz-goes-into-publishing-with-future/">investment into Future</a>, a media property in which it will publish stories about topics related to areas in which the firm invests.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IEMZDHV4fd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-only-take-about-the-future-of-media-is-that-media-is-the-future/">The only take about the future of media is that media is the future</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The only take about the future of media is that media is the future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-only-take-about-the-future-of-media-is-that-media-is-the-future/embed/#?secret=IEMZDHV4fd" data-secret="IEMZDHV4fd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Despite the blending of media and VC, few public relations firms have raised a fund, it appears.</p>
<p>“Many firms have experimented with equity for services since the late 1990s but abandon it quickly when the startup markets slow down,” Chattha said. “We are using LP capital to back companies and therefore are committed to this approach.”</p>
<p>Fear of a bubble burst aside, another reason that PR firms may not have gone into the investment game is the sheer complexity of managing clients and portfolio companies at the same time. Will there be a tension between VSC clients and VSC portfolio companies that are competing for the same partners’ time?</p>
<p>“We get asked this a lot,” Chattha said. “While the climate tech practice comes with money, in general, a lot of our companies are beyond where we can invest in them.” Since the majority of VSC’s current clients are Series B and beyond, the new fund will only be able to put money into a fraction of clients &#8212; which helps the investors draw a line on who they will and won’t back. This could change if VSC continues to raise more funds in the future.</p>
<p>Public relations firms also sometimes work as crisis communications, helping startups better message their mistakes to investors, employees, customers and, of course, the press. One could argue that founders may feel less incentivized to be vulnerable with a PR firm about struggles if they are also their investors, the same people they are incentivized to impress.</p>
<p>“Because we&#8217;re not the lead investor, we don&#8217;t ever put that kind of peer pressure on them,” Chattha said. “We have enough skin in the game to be honest and vulnerable with them, but not so much that we&#8217;re going to guide them into the wrong for their business.”</p>
<p>The venture arm, still in its early days, wants to be clear that it’s prepared for the startup boom to quiet down &#8212; whenever that happens.</p>
<p>“We’re in an up and to the right era, but it won’t be like this forever,” Chattha said. “Every vertical has its own ups and downs&#8230; and by not being the biggest check in or the lead check in, you know, we take that pressure off.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During its big VR and AR-focused event Thursday, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a major new title headed to its VR platform that should turn a few heads.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is on the way to the Oculus Quest 2. San Andreas is Rockstar&#8217;s well-loved 2004 entry into the hit GTA franchise, which invites players to wreak havoc in an urban open world fashioned after cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new version of what I think is one of the greatest games ever made will offer players an entirely new way to experience this iconic world in virtual reality,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bringing such an iconic game into the fold is certainly one way to lure more users into the company&#8217;s emerging virtual world — one that even folks squeamish about Facebook&#8217;s VR account login requirements might find enticing.</p>
<p>While Zuckerberg didn&#8217;t offer many details about what to expect or when, Facebook has apparently been working on bringing the GTA classic to its VR headset for years.</p>

<p>As Instagram has pushed video harder through its Reels platform, the uptake for AR filters has gotten more sustained among users, providing an opportunity for Facebook to push them on creators.</p>
<p>The app seems to be pretty early in production; Facebook says it will be going into closed beta later this year as they hand pick certain creators to onboard. Eventually, the company will be rolling this out widely as a free app that helps anyone create their own AR filters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buy now, pay later is here to stay.</p>
<p>A year ago, the biggest players in the space were companies founded solely to offer consumers the ability to pay in installments at the point of sale. Sweden’s Klarna, Australia’s Afterpay and U.S.-based Affirm were the top names associated with BNPL.</p>
<p>But the landscape looks very different now that more companies recognize the opportunity and fight for a piece of the pie. PayPal last month spent $2.7 billion for Japan’s Paidy in an effort <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/paypal-acquires-japans-paidy-for-2-7b-to-crack-the-buy-now-pay-later-market-in-asia/">to crack the market in Asia</a>. In early August, Square announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">plans to acquire Afterpay</a> in a $29 billion deal. Even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/what-impact-will-apples-buy-now-pay-later-push-have-on-startups/">Apple is said to be getting into the BNPL game</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s BNPL space is seeing a slow emergence of a symbiotic relationship between traditional financial institutions, payments upstarts and leading companies. As credit card and payments firms eye BNPL as a new growth opportunity, incumbents like Klarna and Affirm are seeking ways to make their installment loans available to more consumers.</p>
<h2>The bigwigs enter the fray</h2>
<p>Now that consumers are growing comfortable with BNPL services, the big credit card providers are taking steps to ensure they aren&#8217;t left behind. Visa said on Wednesday that a &#8220;growing list&#8221; of issuers, acquirers and fintechs are using its technology to offer BNPL options to their customers.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mary Kay Bowman, Visa’s SVP and global head of payment and platform products, said the company has been &#8220;enthusiastically embracing BNPL&#8221; for years &#8220;because it expands choice and convenience for buyers and sellers alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If shoppers prefer a BNPL fintech solution, we are here and enabling it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If they want an option from their banks, we’re helping offer those too.&#8221; Interestingly, Visa said today it has inked a &#8220;global brand deal&#8221; with BNPL giant Klarna to accelerate its expansion and scale in several markets.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is keen to improve the process of joining VR experiences via its Quest headset. Today at the company&#8217;s Connect conference, they announced that Quest users will be able to make and take audio calls via Messenger. The functionality will be available later this year, the company says.</p>
<p>The Quest has generally struggled with its social interfaces over the years, a surprising shortcoming for a device made by a social networking company. Its new mandate last year for users to sign into the platform with their Facebook IDs created some PR issues for the company but has enabled them to eliminate some redundancies in their social workflows.</p>
<p>Users will be able to make calls, send messages or request users join their &#8220;party&#8221; directly from the native Messenger integration inside the Quest.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225721" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Earlier this year, Facebook announced support for Messenger chat inside the Oculus ecosystem, but audio calls will likely help users organize VR meetups more efficiently and help them stay away from typing in VR, which is still a pretty rough experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soon you&#8217;ll be able to read incessant Slack messages without ever having to take off your VR headset.</p>
<p>At Facebook&#8217;s Connect conference, the company showcased a new framework for bringing 2D apps into the Oculus Store so that users will have to duck out of VR less to check notifications on their phone. While a number of Facebook apps are available today, the company also shared that Slack will soon be coming to the Oculus store.</p>
<p>The Quest has previously had very light support for 2D experiences, with most confined to the Oculus web browser. Facebook also previously rolled out native support for Messenger on the Oculus Quest 2 and announced today that they&#8217;ll be bringing support for audio calls to the platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225821" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In August, Facebook showed off its Horizon Workrooms meeting simulator which integrated with Zoom and promised to bring users a more productive VR experience. The lack of app-support was a major roadblock on the way to this goal.</p>
<p>Typing in VR isn&#8217;t exactly a solved problem, so it&#8217;s likely that this will be an experience most suited for users that have paired their keyboard to the headset or are more comfortable just checking up on notifications rather than firing off a ton of lengthy messages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook wants to make its Quest 2 headset a productivity device for a new generation of remote workers, but in order to pull that off, it needs apps.</p>
<p>Today, Facebook announced that they&#8217;re bringing 2D apps into the Oculus Store for the first time. The new apps, which are based on the Progressive Web App (PWA) industry standard, will allow users to check apps that they would have previously needed to take off their headset and see on their phone.</p>
<p>A handful of 2D apps are available in the Oculus Store as of today, including Facebook, Instagram, Smartsheet and Spike. Other apps on the way include Dropbox, Monday.com, MURAL, My5 (UK), Pluto TV and Slack, the company says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225814" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Slack is coming to the Oculus Quest&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/slack-is-coming-to-the-oculus-quest/embed/#?secret=qsqnzE8iXo" data-secret="qsqnzE8iXo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While the Oculus Store has seen native VR support from a handful of app-makers, maintaining a dedicated virtual reality app is complicated on multiple fronts and has led to apps from companies like Netflix and Hulu seeing very rare updates. Relying on PWAs will make the developer lift significantly lighter and will hopefully lead to broader adoption than Oculus has generally seen from app makers.</p>
<p>The inclusion of 2D apps is part of a broader effort to bring the Quest into the workplace. In August, the company announced an app called Horizon Workrooms, which allowed workers to bring their desktop into VR and communicated in a shared social VR space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The on-demand transport space in Africa has evolved since San Francisco-based ride-hailing firm </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/uber-tests-shared-rides-in-africa-as-uberpool-stays-shut-in-us-canada/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first set up operations in South Africa in 2013, setting the stage for its foray across the continent while radically transforming the entire taxi industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost a decade later, Africa’s taxi industry is now dominated by tens of local and international tech-led ride-on-demand platforms, with the latest additions being global giants Didi Chuxing from China and Russia’s inDriver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking to edge out its competitors, Chinese behemoth Didi is currently expanding across the continent, stepping up competition for market leaders Uber and Estonia-based Bolt. Evidence shows it is preparing to enter Nigeria, having begun operations in South Africa in March and Egypt just last month when the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">posted a job opening for a driver center manager in Lagos – the same role it first advertised for when entering South Africa and Egypt.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225714" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key indicator of the company’s imminent expansion into Nigeria was hidden within the lines of the driver center manager&#8217;s responsibilities – &#8220;to collaborate with operations and Didi&#8217;s team to support the successful launch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didi did not respond to multiple TechCrunch requests for comment about its expansion plans in Africa.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225766" style="width: 357px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225766" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2225766" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?w=347" alt="Didi" width="347" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=76,150 76w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=153,300 153w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=768,1507 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=347,680 347w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=783,1536 783w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=1044,2048 1044w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/E520036E-6E8E-4A20-A012-70076D6191AA.jpeg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225766" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of Didi’s app in Nigeria</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didi is one of the biggest ride-hailing services in the world. However, unlike global competitors Uber and Bolt, which years ago saw Africa as a key market in their quest for global dominance, the Chinese firm held off the continent until now.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2012, Didi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/how-do-ride-hailing-giants-didi-uber-compare-2021-06-30/#:~:text=%2D%20Didi%20has%2015%20million%20annual,twelve%20months%20ended%20March%2C%202021.&amp;text=%2D%20Uber%20in%20February%202020%20said,some%205%20million%20drivers%20worldwide.&amp;text=%2D%20Didi%20was%20loss%2Dmaking%20from,the%20first%20quarter%20this%20year.">has around 600 million users</a> across 17 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Russia. The company also has over 15 million annual active drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to launching other mobility platforms, Didi now owns minority stakes in other global platforms &#8212; the United States&#8217; Lyft and Uber, Indonesia&#8217;s Grab, Egypt&#8217;s Careem and India&#8217;s Ola. It also fully acquired Brazil&#8217;s 99.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Didi starts its incursion into Africa, Russia’s inDriver is firming up its presence across the same markets, where it recently started taking commissions from drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike other taxi-hailing apps that have a unilateral billing structure, inDriver allows riders to negotiate trip charges with drivers, making it popular among taxi users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taxi drivers in Kenya’s capital Nairobi using inDriver, which rolled out its services in Africa in 2018, have over the last few days received notifications from the company confirming the introduction of a 9.52% commission for every trip made. The commission is lower than Didi’s 13%, although both are much lower than Uber’s 25% and Bolt’s 20%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">InDriver inferred that it was introducing the charges due to the increased demand of the service, but it was keen to keep the commission lower than those of its competitors. The app was launched about three years ago across multiple markets in Africa including South Africa, Nigeria, Tanzania, Morocco and Botswana with the promise of a commission-free first year. The company is just now introducing commissions in some of these markets, although the deductions are already in effect in Nigeria and South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a notification sent to drivers in Kenya, inDriver said that it “became a noticeable event in the passenger rides market in Nairobi. Many people use it daily and their number is increasing. This extensive work requires significant costs. To cover these costs, we introduce payments for each order in the amount of 9.52%. To keep inDriver still profitable for both passengers and drivers, the amount of payments is lower than in other services, where payments can range from 15% to 30% of each order.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new update comes as the company plans to grow in different markets, having already diversified into the courier business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company launched its delivery business in April last year, at the height of the pandemic, to tap the demand for parcel delivery services. Courier services enlisted on the app include auto, foot and moto, and are available in over 16 countries. The company is now introducing freight services in different markets around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013 by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arsentomsky/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Arsen Tomsky</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, inDriver is currently available in 34 countries and recently crossed the 100-million download mark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it joins Didi to step up competition in Africa, market pioneers Uber and Bolt are expanding their service range in cities across the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Uber is rolling out Pool Chance, a feature that lets riders headed in the same direction share the cost of the journey, in Kenya, with plans to offer the low-cost service in Ghana and Nigeria. The company says that the rollout of budget services is part of its plan to attract price-sensitive users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the continent, Uber has over the last few months expanded into new regions and introduced new products as part of its strategy to retain existing customers and attract new ones amid growing competition.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, the firm entered two additional cities in Nigeria &#8212; Ibadan and Port Harcourt &#8212; bringing into the regions a service that is already available in three other cities. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In South Africa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is now available in 40 cities, serving 80% of the urban population, with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> premium services Uber Comfort, UberX and UberBlack and budget service UberGo. It recently expanded into 21 new cities and added a feature last August that allows the booking of trips a month in advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to continue investments into African cities through collaborations with national and local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that we face significant competition across local transportation modes in Africa. These are vibrant and competitive with many viable alternatives, including ridesharing, personal cars and public transportation—which consumers can and do choose between,” Frans Hiemstra, the general manager for Uber Sub-Saharan Africa, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe competition makes us better, which improves the service for our riders and earners alike,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is still king in terms of combined market share in Africa; it claims to have about 150,000 drivers in its eight markets across the continent, while Bolt comes in second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt has been aggressively</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bolt-to-expand-ev-option-in-south-africa/?tpcc=tcplustwitter"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">expanding its services in Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The firm is planning to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">roll out electric taxi options in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in Johannesburg and Cape Town.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolt also launched its food delivery service in Nigeria last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Uber, Bolt sees myriad opportunities in the continent.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see that there is room for several players across the continent. The infrastructure and experience we have built up with our ride-hailing business give us a good platform to expand and diversify our services,” said Bolt’s regional director for Africa and Middle East, Paddy Partridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For new players like Didi, it will be an entry to a market that dealt with drivers and partners demanding better working terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria and Kenya, both Uber and Bolt faced a series of protests earlier this year as their drivers expressed displeasure with the ride-hailing companies&#8217; decision to increase their commissions, despite burdening users with price surges. However, no notable changes have been made from either of the two companies in line with the demands of drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didi’s operations elsewhere have not been without drama. Before it went public on the NYSE this year – nine years after operating as a privately held startup and raising $25 billion from investors – the Alibaba, SoftBank and Apple-backed company faced scrutiny from the Chinese government and regulators. It was accused of employing anti-competitive practices and pricing and misusing users&#8217; personal information.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didi&#8217;s fallout with China is just one of the many struggles it dealt with this year. Trying to compensate for the troubles at home, the firm looked to enter the U.K. market, but the move was met with concerns from the British Parliament that China could harvest data from Brits using Didi&#8217;s service. However, it seems its entry into African markets has been smooth &#8212; and could explain why it wants to keep its operations quiet: to avoid scrutiny.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tim Berners-Lee created the standards for the world wide web three decades ago, setting the pathway for countless companies to flourish at unimaginable scale. His new venture, called Inrupt, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/08/tim-berners-lees-startup-inrupt-releases-solid-privacy-platform-for-enterprises/">wants to fix some of the mess</a> many of those companies have made &#8212; and it&#8217;s in the market to raise money.</p>
<p><a href="https://inrupt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inrupt</a> is in talks with a handful of investors to raise between $30 million to $50 million at a pre-money valuation of $140 million, according to two people familiar with the matter and an investor pitch deck obtained by me. The round &#8212; Series A &#8212; hasn&#8217;t closed, so the terms may change, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.</p>
<p>An Inrupt spokesperson declined to comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225709" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup, which counts Akamai Technologies and Glasswing Ventures among its investors, says it is attempting to “reshape the internet” by building a platform that gives users control of their data. Inrupt has built a platform where users can store their personal data in something called a POD (Personal Online Datastores). Its customers include governments and enterprises.</p>
<p>&#8220;Governments and enterprises want to help manage their users&#8217; data, but unfortunately, they do not have a platform to do so. Corporations want access to that consumer data without necessarily storing it, but again, there is no global open protocol for them to do so,&#8221; the investor deck reads.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now creating a new platform and infrastructure that gives the global population control over their data, governments the ability to put data programs in place to securely store that data and enterprises the ease of use to access that data without fear of insecurity or abuse,&#8221; the pitch reads, pointing to the startup&#8217;s product called Solid.</p>
<p>Inrupt believes, it said in the investor pitch, that its addressable market is the “entire data market,&#8221; as it attempts to emulate the core infrastructure of companies such as Visa for credit card processing and Verisign, which commercialized the DNS standard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has signed contracts with governments of Sweden, Argentina and Basque. These partnerships have not been previously reported. It generated $225,000 in revenue last year, and $200,000 in revenue last month, according to the investor pitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inrupt&#8217;s management team and Board of Directors are committed to a governance system that ensures that the company operates with utmost integrity, transparency and with the highest ethical and privacy standards,&#8221; the investor pitch reads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you make some software and sell it online, you can make lots of money. Thanks to low-cost distribution, it&#8217;s possible to write one bit of code and sell it many times, generating fat margins in the process. Throw in a larger industry trend toward recurring pricing as opposed to single-shot sales, and you have the foundation for rich software company valuations in hand.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Writing was supposed to be the same, but it mostly didn&#8217;t work out. The internet allows you to write once and distribute those words to anyone at incredibly low costs, but the economics wound up being pretty tough. The real way to make money writing online, it turned out, was to treat words as code to a degree and release them under a subscription aegis, allowing media companies to look quite a lot more like modern software companies than we expected in the earlier days of the internet.</p>
<p>The New York Times &#8212; 68% subscription revenues <a href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2021/08/Press-Release-6.27.2021-PM-7Xc0A2HHkQj.pdf">in Q2 2021</a> &#8212; is a good example of how this can work. TechCrunch+ is another example of the model, though we&#8217;re about a zillion times smaller.</p>
<p>The model of writing and distributing it for <em>free</em> online was predicated on advertising rates translating from older businesses like television and print to the web. They mostly didn&#8217;t, even if certain publication niches can command reasonable ad rates at the moment.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s NerdWallet, a business that has proven that you can not only make a lot of money with writing on the internet while not charging for it, but also that if you manage the feat, you can generate huge amounts of value at the same time. We love a counterexample here at TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001625278/000162828021020521/nerdwallets-1a2.htm">dropped pricing details this week</a>, giving us a window into its expected public-market valuation, and the good news for fans of making words appear for others to consume is that NerdWallet is set to command a unicorn price when it does begin to trade.</p>
<p>Who would have thought!</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s NerdWallet worth?</h2>
<p>Naturally, what NerdWallet does is different from pure journalism. But the firm does make noise &#8212; as we noted in both <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/nerdwallets-ipo-filing-reveals-high-margin-content-business-accelerating-marketing-spend/">an earlier piece on the company</a> and on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/nerdwallet-gen-z-and-the-value-of-the-written-word/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">writing-focused episode of Equity</a> &#8212; about its writing team being editorially independent.</p>
<p>In theory, then, the company&#8217;s writing teams are working for the reader and not for the near-term goals of the company&#8217;s revenue and marketing functions.</p>
<p>NerdWallet even noted in its IPO filing that it will avoid sugar-high, near-term revenue hits to preserve long-term credibility, i.e., it doesn&#8217;t intend to take extra checks from folks to recommend lesser products. NerdWallet&#8217;s business model is built around trust &#8212; that it will recommend the best products regardless of how much they pay in commission for sending users their direction.</p>
<p>As something of a personal finance Wirecutter, trust and the work the company does to preserve it are key foundations of NerdWallet&#8217;s relationship with end users.</p>
<p>Back to valuations: When we consider that NerdWallet expects to sell stock in its IPO at $17 to $19 per share, against a non-diluted share count of 64,747,341, or 65,834,841 inclusive of shares reserved for its underwriting banks, we can put a value on its business of as much as $1.25 billion. That must be more than $1 per word that NerdWallet has published, implying a pretty good return on scribbling.</p>
<p>My favorite group of IPO heads, Renaissance Capital, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/87760/Personal-finance-platform-NerdWallet-sets-terms-for-$131-million-IPO">peg the company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation</a> at the midpoint of its IPO price range as $1.3 billion. At $19 per share, that figure rises to $1.37 billion. Again, not bad for a company predicated on being able to extract dollars from words.</p>
