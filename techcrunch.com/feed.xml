										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Justworks released an updated IPO filing today, providing fresh financial results and a look at what the company may be worth when it debuts.</p>
<p>For those of you in search of a single number, using a simple share count, Justworks could be worth more than $2 billion at the top end of its current range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But that&#8217;s hardly enough information. So this morning, The Exchange is going to calculate the company&#8217;s various simple and fully diluted valuation marks, run multiples using its most recent quarter&#8217;s results, and compare all the data to the firm&#8217;s final known private valuation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220366 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I had wanted to write up a 2022 IPO primer this morning, discussing the upcoming Reddit and Via IPOs, but that will have to wait a day. The Justworks <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001623414/000162828022000133/justworkss-1a1.htm">S-1/A filing is here</a>, if you want to follow along. Let&#8217;s talk SMB-focused HR software!</p>
<h2>Justworks&#8217; recent financial performance</h2>
<p>If you missed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/justworks-files-to-take-its-smb-focused-hr-themed-saas-business-public/">our first look into the Justworks story</a>, let&#8217;s catch you up: The company has two core business lines. The first, called subscription, is what Justworks charges for access to its service &#8212; things like &#8220;HR expertise, employment and benefit law compliance services, and other HR-related services,&#8221; per its filing.</p>
<p>The other, larger component of its top line is called &#8220;benefits and insurance-related revenue.&#8221; The former is pretty high margin, the latter less so.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the company did on an aggregated basis in its November 31, 2021, quarter:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252971" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252971" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2252971 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="154" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png 701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=150,34 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=300,68 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=680,154 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-04-at-8.26.05-AM.png?resize=50,11 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252971" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Justworks S-1/A filing</p></div></p>
<p>As you can see, Justworks posted fairly material growth on a year-over-year basis, and even better gains in terms of gross profit. If you are surprised that the company&#8217;s resulting gross profit is so small compared to its revenues, recall that Justworks is not merely a software company; its revenues include lots of that lower-margin &#8220;benefits and insurance-related revenue&#8221; that we noted above.</p>
<p>More simply, the company is in the SMB HR space, so its software unlocks customer activity that will not generate SaaS-like margins. Still, the company&#8217;s aggregate results detail growth and very limited losses. So we can note that the company&#8217;s revenue mix is different from what we see from most software companies while also not being rude about that fact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seoul Robotics, an AI-based perception software company, wants to turn first- and last-mile logistics hubs for automotive and trucking into mind hives, wherein one sensor tower controls the movements of a fleet, like a conductor of an orchestra, guiding hundreds of vehicles into place.</p>
<p>After two years of piloting its tech with BMW, the startup announced at CES its first commercial deployment with the German car manufacturer to automate fleet logistics at its manufacturing facility in Munich, deploying technology that it refers to as &#8220;autonomy through infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vehicles that are guided by Seoul Robotics&#8217; newest product, the Level 5 Control Tower (LV5 CTRL TWR), are not autonomous themselves. All that is required of them is to have an automatic transmission and connectivity, according to HanBin Lee, CEO of Seoul Robotics.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252408" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A web of sensors and computers with Seoul Robotics&#8217; 3D perception software, &#8220;Sensr,&#8221; is strategically placed on infrastructure throughout a facility. That infrastructure then perceives information about the environment surrounding the vehicles, performs computations, makes predictions and sends commands to the vehicles themselves, which Lee said can be done today safely without a human safety operator or human in the loop at all.</p>
<p>At BMW, the LV5 CTRL TWR relies mainly on around 100 lidar sensors that have been placed through the facility, but Lee said in the future, the company wants to introduce cameras and radar for sensor redundancy.</p>
<p>Most autonomous vehicle companies are entirely focused on creating self-driving vehicles, complete with all their own sensors and onboard compute power that will enable a vehicle to drive in urban environments and on highways. At least for autonomous freight, those companies still require a human to take over at certain points, like navigating within logistics hubs or, in the case of BMW, moving newly manufactured vehicles from the assembly line to vehicle distribution centers.</p>
<p>Autonomous trucking company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tusimple-completes-its-first-driverless-autonomous-truck-run-on-public-roads/"> TuSimple just successfully completed its first driver-out program</a>, driving on an 80-mile stretch of highway from facility to facility, but the startup still requires humans to manage certain operations on the ground. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/waymo-via-is-scaling-up-autonomous-trucking-operations-in-texas-arizona-california/">Waymo is building autonomous trucking hubs to facilitate its transfer hub model</a>, which involves a combination of automated and manual driving in which human drivers handle first- and last-mile deliveries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>LV5 CTRL TWR is not meant to be deployed on highways. Rather, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>aims to fill in the gaps and cut costs for OEMs, trucking companies, car rental companies, and potentially even airports at the first and last mile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The nature of the facility is that it&#8217;s very tightly packed parking lot, and it&#8217;s a fleet of vehicles trying to drive around in this small facility – somebody needs to orchestrate it, somebody needs to be the control tower and make sure the vehicles are going into the designated spot at the right timing,&#8221; Lee told TechCrunch. &#8220;Even if those vehicles become autonomous one day, the Level 5 Control Tower is necessary because it&#8217;s a vehicle management system. Not to mention Level 4 and Level 5 is pretty far off, while this system is providing the benefit right away of basically being a robotaxi within a very confined space.&#8221;</p>
<p>OEMs, car rental companies and trucking companies dedicate thousands of employees to simply moving vehicles from Point A to Point B within their own facilities. Not only is this an unnecessary use of labor, but a lot of damage and accidents also occur when people &#8212; likely locals taking part-time gigs rather than highly trained drivers &#8212; drive in congested spaces, said Lee.</p>
<p>By providing information from multiple vantage points, like behind trucks and around corners, the sensor tower should eliminate blind spots, thus reducing collisions and creating a more reliable process, the company said.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the challenges companies creating Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) software run up against is latency issues. Out in the world, V2X controls are being shared with vehicles through public 4G and 5G LTE, but because Seoul Robotics operates on private grounds, like those owned and operated by BMW, it sends information on private networks where it can ensure bandwidth is dedicated to its own use cases. Besides, the vehicles at these facilities are only allowed to drive up to 13 miles per hour.</p>
<p>A perk of using advanced V2X to automate on private property is that there is no need to work with the government on securing driver-out permits, and almost no risk of vulnerable road users succumbing to an accident, according to Lee.</p>
<p>Another challenge V2X companies have faced in the past, particularly on public roads, is the costs associated with purchasing and installing hardware, but Lee said from a logistics standpoint, the unit economics work out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lidar is much cheaper nowadays, at only $1,000 to $2,000 per sensor, and the full deployment of the system costs a couple million dollars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;OEMs pay upfront for the hardware cost, so we don&#8217;t pay for hardware or installation, and once the system is installed, we&#8217;re basically being paid an installation fee and a licence-per-vehicle monthly fee. Because of the money they&#8217;re saving on labor and potential damage, their ROI can be as short as one or two years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other companies are working on similar technology. In 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/daimler-and-boschs-driverless-parking-feature-can-legally-operate-without-human-supervision/">Bosch and Daimler joined forces to pilot automated valet parking</a>, and Lee said there are a number of startups that have yet to publicly announce their tech but that also bid for the BMW gig.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://twitter.com/JessicaNamKim">Jessica Kim</a>, chief executive officer of </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.ianacare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ianacare</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, understands these statistics deeply as she made the difficult choice to leave her job in 2016 to care for her mom full time, as do nearly a third of working caregivers. Kim co-founded ianacare in 2018 after spending more than seven years caring for her mom during a cancer battle.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Today, caregiver support is the most overlooked gap in healthcare and employee benefits. As per the National Alliance for Caregiving (NAC) <a href="https://www.caregiving.org/caregiving-in-the-us-2020/#:~:text=The%202020%20update%20reveals%20an,compared%20to%20five%20years%20ago">report</a>, about 61% of caregivers are women, while 39% are men. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252846" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“For far too long, caregiving has been treated as an individual issue, and we’ve asked people to make the choice to either work or care for their families. We cannot authentically discuss keeping women in leadership or the workforce at large without addressing their care need,” Kim said. </span></p>
<p>The Boston-based startup built a platform, which provides tech-enabled caregiver support through employers and health plans. Its mission is to encourage, empower and equip family caregivers with resources and communities, so no one has to do it alone.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ianacare announced this morning it has raised a $12.1 million Series A funding led by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.greycroft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greycroft</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> with participation from 8VC, SemperVirensVC, Able Partners and Brown Alumni Group. Previous backers, including Slow, Founder Collective, Indicator Venture and Entrée Capital also made follow-on investments in the round. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fresh capital, which gives ianacare a total of $16.7 million raised to date, </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">will be used to scale sales, internal team and operations needed to meet the rising demand of companies looking to support family caregivers in their workforce. ianacare currently has seven full-time employees and will expand the team to more than 25 by the end of this year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“For caregivers, ianacare is the front door to all the different types of support they will need in the home environment,” Kim said in an email interview. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Through its free mobile app, users can organize and mobilize friends and family onto one team for easy coordination of everyday tasks such as dropping off groceries, picking up medication from the pharmacy, providing respite care and more, Kim said. This feature, also knowns as personal social circles, is available to download for all consumers and is used nationwide, even if their employer is not currently an enterprise partner, Kim added.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The startup works with employers and institutions to offer a cost-effective and scalable enterprise solution as a benefit to working caregivers. Its enterprise solution, launched in March 2021, covers more than 400,000 lives through existing partnerships with employers like </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.anthem.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anthem</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, an insurance company. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As we look ahead to launching with some of the nation&#8217;s largest employers in 2022, we are on track to grow to cover more than 1 million lives,&#8221; Kim said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To differentiate itself from other companies in the space, ianacare&#8217;s solution provides “unlimited access of online chat, phone, video with professional caregiver coaches,” which is just one of the five layers of support it offers, Kim said. Also, the platform is a one-stop-shop solution, connecting family caregivers to all the layers of support personalized for their specific home, work, and care situation. It can detect gaps in care and proactively fill those needs with resources available to the caregiver and care recipient, Kim continued. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“There are so many activities built into the care plan that fall to family caregivers – like medication management, transportation to and from appointments, managing dietary needs. Creating a true infrastructure of care in the home environment requires access, knowledge, and guidance,” said Steven Lee, COO and co-founder of ianacare. “What we realized was that thousands of resources and services already exist, but they are highly fragmented and difficult to find. The power of technology allows us to bring large systems together, enable simpler connection and coordination and deliver highly personalized experiences at scale,”  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The scalability of the ianacare platform has remained a focus and will become increasingly important in order to meet the fundamental increase in care happening in the home, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ranks of family caregivers are on pace to exceed 75 million Americans over the next ten years; ianacare calculated the figure based on the rates of growth in caregiving in these </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.caregiving.org/caregiving-in-the-us-2020/#:~:text=The%202020%20update%20reveals%20an,compared%20to%20five%20years%20ago" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">stats</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> &#8211; growing at more than 10 million every five years. There would be a tremendous impact on the U.S. healthcare system, society, culture, and workplace without proper support structures, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">F<span style="color: #0e101a;">amily caregivers, with an average age of 59, have higher rates of anxiety, depression, and disturbed sleep than non-caregivers, according to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/health/coronavirus-home-caregivers-elderly.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #4a6ee0;">a report by New York Times</span></a>. The startup claims that those with access to ianacare’s platform reported an 83% increase in productivity, a 30% decrease in stress and burden and 96% reported feeling supported by their employer, in a recent study of working family caregivers at Anthem conducted by Healthcore. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“For the last several years, we’ve had a strong thesis that the caregiving space was ripe for innovative impact. When we saw the comprehensive nature of ianacare’s platform and the passion behind the founders’ personal experiences, we knew they were the right team to lead this incredible transformation,” said partner of Greycroft, Ellie Wheeler, who will join the ianacare board to support its next phase of growth. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brands like Muzak have made a big business out of building catalogues of licensed audio content for commercial venues &#8212; the infamous &#8220;elevator music&#8221; &#8212; and today a company that&#8217;s aiming to do the same for video has picked up a big round of funding as its business continues to see strong momentum, despite the many dampeners brought on public life from the Covid pandemic. <a href="https://atmosphere.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atmosphere</a>, which creates and streams ad-supported, free licensed video channels &#8212; often without any sound &#8212; for broadcast in public places like bars, restaurants and doctors&#8217; offices, has raised $100 million &#8212; $80 million in the form of a Series C and a further $20 million in debt.</p>
<p>Sageview Capital is leading this round, with Valor Equity Partners and S3 Ventures also participating. Valor &#8212; the VC that has backed, among the likes of SpaceX and GoPuff, also several media tech startups like Reddit and esports startup Cloud9 &#8212; led Atmosphere&#8217;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atmosphere-closes-25-million-series-b-investment-from-valor-equity-partners-301275396.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B round of $25 million</a> less than a year ago, in April 2021. Bridge Bank is providing the $20 million debt facility.</p>
<p>Atmosphere isn&#8217;t disclosing its exact valuation but Leo Resig, the co-founder and CEO, tells me it&#8217;s &#8220;not quite a unicorn, but we are close.&#8221; (In other words, in the high hundreds of millions.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252925" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This would be a big step up for Atmosphere, which has now raised $140 million spinning out from Chive Media (the video content platform) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/23/atmosphere-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2019</a> and was, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/266979-43/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>, valued at $275 million in April 2021.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also coming on the heels of strong growth in what might have otherwise been challenging times for the company and its particular business model. Resig told me that in the last year, it has more than doubled its customer footprint to 19,000 (it was 9,000 business venues a year ago), and it now streams some 250,000 hours of content daily to some 20 million unique viewers. Resig said that it&#8217;s getting 215,000 impressions per advertisement, &#8220;comparable to a TV rating.&#8221; That is a lucrative comparable: the TV ad market is a $70 billion opportunity today,  he added.</p>
<p>Its mix of content, meanwhile, is not exactly comparable with what you might get from a cable subscription: it sources and curates video from third-parties (some unknown and some well-known brands like Red Bull, with one very big name coming to its screens later this week); and it combines that with content that it creates itself (such as a new news format). Virtually all of it is sound-free and captioned with summary text on screen.</p>
<p class="p11">&#8220;One hundred percent of the content we stream is audio optional,&#8221; Resig said. He added that more than 99% of the venues that use its services had already been broadcasting TV with the sound off anyway, so that is what it set out to create with its own channels: video content that can be engaging without the sound on, by default. &#8220;Like any good business we find a problem and fix it.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The opportunity for Atmosphere (and for its investors) is in tapping that gap in the market, with the belief that companies creating content want to find new users, and they will be willing to consider the Atmosphere format as part of that effort.</p>
<p>In addition to a big social media brand that Atmosphere is announcing as a partner later this week, the company said that it&#8217;s in conversation with a number of others, including professional sports organizations, to build channels of their own on the Atmosphere platform.</p>
<p>Atmosphere has identified an interesting disparity in how media is streamed in public places. Much like music, video streaming requires specific licensing when it is used in commercial venues, and as such paid TV in those environments &#8212; when it is being used legally &#8212; works out as a more expensive subscription than it would be for a consumer using it in a private home.</p>
<p>That economic premium represented a prime opportunity to Atmosphere: create TV content specifically for public venues, and price it significantly cheaper than basic paid TV &#8212; free, in fact, supported instead by ads &#8212; and package it up with hardware that it supplies (Apple TV, although business customers can use their own they you already have it), so that it can be plugged into a TV in the venue. (Note: there is a $99 activation fee when customers first sign on, so not totally free.)</p>
<p>Along with the economic model, Atmosphere also rethought what venues wanted in their spaces, too: the lack of sound and keeping the content short and watchable without being distracting turns out to fit perfectly with how people tend to watch media in public places.</p>
<p>Atmosphere&#8217;s initially push was to sells to bars and restaurants, although that business has unsurprisingly seen a lot of setbacks in the last two years with Covid-19. The company in that period decided to diversify and sell to other kinds of venues, such as doctors&#8217; and other offices, as well as other public places like gyms, where people typically might have to spend time waiting for something, or doing something that doesn&#8217;t take all their concentration or needs a distraction. That turned out to be a growing market: today some 60% of Atmosphere&#8217;s customers are still bars and eateries (which ideally will also come back into growth as the pandemic hopefully subsides), but the other 40% is a wide mix of others. Current customers include Meineke Car Care, Burger King, and Texas Roadhouse.</p>
<p class="p11">“We were impressed with Atmosphere’s unique strategy for connecting advertisers with hyper-focused markets. We believe their capabilities will be well-received among advertisers and businesses that adopt the service,” said Dean Nelson from Sageview, in a statement. “Given the company’s proven business model and strong growth, we’re excited to partner alongside Atmosphere at a stage when scaling its operation is most critical.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p class="p11">Atmosphere is not the only game in town for these kinds of services: the company behind Muzak, which is now called <a href="https://us.moodmedia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mood Media</a>, also has branched out into video solutions, among a number of others targeting people outside the home. The proposition remains a compelling one for the platform that can not only make it as easy as possible to integrate with a business&#8217;s existing infrastructure, but finds a way to make it profitable for everyone involved. For Austin-based Atmosphere, it has squared away how to address the former, but the latter remains a question: Resig, who co-founded the company with his brother John, confirmed that Atmosphere has yet to make a profit; the projection is that the funding and further scaling will lead there, too.</p>

<p>Throughout 2021, global news seemed to ricochet between the rapid spread of new iterations of COVID-19 and cyber criminality — both becoming increasingly creative and disruptive as they mutate in a battle for survival; both interlinked as cybercriminals profit from rapid digitalization forced by COVID-19 lockdowns. In a <a href="https://insight.scmagazineuk.com/top-cisos-what-i-learned-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent interview</a>, a prominent cybersecurity executive pointed out that alongside birth, death and taxes, the only other guarantee in our current lives is the exponential growth of digital threats.</p>
<p>Yet misperceptions over cybersecurity — particularly that it is complex, costly, onerous and even futile — has led many emerging economies to leave cybersecurity behind as they seek to join the Fourth Industrial Revolution. But without mature cybersecurity policies, states might find themselves unable to fully realize the potential of their digital economies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252633" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Reframing cybersecurity as a path to opportunity and competitive advantage in the development of innovation ecosystems could be the key to increasing individual states’ cyber resilience, as well as strengthening the global digital ecosystem for all.</p>
<h2>Innovation or security?</h2>
<p>As 10 billion devices are set to join the Internet of Things (IoT) by 2025, emerging digital economies are vying to be at the center of this revolution. In 2020, about <a href="https://www.business-sweden.com/contentassets/a95b43647e544df19b2aff7068606094/africa---fertile-ground-for-innovation-and-opportunity.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2.4 billion worth of investment was deployed in African startups</a> and Africa’s e-commerce sales are projected to reach $75 billion by 2025. It is <a href="https://www.business-sweden.com/contentassets/a95b43647e544df19b2aff7068606094/africa---fertile-ground-for-innovation-and-opportunity.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">home to half of the 40 fastest-growing emerging and developing countries</a> and is currently the most <a href="https://institute.global/policy/what-would-it-take-make-africa-tech-startup-superpower-towards-roadmap-policymakers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entrepreneurial</a> continent. This trend will only accelerate as initiatives to close the digital divide by 2030 connect the remaining 78% of the population to the internet.<br />

<p>But as internet access expands, so too, will global cybercrime. Experts estimate that cybercrime will <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybercrime-damages-6-trillion-by-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost</a> the world economy $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. While digitally advanced nations have responded by bolstering their cyber defenses, Africa’s innovation ecosystem remains one of the most under-protected globally.</p>
<p>Only 10 out of 55 African countries have ratified the African Union Convention on Data Protection and Cybersecurity (the Malabo Convention) and Africa continues to be the lowest-scoring continent on the <a href="https://www.itu.int/hub/2021/09/are-african-countries-doing-enough-to-ensure-cybersecurity-and-internet-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) Global Cybersecurity Index</a>. Despite ITU and World Bank initiatives, only 29 countries in Africa have any type of cybersecurity legislation and only 19 have cyber incident and emergency response teams. This leaves African economies exposed and African leaders outside of the bodies shaping global cybersecurity policy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When viewed globally, this rapid investment in innovation systems without concurrent investment in security creates a digital maturity-security paradox, in which attackers can exploit the gap between these two levels of maturity. In turn, those entities within the states and the states themselves are left doubly exposed and vulnerable as they become low-hanging fruit susceptible to opportunistic and malicious cyber criminals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252636" style="width: 522px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252636" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2252636 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tc_global_cybersecurity.png" alt="" width="512" height="288" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tc_global_cybersecurity.png 512w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tc_global_cybersecurity.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tc_global_cybersecurity.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tc_global_cybersecurity.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252636" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Garson</p></div></p>
<p>In a dynamic reminiscent of vaccine geopolitics, this runs the risk of leaving states with fledgling and fragile innovation systems exposed.</p>
<h2>Cybersecurity fight or flight?</h2>
<p>It would be logical to assume that the increase of cyber incidents — and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/suspected-ransomware-payments-for-first-half-of-2021-total-590-million-11634308503?mod=tech_lead_pos1&amp;utm_source=blognotification&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Blog%20Post%20Notification%20Net%20Politics&amp;utm_term=NetPolitics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sticker shock</a> <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/tech/cybercrime-to-top-6-trillion-in-2021-north-texas-security-firm-says/2636083/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costs</a> associated with them — should lead to increased cybersecurity. Yet, counterintuitively, the narratives of cybersecurity that spur action in the West either lead to policy paralysis or restrictive knee jerk reactions.</p>
<p>As game theorist and Nobel laureate Thomas C. Schelling noted “<a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=3226" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is a tendency in our planning to confuse the unfamiliar with the improbable … what is improbable need not be considered seriously.”</a> Many digitally developing states consider themselves outside of the great power politics that underpin malicious cyber activity. It seems improbable to them that they would be victims to the magnitude of action witnessed in Russian-U.S. cyberspace confrontations, the China-U.S. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/is-washington-prepared-for-a-geopolitical-tech-race/">race</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/fintech-regulation-us-china/">for</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/22/to-protect-the-future-of-the-internet-us-led-tech-diplomacy-must-change-tack/">digital</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/24/can-america-meet-its-next-sputnik-moment/">supremacy</a>, or the Iran-Israel digital war of attrition. Protecting from such cyberattacks is low on the list of policy imperatives.</p>
<p>Digitally advanced nations have responded to the rapid proliferation of cyber threats with cybersecurity mechanisms such as new legislation with draconian punishments for failure to report cyber incidents and ransomware payments and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-governments-turn-tables-ransomware-gang-revil-by-pushing-it-offline-2021-10-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coordinated international initiatives to paralyze ransomware gangs such as REvil</a>. At the other end of the spectrum, digitally developing states are often ill-incentivized and ill-equipped to unravel the perceived complexity of cybersecurity measures required to address these threats.</p>
<p>This is compounded by a wariness of Western cybersecurity paradigms, which many see as a form of potential technological neo-colonialism. Demands for regulatory compliance, adoption of norms and purchase of Western cybersecurity technologies are often perceived as stifling these nations’ opportunities for growth. And, attempts at trying to shame states into cybersecurity compliance can be perceived as an attack on their sovereignty, which could backfire and drive states to seek alternative paradigms such as internet shutdowns that may ultimately threaten their access to the benefits of the free, open and interoperable internet.</p>
<p>More frequently, though, leaders often react to overwhelming threats with paralysis — and fail to act at all.</p>
<p>It is the CISO’s mantra that cybersecurity is a team sport. In the global context, this means ensuring that developing digital economies <em>want </em>to be part of the team. To achieve this cybersecurity needs a radical makeover.</p>
<h2>Radically reframing cybersecurity</h2>
<p>Cybersecurity advocates can start by reframing cybersecurity as an opportunity to build a vibrant and resilient innovation ecosystem rather than a burden or a restraint. New narratives that emphasize the attractiveness and value of cybersecurity are needed to counteract perceptions of unreasonable standards that stifle innovation.</p>
<p>For instance <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/2018/05/cybersecurity-the-new-competitive-advantage-for-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> show that cybersecurity and data privacy is a major source of competitiveness for retailers, outranking even price sensitivity. Meanwhile, recent U.S. and British initiatives, like the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/578728-blinken-formally-announces-new-state-dept-cyber-bureau-as-part-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new State Department Cyber Bureau</a> and the U.K.’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-cyber-strategy-2022/national-cyber-security-strategy-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Cyber Strategy 2022</a> have highlighted strong cyber ecosystems as strategic advantages.</p>
<p>Governments of mature digital economies, multilateral institutions and cybertech providers should emphasize that those states able to protect themselves will be the most sought-after partners in the digital revolution. They will also be those able to shape global conversations on cybersecurity.</p>
<h2>The value of safer net for all</h2>
<p>A vibrant and competitive digital economy that leads to prosperity for all requires open and interoperable networks that are trusted, safe and secure. States that are able to leverage best practices to secure their innovation ecosystems will lead the way in disruptive development. But to induce states, SMEs and individuals to take cybersecurity seriously requires a shift from advocating policy built <em>from</em> fear toward policy built <em>on</em> an optimistic rationale for cybersecurity.<em> </em></p>
<p>Changing the narrative also requires digitally mature states to provide sustained support to those more vulnerable. This is more than digitally developing states being just a market for cybertech exports and cybersecurity strategy blueprints, but a commitment to helping develop the infrastructure that unleashes the benefits of cybersecurity locally and globally. Through a radical reframing of cybersecurity as an opportunity, states and societies can work together to ensure that innovation systems built on safe digital inclusion can create a safer net for all and the potential of the internet as a force for good will be realized.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Refinery focuses on “early scale” companies, a term the firm uses to describe companies that secured a seed, but need that “oomph” to get it to Series A.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://refinery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Refinery Ventures</a>, a Cincinnati-based venture firm, announced the close of its second fund with $36 million, which was more than two times its first fund.</p>
<p>Fund II is backed by a group of LPs, including Cintrifuse, Great American Insurance, Western and Southern Insurance and The Cleveland Foundation.</p>
<p>The firm invests in enterprise and SaaS “early scale” companies, a term managing partner Tim Schigel likes to use to describe companies that secured a seed, but need that “oomph” to get to Series A.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252726" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Plenty of companies in the Midwest are getting seed rounds, but many don’t make the gap from seed to Series A,” Schigel told TechCrunch. “You have product market fit, but instead of selling to friends and family, you are selling to organizations. Now you need forecasts and other projections you have never done.”</p>
<p>Most investors initially focus on the founder, but few founders, in Schigel’s opinion, have experience with hypergrowth. It was that lightbulb moment that led him to start Refinery Ventures nearly five years ago.</p>
<p>He says it is not always about being the founder, but if you were employee No. 2 or even 20, but took the company from 20 employees to 200, “you are well-suited to end up being the founder of a company.”</p>
<p>“That is where we want to go looking, for people who experienced hypergrowth and can navigate the gap,” Schigel added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Schigel himself knows all about the challenges of hypergrowth in a company. An electrical engineer by trade, he worked in Cincinnati, but got his Silicon Valley connections early working with Apple to support P&amp;G.</p>
<p>From there he went into venture capital before starting his own company, ShareThis, to keep track of online content that is shared — yes, he’s the one responsible for that little sideways “V” icon. He grew the company to $50 million in revenue in less than four years.</p>
<p>Then Schigel launched and managed Cintrifuse, a fund of funds investing in early-stage funds across the U.S. like Greycroft, Upfront Ventures and Techstars.</p>
<p>“It gave me a unique and different perspective into startups and one I bring to Refinery,” he added.</p>
<p>Prior to the global pandemic, founders were already leaving the coasts, but Schigel believes the timing was right for the new fund when the pandemic became “a catalyst like you couldn’t believe.” His inbox is now full of former Midwesterners looking for opportunities back home.</p>
<p>Refinery Ventures’ first fund went into nine startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/edgybees-raises-9-5m-series-a-for-its-aerial-video-augmentation-service/">Edgybees</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/11/astronomer-raises-3-5m-to-make-data-analytics-more-accessible/">Astronomer</a>, Torch, Tealbook and Folio Photonics. Two of its portfolio companies, HALO Health and Engage, were acquired.</p>
<p>Schigel expects the new fund to invest in a similar number, between 10 and 12 startups. Refinery has already invested from the second fund into companies like Vantage Robotics, RedCircle and StoryTap.</p>
<p>It will also utilize part of the funding to discover and invest in dual-use technologies — companies going after both commercial and government, similar to Edgybees and Vantage Robotics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the past few years, Mojo Vision has had a small presence at CES, offering up glimpses into the potential of its augmented reality contact lenses. Every year, the picture seems a little closer, if still far away. For reasons having to do with the pandemic, we won’t be meeting with the California firm this year, though it is offering up some more insight into what a future of smart contacts could look like.</p>
<p>The big news at this year’s show is a number of partnerships with brands across the sports spectrum, including: Adidas Running, Trailforks (cycling/hiking), Wearable X (yoga), Slopes (skiing) and 18Birdies (golf). In spite of the partnerships, the tech still isn’t ready for market &#8212; among other things, the company is seeking FDA approval.</p>
<p>Instead, what it’s showcasing here is the potential role an effectively eye-mounted display could play in the lives of professional athletes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251750" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Today’s wearable devices can be helpful to athletes, but they can also distract them from the focus of the activity; we think there’s a better way to deliver athletic performance data,” Mojo Senior Director of Product Management David Hobbs said in a release. “Wearable innovation in existing form factors is starting to reach its limits. At Mojo, we&#8217;re interested in better understanding what&#8217;s still missing and how we can make that information accessible without disrupting someone&#8217;s focus and flow during training — when it matters most.”</p>
<p>Effectively, the company’s envisioning a world where data can be served up without a bulky wearable or forcing the athelete to look down at their device. At the very least, the partnerships are a clear indication that Mojo is going after sports as an early market for its technology, in addition to other applications, like assistance for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>The company also announced today a $45 million Series B-1, following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/29/smart-contact-lens-startup-mojo-vision-raises-51m/">last April&#8217;s</a> $51 million raise. This latest round, which features Amazon Alexa Fund, PTC, Edge Investments and HiJoJo Partners, brings the firm&#8217;s total funding up to $205 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back at CES 2020, Labrador Systems co-founder/CEO Mike Dooley told me, “I think there are fewer fake robots [at the show] this year.” Over the past several years, we’ve seen the show begin to treat robotics less as novelty and more as serious home devices. At the time, the company had rented a suite where it was showing off an early version of the system it would come to call, fittingly, Retriever.</p>
<p>Early last year, following the first all-virtual CES, the company began rolling out prototypes to select users. At this week’s show, we’re getting to see the fruits of those early tests, in the form of testimonial videos. Retriever is effectively a more refined version of what I saw two years back, but essentially works on the same principle. It resembles a robotic bar cart, offering assistance for elderly users and people with limited mobility.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251564" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251564" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2251564" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg 5100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kitchen-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251564" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Labrador Systems</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251560" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you’ve been following the industry, you no doubt know that eldercare has been a big business for robotics in Japan, due to an aging population. That’s been less of a case here in the States, though companies are starting to follow suit. Retriever is one of the best examples I’ve seen thus far of an American company purpose-building a robot to assist people in this way. The product is primarily aimed at those people who are capable of living independently, but could benefit from an added robotic hand.</p>
<p>“There’s a significant portion of our society that’s massively underserved,” Dooley said in a release tied to the news. “When pain or other health issues start interfering with your ability to move yourself or other things, even short distances can have a major impact on your independence, quality of life and overall health. The Retriever is meant to help physically bridge some of that gap and empower individuals to be more active and do more on their own.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251565" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251565" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2251565" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg 5389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Laundry-Room-Scene-Press.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251565" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Labrador Systems</p></div></p>
<p>The system is capable of carrying up to 25 pounds, and can be used to deliver laundry, meals and other payloads around the house. It features a retractable tray system that can move objects onto the cart from counters, shelves and a bespoke refridgerator the company says it’s planning to offer. Underneath that is an additional storage space for things like food and medication, as well as a port for charging phones.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The system will also feature voice control by way of Alexa &#8212; fitting, given that the Amazon Alexa Fund was one of the startup’s backers (along with SOSV/HAX, iRobot and the National Science Foundation). Following an upcoming beta test period, Labrador plans to hit commercial sales by the second half of next year, at a range of different price points, based on functionality. Early adopters can secure a Retriever unit for $1,500 up front, plus a monthly services fee of between $99 and $149 a month, depending on financing.</p>
<p>The company is also using the opportunity to announce a $3.1 million seed round co-lead by Alexa Fund and iRobot Ventures. The funding will go toward increasing headcount for engineering and accelerating production.</p>
<p>“Labrador is advancing the state of the art in what it means to provide assistance to people aging and with mobility challenges,” Alexa Fund&#8217;s Paul Bernard said in a statement tied to the news. “They are addressing a significant problem in our society and have brought their decades of experience in consumer robotics to bear, delivering a product that will help empower people to live better lives.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starlink, part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX, informed a number of individuals in India on Tuesday that it will be refunding their pre-orders, more than a month after New Delhi told the firm to stop “booking/rendering the satellite internet service” in the South Asian market without obtaining a license.</p>
<p>In an email to those who had pre-ordered Starlink in India, the company said it was “looking forward to making Starlink available in India as soon as possible,” but it currently doesn’t have clarity on the “timeline for receiving licenses to operate.&#8221;</p>
<p>“As has always been the case, you can receive a refund at any time,” the company wrote, outlining the steps to avail the refund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252945" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Starlink had received over 5,000 pre-orders for its devices in India and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/spacexs-starlink-forms-india-subsidiary-aims-to-deploy-200000-active-terminals-by-2022/">looking to conduct pilots in the country</a>. Last year, the company appointed an India head, who reached out to several stakeholders in the country to explore ways to collaborate.</p>
<p>In late November, the Indian government told the company, which competes with Bharti Group-backed OneWeb and Amazon&#8217;s Kuiper, in a public statement that it needs to comply with the regulations and refrain from taking pre-orders &#8220;with immediate effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Starlink, which had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/spacex-ships-100000-starlink-terminals-to-customers-eyes-future-launches-using-starship/">shipped over 100,000 terminals to customers</a>, sees India as a big potential market. Sanjay Bhargava, the India head of Starlink, said last year the company had plans to deploy over 200,000 active terminals in over 160,000 districts in India by the end of December 2022.</p>
<p>“At Starlink, we want to serve the underserved. We hope to work with fellow broadband providers, solution providers in the aspirational districts to improve and save lives,” he wrote.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even as more than half a billion people are online in India, just as many are still offline. According to industry estimates, hundreds of millions of Indians living in rural areas don’t have access to any broadband network.</p>
<p>“The government approval process is complex. So far there is no application pending with the government, so the ball is in our court to apply for consideration, which we are working on,” Bhargava said at the time.</p>
<p>“Our approach will be to get pilot approval quickly if Pan India approval will take long. We are optimistic that we will get approval for a pilot program or Pan India approval in the next few months,” said Bhargava in October, cautioning that if it fails to get the government approval, the actual number of terminals it may end up deploying by the end of next year will be “much lower than that or even zero.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous trucking company TuSimple is preparing to scale its self-driving tech with the help of Nvidia&#8217;s newest system-on-a-chip (SoC), Drive Orin, the company announced at CES. The chip, which is specifically made for autonomous applications, will provide the robust, compact, energy efficient and auto-grade compute power necessary to accelerate TuSimple&#8217;s race to get its self-driving trucks to market.</p>
<p>The relationship between Nvidia and TuSimple has been going on for years, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/16/nvidia-invests-in-chinese-autonomous-trucking-startup-tusimple/">Nvidia leading TuSimple&#8217;s Series B round in 2017</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/nvidias-next-generation-self-driving-toolkit-is-available-for-2024-vehicle-models/">Drive Orin is part of Nvidia&#8217;s Hyperion 8</a>, a production-ready platform that includes sensors, compute and software needed for AV development, which came to market in November. While TuSimple will choose its own sensors and use in-house-built software, it will rely on Drive Orin&#8217;s SoC to co-develop its autonomous domain control (ADC), the truck&#8217;s central computational unit.</p>
<p>The ADC houses TuSimple&#8217;s virtual driver software, takes inputs from all different sensors and gives outputs in the form of commands to the different parts of the truck to control it, according to CEO and president of TuSimple, Cheng Lu. Drive Orin has sufficient computational power and is compact enough to help TuSimple accelerate its ability to put at scale autonomous trucks on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/tusimple-kicks-off-plan-for-a-nationwide-self-driving-truck-network-with-partners-ups-xpress-and-mclane/">autonomous freight network</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252093" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Without an auto-grade ADC, it&#8217;s not possible for any OEM or autonomous technology player to have scaled production of AV trucks on the road,&#8221; Lu told TechCrunch. &#8220;Today we use prototype systems that are costly, and not as reliable. It works for a small batch of vehicles, but would not work when you manufacture integrated AV trucks at the OEM at scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tusimple-completes-its-first-driverless-autonomous-truck-run-on-public-roads/"> TuSimple completed its first fully autonomous, driverless truck pilot</a> on the I-10 in Arizona, a milestone that brings the company that much closer to scaling its tech into purpose-built trucks over the next three years. TuSimple plans to build semi trucks specifically designed for autonomous applications by 2024 in partnership with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/navistar-teams-up-with-tusimple-to-produce-self-driving-trucks-by-2024/">Navistar</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/vws-traton-group-strikes-a-deal-with-tusimple-to-develop-autonomous-trucks/">Traton Group</a>, Volkswagen AG&#8217;s heavy truck business, but Lu says the Nvidia collaboration is independent of the production programs with those OEMs and did not comment on what ADC the company will use in those trucks.</p>
<p>The Drive Orin SoC delivers 254 trillion operations per second of performance, including perception, planning and actuation functions, according to TuSimple. Along with this most critical hardware component of the ADC, Nvidia brings to the partnership a good understanding of the design and placement of chips into a computational box to make them work most efficiently, says Lu. Because TuSimple&#8217;s software is embedded into the ADC, the company provides requirements like specific computational needs, sensors and power usage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together, we make a blueprint of what the entire ADC needs to be from a hardware perspective, and a third-party manufacturer will produce and assemble a complete ADC,&#8221; said Lu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TuSimple owns usage rights, which includes certain limited &#8220;first-use&#8221; provisions, to the ADC reference design, according to a statement from the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford said Tuesday it will nearly double production capacity of its upcoming electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck to 150,000 vehicles a year by mid-2023 in response to customer demand.</p>
<p>The F-150 Lightning trucks, which will have a base price of $39,974 before tax incentives are applied and not including the destination fee, will be produced at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan.</p>
<p>The company made the decision after receiving nearly 200,000 reservations — essentially refundable placeholders before buying the vehicle — for the new electric pickup truck. The true test of whether this demand is real will begin later this week when Ford invites the first wave of retail reservation holders to place orders for the truck.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248575" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The reservations will be unlocked in waves and more customers should expect to be notified of their chance to place an order in the coming weeks and months, the company said. Invitations will come by email or by logging into their Ford.com account.</p>
<p>More vehicles, of course means more parts. Ford said it is working with key suppliers and its own manufacturing facilities Rawsonville Components Plant and Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center to find ways to increase capacity of parts needed for EVs, including battery cells, battery trays and electric drive systems.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252786" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/REVC_4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252786" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2252786 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/REVC_4.jpg" alt="Ford Lightning electric truck production" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/REVC_4.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/REVC_4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/REVC_4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/REVC_4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/REVC_4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/REVC_4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/REVC_4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2252786" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Ford</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the F-150 Lightning development is progressing. The company said that this week the Lightning entered the final phase of pre-production before moving into mass production later this year.  These production-level trucks will be used for testing in real-world conditions. The first deliveries of the retail F-150 Lightning and F-150 Lightning Pro for commercial customers are expected to begin this spring.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s announcement comes several weeks after CEO Jim Farley said Ford planned to increase production of the all-electric Mustang Mach E in 2022 with the goal of tripling its current capacity by 2023.</p>
<p>Ford said in November that it would increase its production capacity of electric vehicles to 600,000 units globally by 2023 &#8212; a goal that would be spread across the Mustang Mach E, F-150 Lightning and commercial E-transit vans. If Ford hits that 600,000 figure it would double the number it had expected to produce over the next two years.</p>
<p>The automaker said it will spend more than $30 billion in electric vehicles through 2025, which includes an $11.4 billion investment to build three new battery plants with SK Innovation. The plants, one in Tennessee and two in Kentucky, will produce lithium-ion batteries to power next-generation Ford and Lincoln vehicles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since Kindle <a href="http://tech.sina.com.cn/it/2013-06-08/03398425424.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began shipping in China</a> nearly nine years ago, the ebook giant has garnered a loyal following in the country. The journey has never been easy, thanks to regulatory hurdles around digital content. Recently, there are signs that the Amazon-owned ebook business is scaling back some of its operations in China.</p>
<p>Kindle&#8217;s official store on Tmall, Alibaba&#8217;s online shopping mall, closed down in October. Chinese versions of the ebook device are currently <a href="https://www.amazon.cn/s?k=kindle%E9%98%85%E8%AF%BB%E5%99%A8&amp;__mk_zh_CN=%E4%BA%9A%E9%A9%AC%E9%80%8A%E7%BD%91%E7%AB%99&amp;crid=W1F5YEV96VKY&amp;sprefix=kindle%2Caps%2C201&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_3_6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of stock</a> on Amazon.cn, the firm&#8217;s localized site for China. Its official store on JD.com remains up but most of its devices are also out of stock. Some models are still available on its official WeChat store.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson said some Kindle models are &#8220;currently sold out in China&#8221; but consumers can still purchase Kindle through &#8220;third-party online and offline retailers.&#8221; The company declined to say why its Alibaba store was shut and why its products are not stocked in China.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252863" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are dedicated to serving Chinese consumers,&#8221; said the spokesperson. &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s commitment to offering quality customer service and warranty remains unchanged.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Alibaba and JD.com for comment.</p>
<p>Amazon has <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/514198117_114988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> disbanded Kindle&#8217;s device team in China back in November, according to a <a href="https://weibo.com/7669807266/L9aOAe0QM?pagetype=profilefeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media post</a> by a reporter at BK Economy, a subsidiary of state-owned Beijing News. Amazon China declined to comment on the alleged layoff.</p>
<p>Axing the device team would spell the end of the ebook&#8217;s localized hardware. Like iPhone, Kindle has been offering Chinese editions of its devices, which function the same as the American versions but come with aftersales service in China. Closing the hardware unit would also mean third-party distributors are limited to importing overseas Kindle models for Chinese consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>A key but challenging market</h2>
<p>As of 2017, China was Kindle&#8217;s largest market with double-digit growth, David Limp, senior vice-president of Amazon Devices <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/tech/2017-06/28/content_29913054.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> at the time. Nonetheless, the Chinese ebook market has been markedly different from the rest of the world at the outset.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at bestseller lists in 90% of the world, ebooks are – at least at the top of the stack – equivalent to digitalized versions of traditional books. In China, however, traditionally-published books, like traditionally-published longer-form video content such as TV and movies, are not very interesting because the majority of them come from state-owned publishing or content houses that are constrained in the topics they can cover,&#8221; said a veteran of China&#8217;s ebook industry who declined to be named.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how Kindle has fared in China more recently and what led to its decision to close its Tmall store. But given the sheer length of time that Kindle has been present in the market and the amount of hardware that has been sold there, it stands to reason that there are still a large number of Chinese Kindle owners who do purchase and read traditional ebooks from Amazon’s Kindle ebook store.</p>
<p>Kindle&#8217;s Chinese ebook store, which is separate from the global one and features a much smaller pool of English-language books, is still available, so current Kindle owners in China aren&#8217;t affected.</p>
<p>Over the years, Amazon has abridged several waning businesses in China while ramping up the budding ones. In 2019, the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/amazon-china-close-local-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shuttered </a>its online marketplace connecting Chinese buyers and sellers, a business that had put it in competition with local titans like Alibaba. In the meantime, Amazon has been doubling down on its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/chinese-products-get-pulled-from-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">export business in the country</a>, helping Chinese merchants find customers around the world.</p>
<p>Amazon has grappled with criticisms after Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/amazon-partnered-with-china-propaganda-arm-win-beijings-favor-document-shows-2021-12-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> last month it created a portal to feature books sanctioned by the Chinese government, a project that had helped it overcome ebook licensing problems in China.</p>

This amount was also more than double the </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/fintech-bright-spot-africa-plays-catch-up-in-bumper-funding-year?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.35 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investment that fintechs in Africa raised in 2020, and triple the amount in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the largest beneficiaries of the fintech capital were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/african-fintech-opay-valued-at-2b-in-softbank-vision-fund-2-led-400m-funding/">Opay</a>, which raised $400 million in  Series C funding, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a>, which got $170 million in a Series C round, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/south-african-digital-bank-tymebank-lands-109m-from-uk-and-phillippines-investors/">TymeBank</a>, which raised $180 million in Series B. Jumo and MNT Halan raised $120 million rounds, as digital payments gateway MFS Africa gained $100 million. This was as Zepz (formerly WorldRemit) raised $292 million in Series E financing, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/chipper-cash-gets-2b-valuation-with-150m-extension-round-led-by-ftx/">Chipper Cash</a> raised</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$250 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> , <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/tala-grabs-145m-to-offer-more-financial-services-in-emerging-markets/">Tala</a> $145 million as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/sequoia-heritage-stripe-and-others-invest-200m-in-african-fintech-wave-at-1-7b-valuation/">Wave</a> sealed $200 million in funding.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252619" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, given the incremental funding for fintechs in Africa over the years, capital injected into these startups is only likely to increase with deepening mobile phone usage and internet penetration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile subscriber penetration across the continent is predicted to increase by four percentage points to hit 615 million &#8211; </span><a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/sub-saharan-africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">half of the continent’s population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; by 2025 according to the GSM Association. It is also poised for greater growth as the adoption of lending, digital payments, banking and insurance services grows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial Technology Partners, an investment banking firm focused exclusively on fintech, in a past review of the sector in Africa </span><a href="https://ftpartners.docsend.com/view/kg7dbcj"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the continent, with its rapidly growing population, some of the fastest-growing economies and an underdeveloped financial services ecosystem, presents an attractive opportunity for fintechs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the payment space begins to see scale-ups such as Flutterwave, Chipper, MFS Africa, Cellulant, Jumo playing alongside global, established providers such as Visa, Mastercard, and Stripe, the next few years are likely to (in fact, we already do) see increased movements across other fintech verticals, from lending to KYC, SME management software, and decentralised finance. This, and greater M&amp;A activity, as the ecosystem moves towards maturity and consolidation,” Director at Briter Bridges, Dario Giuliani told TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups specializing in digital/mobile payments have received the greatest financing over the years followed by banking/lending startups and insurtechs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest </span><a href="https://ftpartners.docsend.com/view/kg7dbcj"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows digital payments space in Africa has also experienced the greatest growth in terms of funding received and total transactions volume </span><a href="https://ftpartners.docsend.com/view/kg7dbcj"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the last decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when compared to other sub-sectors within the fintech space. The growth experienced by fintechs is against the backdrop of the increasing phone ownership and a deepening penetration of mobile money technology and the internet – all of which have made it possible to bypass the sometimes restrictive traditional banking infrastructure.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovations around mobile money and digital payments have allowed for the processing of payments online and offline through USSD or STK commands, over apps or using NFC technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Africa has a massive underbanked and unbanked population, but its growing middle class, increasing mobile penetration and improving communications infrastructure make it uniquely conducive to fintech innovation and mobile financial services,” said Financial Technology Partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging fintech services have banked the unbanked, driving up financial inclusion as their uptake solves some of the greatest pain points experienced by businesses and individuals– like sending and receiving money, and accepting payments. Startups in the remittance space like Wari, sureRemit and Paga, have, for example, made it possible for African residents to receive money from overseas easily and affordably. </span></p>

<p><strong>Opportunities for growth</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is regarded as the world’s second-fastest growing and profitable payments and banking market after Latin America, according to </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/african%20retail%20bankings%20next%20growth%20frontier/roaring-to-life-growth-and-innovation-in-african-retail-banking-web-final.ashx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> McKinsey study, and this only means that the fintech sector is likely to continue to attract investors tapping on the increasing growth opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The continent is already a global leader in mobile money adoption, accounting for the bulk of the mobile money transactions made in 2020 – a year that saw the number of mobile money accounts rise by </span><a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GSMA_State-of-the-Industry-Report-on-Mobile-Money-2021_Full-report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">43%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  Mobile money success across the continent is likely due to ease in access brought by advancements in telecommunications technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, M-Pesa, a mobile money service by East Africa’s biggest telco, Safaricom, does not require internet connectivity for its customers to send and receive money, as well as to pay utility bills &#8211; the wallet turns subscribers’ phone numbers into a sort of proxy for bank accounts. The service recently surpassed voice to become Safaricom’s top earner after the platform’s revenues hit $745 million for the financial year ending March 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the region (especially in Kenya) M-Pesa has served as an anchor for a raft of new services that are coming online. In 2012, for example, Safaricom laid the ground for the adoption of lending apps when it first launched M-Shwari &#8211; a mobile-based savings and loans product. Many more lending apps have since emerged in the market including Silicon Valley backed Tala and Branch. These now-popular l</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/kenya-cracks-down-on-digital-lenders-over-data-privacy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ending apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use customers&#8217; mobile money transaction history to determine the amount of instant credit to extend to borrowers – monies that are then deposited in customers&#8217; mobile money wallets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such lending and banking startups have made credit accessible to a majority of people with no credit scores, and who were previously cut out by formal financial institutions due to a lack of banking history data.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurtechs have also over the last few years thrived with the birth of innovative products that are affordable, allowing micropayments, and covering growing risks including those brought by climate change. Innovative products around insurtech have also encouraged the uptake of insurance products – even though the penetration across sub-Saharan Africa (with an exception of South Africa) remains low compared to other regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While investments grew in 2021, the bulk of the funding went to a small number of startups. Analysis by Briter, which includes data from both disclosed and undisclosed deals, shows that an estimated $3 billion of the total amount raised went to 20 companies, as over 700 other startups raised nearly $2 billion.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LG has had a pretty incredible winning streak with its OLED televisions the past couple of years. <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65c1pub-oled-4k-tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG&#8217;s C1</a> has been the flat screen to beat, so there&#8217;s little surprise that the company&#8217;s 2022 lineup caught our (virtual) attention at CES this year. It seems like the company is content leaving well enough alone, with a relatively minor update to the best-selling televisions, adding some additional screen sizes and some additional smarts to the family.</p>
<p>OLED tech isn&#8217;t new; Sony showed off a version of an OLED television with dismal resolution and a bank-destroying price tag <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/11/15/very-expensive-sony-oled-tv-ready-for-pre-ordering/">back in 2007</a>. In recent years, the tech has accelerated, putting it within the range of middle-class wallets. The OLED technology in question does away with the need for the back-light found in older LED-lit LCD panels. Instead of a large light source that&#8217;s beamed through an array of little color pixels, in the OLED tech each individual pixel is a little light-emitting diode. This means that when an individual pixel is off, it is not emitting any light at all, giving astonishing amounts of contrast and positively jaw-dropping color gamut. Because of the lacking backlight, TV manufacturers can also get fancy with the packaging; the thinner form factor means rollable or bendable TV screens become possible.</p>
<p>LG&#8217;s TVs have collected well-deserved CES Innovation Awards eight years running, and the company was positively beaming with excitement as it showed off the newest visions for the future of television.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252729" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company showed off two new series of televisions &#8212; the G2 and C2 series, both using upgraded OLED technology to create even better visuals. LG claims that this enables the displays to deliver higher brightness with greater clarity and detail, all of which should result in even more realistic images beamed into your eye-holes at home.<a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-OLED-evo-C2_77-inch_Product05-e1641250731704.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252748" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-OLED-evo-C2_77-inch_Product05-e1641250731704.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="663" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-OLED-evo-C2_77-inch_Product05-e1641250731704.jpg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-OLED-evo-C2_77-inch_Product05-e1641250731704.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-OLED-evo-C2_77-inch_Product05-e1641250731704.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-OLED-evo-C2_77-inch_Product05-e1641250731704.jpg?resize=768,497 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-OLED-evo-C2_77-inch_Product05-e1641250731704.jpg?resize=680,440 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-OLED-evo-C2_77-inch_Product05-e1641250731704.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>LG&#8217;s 2022 77-inch C2 with evo OLED technology. It probably looks better in person. (<strong>Image Credits:</strong> LG)LG’s 2022 G2 series introduces a new 83-inch model and the world’s very first 97-inch OLED displays. The new sizes are introduced alongside the three other sizes (55&#8243;, 65&#8243; and 77&#8243;) already available in the lineup. The LG G2 series gets a design refresh with a snazzy looking flush-to-the-wall mounting option the company calls &#8220;Gallery Design&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the C2 series gets a total of six display sizes for this year&#8217;s starting lineup. It adds a small 42-inch version, which is great for smaller rooms or for console or computer gaming. On top of the newcomer, there are 48-, 55-, 65-, 77- and 83-inch options.</p>
<p>Also new for 2022 is a shiny new user experience based on LG&#8217;s webOS 22. Among other things, the software includes personalizable profiles so the various users of the TVs can configure their settings, which streaming services they prefer, and get customized content recommendations based on their viewing histories and such.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are a number of incremental upgrades on the display side as well, as the company maintains it has further improved its already class-leading color rendition, brightness and a flicker-free experience. LG also doubles down on its gaming cred; it is the first OLED TV to support <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nvidia G-SYNC Compatibility</a>, and the company reminds us that its displays are the first 8K OLED TV to enable full-on 8K gaming with Nvidia&#8217;s top-of-the-range <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX 30-Series graphics cards</a>, along with an array of gaming-specific settings and presets available through the company&#8217;s Game Optimizer menu.</p>
<p>No doubt the reviews will be bubbling forth before long, so keep your eyes peeled for those in the next few weeks and months. If you somehow managed to stay clear of CES in Las Vegas, and you have a beyond-usual interest in LG and its shiny new announcements, you can <a href="http://www.LG.com/CES2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out LG&#8217;s virtual exhibition booth</a> from 8 am PST on January 4th, 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CES, in general, isn’t much of a phone show. That certainly applies to Samsung, which tends to save its big mobile news for Mobile World Congress, a month or two from now. Instead, the event is more about big things: TVs, washing machines, etc.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, however, the electronics giant has used the show as a platform for launching its budget flagship &#8212; again, just ahead of the launch of its…flagship-flagship S series. Over the years, Samsung has toyed around with various names for the product, including the “Lite,” before settling on “FE” &#8212; short for “Fan Edition.” Seems last year&#8217;s device was a big success for the company. It notes, &#8220;Since its launch in Q4 2020, Galaxy S20 FE sold 10 million units in just over a year, making it one of Samsung’s best-selling Galaxy smartphones over the past year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251991" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251991" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2251991" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-7.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-7.jpg 6566w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-7.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-7.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-7.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-7.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-7.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-7.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Galaxy-S21-FE_Lifestyle-Product-7.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251991" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ultimately, the company no doubt landed on the notion that naming a device “Lite” was really leading with the fact that the product was “less than,” from a spec standpoint. So it’s positioning these devices as a kind of fan service &#8212; offering some of the luxuries of the higher-priced devices, while dulling some of the bleeding edges in the name of keeping costs down.</p>
<p>For the newly announced Galaxy S21 FE 5G, that’s a starting price of $699 (roughly one dollar per letter of the product’s name). That’s the same price point the company hit with last year’s S20 &#8212; and $100 more than Google’s Pixel 6, which has catapulted to the top of the list of affordable flagships (apologies if the flagship and budget distinctions get sort of nebulous here).</p>

<p>“We saw an incredible response to the Galaxy S20 FE and Galaxy S21 lineup,&#8221; says Samsung&#8217;s TM Roh in a release. &#8220;So we applied the same approach with S21 FE 5G, equipping it with the premium features that matter most to our loyal Galaxy fans — because we’re focused on delivering a smartphone that meets their most important needs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The handset sports a 6.4-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, as its successor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, is starting rollout on flagships from companies like Xiaomi. There’s a triple camera system with a 12-megapixel main, 32-megapixel ultrawide and 12-megapixel telephoto. The system comes with either 6 or 8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage, along with a solid 4,500mAh battery. And, of course, as the name implies, there’s 5G on-board.</p>

<p>The design borrows plenty of cues from the standard S21, though the premium build has been swapped out for a lower-cost plastic construction. The S21 FE starts shipping January 11.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://liquiddeath.com/">Liquid Death</a>, a water brand that began life in 2018 with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYkKBXqqunE">funny video</a> to first test the concept, has grown deadly serious about its growth prospects. The L.A.-based outfit, which sells canned mountain water from the Alps that will &#8220;murder your thirst,&#8221; has just landed $75 million in Series C funding led by the startup studio Science, which helped launch the company and now owns a &#8220;strong minority&#8221; position. (Says Science cofounder Mike Jones, &#8220;I wish we owned more.&#8221;)</p>
<p>We talked earlier today with Liquid Death&#8217;s cofounder and CEO, Mike Cessario, a West Coast agency creative-turned-entrepreneur, about the company&#8217;s growth. Seemingly, there is a lot to boast about. According to Cessario, Liquid Death is now carried in more than 29,000 locations throughout the U.S. including Whole Foods, Target, Safeway and 7-Eleven stores, and revenue reached nearly $45 million last year, up from $3 million in 2019 when the company sold its first can.</p>
<p>He thinks there is a lot of room to grow from here, including through flavored waters that Liquid Death is beginning to roll out with names that suit the brand&#8217;s punk-metal ethos. Its first three products? Berry It Alive, Severed Lime, and Mango Chainsaw.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252735" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cessario has long credited the firm&#8217;s growth with its grimly funny phrasing, along with its packaging, arguing that aluminum is more recyclable than plastic (though, of course, no single-use container is great for the environment).</p>
<p>Still, he&#8217;s particularly proud of Liquid Death&#8217;s organic growth strategy, one that has enabled the outfit to compete and even thrive in a world rife with other water brands. Indeed, asked how much Liquid Death spends on marketing compared with other beverage brands, Cessario insisted there is no comparison.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what other water brands spend, but we&#8217;re not going to have Coca-Cola or Pepsi-like budgets to spend. We don&#8217;t have $300 million to throw at something, so every piece of marketing that we make has to be interesting or entertaining so that people organically spread it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of these marketing pieces come together quickly, he said, in two weeks or less when &#8220;an idea comes out of nowhere.&#8221; Other times, a marketing piece can be a six-month-long process. Take a stunt last summer by Liquid Death and one of its handful of celebrity investors, Tony Hawk, who teamed up to sell 150 skateboard decks whose ink included <a href="https://liquiddeath.com/pages/hawkblood">some blood from Hawk</a>. The decks sold out quickly, said Cessario, but making the decks, as well as lining up a phlebotomist who could &#8220;legally draw blood and was willing to be on camera&#8221; took some time, he said with a laugh.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In an even more extreme gimmick, Cessario had the face of an avid Liquid Death customer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVBDn5HgkRK/">tattooed on his arm</a>.</p>
<p>As for how the company&#8217;s strategy changes now that it has more products to push, Cessario told us that the focus remains squarely on building a brand &#8220;that&#8217;s about making healthy beverages as fun or more fun than junk food and alcohol brands.&#8221; Because its demographic skews younger and male, and because &#8220;young kids and most men have more of a palette for sweeter things,&#8221; observes Cessario, that means new drinks, which Cessario said are sweetened by agave nectar and feature just three grams of sugar and 20 calories per drink. (&#8220;We aren&#8217;t catering to people who are obsessing over every last calorie,&#8221; he noted.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, there are evidently plenty of places in the U.S. that have yet to discover the brand. Pointing to a beverage industry metric called ACV (for all-commodity volume) that represents the total annual sales volume of retailers, Cessario said that Fiji water has 90% ACV whereas Liquid Death was approaching just 9% at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>A sweeter deal with Amazon may well boost that percentage. Specifically, said Cessario, Liquid Death recently passed an important metric that Amazon uses to decide when to start selling a product wholesale, meaning Liquid Death no longer gets charged for every case of water that it sells through Amazon but instead is selling water directly to the e-commerce giant, which then sells the water directly to its customers at a reduced price &#8212; and has sent sales soaring, said Cessario.</p>
<p>It matters, he continued.&#8221;For a lot of food and beverage brands, Amazon is often their biggest sales channel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other investors in Liquid Death&#8217;s new round include Live Nation, PowerPlant Partners, Access Capital, and Nomad Ventures.</p>
<p>Altogether, Liquid Death has now raised $125 million altogether and is valued by its backers at $525 million, it says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, in response to someone who tweeted that VCs were racist, venture capitalist and entrepreneur <a href="https://twitter.com/JTLonsdale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Lonsdale</a> attributed disparities in venture capital investing to “average black culture.”</p>
<p>“A real view: average black culture needs to step it up and stop having as many kids born out of wedlock (statistical indicator of underperformance) / who don’t value education or spend as much time on homework,” wrote Lonsdale in the now-deleted series of tweets.</p>
<p>The opining of Lonsdale, who co-founded Palantir and runs the early-stage venture firm 8VC, prompted swift criticism from a number of tech investors, many of whom called on Lonsdale’s advisors and limited partners &#8212; which include the likes of Yahoo founder Jerry Yang, Box CEO Aaron Levie and actor Leonardo DiCaprio &#8212; to speak out against the entrepreneur&#8217;s actions.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252795" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In one tweet with a screenshot of Londsale’s tweets, Bessemer partner <a href="https://twitter.com/TheValuesVC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elliott Robinson</a> wrote, “[I]t’s not VCs like [Joe Lonsdale] that hold the tech ecosystem and society back. It’s the hundreds of LPs, co-Investors, Founders, and decision makers that remain silent because: they do not care, they are scared [or] they agree. I feel bad for him/them to live like that. Its sad.”</p>
<p>Stealth-mode general partner<a href="https://twitter.com/lolitataub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Lolita Taub</a>, who formerly invested via Backstage Capital and the Community Fund, told anyone who agrees with Londsale’s “racist commentary” to unfollow her.</p>
<p>Lightship Capital GP <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianBrackeen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Brackeen</a> meanwhile said <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianBrackeen/status/1476547564073676800" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a tweet</a> that “any LP of his is complicit” and that “there is no shame in being him in SF. The culture there is to accept people like him. Diversity in tech can’t improve until we diversify the geography.”</p>
<p>Lonsdale responded to a request for further context, saying to TechCrunch via e-mail that he was “jumping on a flight” but that “somebody edited a screenshot and took a tweet totally out of context in order to cause outrage.” He further added that “the people attacking me have political motivations. You will note they are almost entirely on the far left and prefer divisive attacks vs working towards positive solutions together.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He insists that context surrounding the statements was lost from his original thread.</p>
<p>“I commented how past racism likely caused issues with some cultures today that we need to discuss and address, and given how terrible some of the things these communities experienced in the past were &#8211; red lining, Jim Crow, and so many terrible past issues &#8211; it isn&#8217;t necessarily fair to blame 100% of problems today on racism.”</p>
<p>Lonsdale also added that he has “invested millions of dollars in black founders and in relevant philanthropic causes and proudly work with a lot of advisors from these communities and we continue to do more to reach out to talent from these backgrounds and to partner. As i have stated, it&#8217;s not only dumb to discriminate, but if anything if somebody comes from a tough background and still manages to succeed &#8211; that means they are likely to be resilient, which means they are an even better founder to back. I am eager to continue to back talented black founders.”</p>
<p>When asked about the Black founders that Lonsdale has invested in, a spokesperson for Lonsdale responded saying it &#8220;doesn&#8217;t seem appropriate to list names and force [anyone] to answer questions&#8221; given how Lonsdale&#8217;s &#8220;notes were taken out of context.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lonsdale has a highly successful business track record, but a record, too, of troubled personal dealings. In addition to Palantir and 8VC, Lonsdale has co-founded a line of companies, including Addepar, OpenGov, Affinity, Epirus, Esper, Swiftscale Bio, Resilience Bio, Hearth and LIT, which recently <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiger-global-to-invest-in-joe-lonsdales-newest-fintech-venture?rc=ajsw4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a $50 million investment from Tiger Global.</a></p>
<p>He has been the main character in a number of controversies, including a breakup with <a href="https://fortune.com/2015/11/10/what-caused-formation-8-to-split-and-what-comes-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier investing partners</a> and a high-profile lawsuit filed by a former Stanford student <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/02/high-profile-lawsuit-against-vc-joe-lonsdale-now-dropped/">that was later dropped</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://twitter.com/JTLonsdale/status/1453399478254379008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1453399478254379008%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffox2now.com%2Fnews%2Fdads-who-take-6-months-of-paternity-leave-are-losers-tech-investor-says%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he called</a> “any man in an important position who takes 6 months of leave for a newborn…a loser.”</p>
<p>Lonsdale &#8212; whose venture firm has been successful in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/16/joe-lonsdale-moves-forward-with-8vcs-new-fund-and-more/">fundraising efforts</a> despite public controversy &#8212; has been attempting to clarify his earlier position since taking it last Friday. Later that same day, for example, he tweeted: “Worth clarifying: you can be against divisive and &#8216;woke&#8217; nonsense, and I am. But we should still appreciate the positive parts of our culture and wisdom of the 21st century &#8211; that it’s important to be aware of past racism, kind, inclusive, and against actual racism of all sorts.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t necessarily expect TC to give me a fair hearing &#8211; a sensational article attacking and making [people] think somebody is racist and getting angry is what you are taught to do in journalism these days &#8211; but I hope you&#8217;ll consider representing this view fairly,” Lonsdale said in an e-mailed statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>In a competitive and cash-rich fundraising market, Lonsdale’s controversial comments could attract negative attention to his venture firm and make founders less inclined to accept his money. Indeed, Block Party founder <a href="https://twitter.com/triketora">Tracy Chou</a> claimed on Twitter that even before making his latest comments, Lonsdale had spoken to her Y Combinator batch and she described his comments on stage as “terribly distasteful.”</p>
<p>“It sucks that even after everything he’s trotted out by the establishment as an exemplar and to give advice,”<a href="https://twitter.com/triketora/status/1476355529970786304" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> she tweeted.</a></p>
<p>In the meantime, Lonsdale may find it harder to partner with the venture industry’s small but growing number of Black investors. Fund manager <a href="https://twitter.com/DelJohnsonVC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Del Johnson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/spencergtyson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spencer Tyson</a>, an associate at Revere VC, are among many investors who took to Twitter to dissect Lonsdale’s comments in the aftermath, and their frustration was plain. Tyson tweeted: “What you, and many others, fail to realize is that there is a difference between &#8216;woke&#8217; culture and BLACK culture,” he said. “We’re not your rich liberal friends you argue with at dinner parties… You attacked BLACK culture.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ladies gentlemen, folks of all ages. I present to you my thesis: <a href="https://t.co/yVDFZ5B9IS">https://t.co/yVDFZ5B9IS</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>For now, Lonsdale is continuing in his efforts to recontextualize his earlier statements. “The data suggests that there are structural issues (likely caused by past racism) holding people back and causing disparity, not racism by VCs,” Lonsdale tweeted<a href="https://twitter.com/JTLonsdale/status/1476590029828857858"> in a separate response. </a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Exotel said on Tuesday it has raised $40 million in a financing round, just three months after securing $35 million in funding, as the Bangalore-based startup demonstrates growth for its full-stack customer engagement platform in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Steadview Capital led the startup’s Series D round. Exotel, which counts Blume Ventures and IIFL Asset Management among its backers, has raised about $100 million in a mix of debt and equity rounds in the last 12 months.</p>
<p><a href="https://exotel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exotel</a> offers its clients a full-stack platform with offerings such as contact center, APIs, voice and chat bots, to engage with their customers through touch points such as web chat, co-browsing and videos.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252802" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Indian ride-hailing giant Ola uses Exotel’s platform to send text messages to its customers. Food delivery giant Swiggy relies on the startup to mask the phone numbers when the delivery partner makes a call to the customer. Relationship managers at HDFC Bank, a large bank in India, use Exotel to engage with customers with a savings account.</p>
<p>This engagement “involves bringing together disconnected channels, bots, applications with siloed customer data across teams,” said Shivakumar Ganesan, co-founder and chief executive of Exotel. “For the first time we are enabling this over the cloud with our full-stack platform.”</p>
<p>The startup operates in a space that has attracted the attention of several major giants, such as Microsoft, Amazon, Twilio, Salesforce and Zoom in recent years as organizations scramble to build or acquire tools to create one-store service centers.</p>
<p>But Exotel has two clear differentiating factors in the otherwise crowded field, said Ganesan in an interview with TechCrunch. The startup focuses on serving customers in emerging markets and, unlike many of its global competitors, it offers a wide range of services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Practically everyone in India is our customer,” he said. The startup, which has also expanded to Southeast Asia and the Middle East in recent years, has amassed over 4,000 customers, some of which it gained after its recent acquisitions of cloud center platform Ameyo and conversational AI startup Cogno AI. Bajaj Allianz, City Mall, KrazyBee, Shadowfax and TCS started to use Exotel&#8217;s platform in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Ganesan attributed some of its recent growth to the pandemic, which he said has made communication technology a “source of life” for several enterprises and businesses in banking, fintech and auto industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The importance of having effective communication strategy is increasing over time and Exotel executed this successfully by powering communication to almost all internet unicorns in India,&#8221; said Puneet Kumar, managing director at Steadview Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We like their vision of building an end-to-end communication stack to enable enterprises to engage intelligently with customers and are thrilled to be part of their next growth phase.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup, which employs more than 1,000 employees, today generates an annualized recurring revenue of $50 million. It aims to grow this figure to $200 million as it broadens its offerings and wins more customers. It&#8217;s also looking to hire about 200 people by the end of the year.</p>
<hr />
<p>Karthik Reddy of Blume <a href="https://blume.vc/exotel-the-bootstrap-champ-10yearsofblume/">shared the story</a> of how his firm chased to invest in Exotel, which he described as &#8220;one of the buzziest&#8221; deals it had won at the time. The blog post from last year also recounts the struggle the super hot startup faced in its lukewarm years.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was a lot of visibility for the company in digital and traditional media as it kept building beyond the odds. Then there was some regulatory scare. Good press can alert various competitors – from large telcos to larger funded companies. Others in the sector too got similar scares. The company had to double down on ensuring that they were well above board and procured whatever licenses it needed. The bank balance dipped to 14 lacs at a point in 2014-15.</p>
<p>Investors would show excitement and then shirk away. Over 6 years, between 2012 and 2018, we lost count of near miss term sheets, half-hearted term sheets (e.g.”we will invest $3 mill contingent on another $3 mill being committed by a co-lead”), merger and acquisition offers from everyone, Indian competitors to Asian telcos to American giants.</p>
<p>Clearly, the segment was considered interesting enough that we needed to see a desi Twilio emerge.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Your bathroom scales have been capable of telling you more than your weight for a while, and <a href="https://www.withings.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Withings</a> is one of the companies leading the charge on that front (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/30/your-weight-for-a-wi-fi-scale-is-over-get-it/">since 2009</a>). Today, the company announced its Withings Body Scan, which continues the company&#8217;s bid for being your measure-all-the-things-about-yourself brand of choice. In addition to weight, the $299 slate of glass promises to measure an ECG, segmental body composition, and keep an eye on your nerve activity.</p>
<p>Because the scale is promising at-home ECG, the device has to go through a more rigorous FDA approval process. The same process caused a lengthy delay in the company&#8217;s ScanWatch &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/withings-scanwatch-review/">which offers an on-wrist ECG feature</a> &#8212; making it to U.S. shores, compared to its European launch.</p>
<p>The new Body Scan adds a few funky new features to the otherwise familiar-looking scale from Withings. The product, which contains four weight sensors, promises body weight accuracy to within 50 grams (or, for a 200-pound person, accuracy to an impressive 0.025%). The device also has 14 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_tin_oxide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITO electrodes</a> within the platform and four stainless steel electrodes in a retractable handle. Together, those sensors gather data for the six-lead ECG and segmental body composition analysis.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251569" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Body Scan promises daily analysis of data associated with health conditions, including heart rate, &#8220;vascular age,&#8221; and the aforementioned ECG measurement. The flurry of electrodes means that Body Scan can pull off some fun party tricks, including using multi-frequency Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis to measure overall body composition. Beyond the standard body fat percentage you may have seen on its old scale, the Body Scan can also measure water percentage, visceral fat, muscle and bone mass. It further promises to be able to offer more granular readings for individual body parts, including torso, arms and legs.</p>
<p>Seen in the context of the company&#8217;s other product offerings, including under-mattress sleep trackers, smart blood pressure cuffs, body temperature sensors and its growing line of smart health fitness sensors, the Body Scan is an obvious brand extension.</p>
<p>On top of the hardware products, Withings is extending its in-app health coaching. The company enables its users to access coaching, clinical specialists and personalized nutrition, and exercise plans help them reach their health goals. The app also lets users export a health snapshot with historical data, which will be particularly useful for people who like to take a more active role in their health alongside their nutritionists, trainers and health professionals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elizabeth Holmes has been found guilty of defrauding investors as founder and CEO of Theranos. After four months of court proceedings and seven days of deliberations, the jury has reached a verdict that will have lasting implications in Silicon Valley and beyond.</p>
<p>The former <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2015/05/27/forbes-announces-inaugural-list-of-americas-50-richest-self-made-women/?sh=4ab0aca824c1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youngest and wealthiest</a> female self-made billionaire was tried for two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. Holmes was found guilty of conspiring to defraud investors, as well as defrauding investors from the DeVos family, hedge fund manager Brian Grossman and former estate and trust attorney Dan Mosely. She was not found guilty of charges related to defrauding patients.</p>
<p>The jury did not reach a verdict on three wire fraud counts involving Black Diamond executive Chris Lucas, Hall Group executive Bryan Tolbert and money manager Alan Eisenman, who all testified in the trial. Judge Edward Davila found a <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1478168539618070529" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mistrial</a> on these three counts. Prosecutor Jeffrey Schenk said he will confer with the Department of Justice, then tell the court next week how the government wishes to proceed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250549" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 after dropping out of Stanford. She pitched investors and partners on technology that would revolutionize the healthcare system &#8212; instead of drawing blood intravenously and waiting days for test results, her technology would prick a tiny bit of blood and instantly conduct dozens of tests on it. Soon she was the CEO of a company with a $10 billion valuation, but there was one problem: the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-lab-chief-says-he-found-blood-testing-technology-didnt-work-11613602822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technology didn&#8217;t work</a>.</p>
<p>Theranos has been defunct since 2018, but Holmes&#8217; criminal trial only began this fall after delays due to the pandemic and the birth of Holmes&#8217; child. Over 11 weeks, the prosecution constructed the case that Holmes knowingly defrauded investors, questioning witnesses like former U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis, whistleblower Erika Cheung, Theranos patients, investors, medical professionals and journalists.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Even though Theranos&#8217; technology didn&#8217;t actually accomplish what the company claimed it did, Holmes said that she thought she was telling the truth &#8212; she even alleged that the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/11/23/technology/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos?name=styln-elizabeth-holmes-trial&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=LegacyCollection&amp;variant=show&amp;is_new=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slideshows</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> she presented to investors were made by scientists and engineers. But the prosecution managed on some counts to convince the jury that Holmes knowingly misled investors and partners &#8212; one piece of evidence showed that Theranos used Pfizer&#8217;s logo in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/technology/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos-takeaways.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unauthorized manner</a> while negotiating a partnership with Walgreens. A former senior product manager at Theranos, Daniel Edlin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/technology/elizabeth-holmes-trial-takeaways.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified</a> that Theranos sometimes faked demonstrations of their technology in front of investors. When billionaire investor Rupert Murdoch had his blood tested, Theranos removed abnormal results before sending out the reports, Edlin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In a big twist for the high-profile trial, Holmes </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-testifies-in-her-own-criminal-trial/">took the stand herself</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to argue that her failure as a startup founder doesn&#8217;t mean she committed fraud. In a key moment, </span>Holmes alleged that Theranos COO Ramesh &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Balwani abused her.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Balwani, who faces a separate trial next year, was Holmes&#8217; boyfriend in secret. They met when Holmes was 18 and Balwani was 37 &#8212; she moved in with him the year after she dropped out of Stanford. She also said during the trial that she was raped as a Stanford student, which is part of why she didn&#8217;t finish her degree. She &#8220;decided [she] was going to build a life by building this company.&#8221; She detailed Balwani&#8217;s controlling behavior, including a written document that dictated her daily schedule, including what she ate, when she slept and how she dressed. She said, &#8220;He was so disappointed in my mediocrity and he was trying to teach me how to be better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jury deliberated for seven days, even <a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1473433208574263297" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asking</a> if they were allowed to take jury instructions home to review. They also asked to re-listen to some audio clips of Holmes&#8217; calls with investors, which had been presented as evidence, yet deliberations continued into the new year.</p>
<p>On the seventh day of deliberations<strong>,</strong> the jury submitted its third note to the judge, saying that it could not reach an unanimous verdict on three of the 11 counts. The prosecution suggested that Judge Davila read the jury an instructional document on what to do in the case of a deadlocked jury. Holmes&#8217; defense disagreed, saying that these <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1478078212139798537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions</a> could be seen as coercive, but the judge proceeded to deliver the instructions. He also <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1478081965697994762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminded</a> the jury that Holmes would be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Four hours later, the jury submitted another note stating that its members could still not reach an unanimous verdict on three charges. Shortly after, they presented their verdict on the eight other counts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unexpected for the deliberations in a prominent white-collar trial to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-28/in-many-blockbuster-white-collar-trials-jurors-took-their-time?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take this long</a>. The jury deliberated for five days before arriving at a verdict in Ghislaine Maxwell&#8217;s recent four-week trial; she was found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/30/ghislaine-maxwell-what-happens-next-charges-sentencing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guilty</a> of five of six charges. In 2007, former press tycoon Conrad Black was of fraud convicted after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/14/business/13cnd-black.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 days</a> of jury deliberations in a 14-week trial.</p>
<p>The trial&#8217;s verdict sends a message to tech founders that it&#8217;s not okay to lie about your technology &#8212; especially not when it affects the health of real people. But it sends a mixed message that she was found not guilty of the counts related to defrauding patients. Beyond that, the case showed how important due diligence is for investors and partners collaborating with startups. Notably, Theranos&#8217; investors weren&#8217;t the usual-suspect venture capital firms. Rather, her funding came from individuals like former Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and the Walton family, among other wealthy elites. Some evidence showed that these investors were willing to give Theranos money even when Holmes evaded their more probing questions.</p>
<p>But the investors&#8217; misplaced belief in Holmes wasn&#8217;t the only thing propelling the faulty Theranos tech forward. Theranos and other diagnostics companies have exploited <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/theranos-faulty-blood-tests-got-122724789.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory loopholes</a> that allow devices that are not yet FDA approved to reach the market.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1478172574420975624">not yet</a> a date set for Holmes&#8217; sentencing hearing. The prosecution <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1478169425383669760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will not</a> ask Holmes to be detained today, but <a href="https://twitter.com/doratki/status/1478171908596281347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the government wants either cash or property to secure her bond.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Theranos isn&#8217;t quite a thing of the past yet. Balwani awaits his own criminal fraud trial next year. </span></p>
