										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roblox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roblox">Roblox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is now one of the world&#8217;s most valuable private companies in the world after a monster Series H raise brings the social gaming platform a stratospheric $29.5 billion valuation. The company won&#8217;t be private for long, though.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/01/roblox-raises-520m-led-altimeter-capital-dragoneer-investment-group/">$520 million raise</a> led by Altimeter Capital and Dragoneer Investment Group is a significant cash influx for Roblox, which had previously raised just over $335 million from investors according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/roblox/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>. The Investment Group of Santa Barbara, Warner Music Group, and a number of current investors, also participated in this round.</p>
<p>In February of 2020, the company closed a $150 million Series G led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which valued the company at $4 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The gaming startup has initially planned an IPO in 2020, but after the major first day pops of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Airbnb, the company leadership reconsidered their timeline, according to a report in <a href="https://www.axios.com/roblox-ipo-affirm-delay-032685fe-3816-46fb-a50d-85979edf317c.html">Axios</a>. Those major say-one share price pops left significant money on the table for the companies selling those shares, an outcome Roblox is likely looking to avoid. Today, the company also <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/01/roblox-announces-anticipated-direct-listing/">announced</a> that it plans to enter the public markets via a direct listing.</p>
<p>Roblox&#8217;s 7x valuation multiple signals just how feverish public and private markets are for tech stocks. The valuation also highlights how investors foresee the company benefiting from pandemic trends which pushed more users online and towards social gaming platforms. In a 2019 prospectus, the company shared that it had 17.6 million users, now Roblox claims to have 31 million daily active users on its platform.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Lisbon — and Portugal generally — is becoming a magnet for digital nomads with talent.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost four years ago I wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/14/in-2016-lisbon-fired-up-its-startup-engines-2017-will-hear-them-roar/">a long deep dive</a> into Lisbon’s tech scene. So it’s great to check back in with both Lisbon and Portugal for a slightly briefer update on where it’s at.</p>
<p><a href="https://startupuniversal.com/country/portugal/">As well-outlined</a> by Stephan Morais, founder and managing general partner at Indico Capital Partners, Portugal has a very high quality of engineering talent at a competitive cost; an extremely high level of English language proficiency (compared to Spain, France, Italy); and a preference for launching product globally from day one. Portuguese founders are highly qualified, with the majority of them holding at least a master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p>However, the ecosystem is still in an &#8220;early phase&#8221; and there are few founders turned angel investors; there have been limited exits until recently; and there is limited available talent in sales and marketing fields. That said, there is still <em>plenty</em> of growth to come, as you will see below, and in the COVID-19 era, Lisbon — and Portugal generally — is becoming a magnet for digital nomads with talent.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Given the lack of a large home consumer market, startups in Portugal tend to err toward enterprise and SaaS over consumer applications, according to the Startup Portugal Ecosystem <a href="https://www.scaleupportugal.tech/ecosystem-reports">report</a>. While the gap between domestic and foreign sources of funding is closing, there is still a gap in early-stage financing. According to government figures, in 2019 there was €285 million available for investment, and the top 25 later-stage companies raised a total of €117.8 million.</p>
<p>VCs in the country include Portugal Ventures, Indico Capital, Faber Ventures, Armilar Venture Partners, Bynd Capital, Semapa Next, Bright Pixel, EDP Ventures and Shilling Capital Partners. While Mustard Seed is a VC, it’s fashioned as an impact fund, only investing in startups that use technology to address social and environmental challenges inside the country.</p>
<p>Portugal is undergoing some changes. In particular, many British refugees from Brexit are relocating there (and everywhere else in Europe, but Lisbon has beaches and startup-friendly taxes). Non-EU residents are able to get a<a href="https://www.goldenvisas.com/portugal"> golden visa</a> and <a href="https://startupportugal.com/startup-visa/">tech entrepreneurs can get a startup visa</a>. Meanwhile, Portuguese startups are starting to raise money internationally, so, therefore, punching out of their Portugal-shaped box.</p>
<p>Domestic VC capacity went through a period of great scarcity 2016-18, but this has greatly improved in the 2019-20 period. And international VCs, including nearby Spanish ones (K Fund, Kibo, Conexo Ventures, etc.), are taking an interest in the ecosystem, as explained by one <a href="https://medium.com/samaipata-ventures/why-we-believe-in-the-portuguese-ecosystem-cef95b535346">here</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the recent successes of Farfetch, Talkdesk, Outsystems, Feedzai and DefinedCrowd, among others, international investors are becoming interested in Portugal. According to investor <a href="https://www.pedroalmeidabusinessangel.com/list-of-international-venture-capital-firms-interested-in-portugal-startups/">Pedro Almeida</a> in 2020, less than 40% of overall venture rounds had the participation of an international investor, but international investors account for over 30% of seed and pre-seed rounds.</p>
<p>This indicates that international investors will increasingly participate higher up the funding stack as the startups grow. Corporate VC has also become more active and professional during the period.</p>
<p>Key Government initiatives to stimulate the ecosystem include <a href="https://startupportugal.com/">Startup Portugal</a> and <a href="https://www.200m.pt/pt-pt/">200M, a 50:50 matched-funding initiative</a> with a call option within 3-4 years at a low price point (3%-4% IRR); and the <a href="https://www.fis.gov.pt/en/">FIS</a> social innovation fund with a 70:30 match funding initiative and a call option within 3-4 years also at a low price point.</p>
<p>Plus, &#8220;Portugal Tech&#8221; is the first-ever proper fund-of-funds initiative, market rules, owned by IFD (the development bank) but professionally managed by the European Investment Fund.</p>
<p>Unicorns emerging from the Portugal ecosystem include OutSystems; Talkdesk (which relocated its HQ to SF); and while Farfetch can claim Portuguese heritage via its founders, it’s better known as a London startup. On their way to bigger things are startups to watch like Feedzai, Codacy, BIZAY, Aptoide, Unbabel and Uniplaces.</p>
<p>Among the up-and-coming &#8220;new kids on the block&#8221; there are Rows, Didimo, Tonic App, SWORD Health, Barkyn, Utrust, Sensei, Vawlt, Lovys, StudentFinance, Nutrium, Reatia, LegalVision, Kitch, Rnters, kencko and YData.</p>
<p>Key accelerators/incubators include Beta-i, Bright Pixel, BGI (Building Global Innovators), Tec Labs, Startup Lisboa, Fábrica de Startups, Techstars Lisbon (run for two years, but now on a pause), Demium, EDP Starter, Maze X, Blue Bio Value and the Indico Pre-Seed Program.</p>
<p>Co-working spaces (Lisbon only) include LACS, Fintech House, Cowork Central, Second Home, Startup Lisboa, SITIO, Impact Hub and NOW_Beato. Then there is the giant &#8220;campus&#8221; style <a href="http://factory.co/locations/factorylisbon/">Factor Lisbon</a>, which has happily rejiggered its plans ahead of launch to make the spaces COVID-safe.</p>
<p>Lisbon — and Portugal more generally — is emerging on the European and global stage as an increasingly fast-moving ecosystem that will benefit from its continued EU membership, international outlook, welcoming culture and can-do work ethic.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Cristina Fonseca, partner, Indico Capital Partners</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Digitalization of supply chains and AI-powered decision-making processes.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Digitizing beehives — honey production and pollination industry.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
IoT and AI will finally come to be with 5G; time to invest is now.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We are going deeper in founder personality analysis pre-investment.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Digital health, fintech in general, e-commerce.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Portugal mostly, Spain a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
B2B SaaS and marketplaces (sometimes a combination that creates the moat). Watch out for Barkyn, Nutrium, Unbabel, Zenklub, kencko, Consentio.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Business as usual, great engineering, global ambition.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
For sure, already a reality in Portugal and Spain for some years and more to come.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
On the plus side more consumers moving to online for all needs. On the negative side startups that have SMEs as customers will continue to be impacted as will travel, proptech and fintech (because of bank reactions).</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Cash is king, make sure you don´t run out of money and prioritize that — cost reduction, fundraising and focus on positive margins, road to zero burn.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Absolutely — consumer move to online shopping and interactions has benefited almost half of our portfolio directly.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The end of home schooling.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
We might be back to a 2008 situation or worse, but we are better prepared this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pedro Ribeiro Santos, partner,  Armilar Venture Partners</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Having always invested in deep tech, we&#8217;ve been advocates of the low-code/no-code movement for more than a decade (e.g., through our early investment in OutSystems), and it&#8217;s really exciting to see all that not just becoming a reality but also expanding even further toward the &#8220;citizen developer,&#8221; with products such as dashdash, Airtable, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Our latest investment was in Didimo, a young company with very exciting tech to automate the creation of high-fidelity and fully animatable human avatars in just seconds and from just a photo taken with any handheld device. Traditional processes use a sequence of piecemeal technology, several hours of computer graphics artists and computational processing. Enormous range of applications, the most immediate in gaming/entertainment and retail.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Teleportation :)<br />
More seriously, while many T&amp;H startups are enduring the impacts of COVID, the dramatic and long-enduring effect that it will have in change of habits (e.g., in business traveling) will likely open a world of new opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
I&#8217;ll go with the general: Tech with strong defensibility (IP) with wide market applicability.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong></p>
<p>While there are obviously several marketplaces that I wish we had invested in, I&#8217;m generally wary of that type of investment at the early stage, due to the low barriers to entry/no tech defensibility. (Of course, at the later stage, scale itself and the network effects become evident and extraordinary barriers to entry.)</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong></p>
<p>While we&#8217;ve been investing globally since the beginning (20 years ago), we&#8217;ve been investing closer to home as the regional-to-local (European, Southern European, Portuguese) ecosystems really started to develop. Our current flagship fund V has a defined allocation to Portugal (not just Lisbon) of more than 50%, and we currently have a smaller fund 100% dedicated to Portugal.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
I&#8217;m biased, but I am a strong believer that Portugal is particularly well-poised to thrive in companies that are capital-light and engineering-heavy, that rely more on their proprietary tech (rather than deep pockets) to scale fast: deep tech B2B software companies. Software engineering/developer tools/DevOps/low-code tools/SW-based infrastructure spring to mind, as well as strongly grounded AI products. As Portugal still needs to fully close the loop of startup -&gt; success -&gt; exit -&gt; liquidity -&gt; reinvestment, I&#8217;m most excited about the companies that appear to be closer to that feat: OutSystems (our portfolio), Feedzai (our portfolio), Talkdesk (not our portfolio). I&#8217;m also really excited about companies less mature than those but with a very high potential, such as DefinedCrowd (not our portfolio), SWORD Health (not our portfolio), Codacy (our portfolio), dashdash (our portfolio), Didimo (our portfolio), among others that I&#8217;m surely and unfairly leaving out.<br />
<strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Portugal is characterized by:<br />
• Enormous talent (particularly technical) at a relatively low cost (versus most of Europe).<br />
• A place where people want to live (security, climate, friendliness, infrastructure, languages … the list could go on).<br />
• Where capital has historically been scarce (it has recently developed significantly, but it remains relatively scarce by any European measure), but with very meaningful local experience.<br />
• Companies born with a global mindset (Portugal is, at best, a good pilot market) and a capital efficiency mindset (do a lot with a little).<br />
• Resulting in a ratio of good companies (measured, e.g., in the number or value of unicorns, or any other measure) per (capita, GDP, local capital or other metric of choice) far above most European countries (OK, maybe not Romania).<br />
The scarcity of capital has been opening up a lot of opportunities for international investors, attracted by all of the above.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Not necessarily. Many founders come from outside Lisbon or Porto already, with the cities serving as a central focus point.<br />
<strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong></p>
<p>After the first 4-6 weeks of uncertainty, no change in the investment strategy. Biggest concerns of founders revolve around delays in buying decisions from their customers/frozen budgets. Hang tight!</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes. In many cases (except for the most critically hit arenas such as travel and hospitality), there are signs of business going back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Many businesses that had dramatically cut their plans for 2020 are now realizing that it won&#8217;t be as bad as they had initially thought.</p>
<h2>Tocha, partner, Olisipo Way</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Looking for companies aiming at profitability that can become startups or businesses.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Reatia.com and HunterBoards.com.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Small niches that traditionally are not big enough markets for VCs.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Passionate founders that want to create businesses where they want to work for the rest of their life.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Marketplaces, crypto.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
100% local Portuguese only.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Tourism, relocation.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Great founders, great and affordable teams. Companies focused since day one in international markets.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Tourism, restaurants and retail.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes. All related to home delivery or remote work.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
General understanding that the pandemic is here to stay for the next 2-5 years. And it&#8217;s not a short-term issue.</p>

It would be great to have a startup that would allow us all to keep eye contact during a video call by using software, but perhaps that&#8217;s more like a DIY project :)</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
In general? A good return on investment :) Just being funny, but serious though. As a seed/early-stage investor we naturally thrive for having a successful exit, but we do have a big focus on assisting the startups in all their initial challenges and also in securing new rounds of funding for further growing and expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
At this point all areas that have a tiny and small opportunity window — even if the market is big — will be having difficulties in getting funding, more than in the past. Startups that are only &#8220;marginally&#8221; improving current processes, meaning that if they are not brand new nor bringing breakthrough disruptive innovation their probability of succeeding will be too small.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Portugal Ventures is focused on Portugal only.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Companies excited about in the portfolio:<br />
Barkyn (founder: André Jordão), which closed a €5 million round during the pandemic and that is already present in two international markets (Italy and Spain) besides Portugal.<br />
DefinedCrowd (founder: Daniela Braga), another company that has secured a round of fundraising in the amount of $50,5M during the pandemic.<br />
Curiously, both founders have won the first two editions João Vasconcelos&#8217; award for entrepreneur of the year, Daniela in 2019 and André in 2020. That&#8217;s two in a row for Portugal Ventures :)</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
IMO, and on general terms, the main drivers for other investors to look into Lisbon but also to Portugal are the following ones:</p>
<p>DEVELOPED LOCAL MARKET</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Allows for business model validation at a reduced cost.</span></li>
<li>Important entrepreneurial hubs (Lisbon, Porto, Braga and Coimbra).</li>
</ul>
<p>AVAILABILITY OF LOW-COST TALENT AND ALSO CHEAP LIVING COSTS</p>
<ul>
<li>High-capital efficiency but with needs of international talent, for instance in the sales and marketing fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>RELATIVELY LOW VALUATIONS</p>
<ul>
<li>Maturing ecosystem.</li>
<li>Buyers’ market, meaning supply exceeds demand, giving purchasers an advantage over sellers in negotiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>PUBLIC INCENTIVES ON INNOVATION</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage the equity investment with long-term nondilutive state and regional grants, R&amp;D tax breaks or even a matching fund like 200M.</li>
</ul>
<p>MORE STARTUPS GROWING FASTER AND ACHIEVING HIGHER MULTIPLES</p>
<ul>
<li>It contributes to the creation of a real ecosystem, where network effects start to be more tangible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
In the case of Portugal and the Lisbon hub I think it works quite on reverse. What I mean is that I envision Lisbon (and Portugal) receiving digital nomads essentially for some of the reasons I mentioned above, and the weather, never forget the weather :) Besides the quality life the country has to offer, other things will be contributing, IMO, for this inflow.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
On the downside, tourism-related ventures look definitely weaker under the current pandemic situation, which is easily understandable considering all the current restrictions. On the upper side, e-commerce as well as on-demand services have been experiencing a particularly good moment. In short, all businesses that can ride the trend of allowing a transition from the offline to the online world, preferably in untapped markets can benefit from a big window of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
The investment strategy hasn&#8217;t changed as we are still looking for the best opportunities and the most promising ventures. What indeed happened during Q1 and Q2 2020 was that we needed to go through all our portfolio companies and assess their exposure to the pandemic situation — it&#8217;s like protecting the family first — then make decisions on further financing to sustain operations under the uncertain times of the pandemic. This put on hold the new opportunities we were looking into. But from Q3 2020 onward we got back on track with our deal sourcing as well as investing in new startups. The biggest worries of the founders of the portfolio was the impact of COVID on business activities in general and also to try to guarantee the biggest runway possible considering the uncertainty of the times ahead.<br />
<strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
As mentioned some of them take benefit from the pandemic situation, others don&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
During the pandemic I closed my first fully remote deal (Barkyn) — I still haven&#8217;t met the CEO (André Jordão) in person nor even anyone from the team actually (looking forward to that!). Also participated in the TNW 2020 Conference (fully remote) as a speaker on the topic of scaling up and expanding in the Iberian Peninsula. Both &#8220;moments&#8221; made me think how the things are indeed transforming and perhaps how this way of living, making business and sharing knowledge can speed up things rather than slowing them down and also how efficient they can be, at least IMO.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong></p>
<p>Portugal, the next 10 years, a VC perspective: I saw the evolution from the last 10 years, and I do think that if we are able to keep the current trajectory in Portugal we will continue to stand out and impress. I think it is a mix of being ambitious but also credible and the most recent wave of entrepreneurs and founders I have been talking with seem to be better prepared than their predecessors. The other thing I do expect is that we are able to create a real ecosystem in Portugal, true ecosystems are good if network effects could be activated and also deliver positive outcomes for everyone involved, and I think we have a journey ahead of us. Last but not least, I hope that successful entrepreneurs in 5-10 years time can be able to give back to the community and share their knowledge with new startups in that time. They can do this through becoming investors themselves, that is something we see in other more mature countries happening, or simply by acting as facilitators in any type of challenges that startups will face.</p>
<h2>Alexandre Barbosa, partner, Faber</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Faber invests in teams transforming the world with emerging technologies and we believe data-centric startups are accelerating digital transformation and driving innovation in several industries.</p>
<p>We are excited about the technologies enabling resilience, intelligence, agility or automation in the enterprise world, including next-gen solutions around AI Engineering (e.g., DataOps, MLOps), NLP, explainable AI, data management, data privacy and cybersecurity. Additionally, we also see value in using proprietary data and innovative human-machine interfaces (e.g., neurotechnologies) to enable precision and/or personalization in several industries (e.g., digital health).</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Over the last few months we have completed four new investments out of our new AI/data-focused fund: SWORD Health, who are building the future of digital physical therapy, and three other investments (to be announced soon) around DataOps/synthetic data, neurotechnologies and explainable AI.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
A growing percentage of enterprise IT budgets is being allocated to accelerating digital transition by working with data-centric startups, so there’s still significant opportunity for next-generation startups to challenge and transform the tech stack in multiple industries. Our belief is that entrepreneurship is also a core engine for a sustainable future through a combination of new business models, technology innovation and positive impact. As we are seeing in digital health, we expect to see a growing number of startups on a mission to tackle pressing societal challenges, such as climate change, through innovative applications of AI/ML/robotics to Earth science or natural resource management.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We are typically the first local investor in early-stage (pre-seed/seed) B2B data-driven startups primarily starting from Southern Europe to scale globally.<br />
We look for highly specialized tech teams on a mission to transform an industry, who aim to build a diverse, balanced and inclusive culture with an open mindset, endless curiosity and relentless ambition to capture a large opportunity and conquer the world.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Within our B2B focus, startups launching undifferentiated SaaS products or with too much exposure to stressed industries should rethink their priorities.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Our stage/tech specialty focus and value-add approach fill a gap in Iberia and we believe that we are now well-positioned to be investors in the next vintage of data-driven successes from Southern Europe (that typically scale up to the U.S.). In this context, we are planning to invest most of our capital in companies starting from Iberia to become a world-class benchmark, and selectively co-invest in promising teams across Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
We believe that some of the most valuable and innovative startups emerging from Southern Europe are working in the &#8220;intelligent enterprise” space and/or driving digital innovation in financial services, cybersecurity, healthcare, manufacturing, agro-food and retail industries.<br />
We have been first local investors in companies like Unbabel, Codacy, Seedrs and EnjoyHQ, who have started their companies from Portugal and rapidly scaled up to become distributed and acknowledged innovators in their industries/market spaces (just like Feedzai, who started before Faber existed). We are obviously excited about their success and how strongly they reflect our thesis.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Iberia has a solid track record of being a launch pad for a significant number of successful startups over the last 10 years. The region continues to be a magnet for talent from across Europe to blend with local talent and start a new venture, leveraging the growing maturity and specialization of the local ecosystem and its resources with a clear mindset from founders to start locally and scale up to the U.S.<br />
Both Portugal and Spain have experienced pre-Series A investors who have historically co-invested with international VCs, a growing layer of later stage/growth capital (both local and international) and now more institutional LPs are following to get exposure to the asset class.<br />
We strongly believe that Southern Europe will continue to produce a substantial number of innovative companies that will challenge and lead their industries at global scale, proving that the region is becoming the next emerging opportunity for venture in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
The ecosystem has been rapidly adapting and we expect to see a growing number of new companies starting with distributed teams, ready to work around market restrictions and more resilient in general.<br />
This will hopefully lower the barriers for founders from outside major cities, but we also believe that the major hubs in the region will continue to offer a powerful combination of resources to power new companies. So we don’t see remote work and new work dynamics as detrimental to major cities, but as a facilitation of access to capital or talent and an amplification of the deal flow in the region.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Although some industries are more exposed to the consequences of this pandemic (e.g., travel and hospitality), our investment strategy focuses on data-centric startups applying AI/ML/data science to enterprise digital transformation.<br />
The immediate implications of C19 for business continuity, agility and performance open a realm of enterprise-grade opportunities for B2B data-driven startups that can help corporations adapt or drive innovation in their industries by leading “the new normal.”</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Our investment strategy hasn’t changed, if anything these times have validated our thesis and our focus on teams and companies challenging their industries with innovative solutions across the data stack that can help accelerate enterprise digital transformation.<br />
The immediate priority of our portfolio was to work with us and our co-investors in ensuring solid runways, quickly adjusting go-to-market strategies to focus on less-exposed industries or longer sales cycles and, in general, review priorities and plan/prepare for uncertain times ahead. Fortunately the overall balance is currently positive, with the vast majority of our portfolio growing this year.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, so far the overall portfolio has been adapting and overcoming this challenge with a better performance than initially expected (in several cases with significant YoY growth), demonstrating that B2B/cloud/data-centric startups are more resilient and necessary.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
As in previous downturns, it is always invigorating and encouraging to see the audacity and the resolve of a new generation of entrepreneurs turning difficulty into opportunity and launching their ventures to challenge the status quo and build a better future.<br />
Over the last months and despite these current times, we have been fortunate to witness this kind of long-term sight across a growing number of mission-driven founders and investors, alongside a vibrant momentum at technical universities and research institutions.<br />
Together with the collective behavior and determination to adapt to and overcome this pandemic, we believe the entrepreneurial signs are strong enough to offer hope for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Stay tuned for the next generation of startups arising from Southern Europe, the ecosystem is maturing fast and there’s a large number of new teams working around innovative applications of AI/engineering/deep tech in the region.</p>
<h2>António Miguel, partner, Mustard Seed MAZE</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Sharing economy (more linked to circularity, like rental solutions); elderly care; skills development (requalification at scale post-COVID); female tech.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Investment in a femtech business that is offering people who bleed with superior menstruation products and using a tech-enabled platform to be a full-spectrum companion across all period cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Elderly care is ripe for disruption despite being talked about for some years; I wish I would see more on specific female health topics (e.g., menopause); overlooked opportunities include areas like environmental footprint of e-commerce and online to offline solutions given that people are now craving more than ever for meaningful connections.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
A strong impact thesis through a lockstep model where the creation of social/environmental impact is the driver of top line.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Sustainable consumption apps and carbon footprint personal tracking; urban mobility.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
50% in local ecosystem; 50% all Europe (EU and non-EU).</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Well-positioned to thrive: Blue economy ventures; elderly care ventures; food tech.<br />
Not well-positioned to thrive: Consumer businesses.<br />
Companies I&#8217;m excited about: Hopin; StudentFinance.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Portugal is a great place to find price-competitive talent and an excellent location to be a first second-market for European businesses given its size, small distance between product and market (and therefore faster feedback loops) and sophistication of users.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Definitely. Take Lisbon as an example: Every week I learn about a founder or investor moving to Lisbon as a way to move out of U.K./Germany/France/U.S. as a result of the pandemic. The local ecosystem has never been so cosmopolitan and diverse.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Impact in our strategy: de minimis. Our strategy is focused on the belief that the most successful businesses are those that profit whilst solving social and environmental issues. COVID has only corroborated the need for such businesses. If anything, we have just invested more earlier tickets given the nature of fundraising in Q2 and Q3 of 2020.<br />
Worries of founders: fundraising amidst uncertain times; how much of current traction is an indication of future traction versus a time-constrained trend (e.g., D2C revival as a distribution channel).<br />
Advice: execution first and foremost; double down on stakeholder management, especially with super clients, partners and investors.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, especially because our portfolio is exclusively based on companies that generate revenues by solving social and/or environmental challenges. As a result, during and post-pandemic, demand for their solutions has increased.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Hearing Michael Seibel <a href="https://investorfieldguide.com/michael-seibel-lessons-from-thousands-of-startups-invest-like-the-best-ep-190/">saying</a> that social impact is the biggest trend he has seen in the last YC batch.</p>

<h2>Jaime Parodi Bardón, partner, impACT NOW Capital</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Our focus is impact investing and social innovation. Startups tackling the challenges that are at the heart of the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
We are currently structuring our first VC fund, which hopefully will be up and running in the beginning of 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
We expect to see an imminent development at the intersection between business, impact and technology … potentially through an emerging vertical: impact tech. It is still an immature field but it is rapidly gaining awareness and traction from entrepreneurs and investors.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We are looking for startups developing technology as a way to solve problems at the core of the UN SDGs agenda and/or using it as a channel to scale their solutions faster. These startups must create societal or environmental impact while producing financial performance. Personally, I want to see AI and blockchain as a force for good.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
In the impact landscape there is still plenty of room to grow. There are many local initiatives that are not sustainable nor scalable. It is needed to professionalize the commercialization of these initiatives (through products and services) to make them sustainable (and profitable), and incorporate technology in order to make them scalable.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Our plan is to invest 50% in Iberia (it includes Portugal, our local ecosystem, and Spain) and 50% between Europe and CPLP (Community of Portuguese Language Countries).</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
The Portuguese government, through the Social Innovation Fund (SIF), is supporting social innovation and stimulating the impact economy. We are observing a significant development in areas such as healthcare and well-being (SDG #3), education (SDG #4), clean energy (SDG #7), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG #11). We have also seen great initiatives working in other fields such as responsible consumption and production, climate action and inequalities reduction. However, it is still not enough to meet the societal and environmental demands. We need to feel the sense of urgency and understand the dramatic consequences of not tackling these challenges on time.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Lisbon is a vibrating startup ecosystem. Investors from other countries are conscious of that and keep a good relation with the city and its ecosystem. Lisbon holds relevant entrepreneurial and investment events with Web Summit at the forefront. In addition, the Social Innovation Fund is creating opportunities for foreign investors to invest in Portuguese impact startups.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
The increasing adoption of remote work tools during the pandemic has only accelerated the trend that was already in place. Lisbon was already a hub for entrepreneurs and digital nomads (not only working for Portuguese startups but global ones). It is possible that current big cities as startup hubs are losing people now while virtual communities are gaining ground. That would contribute to a more delocalized VC industry. However, in my opinion, the human touch is very important and physical events are a big part of building a community, so as soon as they are back, people will be attracted to them.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
The pandemic has aggravated some of the challenges already present in the UN SDGs agenda. Apart from the obvious devastating health outcomes, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the surface the weaknesses of the, until now, reducing inequalities efforts. On the other side, it is offering a great momentum and opportunity to review the concept of humanity through core values, population solidarity or global collaboration … all of them empowered by the digital transformation and adoption. The UN SDG agenda is not a choice but a must. Any startup that is able to implement a profitable and scalable business model addressing one of the challenges at the core of any of the SDGs will have a great opportunity to thrive in the medium and long term. In the short term, we can see a faster lane for these startups that keep a broader vision for the future while executing a narrower mission focused on solving problems related to COVID-19 itself.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 has brought even more sense of urgency in solving the problems already identified by the UN. Our investment strategy has not changed but has been reinforced by the current situation.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Since we don&#8217;t have an official portfolio yet we can not answer completely this question. What we have seen so far, in our prospects, is the creation of new markets and extension of the existing ones thanks to the aforementioned digital transformation/adoption. In addition, the increasing awareness of the consumer about the societal and environmental challenges together with the sense of responsibility in its purchasing behavior has lead to new and revolutionary revenue streams.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
It might sound cliché but the recent birth of my baby girl gives me even more energy to help build a better future.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
We would like to keep on encouraging entrepreneurs, investors, corporates, governments and the rest of the ecosystem stakeholders to work together in finding formulas that create significant impact and financial benefits.</p>
<h2>Stephan Morais, partner, Indico Capital Partners</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
SaaS solutions, AI applications, digital health, data monetization, IoT SaaS platforms, engineered biology, marketplaces.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Nutrium, a digital health platform that serves 800,000 nutrition patients and aims to put together dietitians, patients and their appointments, including wellness data and products and supplements.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Still many traditional areas and industries to digitize. AI is in its first stages in most industries so we need to address these traditional large opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We look for great founders that can actually be good leaders and CEOs. That’s a combination of vision, being able to take advantage of the market opportunity and having the necessary resilience to break the necessary barriers to create a success case. Additionally, teams need to be very good technically.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Food delivery, most e-commerce and SaaS for SMEs and startups. Given the saturation and competition in the advertising space, everything that depends on that to get off the ground is challenging.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
We are 100% focused on Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
B2B SaaS companies: Unbabel, InnovationCast, Infraspeak, Onalytics.<br />
AI and deep tech: Feedzai, Smartex, Cleverly.ai, Sound Particles.<br />
Digital health: Nutrium, Zenklub, SWORD Health, Tonic App.<br />
Fintech: StudentFinance, Switch Payments.<br />
Consumer: Barkyn, EatTasty, Pleasy Play.<br />
Digitalization of traditional industries: BitCliq, Apis Tech.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
In regards to Portugal, the ecosystem still has room to evolve. Most of the opportunities are in the early stage and the majority of the rounds are below €1 million. International investors should partner with local players in the early stages.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Portugal has been very attractive to international companies that have setup local offices in the past years to take advantage of the great technical talent available. The safety and lifestyle also makes the country attractive for nomads and remote workers, as well as senior executives that are willing to relocate here with their families. As more people work remotely, Portugal is expected to become even more of a destination for tech workers and startups.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Some industries like travel, hospitality and aviation are clearly suffering and some of our companies addressing these sectors have been impacted. We expect that to persist for the next couple of months.<br />
Other sectors are booming like online deliveries, automation of processes and team sync and communication.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
We focused the last months in making sure our portfolio had enough runway for the next year. We know cash is king, companies need to balance that with executing on their vision, taking advantage of the current opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Definitely. In some sectors, tech has been fundamental in keeping the society working and companies productive.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Lots of successful companies in the U.S. were created by European founders, and some of them are returning to their home countries, which will generate a very positive impact! There will be a lot of interesting companies coming out of Europe in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Europe has so much to do to catch up — severe lack of depth in the availability of capital still makes companies move to the U.S. after Series B.</p>

A proven management team and proven product with international expansion potential.</p>

Less.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Lisbon provides fantastic work-life balance and low startup and living costs as well as a good supply of skills. As a result it is likely to benefit from the recent COVID-inspired move away from more established startup hubs in less desirable locations.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Too early to tell. Obviously tourism and many services have been negatively impacted, but even in these areas innovators are taking advantage of the disruption to position themselves well if there is a recovery (and a release of pent-up demand) post-vaccine.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Surprisingly, the net result has been positive across our portfolio with significant opportunities arising. Turmoil and change bring opportunity,<br />
<strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
All of our investments are outperforming budget and expectations this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cable or fiber. For the vast majority of American homes, there’s no choice of how customers get their internet access. If you’re lucky to live in some dense urban areas with amenable landlords, that ‘or’ might become an ‘and.’ Yet, as more and more people rely on the internet for more than just cat photos (and after recent events, maybe rely on cat photos as well for sustenance), it seems obvious the market needs more choice and competition.</p>
<p>Utah-based <a href="https://welink.com">WeLink</a> wants to be that alternative. Taking advantage of advances in 5G in the millimeter spectrum as well as rapidly declining hardware costs, the startup is pioneering a mesh network of wireless base stations that can transmit high-bandwidth signals across entire neighborhoods at relatively cheap infrastructure installation costs.</p>
<p>It’s a paradigm that caught the eye of investors, with Digital Alpha Advisors, a long-time telecom VC with close ties to Cisco, investing $185 million into the company in equity as well as a debt facility in exchange for revenue share (sort of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/saas-securitization/">hardware version of SaaS securitization</a>). It dubbed the latter an “outcome-based financial structure.” Rick Shrotri and Neil Sheridan from Digital Alpha will join WeLink’s board.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup was founded by CEO Kevin Ross and CTO Ahsan Naim in 2018. Ross had been interested in wireless internet since 2005, but the technology was early — and very expensive. “I was twenty years ahead of my time or [maybe] fifteen years, and so it was an exercise in frustration waiting for the technology to actually commercialize,” Ross said. He built one company in the space, eventually selling it to Vivint, a smart home company that was owned by Blackstone and which went <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/vivint-ma-softbank/blackstone-backed-home-automation-company-to-merge-with-softbank-unit-idUSL3N2672BK">through a reverse merger with a SoftBank unit last year for $6.5 billion</a>. The buyer at Vivint was Luke Langford, who left to work on another startup called Lucid Software before joining WeLink more recently as president and COO.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093186" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093186" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2093186" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink-Founders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="340" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink-Founders.jpg 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink-Founders.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink-Founders.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink-Founders.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink-Founders.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink-Founders.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093186" class="wp-caption-text">WeLink&#8217;s executives: co-founder and CEO Kevin Ross and COO and President Luke Langford. Photos via WeLink.</p></div></p>
<p>Now, wireless internet has been a story many of us have followed for more than a decade, with few notable success stories. Ross is convinced though that the combination of reliable millimeter-wave 5G (at around 60-70 Ghz) plus dramatically cheaper hardware costs has finally opened the door to high-quality wireless internet for the first time. (It’s probably good to note that TechCrunch is editorially independent from our ultimate parent company Verizon, which obviously has a fiber customer or two).</p>
<p>WeLink’s technology uses a mesh architecture, which means that signals can be bounced between different base stations as necessary throughout a neighborhood in order to reach a “point of presence” station with a fiber connection. For the typical single-family home installation, a small base station (Ross says about four inches by four inches) is installed on the roof “similar to a satellite dish” and a single cable is run down to connect to the home’s router or Wi-Fi station.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093181" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093181" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2093181" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Deployment_2.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Deployment_2.jpg 3717w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Deployment_2.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Deployment_2.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Deployment_2.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Deployment_2.jpg?resize=680,456 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Deployment_2.jpg?resize=1536,1031 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Deployment_2.jpg?resize=2048,1375 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Deployment_2.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093181" class="wp-caption-text">WeLink&#8217;s base station on a home roof. Photo via WeLink.</p></div></p>
<p>Ross says that WeLink doesn’t need a lot of density to reach ubiquity. “We don&#8217;t need much — a couple of percentage points in a neighborhood of take rate … and that actually ends up giving us blanket coverage. What happens is we will typically get north of 5% very quickly.” Once a neighborhood has an ever higher rate of, say, 10%, “ There&#8217;s so much redundancy there,” Ross said. The company says it offers “Up to 940 Mbps Download/Upload,” although of course, your mileage will vary in reality. That bandwidth is symmetrical unlike cable internet, which should be good for video broadcasting and large file uploads in this remote-work world.</p>
<p>He also noted that the company doesn’t need a lot of approvals from cities in order to launch, which has historically been a large barrier to new internet connectivity startups. “There&#8217;s no permitting required other than at our fiber points of presence where we&#8217;re broadcasting from, but those are minimal.”</p>
<p>WeLink’s first launch neighborhoods are in Henderson, Nevada outside Las Vegas, and the company is expanding into Arizona with installations in Tucson and Phoenix. The company intends to expand to ten markets in the coming years. Ideal markets tend to be suburban neighborhoods and subdivisions where there is enough density to make the mesh network work but with a built environment that doesn’t prevent line-of-sight between antennas. “We&#8217;re kind of primarily focused on bedroom communities, the doughnut around the urban core in big cities,” Ross said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093183" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093183" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2093183" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Topography.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="486" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Topography.png 1532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Topography.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Topography.png?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Topography.png?resize=768,548 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Topography.png?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WeLink_Network_Topography.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093183" class="wp-caption-text">WeLink&#8217;s marketing concept art on how its base stations connect with each other in a neighborhood. Photo via WeLink.</p></div></p>
<p>Pricing is $80 per month on a month-to-month plan, and $70 per month with a two-year contract. After two years, the price drops $10 per month in what Ross described as a “loyalty discount.”</p>
<p>On the investment side, Langford the COO noted Digital Alpha Advisors’ Cisco connections as a key consideration for the company. “There is an affiliation with Cisco, and being an internet service provider, it&#8217;s nice to be able to punch above our own weight as a startup and still have dialogue with the leaders in networking technology so certainly that was something that was attractive to us,” he said. “They were comfortable with a business that has atoms, not just bits.” As for the debt model, Langford said that “There&#8217;s some advantages to not having as much dilution … but also have capital to make sure that we can go add customers.“</p>
<p>Obviously there are other internet wireless startups out there, the most prominent these days given its backer being satellite-based ISP Starlink. Ross noted that he doesn’t really see the company as a competitor, since WeLink’s bandwidth is significantly higher and more reliable given its 5G mesh architecture. He sees Starlink competing much more heavily for the rural market, where many other internet connectivity technologies like cable and fiber are less viable.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of venture money, a serious bet in the 5G space, and hopefully for families fighting on Zoom for pixels, an opportunity to get more competition for high-bandwidth internet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mandy Price was already a highly successful lawyer in private practice before she took the jump into entrepreneurship alongside two co-founders to launch <a href="https://www.kanarys.com/">Kanarys</a> a little over one year ago.</p>
<p>The Harvard Law School graduated didn&#8217;t have to start her company, which helps businesses measure the efficacy of their diversity and inclusion efforts using hard data, but she needed to start the company.</p>
<p>Now, a year after its launch, the company counts companies like Yum Brands, the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dallas-mavericks" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dallas-mavericks">Dallas Mavericks, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Neiman Marcus among the dozen or so companies using its service and has $3 million in seed funding to help it expand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Price, the drive to launch Kanarys came from her own experiences working in law. It wasn&#8217;t the microagressions, or the lower pay, or casually dismissive attitude of colleagues toward her well-earned success that led Price to start Kanarys, but the knowledge that her experience wasn&#8217;t unique and that thousands of other women and minorities faced the same experiences daily.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have had many things happen to me in the workplace that is similar to what many other women and women of color have dealt with and didn’t want to have my children have to go through similar issues,&#8221; Price said. </span></p>
<p>So alongside her husband, Bennie King (himself a serial entrepreneur in the Dallas area), and her University of Texas at Austin and Harvard classmate, Star Carter, Price launched Kanarys in late 2019.</p>
<p>The company uses Equal Employment Opportunity reports and assessments of various policies involving promotion, recruitment, and benefits to track how a company is performing in relation to its industry peers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A lot of the inequities we see are from a structural and systemic standpoint. That is where Kanarys can see how they’re perpetuating inequity,&#8221; Price said. </span></p>
<p>Kanarys starts with an independent assessment of a company&#8217;s policies and practices and then conducts quarterly surveys with employees of its customers to see how well they are meeting their stated goals and objectives. They also integrate with existing human resources systems to track things like pay equity and promotions.</p>
<p>The service has attracted the attention of the Rise of the Rest fund, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/morgan-stanley" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="morgan-stanley">Morgan Stanley, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Jigsaw Ventures, Segal Ventures and Zeal Capital Partners, which led the company&#8217;s $3 million seed round.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Organizations have typically tried to address this with individual interventions,&#8221; said Price. &#8220;What we’re saying is we have to address it on both fronts. So much of the inequities that we see are based off of institutional and systemic policies and practices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Not only does Kanarys track information on diversity and inclusion efforts for customers, but for job seekers there&#8217;s a database of about 1,000 companies which operates like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/glassdoor" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="glassdoor">Glassdoor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. The focus is not just on worker satisfaction, but on how employees view the diversity efforts their employers are undertaking.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Kanarys founders join the (far-too-few) ranks of Black entrepreneurs launching businesses and raising venture capital. In 2017, studies showed that</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/a-look-at-the-pay-gap-between-male-and-female-executives"> 98 percent</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of venture capital raised in the U.S. went to men, according to data provided by the company. Black entrepreneurs in general receive less than one percent of venture capital, and Black women founders make up only</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/02/business/black-women-startup-business-funding/index.html"> 0.6 percent</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of venture capital funding raised. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that a focus on DEI in business is not just the right thing to do for employees, it also makes good business sense,” said Price, CEO and co-founder of Kanarys, in a statement. “Kanarys’ DEI data arms companies, for the first time, to make precise, immediate, and informed decisions using real, intersectional metrics around their diversity goals and inclusion programs that ultimately drive bottom-line business objectives.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Leave it to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lenovo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lenovo">Lenovo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to give the world a swiveling all-in-one. It’s kind of the company’s M.O. – not always the most necessary or practical, but never not interesting. When it comes to fairly staid product categories like this, I&#8217;m all for trying something a little weird. And hey, in a world of convertible and two-in-one the devices, the big, heavy AIO has always been a hold out.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the why here.</p>
<p>I suppose there at least a handful of reason you would want a vertical screen. If, say, you’re a journalist who endless scrolls through news feeds. Though, honestly, the idea of looking at Twitter on a vertical 27-inch 4K display makes me break out into a cold sweat these days. Like the swiveling Samsung TV before it, the form factor allows you view content in portrait mode a la your handset.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And like the Sero, it’s hard to imagine too many users deeming such a feature necessary. I could probably see myself using it one or twice a year. It might also be a bonus while doing spring cleaning. Of course, there’s always the possibility that opening a new screen orientation option could go a ways toward adapting your workflow.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>All in all it’s not a bad looking all-in-one. The 4K screen includes some solid color features, per Lenovo,</p>
<blockquote><p>Yoga AIO 7 affords peerless 4K visuals and more authentic colors than you’ve ever seen before on screen through the 99% Adobe RGB color gamut and a hyperrealistic DCI-P3 99% color space. It’s also designed in accordance with professional-grade display requirements, adopting DC dimming, carrying Flicker-Free and Low Blue Light dual certifications from TUV Rheinland and OSD functionality to facilitate display settings.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can cast your mobile device directly to the desktop, which is mostly where the rotating screen comes in. It ships with 16 or 32GB of RAM, and between 256GB-1TB of solid state storage. There’s also a standard hard drive option that comes in either 1 or 2TB.</p>
<p>It’s available now in China and will hit additional markets next month, priced at $1,599. North America may or may not ultimately be one of those markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://gtmhub.com/">Gtmhub</a>, a multinational startup that builds software to help other companies manage their corporate planning, announced that it has raised a $30 million Series B. The round was led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight</a>, and included both participation from new investor <a href="https://singular.vc/">Singular</a>, and prior investors <a href="https://launchub.com/">LauncHub</a> and <a href="https://crv.com/">CRV</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gtmhub" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gtmhub">Gtmhub <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> raised capital around 13 months ago, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/gtmhub-raises-9m-from-crv-after-posting-400-arr-growth-in-the-last-year/">a $9 million Series A</a>. At the time, the new capital was larger than the aggregate of its preceding funding efforts. The startup&#8217;s new funding round, like its 2019 Series A, towers above its prior fundraising totals in a similar manner.</p>
<p>How has Gtmhub managed to raise so much money? In a word, growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch reported at the time of its Series A that Gtmhub had managed 400% growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) heading into the round, on a year-over-year basis. Similar levels of topline expansion have continued, with Gtmhub COO Seth Elliott telling TechCrunch that the company grew its ARR by a multiple of three last year (measured December 2019 through December 2020).</p>
<p>Around the time when Gtmhub raised in 2019, a number of other startups focused on the same software market raised as well, leading to TechCrunch asking &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/why-is-everyone-making-okr-software/">why is everyone making OKR software?</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>The acronym OKR translates to &#8220;objectives and key results,&#8221; a planning method that has become popular among American technology firms, and, according to Elliott, is becoming more popular internationally and among non-technology companies.</p>
<p>The startup executive also told TechCrunch that he sees Gtmhub growing alongside two business trends. The first, the rise of OKRs themselves, is a wave that his company is riding, he told TechCrunch. The second, one that he thinks his startup is leading, deals with large companies pursuing corporate transformations to boost their agility; those firms are adopting Gtmhub, he said, which can help them execute their digital transformation, or similar efforts successfully.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a big surprise that large companies looking to rejuvenate their operations might want a new planning method to help keep their staff pointing in the same direction, and Gtmhub has long had an enterprise bent.</p>
<p>That enterprise focus performed well for the company last year, we learned. TechCrunch asked the company for updates on its annual contract value (ACV) results and gross margin levels during our discussion of its new round. In 2019, at the time of its Series A, the company said that it had grown its ACV by 650% in the preceding year. The COO told TechCrunch that that figure rose by a factor of ten in 2020, implying success in selling to large companies. And, Elliott added, the total number of paying users of the service also rose by a factor of ten during the year.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s gross margins held up to their roughly 90% levels set in 2019, it said.</p>
<p>Given those results, it&#8217;s not a surprise that Gtmhub was able to raise another round more quickly than the startup-standard 18 month timeline would have had us estimate.</p>
<p>The round came together quickly. According to Elliott, Gtmhub started to chat with investors outside of a formal process in early November, kicking off a more serious effort to raise capital by the end of that month. The round was closed as 2020 concluded.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">It will be interesting to see if other startups working on the software category that also raised money around a year ago will also now raise more capital. The names on our watch list regarding that question include <a href="https://www.workboard.com/">WorkBoard</a> and <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally</a>. There are other players in the space as well, like <a href="https://www.perdoo.com/">Perdoo</a>, that we&#8217;d love to hear from when it comes to their own 2020 growth.</span></p>
<p>Gtmhub declined to share its 2021 growth plans with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The larger lesson from this round is that even inside of a software niche that you might have dismissed as overly narrow &#8212; namely OKR-focused software &#8212; is in fact large enough to support a handful of high-growth startups. That applies broadly, and underscores a little of the pace of the venture and startup industries in the last few quarters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital product design &#8212; the process of building services like websites and apps that work without bugs and as you intend them to &#8212; has come into focus as an especially important thing to get right in the last year. With more customers using sites and apps to interact with a business, if something is broken or just isn&#8217;t working that well, you can lose them much more easily than in the past in physical spaces, when store assistants might help, or the customer might simply get distracted and interested by another product.</p>
<p>Today, one of the startups building tools to help with digital product design is announcing a huge round of funding, a sign of the urgency and interest in the space.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quantummetric.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum Metric</a>, which provides a cloud-based service both to build digital products, and then test and fix them in real time to improve how they work, sold by the company as Continuous Digital Product Design, has picked up $200 million in funding, a Series B round that values the company at over $1 billion. This is a significant upround for the startup, with 9.2-fold increase compared to its valuation in 2018, according to Mario Ciabarra, the founder and CEO of Quantum Metric.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is a significant round for the company also in the context of its previous fundraising, which up to now totaled $50 million from just three named investors: Bain, Hangar 51 and Insight.</p>
<p>Now, the Series B is being led by Insight Partners with other backers undisclosed. Insight is shaping up to be a huge and prolific backer of companies focused on building better customer service experiences in our current, socially-distanced and very digital economy: just earlier today, the same partner that led this round for Quantum Metric, managing director Lonne Jaffe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/glia-raises-78m-for-its-integrated-hands-on-ai-based-customer-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">led a $78 million round in Glia</a>, a platform to help customer service agents do their work more easily.</p>
<p>Ciabarra has built his company out of Colorado, and it somewhat feels like the DNA of being &#8220;remote&#8221; from the Bay Area has fueled how the company&#8217;s own product has been developed, with the idea being that you don&#8217;t need to be on the ground and in the room with someone to be able to identify when they are unhappy. Indeed, being remote is an asset.</p>
<p>The company, through its customer base of enterprises, collects data interactions that cover some 1 billion internet users and some 20% of all internet activity, he said, &#8220;capturing experiences to see where people are frustrated on the web and in native apps. Our focus is on friction and frustration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quantum Metric is part devops, and part martech. When it is used, its customers can in turn monitor when their customers are clicking too much trying to get something done, or clicking and navigating away. It logs these actions, and then suggests ways to fix them.</p>
<p>That focus on looking for bad online experiences seems to follow him wherever he goes: the first thing Ciabarra talked to me about when we spoke for this article was about how bad the experience was for his 12 year old daughter &#8220;while trying to buy a bed online for her birthday&#8221; when she couldn&#8217;t immediate see a bed she wanted appear in her cart. (Yes, some 12 year-olds buy beds for themselves online, it seems. I&#8217;ll make sure my kids don&#8217;t know about this.)</p>
<p class="p5">“Economic downturns have a way of shining a light on high-growth ScaleUps that are particularly compelling to customers, and this year, the surging customer demand for Quantum Metric’s product from customers hit hard by the pandemic, has been extraordinary,” said Jaffe in a statement. “Quantum Metric lets enterprises use real-time qualitative and quantitative data to take the guesswork out of improving their digital features and products. We are excited to double down on our partnership with the Quantum Metric team as they bring their powerful analytics capabilities to customers across the world.”</p>
<p class="p6">The company today counts large internet and offline brands among its customers, with the list including Alaska Airlines, Crate and Barrel, Lenovo, Western Union, Lulu Lemon and Fanduel, and Ciabarra claims that it has held a 98% gross retention of that base, despite the aggressive competition from the likes of <a href="https://www2.logrocket.com/signup-awr?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=11193814533&amp;utm_group=110127979872&amp;utm_term=quantum%20metric&amp;utm_content=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudD_BRBXEiwAudakX0eIGcQyOJXMTS9VpoUfLVutQSbE34WJm2p5n5Y1gPT0tgcvkrtmgBoCPUkQAvD_BwE#utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=11193814533&amp;utm_group=110127979872&amp;utm_term=quantum%2520metric&amp;utm_content=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudD_BRBXEiwAudakX0eIGcQyOJXMTS9VpoUfLVutQSbE34WJm2p5n5Y1gPT0tgcvkrtmgBoCPUkQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Log Rocket</a> and <a href="https://decibel.com/lp-demo-ppc-quantummetric/?utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_campaign=competitor-usa&amp;utm_content=quantum-metric-em&amp;utm_term=quantum+metric&amp;_bt=457844989831&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAudD_BRBXEiwAudakX4_VZZZzsKNHK2ow0kJL3IBIk-gf7SBob635neMvfZAQn7BwZaQ93RoClW0QAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decibel</a>, which actively market themselves in comparison to it. There is still a lot of opportunity, though, as the market continues to push ahead and not just shift online, but start to look like it&#8217;s here to stay.</p>
<p class="p8">Before Covid, Ciabarra said, &#8220;just 10-15% of transactions were online. That&#8217;s flipped, with only 10% in person now.&#8221; And the reason it&#8217;s having traction, he added, is not just because of how customer interactions are changing, &#8220;but because company cultures are changing, too.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Happy almost CES! Sure the year’s biggest consumer electronics show hasn’t officially kicked off, but, well, what do such arbitrary signposts really mean in a year like 2021, right? Samsung just dropped what’s almost certainly one of its biggest pieces of news for the show, with the arrival of the Galaxy Chromebook 2.</p>
<p>The two-in-one follows almost a year to a day after the announcement of the original. It appears to share a fair bit of the charm of its predecessor, but notably has a much improvement price point. This time out the Chrome OS powered portable starts at a far more reasonable $549 – down from $999.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093131" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093131" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2093131" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg 4500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-Chromebook-2_Dynamic4_Red.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093131" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mind you, that’s for the one running a 10th gen Intel Celeron processor. If you want the Core i3, that starts at $699. It’s a bit of a jump, but a better starting point for users looking at the product as day-to-day machine. And besides, it’s still significantly less expensive than the original. Keep in mind here that last year’s model started with an i5 – which is to say the price drop comes with a bit of a processor downgrade.</p>
<p>Battery life was an issue on the original and is still a bit of a question here. The device now sports a QLED display (which Samsung claims is “world’s first” for a Chromebook), rather than the original’s 4K AMOLED, which could go a ways toward improving longevity.</p>
<p>The changes between the first and second gen product are a pretty clear indicator that companies are still trying to figure out precisely what a “premium Chromebook” entails. After all, it wasn’t all that long ago that the phrase was a bit of an oxymoron. The company’s computing GM Shoneel Kolhatkar sums up the general though process here pretty well in the associated press announcement,</p>
<blockquote><p>Many kids grew up using Chromebooks in school, and as they enter the workforce, their needs evolve, they’re looking for premium, powerful hardware that can elevate that intuitive Google experience. We designed the Galaxy Chromebook 2 with these users in mind, taking the popular features from Galaxy Chromebook—incredible visuals, great specs, and gorgeous design and color—and bringing them to a wider base of customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a sense, Samsung is taking a similar journey as the one Google made from the Pixelbook to the Pixelbook Go. And with Google pretty quiet on that front for the moment, there’s a decent sized market opening for Samsung here.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Chromebook 2 arrives later this quarter, sporting a 13.3 inch display, 4/8GB of RAM and 64/128GB of storage. And yes, it still comes in “Fiesta Red” or gray, if you prefer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The popular news app <a href="https://www.newsbreak.com">News Break</a> is announcing that it has raised $115 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The press release claims this round makes News Break &#8220;one of the first new unicorns of 2021,&#8221; but the startup declined to disclose its actual valuation.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/zhaohui-zheng" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="zhaohui-zheng">Jeff Zheng <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said that when he started the company in 2015, the goal was to differentiate itself from other news aggregation apps by focusing on local news, and to &#8220;help or empower these local content creators.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, you can find similar stories in News Break that you&#8217;d see in other news apps (there&#8217;s a whole section for coronavirus news, for example, and this morning you&#8217;ll see plenty of headlines about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">yesterday&#8217;s violent takeover of the U.S. Capitol</a>), but you&#8217;ll also see plenty stories that are highlighted specifically based on your location.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology is interweaving with every aspect of the company — in how we empower local publishers and local journalists to generate content more effectively and to reach an online audience more effectively,&#8221; Zheng said. &#8220;We have AI tools to help provide all these relevant articles &#8230; We have location profiles and what you&#8217;re most interested in, which we basically match against the content.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093160" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093160" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2093160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?w=680" alt="News Break founder and CEO Jeff Zheng" width="680" height="517" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg 1520w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?resize=300,228 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?resize=768,584 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?resize=680,517 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jeff-Zheng_News-Break.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093160" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> News Break</p></div></p>
<p>The local focus may be increasingly valuable given the broader economic challenges facing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/google-news-initiative-project-oasis/">the local news business</a> — as Zheng put it, there&#8217;s &#8220;strong user demand&#8221; for local news but &#8220;weak supply.&#8221; And the strategy seems to have paid off for News Break so far, with the app<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/meet-news-break-the-news-app-trending-in-america-founded-by-a-chinese-media-veteran/"> reaching the top spot</a> in the News category of the Apple&#8217;s U.S. App Store multiple times (it&#8217;s currently ranked number four), and in Google Play as well. The startup says it&#8217;s currently reaching 12 million daily active users.</p>
<p>Zheng said that while News Break already shares ad revenue with publishers, he&#8217;s hopeful that the value it provides those publishers will only grow over time: &#8220;We want to give as much money back to the creators as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I suggested that publishers and journalists may be leery about<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/facebooks-news-not-yours/"> relying too much on a third-party platform</a> to reach their audience, Zheng argued that News Break&#8217;s incentives are very different from the big internet and social media platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are local-centric,&#8221; he said.&#8221;If local publishers are struggling, if the newspapers are diminishing every year, then sooner or later we are out of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Zheng previously led Yahoo Labs in Beijing and was also founding CEO at Chinese news startup Yidian Zixun — plus, the startup has team members in Beijing and Shanghai — he emphasized that this is a &#8220;U.S. high tech company incorporated in Delaware, headquartered in Mountain View,&#8221; with the majority of its workforce in the United States and a focus on the U.S. market. The distinction could become important if News Break continues to grow, given the U.S. government&#8217;s current <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/tiktok-timeline/">attempts to ban some Chinese companies</a>.</p>
<p>News Break previously raised $36 million in funding.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three years ago, Mercedes-Benz unveiled MBUX, an infotainment system that represented a leap forward in the legacy automotive industry.</p>
<p>That system, with its crisp graphics, intuitive user interface and voice assistant, was closer to the experience of using a smartphone and finally got away from the pixelated screens and cluttered designs found in most modern infotainment systems.</p>
<p>Mercedes unveiled Thursday the next iteration of the MBUX, a 56-inch curved screen that runs the length of a dashboard — the central feature of a next-generation infotainment system that learns the behaviors of its driver. The MBUX Hyperscreen, as its called, will be option in the 2022 Mercedes EQS, the flagship sedan under the automaker&#8217;s electric EQ brand. The Hyperscreen, which was unveiled ahead of the virtual CES tech trade show, features 8 CPU cores, 24-gigabyte RAM and 46.4 GB per second RAM memory bandwidth. There&#8217;s a multifunction camera and a sensor that adapts the brightness of the screen depending on the lighting conditions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of this technology is meant to deliver an intuitive infotainment system that can be individualized for up to seven people. The software behind the Hyperscreen allows the system to continually get to know the customer better, according to Mercedes-Benz CTO Sajjad Khan, adding that it&#8217;s designed without the occupant needing to click or scroll anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;The MBUX Hyperscreen is both the brain and nervous system of the car,&#8221; Khan, said in a statement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093070" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093070" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2093070 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg" alt="Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_010.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093070" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen</p></div></p>
<p>The curved screen, which is really several individual displays under a glass housing, is protected by two coatings of scratch-resistant aluminum silicate on the cover plate to reduce reflections and make cleaning easier. Mercedes also designed the screen with predetermined breaking points in case of a crash.</p>
<p>On either side of the curved screen are two physical air vents that have been integrated into the screen,</p>
<p>Putting the look and size of the screen aside, the user interface and how it operates is what stands out. (Althoug to be clear, we have yet to truly test it). Mercedes chose to put information on <span style="font-weight: 400;">charging, entertainment, phone, navigation, social media, connectivity and massage — yes massage — right up front on the screen. This means no scrolling through menus or using the voice assistant to locate these options. </span></p>
<p>The system&#8217;s software, which will learn the patterns of the driver, will prompt the user, removing any need to<span style="font-weight: 400;"> go deeper into the sub-menu. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">navigation map is always visible in the center and located just below</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it are the controls for the phone and entertainment – or the feature that best suits the specific situation, according to the automaker.</span></p>
<p>Mercedes leaned into the software of the system, playing up its smart features during the Thursday reveal. For instance, if the driver always calls one particular person on the way home on certain days, the system begin to anticipate that action. A business card will appear with their contact information and &#8212; if it&#8217;s stored &#8212; their photo will appear. If someone else drives the EQS on that same evening, this recommendation would not be made.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093071" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2093071 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg" alt="Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093071" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen</p></div></p>
<p>The driver can dive deeper into the system to change settings or access other features. The front seat passenger has their own section of the screen called the co-driver display to play around with during a trip. In certain markets, the passenger will also be able to watch videos <span style="font-weight: 400;">while traveling using the Bluetooth headphones</span>. An<span style="font-weight: 400;"> intelligent camera-based locking concept will prevent the driver from looking at the passenger display to avoid distraction.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The ongoing push for social distancing to slow the spread of Covid-19 has meant that more people than ever before are using internet-based services to get things done. And that is having a direct impact on digital customer service, which is seeing unprecedented traffic and demands when things are not running smoothly. Today, one of the startups that&#8217;s built an interesting, very &#8220;hands-on&#8221; approach to addressing that problem is announcing a round of funding to expand its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.glia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glia</a>, which has built a platform that not only integrates and helps manage different customer support channels, but also provides tools to help agents proactively get into a customer&#8217;s app or web page to help them find things or fix issues, is today announcing that it has picked up $78 million, a Series C. Dan Michaeli, the co-founder and CEO who is based out of New York (the company has a substantial operation in Estonia too), said will be used to continue developing its technology and expanding to address inbound interest for its services after seeing its revenues grow by 150% in 2020.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s original focus was around financial services and it counts a large base of customers in that area, but it is also seeing a lot of activity in adjacent industries like insurance, as well as education, retail and other categories Michaeli said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had overwhelming demand and it&#8217;s incredible to see how businesses want to adopt us right now,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;The plan is to significantly scale up and continue to define and meet that demand for digital customer service.&#8221; The company is likely also to use some of the funding for acquisitions in what appears to be a rapidly consolidating market.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Insight Partners, with Don Brown (an entrepreneur in the world of customer service, with his company Interactive Intelligence acquired by Genesys for $1.4 billion) also participating.</p>
<p>Glia isn&#8217;t disclosing other investors, but past backers include Tola Capital, Temerity Capital, Grassy Creek and Wildcat Capital, as well as Insight. Prior to this, the company, which has been around since 2012 and was previously known as Salemove, had raised just $28 million and its valuation was a modest $69 million <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/54664-21/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to PitchBook data</a> (and it&#8217;s not disclosing valuation today).</p>
<p>While there are a lot of customer service startups in the market today, and a number of them are seeing huge boosts in their business, and even some consolidation as others snap up tech to make sure they have their own customer service strategies going in the right direction. (Witness Facebook of all companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/facebook-confirms-it-has-acquired-kustomer-sources-say-for-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring omnichannel customer support and CRM leader Kustomer</a> for $1 billion in November.)</p>
<p>Glia is not unlike many of the new guard of these companies, in that its focus is very squarely on providing a platform to be able to manage and interact across whatever digital channel a customer happens to be using. Glia, I should point out, means &#8220;glue&#8221; in Greek.</p>
<p>What makes Glia quite interesting and different from these are some of the twists it uses to engage with users. One of these involves being able to give agents the ability to actually get on the screen of the user in question, in order to both guide the user around the screen, and to see what the user is doing on that screen.</p>
<p>To be clear, the connection and ability to track what the user is doing is just on the screen in question, and it&#8217;s done with the user&#8217;s awareness of what is going on. In the demo of the service that I went through, it&#8217;s a very smooth service, which reminded me just a little of things like Clippy on Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>Alongside this, Glia provides tools to agents to let coach them on questions to ask, phrasing to use, and links for answers, and Glia also develops virtual customer service assistants, to help with more basic questions. These also have the ability to interact with people&#8217;s screens when they make contact with a company. This in effect sees the company combining a number of technologies in one place, from natural language to suggest (and in some cases run) customer service responses, through to computer vision to help detect what is going on on the remote screen, through to more fundamental CRM technology to run those services across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>While screen sharing has been a well-used tool in other areas &#8212; for example in workforce collaboration environments, or for presenting online &#8212; Glia is seen as one of the pioneers in leveraging that for customer service. For investors, the interest in Glia has been to tap into that.</p>
<p>“We are proud to expand our investment in Glia as the company continues to lead the evolution of Digital Customer Service for businesses across the globe,” said Lonne Jaffe, managing director at Insight Partners, in a statement. “Glia’s platform provides the modern technology necessary for businesses to meet customers in their digital journeys and communicate through the customer’s channel of choice. With this capital, the company will continue to scale and keep up with skyrocketing demand.”</p>
<p>We are in a key moment of digital transformation in customer services. Surprisingly, there are still many who opt for calling in to ask questions, but as Michaeli noted, these days, even when they are still using phones, customers will do so with &#8220;their screens in front of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown believes that this is the other opportunity to seize. “Many companies are still focused on moving antiquated, on-premises telephony systems to cloud contact centers that essentially offer the same functionality,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;Instead, businesses can leapfrog this process and move directly to a digital-first cloud approach by partnering with Glia. If I were to build Interactive Intelligence for today’s contact center, I would take Glia’s approach.”</p>

The company reported that revenue grew 300% year over year for the second straight year.</p>
<p>It was rewarded for that kind of performance with a $525 million Series D today. It did not share an exact valuation, only saying that it exceeded $1 billion, which you would expect on such a hefty investment. Sutter Hill and Altimeter Capital led the round with help from D1 Capital Management, Coatue, Dragoneer Investment Group, Liberty Global Ventures, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snowflake-computing" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snowflake-computing">Snowflake <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Ventures and Tiger Global Management. The company has now raised close to $600 million.</p>
<p>Lacework CEO Dan Hubbard says one of the reasons for such widespread interest from investors is the breadth of the company&#8217;s security solution. &#8220;We enable companies to build securely in the cloud, and we span across multiple different categories of markets, which enable the customers to do that,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that encompasses a range of services including configuration and compliance, security for infrastructure as code, build time and runtime vulnerability scanning and runtime security for cloud native environments like Kubernetes and containers.</p>

<p>As the company has grown revenue, it has been adding employees quickly. It started the year with 92 employees and closed with over 200 with plans to double that by the end of this year. As he looks at hiring, Hubbard is aware of the need to build a diverse organization, but acknowledges that tech in general hasn&#8217;t done a great job so far.</p>
<p>He says they are working with the various teams inside the company to try and change that, while also working to support outside organizations that are helping educate under represented groups to get the skills they need and then building from that. &#8220;If you can help solve the problem at an earlier stage, then I think you&#8217;ve got a bigger opportunity [to have a base of people to hire] there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company was originally nurtured inside Sutter Hill and is built on top of the Snowflake platform. It reports that $20 million of today&#8217;s total comes from Snowflake&#8217;s new venture arm, which is putting some money into an early partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were an alpha Snowflake customer, and they were an alpha customer of ours. Our platform is built on top of the Snowflake data cloud and their new venture arm has also joined the round with an investment to further strengthen the partnership there,&#8221; Hubbard said.</p>
<p>As for Sutter Hill, investor Mike Speiser sees Lacework as one of his firm&#8217;s critical investments. &#8220;[Much] like Snowflake at a similar point in its evolution, Lacework is growing revenue at over 300% per year making Lacework one of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sutter-hill-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sutter-hill-ventures">Sutter Hill Ventures&#8217; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> most important and promising portfolio companies,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://hopin.com/">Hopin</a>, a quickly-growing startup that sells a technology platform for hosting digital events, announced that it has acquired <a href="https://streamyard.com/">StreamYard</a>. The acquired company, which bootstrapped itself to material revenue scale, will retain its brand and in-market product.</p>
<p>The deal is worth $250 million, paid in a mix of cash and stock. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hopin-8ff6" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hopin-8ff6">Hopin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/hopin-raises-40m-series-a-as-its-virtual-events-business-accelerates/">raised a $40 million Series A in late June of 2020</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">a $125 million Series B last November</a> at a valuation of $2.125 billion.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>At the time of its most recent round, Hopin told TechCrunch that it had grown its annual recurring revenue (ARR) from zero to $20 million in around nine months. In an email Hopin told TechCrunch that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/streamyard" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="streamyard">StreamYard <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> had itself scaled to $30 million ARR without external capital. And during a conversation regarding the StreamYard deal, Hopin CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyboufarhat?lang=en">Johnny Boufarhat</a> said that the combined entity would sport around $65 million in ARR.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can infer from the numbers that Hopin has continued to grow rapidly since its Series B.</p>
<p>If it feels strange that a Series B company is nearly at IPO-scale, recall that Hopin&#8217;s technology benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic during which events around the world from conference centers and into browsers, and that Series demarcations for startup funding rounds have lost their historical size, and maturity tethers. (TechCrunch used Hopin&#8217;s service to host several of its events in 2020.)</p>
<p>The deal will not subsume StreamYard whole-cloth into the Hopin product. Instead, StreamYard will retain its brand and product, so that it can continue to serve its existing customer base.  Hopin does intend to better integrate StreamYard&#8217;s streaming tech into his company&#8217;s marquee product, though its platform will remain streaming-provider agnostic; StreamYard will become the default Hopin streaming option, however.</p>
<p>StreamYard co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/geigev?lang=en">Geige Vandentop</a> told TechCrunch that around 15% to 20% of its customers use its service for events-related activities. The rest comes from sources like the creator economy, and small businesses.</p>
<p>As a company, StreamYard decided to eschew external capital during its growth, keeping its team nigh-skeletal while focusing on customer feedback to help it make product choices. Vandentop said in an interview that StreamYard will keep up its current cadence of weekly livestreams to solicit customer input while part of the Hopin product lineup.</p>
<p>On the same theme, Boufarhat told TechCrunch that Hopin is working to build a customer-first, multi-product lineup, of which StreamYard will be a key piece that the larger company will be known for.</p>
<p>Why would StreamYard sell to Hopin, if it had managed to scale to eight-figure ARR without requiring booster shots of external cash? Vandentop described the deal as best for his current customers, his team, adding that the tie-up should allow his startup to move more quickly.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s read of the deal is that Hopin managed to roughly double its own size through the transaction that came at a relatively modest cost, when we contrast StreamYard&#8217;s revenue scale compared to the acquiring company&#8217;s own. However, StreamYard partially traded its equity for Hopin shares that, given the company&#8217;s rapid 2020 fundraising pace may indicate, could rapidly grow in value. And as Vandentop noted during our chat with the two executives, Hopin was growing even more quickly than his own startup.</p>
<p>The virtual events space, and the hybrid, online and offline events space that Hopin originally set out to serve before COVID-19, is one worth watching in 2021 as vaccines are deployed and the world looks forward to a future of safe travel. With StreamYard in its camp, however, any slowdown in the growth of virtual events software sales could be mitigated by streaming outfit&#8217;s largely distinct customer base.</p>
<p>Now we can begin a countdown of sorts for when the combined Hopin and StreamYard entity reaches $100 million in ARR. After that we&#8217;ll start the IPO timer.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>As an aside, Hopin paying around 10% of its current value for StreamYard puts the deal into a <a href="https://www.saastr.com/if-zuckerberg-offered-whatsapp-8-billion-instead-would-he-have-really-been-unable-to-close-that-deal/">similar bucket to the Facebook-WhatsApp deal</a>. A 10% deal implies that the acquiring company is making a material wager on the choice; the recent Slack-Salesforce deal was just over 10% of the acquiring company&#8217;s December market capitalization peak, for reference.</em></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/waymo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="waymo">Waymo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will no longer use the term &#8216;self-driving&#8217; to describe the technology it has been developing for more than a decade, opting instead for &#8216;autonomous.&#8217;</p>
<p>The Alphabet company said that this seemingly small shift is an important effort to clarify what the technology does and doesn&#8217;t do. It&#8217;s also been viewed as an attempt distance itself — and even the rest of the industry —from the &#8220;full self-driving&#8221; terminology that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> uses to describe its advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<p>&#8220;This past year, we explored the importance of language and how terms like “self-driving car” inaccurately describe what autonomous driving companies, like Waymo, are building,&#8221; the <a href="https://www.ltad.com/news/weve-changed-our-name-heres-why.html">company wrote in a blog post Wednesday</a>. &#8220;Waymo’s vehicles don&#8217;t drive themselves. Rather, Waymo is automating the task of driving and thus the term &#8220;autonomous driving&#8221; is more accurate. The conflation of terms used to describe vastly different technology &#8212; such as advanced driver assist systems and autonomous driving technology &#8212; is referred to as and has serious implications for road safety. find people consistently overestimate the capabilities of driver-assisted features.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Waymo&#8217;s decision to drop the self-driving term has been viewed by other AV companies as a call to action by the entire industry. But not everyone in the industry on board.</p>
<p>Several industry insiders and founders that TechCrunch spoke to wondered if a push to drop &#8220;self-driving&#8221; might have the unintended effect of ceding the term to Tesla. Others suggested efforts would be better spent on other means of education.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re pursuing a driverless application of this technology, and will continue to educate the public on its benefits with language that makes a clear distinction between technologies that drive a truck or car as opposed to technologies that assist a driver,&#8221; Aurora CEO Chris Urmson said. &#8220;Rather than rename technology based on misleading marketing efforts of other companies, we agree it is important as an industry to align on clear language to define the life-saving technology we’re building.&#8221;</p>
<p>The push back on Waymo is in part an acknowledgement of the company&#8217;s position in the industry. Waymo, the former Google self-driving project, is one of the leaders in the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Its efforts carry weight and influence in a nascent industry.</p>
<p>Waymo, which changed the name of its education campaign from Let&#8217;s Talk About Self-Driving to Let&#8217;s Talk About Autonomous Driving as part of its announcement, argues that automakers have described or marketed the advanced driver assistance systems in personally owned vehicles as self-driving or semi-autonomous. That, the company says, is creating confusion. Waymo never names Tesla as one of the drivers behind this name change. However, Tesla and its use of the terms Autopilot and FSD has prompted criticism from an array of automotive and safety organizations as well as autonomous vehicle companies.</p>
<p>Waymo points to research that has found that human drivers operating cars, trucks and SUVs that have been marketed as self-driving don&#8217;t understand the limited capabilities of the technology, which can lead to misuse. The company cited one study conducted in 2019, in which half of respondents believed a driver-assist feature allowed them to drive hands-free, even though these systems require drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times.</p>
<p class="body-copy">Questions and confusion around how to describe technology that allows a vehicle to operate on its own without a human driver behind the wheel have persisted for years. Terms like autonomous, automated driving, driverless and self-driving have been used interchangeably for a decade, some fading off for a time before popping back up in popularity. Fully autonomous driving is another more recent entrant in the sphere of AV linguistics. Even Waymo uses the term autonomous and &#8220;fully autonomous&#8221; at different times within its blog post announcing its decision to drop the self-driving term.</p>
<p>&#8216;Self-driving&#8217; has been the go-to term for companies dedicated to developing and commercializing autonomous vehicle technology. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/argo-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="argo-ai">Argo AI, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Aurora, Cruise, Motional, Nuro and Voyage — other leading companies in the industry — use the term &#8216;self-driving&#8217; on their websites to describe what they&#8217;re doing. Zoox is perhaps the one outlier that uses autonomous ride-hailing.</p>
<p>Other companies such as Argo AI are taking a different approach, opting for a storyteller or learn through conversation strategy. Argo AI, which is backed by Ford and VW, launched a podcast in November 2019 and has published about three dozen episodes to date. The company has expanded that effort with the launch of <a href="https://groundtruthautonomy.com/">Ground Truth</a>, which Argo describes as a &#8220;storytelling platform that provides an inside look at the development of autonomous driving technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since there&#8217;s no shortage of hype and speculation about self-driving cars, there is a need for a place where people can get a realistic understanding of this revolutionary technology and how it could one day impact their lives,&#8221; Argo AI co-founder and CEO <span class="xn-person">Bryan Salesky said in a statement about the new platform. </span>&#8220;Ground Truth will be a destination for stories not just about the technology, but about the people doing the work, the cities where it will be deployed, and the businesses it can enable.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Challenger banks, incumbent banks, and all of the many businesses that are making inroads into any kind of banking service all have something in common: when it comes to launching a new product like a credit line or a deposit or current account, these days many of them are opting not to build from the ground up, but are instead using third-party technology to power these services. Today, one of the big players in providing that tech is announcing a large round of funding to expand its business, underscoring the growth in this market.</p>
<p><a href="http://mambu.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mambu</a>, a Berlin-based startup that describes itself as an SaaS banking platform &#8212; providing, by way of APIs, technology to banks and others to power lending, deposit and other banking products &#8212; has closed a round of €110 million (about $135 million at today&#8217;s rates). The funding gives Mambu a post-money valuation of €1.7 billion (just over $2 billion at today&#8217;s rates), the company has confirmed.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Eugene Danilkis said it will be using the money to expand deeper in the 50 markets where it is already active, as well as focus more on specific regions like South America and Asia. (And for those keeping tabs on the &#8220;Is the Bay Area dead?&#8221; story, it&#8217;s one of the many tech companies with its US offices established in Miami.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mambu has been seeing 100% growth year-on-year, but notably, Mambu covered 50 markets when it last raised money, <a href="http://www.eu-startups.com/2019/02/mambu-raises-e30million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">€30 million in 2019</a>, so you can argue it has some investing and expanding to do on that front.</p>
<p>The round is being led by TCV, with Tiger Global and Arena Holdings, along with past investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Runa Capital and Acton Capital Partners, also participating. TCV, known for making big growth round bets (it&#8217;s invested in the likes of Netflix, Facebook and Spotify in the past) has also been carving out a name for itself for backing some of the biggest names in European fintech and e-commerce, with recent investments including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/revolut-raises-500-million-at-5-5-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revolut</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/spryker-raises-130m-at-a-500m-valuation-to-provide-b2bs-with-agile-e-commerce-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spryker</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/dutch-payments-startup-mollie-raises-106m-at-1b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mollie</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/retail-technology-platform-relex-raises-200m-from-tcv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relex</a>.</p>
<p>The market that Mambu is courting is the vast opportunity for a new wave of banking and financial services that tap into the growth of smartphone and web usage.</p>
<p>Long gone are the days where people have to go into physical banks to take out or deposit money, or fill out loan applications and meet with assessors who ultimately decide whether you or your business will get money or not. In fact, many of those brick-and-mortar locations don&#8217;t even exist anymore. In their place are apps, websites, and on-demand services that live wherever people are spending time and money online.</p>
<p>Mambu&#8217;s platform, according to Danilkis, covers some 7,000 different banking products at the moment. These are roughly split across three primary categories: lending, current accounts and deposit accounts, but the sheer number of products really speaks to just how many ways and forms in which you are offered banking services today. (Take credit for example: you can get it through various kinds of cards, point of sale pay-later products, straight loans, and so on.) Alongside its own products, it also provides links through to <a href="https://www.mambu.com/post/transferwise-for-banks-integrates-with-mambu-cloud-banking-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">certain third-party financial services like TransferWise</a>, additional services such as security (perhaps a given for a banking platform) and a platform for &#8220;process orchestration&#8221; (its equivalent of providing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business process management</a> tools).</p>
<p>Gartner estimates (cited by Mambu) put the banking software market at over $100 billion and growing at double-digits, and Mambu&#8217;s customer list reveals the range of companies that are vying these days for a piece of that action: they include the likes of challenger banks like N26 and OakNorth, but also large incumbent banks like Santander and ABN Amro, and telecoms carriers like Orange, which together cover some 20 million customers and some $12 billion under management, Mambu said.</p>
<p>And indeed, the bigger opportunity has also meant that companies like Mambu have a large and growing list of competitors too: they include newer companies like Rapyd and Unit, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/01/thought-machine-nabs-83m-for-a-cloud-based-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thought Machine</a>, which raised a big round last year; <a href="https://www.temenos.com/">Temenos</a> and Italy’s <a href="http://www.ederabs.com/">Edera</a>. It will be interesting to see how newer entrants in the SaaS banking-platform space disrupt what are, effectively, becoming incumbents in their own right: Mambu is now approaching 10 years old (it was founded in 2011). That could lead to consolidation, too.</p>
<p>Turning back to that customer list, I can understand the logic of a company not really in the business of financial services like a telco, or a neo-bank taking an API-based service to power banking &#8212; it focuses instead on building clever algorithms for running those services, and fast interfaces to make them easy to use &#8212; it was interesting to me to see large banks on that list, too. It turns out that the reason is because banks are up against it in another way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, banks have the functionality and capability, but launching something new is often a case of speed and cost,&#8221; said Danilkis. &#8220;The banks might have a generation-2 system but many will be much older. And  changing how a financial product behaves is very difficult and highly risky because even a small change can create problems. And those systems are not designed to work with APIs, so it is extremely hard if not impossible to connect to other systems, never mind in real time. Certain solutions or offerings become impossible or impractical to build yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Doran, the TCV partner, is joining Mambu&#8217;s board with this round, and while the company may be seen as an incumbent to some, its early mover position has helped it not only gain market share, but to stand out for investors as one of the players with staying power.</p>
<p>“Mambu was one of the first companies to leverage the opportunity to move banking software into the cloud,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;The team has built a highly composable, truly cloud-native product in a multi-billion dollar, rapidly-growing market traditionally dominated by large, slow-moving on-prem vendors. We have been following Mambu’s progress for many years and are truly delighted to be able to partner with Eugene and the entire Mambu team on their journey to expand their offerings to customers worldwide.”</p>
<p>EDIT: An earlier version of this article misstated the amount raised as €100 million. It is actually €110 million (the valuation is correct).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Digital services taxes adopted by India, Italy, and Turkey in recent years discriminate against U.S. companies, the U.S. Trade Representative said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>USTR, which began investigations into the three nation’s digital services taxes in June last year, said it found them to be inconsistent with international tax principles, unreasonable, and burdening or restricting U.S. commerce.</p>
<p>In its detailed reports, which the office has <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/january/ustr-releases-findings-dst-investigations">made public</a>, USTR studied how these digital taxes affected companies including Amazon, Google, Facebook, Airbnb, and Twitter. USTR said it conducted these investigations on the ground of Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>India, which has become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">largest market for Silicon Valley giants</a> Google and Facebook by users, introduced digital taxes in 2016 to target foreign firms. Last year, the world’s second largest internet market expanded the scope of its levy to cover a range of additional categories.</p>
<p>USTR investigation <a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/Report%20on%20India%E2%80%99s%20Digital%20Services%20Tax.pdf">found</a> (PDF) that New Delhi was taxing “numerous categories of digital services that are not leviable under other digital services taxes adopted around the world” and that the aggregate tax bill for U.S. companies could exceed $30 million per year.  It also took issue with India not levying similar taxes on local companies.</p>
<p>Despite the strong findings on three nations’ digital services taxes, USTR said it is not taking any specific actions “at this time” but will “continue to evaluate all available options.”</p>
<p>U.S. tech companies have in the past supported terms brokered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But OECD, which is currently in the middle of working out technical details for agreements for over a 100 nations, doesn’t expect to finish the work until mid-2021. In the absence of OECD agreements, various countries are moving forward with their own versions of the taxes.</p>
<p>Since June last year, USTR has initiated investigations into digital services tax instituted &#8212; or proposed to be put in place &#8211; by a number of countries including Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Indonesia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and France, which resumed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/france-starts-collecting-tax-on-tech-giants/">collecting digital services tax from US companies</a> late last year.</p>
<p>In retaliation, USTR had set a January 6 deadline for levying a 25% tariff on a range of French imported goods including cosmetics and handbags.</p>
<p>USTR did not say whether the tariff had been enforced, but in a <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/january/ustr-releases-findings-dst-investigations">statement</a> said it expects to announce the progress or completion of additional investigations in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://toogoodtogo.com">Too Good To Go</a>, the startup that lets you buy food right before it goes to waste, is raising a $31.1 million round. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blisce">blisce/</a> is leading the round and investing $15.4 million as part of today’s round. Existing investors and employees are also participating. While the company has been around for a while, this is the first time Too Good To Go is raising money from a VC firm.</p>
<p>The startup has been operating across several European countries for a few years now. It runs a marketplace focused on food waste. On one side, restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries and other food businesses contribute surplus food items. On the other side, consumers can snatch food right before it becomes unsellable.</p>
<p>It’s a win for everybody as businesses can generate a bit of revenue from surplus food, customers can buy food at great prices and it reduces unnecessary waste. Of course, it’s also beneficial for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/too-good-to-go-c930" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="too-good-to-go-c930">Too Good To Go <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as the company takes a commission on transactions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company’s CEO Mette Lykke <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/mette-lykke-on-food-waste-and-building-a-big-startup-on-a-big-idea/">told</a> TechCrunch’s Ingrid Lunden that one-third of food produced today is either lost or wasted — so there’s a big market opportunity. While the startup has been growing nicely, the pandemic has had a big impact on revenue — many restaurants shut down and many customers prefer to stay at home.</p>
<p>Back in September, Lykke told TechCrunch that Too Good To Go saw a 62% drop in revenue due to Covid-19. But that’s not going to stop the company.</p>
<p>Overall, Too Good To Go is operating in 15 countries and has saved 50 million meals. 65,000 businesses have sold something on Too Good To Go so far. 30 million people signed up to the service.</p>

<p>Too Good To Go is already working on its biggest expansion — the U.S. Just like in Europe, billions of pounds of food go to waste. According to <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs">USDA’s Economic Research Service</a>, it represents 30 to 40% of the food supply.</p>
<p>As the startup’s operations are extremely local, Too Good To Go is starting with specific metropolitan areas in the U.S. In September, the company started its operations in the U.S. with New York City and Boston. Too Good To Go has expanded to part of New Jersey since then.</p>
<p>In the U.S. alone, the startup has attracted 150,000 users and is working with 600 businesses. It has sold 50,000 meals. Those numbers are still somewhat small, but it’s been a weird quarter for restaurants and grocery stores in the U.S.</p>
<p>Let’s see how it evolves in the coming months. With today’s new funding round, it should definitely boost usage in the U.S. and make it easier to plan for the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.pennylane.tech">Pennylane</a> has raised $18.4 million (€15 million) for its accounting service that combines automated processes with human accountants. Existing investors Global Founders Capital and Partech are investing once again.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pennylane" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pennylane">Pennylane <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is both a software-as-a-service company that helps you deal with your financial data and an accounting firm. By working with accountants directly, it means that you can talk with your accountant through the company’s platform. It becomes a single source of information for financial data.</p>
<p>The startup wants to improve the experience for both its clients and its accountants. Usually, accounting firms receive data every month or every quarter. They waste a ton of time opening files and entering information in accounting software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Similarly, accounting reports are a black box for CEOs and CFOs. They can’t leverage that data for financial projections and visibility. Pennylane wants to change that so that you don’t have to use Excel to predict your company’s P&amp;L.</p>
<p>When you first start working with Pennylane, you connect your account with third-party services that already hold valuable information, such as Stripe, Payfit, Qonto, Zoho, Sellsy, etc. This way, information is always up to date, and not just when you manually export data from all your services.</p>
<p>A year after launch, Pennylane has generated €2 million in revenue ($2.5 million) and attracted 550 customers. There are now 30 accountants working for the company.</p>
<p>Up next, the startup wants to attract more companies, and especially companies that have an in-house accounting team or work with an accounting firm already. You&#8217;ll be able to use Pennylane&#8217;s software-as-a-service with your own accountant.</p>
<p>Pennylane had previously raised a $4.3 million (€4 million) seed round with Global Founders Capital, Partech and Kima Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.iprally.com/">IPRally</a>, a burgeoning startup out of Finland aiming to solve the patent search problem, has raised €2 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is by JOIN Capital, and Spintop Ventures, with participation from existing pre-seed backer Icebreaker VC. It brings the total raised by the 2018-founded company to €2.35 million.</p>
<p>Co-founded by CEO Sakari Arvela, who has 15 years experience as a patent attorney, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/iprally" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="iprally">IPRally <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has built a knowledge graph to help machines better understand the technical details of patents and to enable humans to more efficiently trawl through existing patients. The premise is that a graph-based approach is more suited to patent search than simple keywords or freeform text search.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s because, argues Arvela, every patent publication can be distilled down to a simpler knowledge graph that &#8220;resonates&#8221; with the way IP professionals think and is infinitely more machine readable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded IPRally in April 2018, after one year of bootstrapping and proof-of-concepting with my co-founder and CTO Juho Kallio,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;Before that, I had digested the graph approach myself for about two years and collected the courage to start the venture&#8221;.</p>
<p>Arvela says patent search is a hard problem to solve since it involves both deep understanding of technology and the capability to compare different technologies in detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why this has been done almost entirely manually for as long as the patent system has existed. Even the most recent out-of-the-box machine learning models are way too inaccurate to solve the problem. This is why we have developed a specific ML model for the patent domain that reflects the way human professionals approach the search task and make the problem sensible for the computers too&#8221;.</p>
<p>That approach appears to be paying off, with IPRally already being used by customers such as Spotify and ABB, as well as intellectual property offices. Target customers are described as any corporation that actively protects its own R&amp;D with patents and has to navigate the IPR landscape of competitors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, IPRally is not without its own competition. Arvela cites industry giants like Clarivate and Questel that dominate the market with traditional keyword search engines.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a few other AI-based startups, like Amplified and IPScreener. &#8220;IPRally’s graph approach makes the searches much more accurate, allows detail-level computer analysis, and offer a non-black-box solution that is explainable for and controllable by the user,&#8221; he adds.</p>
