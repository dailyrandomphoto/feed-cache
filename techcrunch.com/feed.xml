										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="http://spendesk.com">Spendesk</a> is announcing that it has raised an extension to its Series C round. Tiger Global is investing $114 million (€100 million) in the startup. Following today’s funding round, the company says that is has reached a valuation of more than $1.14 billion (more than €1 billion).</p>
<p>In other words, Spendesk is a new unicorn in the French tech ecosystem. Funding news has been accelerating over the last few months in France. In January alone, five startups announced that they have crossed the threshold to reach unicorn status —&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/payroll-startup-payfit-is-frances-latest-unicorn-as-it-raises-289-million/">PayFit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/ankorstore-reaches-2-billion-valuation-two-years-after-launching-its-wholesale-marketplace/">Ankorstore</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/">Qonto</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/16/warehouse-robotics-system-exotec-raises-335-million/">Exotec</a> and Spendesk.</p>
<p>Back Market, an e-commerce marketplace focused on refurbished smartphones and electronics devices, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/back-market-reaches-5-7b-valuation-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">raised a mega round</a> and reached a $5.7 billion valuation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258559" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Let’s go back to Spendesk. The startup offers an all-in-one corporate spend management platform for medium companies in Europe. Originally focused on virtual cards for online payments, the company has expanded its product offering to tackle everything related to corporate spending.</p>
<p>Spendesk customers can order physical cards for employees, team members can use the platform to pay outstanding invoices, file expense reports, manage budgets and generate spending reports. By offering everything in a single service, Spendesk wants to simplify accounting and approvals in general so that money moves more freely.</p>
<p>The startup defines its platform as a “7-in-1 spend management solution”, meaning that Spendesk is no longer just a product that lets you order debit cards for your employees.</p>
<p>“We have had this goal since the beginning — we really want to become this platform, this operational system to manage your spending,” co-founder and CEO Rodolphe Ardant told me. “When we started working on the product, we looked at each use case and designed the right workflow for that.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In particular, Spendesk helps you formalize your internal processes. You can define team budgets, set up complicated approval workflows for expensive payments, automate some pesky tasks, such as VAT extraction.</p>
<p>“We target mid-market clients. Those are customers with 50 to 1,000 employees. We have a few clients that are bigger than that and a few clients that are smaller than that,” Ardant said.</p>
<p>And the company currently has 3,500 clients — around&nbsp;half of them are based in France while other clients are mostly based in Germany and the U.K. Clients have spent €3 billion through Spendesk in 2021 alone.</p>
<p>With its central positioning in the financial stack, Spendesk needs to interface perfectly with other financial tools — banks on one side and ERP products on the other side.</p>
<p>The startup currently supports many of the popular accounting tools used by European companies, such as Xero and Datev. Spendesk customers can also export transaction batches and import them into Sage, Cegid and other accounting software solutions.</p>
<p>Spendesk is also working on automating the integrations with your bank accounts, which could be particularly useful for companies with multiple bank accounts. For instance, you could imagine setting up a rule that automatically triggers a transfer between your German bank account and your Spendesk account when you want to pay a German supplier.</p>

<h2>Spend management in Europe</h2>
<p>Spendesk isn’t the only spend management solution in Europe. There are some competitors, such as <a href="https://www.pleo.io/en">Pleo</a>, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/pleo-picks-up-200m-at-a-4-7b-valuation-to-build-the-next-generation-of-business-expense-management/">reached a $4.7 billion valuation</a>, and <a href="https://www.soldo.com">Soldo</a> — another well-funded competitor as it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/soldo-raises-180m-for-its-expense-management-platform-for-businesses/">raised $180 million</a> last year.</p>
<p>In the U.S. as well, companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com">Brex</a> and <a href="https://ramp.com">Ramp</a> have reached sky-high valuations. And yet, Spendesk doesn’t think it has the same positioning as American startups.</p>
<p>“On the American market, it shouldn&#8217;t be called the spend management industry — it’s the corporate card industry. Players like Brex and Ramp position themselves as a payment method,” Spendesk co-founder and CEO Rodolphe Ardant told me. “Europe’s corporate culture is a culture of debit — not credit. We don’t provide payment methods, we provide a process.”</p>
<p>It’s a slight difference in product positioning, so it’s going to be interesting to see if a European spend management startup can successfully enter the U.S. and vice versa.</p>
<p>When it comes to business model as well, Spendesk considers itself as a software-as-a-service company with recurring subscriptions. The startup didn’t want to share any hard numbers for its revenue. Its CEO just said that Spendesk’s revenue “more than doubles every year.”</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Spendesk plans to triple the size of its team over the next two years. The company plans to have 1,000 employees by the end of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crypto.com, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, has extended its venture arm&#8217;s fund size to $500 million as it looks to more aggressively back early-stage startups to help the nascent ecosystem grow, following similar moves by rivals Binance, Coinbase and FTX.</p>
<p>The broadening of Crypto.com Capital comes less than a year after the Singapore-headquartered firm unveiled its maiden fund of $200 million. The fund, unlike those of many of its rivals, has no LPs (meaning, it&#8217;s fully financed by the firm&#8217;s balance sheet.)</p>
<p>The maiden fund, whose individual checks run up to $10 million in size, has been so far deployed to back about 20 startups including YGG SEA, multi-chain crypto portfolio tracker DeBank, cross-chain token infrastructure Efinity and Ethereum scaling solution Matter Labs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258617" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Crypto.com will continue to focus on backing early-stage startups, said Jon Russell, who joined the firm as a general partner this month, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>With the fund, Crypto.com is broadly focusing on gaming, decentralized-finance and startups innovating on cross-chain solutions. But he cautioned that the industry could change and expand, as it has in recent years, to areas “we don’t know about,” hence the firm is keeping an eye out on everything.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s announcement also further illustrates the growing involvement of cryptocurrency exchanges in being the rainmaker – and beneficiary – of the ecosystem which encompasses the industry in which they operate.</p>
<p>FTX, which has backed over 15 startups, last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/15/the-race-to-fund-cryptos-future-sure-is-expensive/">announced a $2 billion crypto fund</a>. Its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, also owns Alameda Research, a venture firm that has backed close to 100 web3 startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the only crypto exchange that is publicly traded, and Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, are also among the most prolific investors in the web3 space.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258633" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258633" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2258633 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="602" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258633" class="wp-caption-text">Venture investment in crypto / web3 in 2021 by category (Image credits: Galaxy Digital)</p></div></p>
<p>The funding activity in the space, even as most of the aforementioned names often co-invest in startups, is at an all-time high. VCs invested more than $33 billion in crypto/web3 startups in 2021, more than all prior years combined, Galaxy Digital, another prolific investor in the space, wrote in a recent report.</p>
<p>“Valuations in the crypto/blockchain space were 141% higher than the rest of the venture capital space in Q4, highlighting a founder-friendly environment and the intense competition among investors for deal allocations,” the report added.</p>
<p>Scores of venture capital firms have also raised new funds for their crypto investments. Just last year, Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">added a $2.2 billion crypto fund</a>, Paradigm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/crypto-vc-firm-paradigm-debuts-monster-2-5-billion-fund/">unveiled a $2.5 billion fund</a>, and Hivemind Capital Partners announced a $1.5 billion fund. Katie Haun, who co-led a16z&#8217;s $2.2 billion crypto fund, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/katie-haun-is-splitting-off-from-a16z-to-launch-her-own-crypto-fund/">left the firm to launch her own crypto-focused fund</a>.</p>
<p>Russell – a former journalist who previously had stints at TechCrunch, The Next Web, and The Ken – said Crypto.com is backing startups to help the ecosystem grow.</p>
<p>“If you’re in the industry, it’s in your interest to help companies grow in the ecosystem and the ecosystem itself to grow,” he said. (Worth pointing out that Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot &#8212; as well as some of their major investors &#8212; are also aggressively backing startups that are building applications for the native blockchains.)</p>
<p>The startups Crypto.com backs are under no obligation to list their tokens on Crypto.com over any of its rivals or offer the exchange any other preferential treatment, he said. The exchange team similarly doesn’t have a soft spot for the investment arm’s portfolio firms, he added.</p>
<p>(What&#8217;s up with the career move? “I’ve been crypto curious for a number of years but I wasn’t gasping to dive in full-time. This project appeals to me because Crypto.com is ambitious but yet it does things the right way. There’s certainly a lot of hype and hot air in crypto and web3 right now, but it’s impossible to ignore the talent that’s pouring into the industry,&#8221; he said.)</p>
<p>Crypto.com, which started its life as a blog of professor Matt Blaze (who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/07/rip-crypto/">sold the domain to the crypto exchange</a>), has aggressively expanded in the past year as it looks to court more users. The Singapore-headquartered firm last year agreed to pay more than $700 million for the naming rights of the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The downtown Los Angeles complex has been rebranded as Crypto.com Arena for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The firm, which bills itself as the &#8220;fastest-growing&#8221; crypto exchange, said at the time of the announcement that the move is positioned to make cryptocurrencies mainstream. Crypto.com, which processes trade volumes of over $2.5 billion every day, also teamed up with Hollywood star Matt Damon last year to promote the brand and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The Damon-starring ad equated buying crypto tokens and NFTs to one of the greatest and boldest accomplishments in the history of humankind. Hyperbole, to be sure, but having the most mainstream American actor as Crypto.com’s celebrity sponsor has certainly helped bring the trading platform, and all that it sells, into the mainstream. The ad went viral and also attracted criticism for being cringeworthy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mioapp.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mio</a>, the Vietnamese social commerce platform, has raised an $8 million Series A, less than a year after announcing its seed round. The funding was led by Jungle Ventures, with participation from Patamar Capital and Oliver Jung. Existing investors investors GGV, Venturra, Hustle Fund, iSEED SEA and Gokul Rajaram also returned for the round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/mio-a-social-commerce-startup-focused-on-smaller-cities-and-rural-areas-in-vietnam-raises-1m-seed/">first covered Mio at the time of its $1 million seed funding in May 2021</a>. Founded in 2020, Mio is a group buying platform that focuses on selling fresh produce and groceries in Tier 2 and 3 cities in Vietnam. The company is able to offer next day delivery because it built a logistics infrastructure that enables it to send produce directly from farms to customers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mio, a social commerce startup focused on smaller cities and rural areas in Vietnam, raises $1M seed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/mio-a-social-commerce-startup-focused-on-smaller-cities-and-rural-areas-in-vietnam-raises-1m-seed/embed/#?secret=oC0gR6guX6" data-secret="oC0gR6guX6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Series A brings Mio’s total raised to $9.1 million, and will be used to expand its logistics and fulfillment system, enter new areas in Vietnam and add new product categories like fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and household appliances.</p>
<p>Mio co-founder and chief executive officer Trung Huynh said that since TechCrunch first covered Mio seven months ago, it has achieved 10x gross merchandise value growth, a 10x increase in agents, or resellers, and grew its team from 60 people to 240. It now fulfills more than 10,000 pieces of fresh produce per day, operating in Ho Chi Minh, Thu Duc, Binh Duong, Dong Nai and Long An, with plans to expand into northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>The numbers “strengthened our conviction in this model and its potential,” he said. “We need fresh capital to accelerate hiring, product development and supply chain to keep up with the pace of growth as we deepen our presence in existing geographies and expand to new provinces.”</p>
<p>Mio is able to offer next day deliveries because its vertically integrated mayor layers of the value chain, including procurement, warehousing, order sorting and bulk delivery. The startup owns the majority of its logistics infrastructure and uses its own fleet of couriers. Its ability to delivery fresh produce directly from farms to customers in less than 16 hours contributed to higher customer retention and growth, Huynh said, and it will continue to shorten delivery times. .</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mio resellers are called Mio Partners. Huynh said one of the driving factors behind Mio is targeting the right people for the program, or “housewives and stay-home-moms in lower income regions who love sharing value-for-money products to their social circle of friends.”</p>
<p>They aggregate orders, usually from friends and family, and orders are delivered to them in batches for distribution. The startup claims Mio Partners can make up to $400 a month, including a 10% commission on each order and additional commissions based on the monthly performance of other resellers they referred to the program.</p>
<p>“There is a strong possibility” that Mio will expand beyond Vietnam, Huynh said, “but will only be considered at a more appropriate time after we successfully built our playbook for Vietnam.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korea-based human resources management platform <a href="https://flex.team/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">flex</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> announced today it has closed a $32 million Series B round at a valuation of $287 million. The latest funding, which brings its total raised to $42 million, was led by </span><a href="https://www.greenoaks.com/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greenoaks</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, with participation from <a href="https://dst-global.com/">DST Global Partners</a>.  </span></p>
<p>The startup’s mission is to enable corporations to automate and streamline manual human resources work processes and focus more on people. Its automation tools optimize the employee experience to ensure seamless data flow across groups for use in payroll, e-signature support, on/offboarding and people analytics. <span data-preserver-spaces="true">It also plans to launch performance review and talents relation management tools in the first quarter of 2022. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“At flex we define HR as Human Relations, not Human Resources. We believe HR teams deserve world-class software to manage and service their employees, but today it’s clear that many organizations still use spreadsheets or legacy products to make ends meet, said Haenam Chang, CEO of flex. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The two-year-old startup will use the proceeds to scale operations to meet demand, advance its HR automation and SaaS products and increase its headcount.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Series B funding comes on the back of growth in revenue of almost ten times, compared to last year, driven by a number of product launches and new customers. The startup has primarily been serving SMBs in the IT sector. However, flex plans to expand the addressable market by targeting new industries in the SMB space this year. It did not disclose any user or customer numbers when asked. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently, flex is focused on growing in South Korea by offering a SaaS solution that modernizes the HR functions and processes, which have been slow to adapt to technical progress over the past 20 years. The company said its deep understanding of cultural nuances in people management and the HR regulations in the country help flex to be well-positioned to offer a set of products tailored to South Korean businesses.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“While some companies have adopted solutions to track and improve how they manage their employees, most still rely on gut instinct or insufficient data to make ad-hoc decisions on employees. At flex, we empower customers with a reliable source of employee data and a rich set of tools to manage their people, maximizing individual and organizational performance. Our goal isn’t just to provide a great HR software solution – it’s to empower companies to better track and manage their most important assets, their people,&#8221; Chang said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Korea is one of the world’s largest and most dynamic economies but has historically lacked a native solution for companies to manage and pay their employees – leaving businesses frustrated and left to develop their own homegrown solutions,” said Josh Cho of Greenoaks. “Now, flex is rapidly building the country’s first next-generation human resources information system and payroll platform. We are excited about their vision for an end-to-end product that will let companies handle all their HR functions in a single place, from performance management to recruiting to payroll and more.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian agritech startup Arya, which reaches hundreds of thousands of farmers in the South Asian market and helps them store and sell their produce and secure credit, has raised $60 million in a new financing round as it enters a new phase of growth.</p>
<p>Asia Impact SA, Lightrock India and Quona Capital co-led the $46 million Series C financing round. US International Development France Corporation and others provided an additional $14 million as debt. The new round values the eight-year-old, Noida-based startup at $300 million, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arya.ag">Arya</a> is attempting to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/arya-raises-21-million-for-its-agritech-and-finance-platform/">solve three challenges</a> that have distressed farmers in India for decades. Only about a third of the yields they produce reaches the big markets, where most of the sales occur, creating an uneven concentration that continues to deprive millions of farmers from being able to efficiently store and sell their produce.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258589" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The vast majority of farmers struggle to find buyers for their yields, and they typically go through a cash crunch until they have sold the produce.</p>
<p>Arya, co-founded by Prasanna Rao, is addressing this through a network of close to 10,000 warehouses, up from about 1,500 a year ago, it has seeded across 21 Indian states. By making these warehouses available to farmers near their farms, the startup has made it possible for them to be able to store their produce for the first time.</p>
<p>The warehouse is designed to store grain produce from the farmers for about three months and gives them insurance coverage. Farmers are able to monitor in real-time as the produce leaves their farm to the nearby warehouse, establishing a level of transparency and trust that is crucial to court farmers, said Rao in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>At the warehouse, Arya also helps farmers connect with buyers and provides them the option to negotiate on prices. “Because we hold the commodity in our warehouses, we have complete visibility into quantity and quality. This is how we are able to establish a connect between the buyer and seller,” he said, adding that the startup has visibility into grains worth over $2 billion on its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has devised a level of sophistication that it is able to spin up a new warehouse within two days in any region they are required, he said. Arya doesn&#8217;t own these warehouses and instead revamps warehouses owned by other businesses. There are over 100,000 of such warehouses spread across the country and most of them are being under-utilised.</p>
<p>Arya works with farmer associations to reach the farmers. The farmers can use Arya.ag website or use traditional ways such as guidance provided in-person to use the platform and clear any confusions.</p>
<p>But the work isn&#8217;t done there.</p>
<p>As we have seen in the case of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/indian-e-commerce-udaan-raises-250-million/"> tens of millions of neighbourhood stores in India</a>, the farmers also rely heavily on the earnings they make from selling their current batches of produce before being able to start a new season of cropping.</p>
<p>Arya works with banks and non-banking financial institutions to help these farmers secure loans, allowing them to get back to work while their produces are sold. The $18 million it has raised as debt in the new round is meant to provide credit to the farmers who financial institutions don&#8217;t find credit-worthy, he said, adding that in the past one year, the startup has grown its financing book by three times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arya’s unparalleled reach across rural India, coupled with its tech-driven integrated service model, has made it one of the fastest-growing agri-commerce platforms in India,&#8221; said Varun Malhotra, Partner at Quona Capital, in a statement. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Arya is successfully bridging the trust gap in post-harvest agri transactions through complete transparency and assurance on quality, quantity and payments. We are excited to deepen our partnership with Arya.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Once an overlooked sector, scores of startups and tech giants are exploring ways to tap what is one of the world’s largest annual harvest of grains. I<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ndia’s agri-tech industry has the potential to reach about $24 billion in revenue by 2025, according to consultancy firm EY. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Amazon recently began offering real-time advice and information to farmers to help them inform their decisions on crops. Microsoft is working with 100 villages to deploy AI and build a platform.</span></p>
<p>Rao said it has been heartening to see more players in the industry to pay attention to the sector. He said Arya alone is hoping to have a network of over 60,000 warehouses in the next four years and is also evaluating acquiring smaller startups to fuel faster growth.</p>
<p>“Through the pandemic, we have seen Arya transform agri-commerce across India,” said Matteo Pusineri, director of Asia Impact SA, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Arya will help accomplish Asia Impact&#8217;s vision to integrate rural under-served farming communities across Asia to markets at scale. We are confident that Arya, under the leadership of Prasanna Rao, Anand Chandra and Chattanathan Devarajan, will greatly contribute to a unique ecosystem supporting the sustainable growth story of rural India.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A full page advertisement in Sunday&#8217;s New York Times took aim at Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; software, calling it &#8220;the worst software ever sold by a Fortune 500 company&#8221; and offering $10,000, the same price as the software itself to the first person who could name &#8220;another commercial product from a Fortune 500 company that has a critical malfunction every 8 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ad was taken out by The Dawn Project, a recently founded organization aiming to ban unsafe software from safety critical systems that can be targeted by military-style hackers, as part of a campaign to remove Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD)  from public roads until it has &#8220;1,000 times fewer critical malfunctions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder of the advocacy group, Dan O&#8217;Dowd, is also the CEO of Green Hill Software, a company that builds operating systems and programming tools for embedded safety and security systems. At CES, the company said <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/green-hills-software-technologies-used-in-2022-bmw-ix-all-electric-sports-activity-vehicle-301451788.html">BMW&#8217;s iX vehicle is using its real-time OS</a> and other safety software, and it also announced the availability of its new over-the-air software product and data services for automotive electronic systems.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258372" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Despite the potential competitive bias of The Dawn Project&#8217;s founder, Tesla&#8217;s FSD beta software, an advanced driver assistance system that Tesla owners can access to handle some driving function on city streets, has come under scrutiny in recent months after a series of YouTube videos that showed flaws in the system went viral.</p>
<p>The NYT ad comes just days after the California Department of Motor Vehicles told Tesla it would be <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-11/dmv-message-to-legislatures-ontesla-full-self-driving-safety-its-not-our-job">&#8220;revisiting&#8221; its opinion</a> that the company&#8217;s test program, which uses consumers and not professional safety operators, doesn&#8217;t fall under the department&#8217;s autonomous vehicle regulations. The California DMV regulates autonomous driving testing in the state and requires other companies like Waymo and Cruise that are developing, testing and planning to deploy robotaxis to report crashes and system failures called &#8220;disengagements. Tesla has never issued those reports.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has since <a href="https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1482809775565926404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1482817514476347392%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felectrek.co%2F2022%2F01%2F17%2Felon-musk-claims-no-crash-tesla-full-self-driving-beta%2F">vaguely responded on Twitter</a>, claiming Tesla&#8217;s FSD has not resulted in accident or injury since its launch. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-safety-regulator-says-aware-tesla-owner-complaint-self-driving-test-software-2021-11-13/">investigating a report</a> from the owner of a Tesla Model Y, who reported his vehicle went into the wrong lane while making a left turn in FSD mode, resulting in the vehicle being struck by another driver.</p>
<p>Even if that was the first FSD crash, Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot, the automaker&#8217;s ADAS that comes standard on vehicles, has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">involved in around a dozen crashes</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside the NYT ad, The Dawn Project published a <a href="https://dawnproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NYTAdFactCheck.pdf">fact check</a> of its claims, referring to its <a href="https://dawnproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tesla-FSD-Safety-Analysis.pdf">own FSD safety analysis</a> that studied data from 21 YouTube videos totaling seven hours of drive time.</p>
<p>The videos analyzed included beta versions 8 (released December 2020) and 10 (released September 2021), and the study avoided videos with significantly positive or negative titles to reduce bias. Each video was graded according to the California DMV&#8217;s Driver Performance Evaluation, which is what human drivers must pass in order to gain a driver&#8217;s license. To pass a driver&#8217;s test, drivers in California must have 15 or fewer scoring maneuver errors, like failing to use turn signals when changing lanes or maintaining a safe distance from other moving vehicles, and zero critical driving errors, like crashing or running a red light.</p>
<p>The study found that FSD v10 committed 16 scoring maneuver errors on average in under an hour and a critical driving error about every 8 minutes. There as an improvement in errors over the nine months between v8 and v10, the analysis found, but at the current rate of improvement, &#8220;it will take another 7.8 years (per AAA data) to 8.8 years (per Bureau of Transportation data) to achieve the accident rate of a human driver.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dawn Project&#8217;s ad makes some bold claims that should be taken with a grain of salt, particularly because the sample size is far too small to be taken seriously from a statistical standpoint. If, however, the seven hours of footage is indeed representative of an average FSD drive, the findings could be indicative of a larger problem with Tesla&#8217;s FSD software and speak to the broader question of whether Tesla should be allowed to test this software on public roads with no regulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not sign up for our families to be crash test dummies for thousands of Tesla cars being driven on the public roads&#8230;&#8221; the ad reads.</p>
<p>Federal regulators have started to take some action against Tesla and its Autopilot and FSD beta software systems.</p>
<p>In October, NHTSA sent two letters to the automaker targeting the its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/us-regulator-targets-tesla-on-ndas-over-the-air-software-updates/"> use of non-disclosure agreements</a> for owners who gain early access to FSD beta, as well as the company&#8217;s decision to use over-the-air software updates to fix an issue in the standard Autopilot system that should have been a recall. In addition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/us-regulator-targets-tesla-on-ndas-over-the-air-software-updates/">Consumer Reports issued a statement</a> over the summer saying the FSD version 9 software upgrade didn&#8217;t appear to be safe enough for public roads and that it would independently test the software. <a href="https://twitter.com/ConsumerReports/status/1482084783991705603?s=20">Last week, the organization published its test results</a>, which revealed that &#8220;Tesla&#8217;s camera-based driver monitoring system fails to keep a driver&#8217;s attention on the road.&#8221; CR found that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/ford-takes-aim-at-tesla-gm-with-its-new-hands-free-driving-system/">Ford&#8217;s BlueCruise</a>, on the other hand, issues alerts when the driver&#8217;s eyes are diverted.</p>
<p>Since then, Tesla has rolled out many different versions of its v10 software – 10.9 should be here any day now, and version 11 with &#8220;single city/highway software stack&#8221; and &#8220;many other architectural upgrades&#8221; coming out in February,  <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1479590174828998663">according to CEO Elon Musk</a>.</p>
<p>Reviews of the latest version 10.8 are skewed, with some online commenters saying it&#8217;s much smoother, and many others stating that they don&#8217;t feel confident in using the tech at all. A thread reviewing the newest FSD version on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rucv50/the_state_of_tesla_fsd_beta_108_ai_drivr/">Tesla Motors subreddit page</a> shows owners sharing complaints about the software, with one even writing, &#8220;Definitely not ready for the general public yet&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Another commenter said it took too long for the car to turn right onto &#8220;an entirely empty, straight road&#8230;Then it had to turn left and kept hesitating for no reason, blocking the oncoming lane, to then suddenly accelerate once it had made it onto the next street, followed by a just-as-sudden deceleration because it changed its mind about the speed and now thought a 45 mph road was 25 mph.&#8221;</p>
<p>The driver said it eventually had to disengage entirely because the system completely ignored an upcoming left turn, one that was to occur at a standard intersection &#8220;with lights and clear visibility in all directions and no other traffic.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://dawnproject.com/full-self-driving-cars-software-at-its-most-dangerous/">The Dawn Project&#8217;s campaign</a> highlights a warning from Tesla that its FSD &#8220;may do the wrong thing at the worst time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can anyone tolerate a safety-critical product on the market which may do the wrong thing at the worst time,&#8221; said the advocacy group. &#8220;Isn’t that the definition of defective? Full Self-Driving must be removed from our roads immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Tesla nor The Dawn Project could be reached for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company has signed a five year agreement with Stripe, an online payment processor, to scale the automaker&#8217;s e-commerce capabilities. Stripe will facilitate transactions for vehicle orders and reservations, handle financing options for Ford&#8217;s commercial customers and route customer&#8217;s payments from the automaker&#8217;s website to the correct local Ford or Lincoln dealer.</p>
<p>Ford plans to begin rolling out Stripe&#8217;s technology in the second half of 2022, starting with North America but with aims to roll out in Europe, as well, <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2022/01/17/ford-credit.html">according to the company</a>. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/">Stripe raised a $600 million</a> round at a valuation of $95 billion, funds the company said it would use to expand in Europe.</p>
<p>The tie-up with Stripe is part of Ford&#8217;s larger Ford+ restructuring plan, an electrification and growth strategy into which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">plans to invest $30 billion by 2025</a>. The strategic decision is also in line with much of the <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/industrial-products/library/auto-industry-transformation.html">auto industry&#8217;s move towards investing in technology that will offer the greatest likelihood of capturing returns</a>, specifically in the short-term as the pandemic stunted automakers&#8217; abilities to meet customer demands. And with Ford and Lincoln gearing up to add a number of subscription services, like, most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/amazon-fire-tv-is-coming-to-more-cars-in-2022/">Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV</a>, it makes sense for the automaker to establish a robust digital payment platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258558" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“As part of the Ford+ plan for growth and value creation, we are making strategic decisions about where to bring in providers with robust expertise and where to build the differentiated, always-on experiences our customers will value,” said  Marion Harris, CEO of Ford&#8217;s financial services arm, Ford Motor Credit Company, in a statement. “Stripe has developed strong expertise in user experiences that will help provide easy, intuitive and secure payment processes for our customers.”</p>
<p>Stripe&#8217;s platform, which has other big-name customers like Deliveroo, Shopify and Salesforce, will be a key part of Ford&#8217;s product and service tech stack, the company says.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Canadian startup working at the cutting edge of satellite imaging has raised $4.5 million across a combination of a $2.25 million seed round, and $2.25 million from a combined pre-seed and government funding. <a href="https://wyvern.space">Wyvern</a>, which is working specifically on hyperspectral imaging (imaging that captures light across many different wavelengths, including non-visible ones) is also joining Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2022 cohort.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve covered Wyvern in the past, including when the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/space-startup-wyvern-wants-to-make-data-about-earths-health-much-more-accessible/">startup participated in incubator Creative Destruction Lab (CDL)&#8217;s academic conference-like demo day back in 2019</a>. Since then, the startup has made some significant moves beyond just the funding, including growing to a total of 18 employees and bringing on aerospace industry veteran and former Airbus CTO Christine Tovee. Wyvern is also set to launch its first satellites to orbit this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Launch is the next big thing we&#8217;re looking forward to,&#8221; said Christopher Robson, co-founder and CEO of Wyvern. &#8220;This is going to be our first set of imagery products. This is the first step that&#8217;s going to take us to getting some super high-resolution hyperspectral. We won&#8217;t see the super high resolution stuff for another couple of years yet, but when it gets here, it&#8217;s going to be pretty great and game changing.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258526" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Making hyperspectral imaging captured from space accessible to commercial customers could unlock major efficiencies in existing industries, including Wyvern&#8217;s first target, agriculture, but it&#8217;s also likely to open up opportunities for entirely new businesses and industries to emerge. Hyperspectral imaging can provide detail about previously hidden information, including the chemical makeup of the scene it captures.</p>
<p>Seed round lead investor MaC Venture Capital recognized the immense potential for hyperspectral, and Robson told me that it was clear from the start the firm and new Wyvern Board member Adrian Fenty were a perfect match for the young company.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, we hit it off right from the first meeting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Both of our teams really meshed well together. But the other thing that really appealed to us about MaC is that they&#8217;ve had previous space investments, and they were very bullish about the space market. They were very strategic in the sense that there were a lot of different either customers or investors or partners that they could connect us to through those investments in the space, as well as in some of our customer markets.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtyYxDZJEeM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by a team of young entrepreneurs, engineers and scientists, Wyvern also added to its strategic advantage with the recent hire of Tovee. Robson told me about how that key leadership team member came onboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine had been on our technical board of advisors for quite some time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We also built a strong relationship with her through CDL. And I think we just really enjoyed working with one another: There was a lot of mutual respect between Christine and the team. We realized that we need some kind of veteran aerospace industry expertise on our exec team to understand how we can play in that part of the of the space industry, too. So definitely a fantastic addition in terms of tech strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tovee also joins the company as yet another female senior leader in an industry where gender diversity is woefully underrepresented. Wyvern co-founder and COO Callie Lissinna (who also joined our recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space event</a>) told me that that has been, and remains a priority for the startup, and it has served them well in conversations with investors and potential team members.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a lot of our conversations with investors, they would mentioned how unique our team is in the space industry for having a 50/50 gender diverse founding team and around a 66% female exec team as a space startup,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And that really flows through to our hiring and recruitment: We&#8217;ve had students say they really like the diversity on our founding team or in our company. So that seems to be an attractive factor for both talent recruitment and investors.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://rebundle.co/">Rebundle</a>, a hair-focused startup based in St. Louis, announced that it has raised $1.4 million in a pre-seed round. <a href="https://m25vc.com/">M25</a>, a venture firm with a geographic focus on the Midwest, led the funding event. Prior to its pre-seed round, Rebundle had raised what CEO and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciaraimanimay/">Ciara Imani May</a> described as six-figures worth of grant, and other non-dilutive capital in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Rebundle creates and sells hair extensions made from plant-based materials. My knowledge of hair extensions is modest, but May walked me through a few key points. First, the market is <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/hair-extension-market-105688">both large</a>, and varied, with myriad price points from low-cost (plastic-based products), to expensive (human hair). And second, plastic extensions can irritate one&#8217;s scalp.</p>
<p>May had a focus on living more sustainably before founding Rebundle, she said, and was aware of the irritation that plastic extensions can cause. What her startup created has the potential to both remove plastics from the product, helping customers&#8217; heads feel better, and limit waste, helping the environment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258527" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To create its product, Rebundle uses banana fiber as the core material in extensions that it sells in a variety of colors. Notably the company is building out new production facilities in the United States instead of offshore.</p>
<p>Manufacturing brings us back to the funding round, which the CEO said will be used to invest both in her team, and her supply chain. Rebundle was selling out of stock in an hour or less before raising more capital, which meant that prior funding sources were too small for it to properly scale. Enter venture capital.</p>
<p>Rebundle is a DTC company, selling its products through its website. I asked May how many times per year someone employing hair extensions might change them out for a new set. She said up to five times per year. This means that Rebundle is selling what appears to be a recurring-purchase physical good through its own channels. The gross margin profile of the extensions market isn&#8217;t clear to us at this juncture, but the potential regularity of extensions sales makes Rebundle an interesting business case.</p>
<p>Recall that mountains of venture capital has been invested in the DTC model for products that lacked a recurring hook, an experiment that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/caspers-return-to-private-life-isnt-a-canary-for-dtc-companies-going-public/">had mixed results</a>.</p>
<p>On the obvious question of subscriptions to its products, the co-founder demurred to share specifics, allowing only that there is &#8220;room to play&#8221; with the idea. Extensions customers today, she explained, do not typically buy subscriptions to the product. If Rebundle can scale its onshore manufacturing and introduce a recurring service to its product mix, I wouldn&#8217;t be shocked to see the company raise again this year.</p>
<p>It likely won&#8217;t need to. The company&#8217;s CEO told TechCrunch that her latest round was compiled with a rolling close, but that the capital will provide at least 18 months of runway, and perhaps a little more. So there&#8217;s not likely a near-term need for more funds at Rebundle, though not needing money has certainly not slowed many startups from taking on more capital when offered.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://burnt.finance/">Burnt Finance</a> is a crypto startup which, as a stunt, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56335948">burnt a Banksy artwork</a> and but then the NFT they’d minted for it for $400,000, double what it cost on the &#8216;normal&#8217; open art market.</p>
<p>Based on the idea that auctions for NFTs could be improved, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/could-nft-auctions-be-moving-away-from-ethereum-one-new-group-is-betting-they-will/">went on to raise</a> $3 million for a decentralized auction protocol built on the Solana blockchain. That round was led by led by Multicoin and Alameda Research and was incubated by Injective Labs, the core contributors to the multi-chain network Injective Protocol. </p>
<p>It’s now getting more serious.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258522" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Burnt Finance has now raised an $8M Series A round led by <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com">Animoca Brands</a>, which develops and publishes a broad portfolio of blockchain games, traditional games, and other products.</p>
<p>Also participating was Multicoin Capital, Alameda Research, DeFiance, Valor Capital Group, Figment, Spartan Capital, Tribe Capital, Play Ventures, HashKey, Mechanism Capital, DeFi Alliance, Terra, and others.</p>
<p>Of those investors, Multicoin is perhaps among the best known, as it’s been investing in the blockchain space since 2017, and has invested in Solana, NEAR, MobileCoin (used for P2P payments in Signal), and several other significant projects.</p>
<p>Burnt Finance will now launch its own NFT marketplace, which will feature English, Dutch, and Buy Now auctions, aiming to be a hub for NFTs by integrating DeFi functionality, such a NFT lending, liquidity mining with staking incentives, fractionalization, and GameFi.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This will provide permissionless access to NFTs and claims to have low fees and fast speeds, with “160,000 users” on its waitlist. It also claims to have processed over $100 million of trading volume in 7 days on its Spark testnet.</p>
<p>It also plans to expand to additional blockchains including Terra and other EVM compatible layer one protocols. </p>
<p>Yat Siu, the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, commented: &#8220;Minting and trading assets in a permissionless ecosystem is crucially important to the economic groundwork of the open metaverse.”<br />
 <br />
The global market for non-fungible tokens hit around $22B in 2021 according to DappRadar. Traditional auction houses Christie’s and Sotheby’s have also expanded into the NFT space.</p>
<p>Burnt Finance is pushing at an open door. NFT sales <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/as-nft-sales-top-4-billion-whats-in-store-for-2022-210612228.html">topped</a> $4b in December 2021 alone.</p>
<p>Competitors include, at various levels of course, OpenSea, SuperRare, Rarible and NiftyGateway. However, although Burnt is clearly still very early, it’s attempting to outpace larger players by using Solana and going for the DeFi space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Istanbul has become a city to watch when it comes to casual gaming startups, boosted by the likes of Peak (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Zynga for $1.8 billion</a>) and Dream (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/dream-games-raises-155m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-its-royal-match-puzzle-game-hits-a-royal-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $1 billion</a> in a funding round last year). Now, a new startup is announcing a major round of funding to make its own mark on the space. <a href="https://spykegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spyke Games</a>, which hopes to bring a new dimension to casual games by using multiplayer functionality and other social elements, has raised $55 million in a seed round of funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teams and alliances, clans, tournaments &#8212; these exist in the midcore genre and that is why they are so sticky,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Rina Onur Sirinoglu said in an interview. &#8220;They let people play together and compete together. We are betting this will start happening in casual games, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Griffin Gaming Partners, a VC that focuses (as you can guess by its name) on startups working in and around the games industry. Other companies in its portfolio include Discord, Forte, AppLovin, Overwolf and WinZO.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258514" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is a big sum for a seed round in any country, but as it happens, it&#8217;s the largest seed round to date for a startup out of Turkey, underscoring just how much things have evolved in the country when it comes to attracting investment. As a point of reference, when Peak was acquired for $1.8 billion by Zynga, it had raised a mere $19 million in 10 years.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even more notable is that Spyke has raised this money before it&#8217;s even launched anything. Its first game, Royal Riches, has been out in a limited release and is due to launch globally this month.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the strong investor interest lies in the co-founders and their collective track record. Co-founder and CEO Rina Onur Sirinoglu had also been a co-founder at Peak and its chief product officer; COO Remi Onur was previously Peak&#8217;s head of design; CPO Barkin Basaran had been a senior product manager both at Peak and then Zynga, CTO Fuat Coşkun was Peak&#8217;s director of engineering; and CMO Mithat Madra had been an executive at Riot Games, among other places.</p>
<p>For Spyke, the outsized round was raised to match the startup&#8217;s ambitions. Sirinoglu acknowledged that the round is an outsized one for the Turkish market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Turkey has always been known as a capital-efficient place for startups,&#8221; she said in an interview, referring to the fact that there is a strong pipeline of engineers coming out of education in the country, but also the fact that hiring them is &#8220;super affordable&#8221; compared to hiring equivalent talent in London or the Bay Area. &#8220;Historically startups have been able to stretch a couple of million dollars to great lengths.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she added that Spyke decided to take a different approach. &#8220;We are doing this a second time around, and we think we have landed on something huge,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have long-term goals to be one of the largest gaming companies in the world, and we want to be able to reach that goal in a quick amount of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spyke&#8217;s arrival in the market comes at an interesting crossroads for casual gaming. On one side, the genre has been around for years now, and so the time is ripe to try to disrupt it. The big question will be whether it will be another casual gaming company, or another kind of entity altogether that is also vying for the same engagement hours as casual games.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just competing against the world of other casual games, but also companies like TikTok,&#8221; Sirinoglu said.</p>
<p>The hugely popular video app has not, to date, published any games that you actively play in the app, but it has very much carved out a place for itself in the gaming community. Last November it launched a new games experience, <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/gaming-goes-live-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Room</a>, where people go to watch a live show where high profile people play games. Others regularly post gameplay videos in the app. It feels sometimes like it&#8217;s just a short step further for TikTok itself to launch games within the app.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for this reason that Spyke&#8217;s basic premise is not just to make more casual games, but to bring in more social elements into the mix, something that she and her co-founders started to see hints of while still at Peak.</p>
<p>She said the team there &#8220;unintentionally&#8221; built in social elements into Toy Blast and &#8220;stumbled&#8221; on to a community of players.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Peak, we didn’t have the infrastructure but across games we noticed a cross pollination between Toy Blast, Toon Blast and other similar games.&#8221; User patterns that they found, meanwhile, are going to be applied at Spyke.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interesting thing about the social studio is that the majority of revenues came not from chips or coins but those selling virtual items in private chat rooms,&#8221; she said. These were related to games, but also to relationships being formed among players. &#8220;That was in the back of our minds and so we want to create technology to keep that activity within our infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their decision to leave and build a new company to explore this says a lot about how often some of the best ideas at startups are easier to explore at a clean slate than trying to carve out a place for disruption within an existing entity. It&#8217;s all the more interesting considering Zynga&#8217;s track record in social gaming over the years, and its early days of looking to build in social elements by way of Facebook integrations.</p>
<p>“Spyke has the perfect combination of a deeply experienced team with proven success developing games and an unwavering  focus on execution,” said Griffin Gaming Partner’s MD Phil Sanderson. He has joined Spyke’s board of directors with this round.</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be taking over this week because your usual host, Kirsten Korosec, is busy doing Kirsten things. (Kirsten here to say &#8216;yes, I sure am, although I do have a little item below.&#8217;)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258530" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest micromobility news from the past week is that Ford-owned </span><b>Spin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laid off a quarter of its staff and is preparing to exit all open-permit markets around the world. The company will wind down operations in some U.S. markets, Germany and Portugal and is projected to close in Spain as early as February 2022. In a</span><a href="https://www.spin.app/blog-posts/spin-forward"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blog post </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Ben Bear said this strategy would help accelerate the company’s path to profitability, as “open permit market dynamics have made it difficult to identify a clear path to profitability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t say I didn’t see something like this coming. Back in June, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote about how Spin was shifting its strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to angle for more exclusive partnerships with cities and campuses. This came as Bear took over as CEO and amid reports that Ford might be divesting Spin. Ford told TechCrunch it is still committed to helping the micromobility company on its path to profitability. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether Bear knew all along that this strategy would require closing down operations in certain markets is unclear. Back in June, he told me Spin was “full speed ahead on the hiring front” with ambitious growth plans. Perhaps Spin was just hoping cities would align with the company’s strategy and start moving towards limited vendor permits. That trend might be true in mid-tier cities, which are just as important to convert to micromobility as the big dogs, so here’s hoping Spin’s strategy turns out alright in the end. </span></p>
<p><b>Micromobilty World 2022</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week was also Micromobility World 2022, an event for micromobility lovers around the world, including yours truly, to talk about all things related to the space. Here are just a few of the many highlights: </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2JwmHyFT44&amp;list=PL8xVg_NZwODQUqKTYqqYRcPvXdS6wJ9Ki&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=MicromobilityIndustries"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke to Horace Luke, CEO of Gogoro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about how </span><b>Gogoro</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has dominated Taiwan, why it’s so important to make charging easy and fast through battery swapping to increase adoption of micro-electric vehicles and why partnering with local businesses is key to expanding into new markets quicker. </span></p>
<p><b>Bird </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Travis VanderZanden talked to Horace Dediu about how Bird wants to continue the micromobility momentum started by the pandemic by focusing on climate change and congestion in cities, how to create main market adoption by showing cities that people are willing and ready to get out of cars and potential plans to create new form factors for the bike lane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caroline Samponaro</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, VP of micromobility at </span><b>Lyft</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spoke to The Verge’s Andrew Hawkins about public-private partnerships in micromobility. Samponaro spoke about how Lyft’s docked bikeshares have contributed to the public transit ecosystem by being reliably stationed, and she talked about the challenges of running a shared business, like the need for exclusivity with a city (such as <strong>CitiBike</strong> kind of has with NYC) and cost-prohibitive insurance obligations. Samponaro said that cities needed to work on their systemic vehicle-centric mindset, and she spoke of the importance of the bike and scooter working together. </span></p>
<p><b>In other news &#8230;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV maker </span><b>Rivian</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/rivian-files-trademark-for-electric-bikes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a trademark to produce electric bikes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company wouldn’t tell TechCrunch anything else about the matter, but Rivian wouldn’t be the only OEM to recognize the micromobility trend and try to get on board. </span></p>
<p><b>Lime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/lime-new-e-bike-swappable-battery-works-with-scooters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finally launching its new Gen4 e-bike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, starting in Washington, D.C. The new bike will have a swappable battery that’s interchangeable with the company’s scooters, which should help improve Lime’s bottom line by making vehicle charges much easier.</span></p>
<p><b>Trek Bicycle </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>World Bicycle Relief</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teamed up to do a nice thing and donate $1.8M to communities in developing regions. Consumers around the world made donations towards Trek’s 2021 Bike of the Year, WBR’s Buffalo Bicycle, which is designed to help people traveling long distances over difficult terrain.</span></p>
<p><b>Helbiz </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is partnering with </span><b>Wheels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it deploy 2,500 seated e-mobility vehicles in four U.S. cities and two Italian innovation hubs starting next month, with plans to expand into other markets in the future. </span></p>
<p><b>Cake </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is mounting </span><b>Dometic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s temperature-controlled thermal box for food delivery, the DeliBox, onto some of its :work series bike to create a more innovative delivery solution.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle-based e-bike maker </span><b>Propella</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently released its new bike, </span><a href="https://www.propella.bike/shop/ebikes/mini"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Mini,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which at the time of this writing is going for $899 (+$50 for U.S. shipping). It’s a single-speed, pedal-assist, ultra lightweight (33 lbs) e-bike with 20-inch wheels. It’s got a range of 20-35 miles and a top speed of 18 mph. Looks like a nice little commuter bike!  </span></p>
<p><b>Retrospec</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has l</span><a href="https://retrospec.com/collections/electric-bikes/products/koa-rev-26-electric-fat-tire-bike"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aunched its new Koa Rev</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fat tire e-bike,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complete with shock absorbers, up to 46 miles of range, a top speed of 20 mph and a throttle. Starting at $1,799.99.</span></p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peer-to-peer car-sharing startup </span><b>Turo</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/peer-to-peer-car-sharing-company-turo-files-ipo-to-go-public/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released its filing to become a publicly traded company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S., which unfortunately did not include terms for its offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turo, which was founded in 2010, allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles through the startup’s website or app – like Airbnb for cars. As car rental prices are increasing due to supply chain issues, Turo is gaining some market share that could lead to success. However, Turo comes with a lot of risk, as its S-1 filing showed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, the company might face liability for criminal activities of its hosts, like the ones who have been using Turo and other similar apps to smuggle humans near the U.S. border. Turo is also liable to lawsuits from airport authorities that require the startup to obtain rental car permits to operate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said there’s plenty of room for growth and expansion within the U.S. and internationally. </span></p>
<p><b>Other deals that got my attention …</b></p>
<p><strong>Arive</strong>, an instant delivery service focused on the wider world of consumer goods, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/arive-raises-20m-for-an-instant-delivery-service-beyond-groceries-and-essentials/">Series A round of $20 million</a>. The funding is being led by Balderton Capital, with Global Founders Capital (the firm connected to Rocket Internet&#8217;s Samwer family), Burda Principal Investments, La Famiglia and 468 Capital also participating.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auto parks maker </span><b>Aptiv</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is acquiring software developer </span><b>Wind River</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/auto-parts-supplier-aptiv-buy-software-firm-wind-river-43-bln-2022-01-11/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4.3B in cash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to boost its offerings to an auto industry that’s quickly becoming autonomous and electric, and thus, software-defined. </span></p>
<p><b>Bolt</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offers on-demand ride-hailing, shared cars and scooters, and restaurant and grocery delivery, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/bolt-raises-709m-at-an-8-4b-valuation-to-expand-its-transportation-and-food-delivery-super-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has raised $709M at a valuation of $8.4B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand into new geographies and bulk out new business lines like its 15-minute grocery delivery option by building out more “dark stores.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Delivery Hero</strong>, the German food delivery group, sold $150 million worth of its stake in the Latin-American delivery company Rappi, close to the entire capital it had invested in the company, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/delivery-hero-sells-part-its-stake-rappi-2022-01-10/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EVage</strong>, the all-electric commercial vehicle startup based in India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/evage-raises-28m-to-be-a-driving-force-in-indias-commercial-ev-revolution/">raised a $28 million seed round</a>, led by new U.S.-based VC RedBlue Capital. The company plans to use the funds to complete its production-ready factory outside of Delhi in the first quarter of 2022 and scale up production to meet growing demand.</p>
<p><strong>HeyCharge</strong>, a Germany-based startup focused on underground carparks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/heycharges-underground-charging-solution-raises-4-7m-seed-led-by-bmw-i-ventures/">raised a $4.7 million seed round</a> led by BMW i Ventures (also an early investor in Chargepoint and Chargemaster), the venture capital arm of BMW Group. Also participating was Statkraft Ventures, the venture capital arm of Statkraft, a large European generator of renewable energy.</p>
<p><b>Magna </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">has acquired the tech, IP and assets of </span><b>Optimus Ride</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Boston-based electric autonomous shuttle startup. The </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/magna-acquires-autonomous-vehicle-startup-optimus-ride/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial terms of the deal were not disclosed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but Magna has hired more than 120 OR employees. It plans to use OR’s tech to beef up its ADAS offerings. </span></p>
<p><strong>StoreDot</strong>, the Israeli next-generation battery technology startup touting an &#8220;extreme fast charging&#8221; (XFC) battery for electric vehicles, secured the first close of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/fast-charge-ev-battery-maker-storedot-pulls-in-80m-led-led-by-vietnams-vinfast/">latest funding round</a> led by Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast. The Series D round is due to close at up to $80 million.</p>
<h2>A little bird</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896211 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif" alt="blinky cat bird green" width="1600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Kirsten here, popping in to give some historical insight into Optimus Ride, the autonomous shuttle company that ceased operations and sold its assets and IP to Magna. About 120 engineers have also joined Magna, as the company looks to beef up its advanced driver assistance system offerings.</p>
<p>It turns out that Optimus Ride was considering a merger with a special purpose acquisition company in a bid to go public. My sources say the company was shopping this idea around in early 2021 with a target of raising $400 million to $500 million during the process of going public. The plan was to close the deal by the end of the second quarter.</p>
<p>That obviously didn&#8217;t happen. Sources tell me they just couldn&#8217;t make the deal happen as some investors lost their appetite for mobility SPACs.</p>

<h3><b>Autonomous vehicles</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-11/dmv-message-to-legislatures-ontesla-full-self-driving-safety-its-not-our-job"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California DMV is revisiting its approach to regulating</span></a> <b>Tesla</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s “Full Self-Driving” beta  software after being confronted with a ton of evidence that the technology drives cars into dangerous situations and a letter of concern from a state legislator. Tesla has been getting away with testing its AV tech on public roads and not reporting crashes and system failures to the DMV, as other autonomous car developers are required to do, for years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla owners/fans have paid $10K (soon to be $12K) for the privilege of testing the FSD software on public roads, when they’re meant to be, but often aren’t, supervising the operation of cars as they autonomously navigate on highways and city streets – features that other developers, like </span><b>Waymo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Cruise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Argo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Zoox</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, must report on to the DMV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DMV has good timing, as it looks like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-features-an-assertive-mode-with-rolling-stops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FSD’s latest update to 10.3 is bringing driver profiles back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with typically bro-ey names like “Chill,” “Average,” and “Assertive.” The Assertive one may perform rolling stops, have a smaller follow distance, perform more frequent speed lane changes and will not exit passing lanes. Ok, Elon. </span></p>
<p><b>Ford </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">appears to be toying with the idea of building its next AV facility in Dallas, according to city documents. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/dallas-wants-to-be-the-site-of-ford-and-argo-ais-next-autonomous-vehicle-facility/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dallas city council members voted on Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an economic package that would entice the OEM to its city, rather than one of two potential sites in California, with a $3M tax break and a $250,000 grant towards the production of the facility.</span></p>
<p><b>Local Motors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company behind the Olli autonomous shuttle and the Rally Fighter, has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/local-motors-the-startup-that-created-the-olli-autonomous-shuttle-has-shutdown/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to several posts from employees on LinkedIn who are already looking for work. Olli is the main feature photo for this post and was an early symbol of the burgeoning autonomous vehicle industry. The closure of Local Motors takes yet another autonomous shuttle out of operations and shows there is still room for consolidation in the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autonomous delivery company </span><b>Nuro</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/nuro-autonomous-delivery-bot-launch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unveiled its next-gen electric self-driving vehicle </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">designed and manufactured in partnership with BYD North America. The “Nuro,” an auto-grade vehicle that operates on public roads but doesn’t carry passengers, has twice the cargo volume of its previous model, customizable storage, temp-controlled compartments and a series of safety features like exterior airbags designed to protect other road users. </span></p>
<p><b>Serve Robotics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Uber spinout that builds sidewalk delivery robots, is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/serve-robotics-new-autonomous-sidewalk-delivery-robots-dont-require-human-assist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deploying its next-gen robots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can reach Level 4 autonomy (meaning no human in the loop) for deliveries in certain geofenced areas in Los Angeles. </span></p>
<p><b>Waymo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expanding its pilot-partnership with J.B. Hunt into a long term deal that will see the logistics company become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waymo Via’s first launch partner for freight movement when it deploys fully autonomous operations in Texas the next few years.</span></p>
<h3><b>Electric vehicles</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/first-drive-2022-mercedes-amg-eqs-and-2022-mercedes-amg-sl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roberto Baldwin gave us a First Drive </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the all-electric 2022 </span><b>Mercedes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AMG EQS and the still-V8-powered SL Roadster, two new cars out of Mercedes’s high performance unit that tick all the boxes for performance, luxury and comfort. </span></p>
<p><b>Rivian</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/rivian-produced-a-skosh-more-than-1000-electric-vehicles-in-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported that it produced 1,015 vehicles in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, delivering 920 by the end of the year – it had originally targeted production of 1,200 vehicles by EOY. The company has more than 71,000 pre-orders for its R1T pickup trucks.</span></p>
<p><b>General Motors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/gm-finally-agrees-california-can-set-vehicle-emissions-rules-as-it-preps-to-scale-evs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finally recognized California’s authority under the Clean Air Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to set its own vehicle emissions standards, which adds it to the list of potential OEMs the state can consider for fleet vehicle purchases. </span></p>
<h3><b>Miscellaneous </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our featured articles this week from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Motavilli looked into the real reason the auto industry is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/feature-bloat-cars-chip-shortage/">facing a chip shortage</a> – “feature bloat,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or “the tendency, fueled by sales competition, to slather new cars with as much technology as possible.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The auto tech released at CES, which includes a range of unnecessary tech that can watch and learn from drivers to anticipate their needs, schedule maintenance on their behalf, connect with smart devices at home and even stream YouTube, is proof that automakers are leaning in way too hard to making vehicles defined by software. Especially when we consider that there is no bug-free software and much of this tech can and will be unreliable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Meanwhile, market reality has resulted in a collision course for buyers on the ground: higher prices and spotty availability of some of the features they say they most want,” writes Motavilli.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon appears to have rowed back from a public threat to end support for Visa payments in the UK in a dispute over payment fees.</p>
<p>The ecommerce giant sent an email to users of Amazon.co.uk today informing them that the &#8220;expected change&#8221; &#8212; which was due to take place on January 19 &#8212; will not now take place on that day.</p>
<p>Although it is still not clear if the two companies have come to sustained terms on fees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The expected change regarding the use of Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk will no longer take place on January 19. We are working closely with Visa on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk,&#8221; Amazon writes in the email sent to UK users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should we make any changes related to Visa credit cards, we will give you advance notice,&#8221; it goes on, adding: &#8220;Until then, you can continue to use Visa credit cards, debit cards, Mastercard, American Express, and Eurocard as you do today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Amazon and Visa confirmed the development &#8212; but did not offer any further detail.</p>
<p>Amazon declined to provide any comment beyond its brief statement to users that nothing is changing for now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While a Visa spokesperson also did not elaborate on what &#8220;potential solutions&#8221; might mean in practice &#8212; implying that negotiations on fees are ongoing in a statement in which it writes: “Amazon customers can continue to use Visa cards on Amazon.co.uk after January 19 while we work closely together to reach an agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an earlier email to UK users, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/amazon-says-it-will-stop-accepting-uk-issued-visa-credit-cards-on-january-19th/">late last year</a>, Amazon had blamed high payment fees charged by Visa for credit card transactions for ending support for Visa payments &#8212; warning Brits to make alternative arrangements for paying for their purchases on Amazon.co.uk.</p>
<p>Its very public mass email had looked like an attempt to leverage its market power to extract better terms from Visa.</p>
<p>Whether that worked to convince Visa to reduce its credit card fees or whether Amazon has just decided to step back from the brink of causing major disruption to UK shoppers is unclear.</p>
<p>If the latter, Amazon had already caused UK users who rely on Visa-based payment methods months of uncertainty over whether they would be able to continue making purchases on its site in the near future.</p>
<p>Back in November, Visa described it as disappointing that Amazon &#8220;is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future&#8221;, as it put it then, also arguing &#8220;when consumer choice is limited, nobody wins&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time, Visa had said it was working towards a resolution with Amazon to ensure Visa cardholders can keep on using their UK-issued Visa credit cards on its website.</p>
<p>Months later talks apparently continue &#8212; just without a looming public deadline for Amazon to stop accepting UK-issued Visa cards.</p>
<p>Rising fees for Visa transactions on Amazon.co.uk have been linked to the UK&#8217;s departure from the European Union &#8212; as Brexit removed the cap on fees that can be charged on transactions between the UK and the European Economic Area/EU.</p>
<p>But the issue also likely involves the specifics of how Amazon structures its UK business &#8212; since it bills UK customers via an EU-based entity, shifting revenue booked via its UK website to its European HQ in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>A report covered by <a href="https://www.cityam.com/amazon-transfers-8-2bn-of-uk-revenue-to-luxembourg-report-says/">City AM</a> last August suggested this corporate structure has enabled Amazon to evade paying considerably higher sums in UK tax. However it looks like the same &#8216;profits shifting&#8217; structure costs (or, well, has costed&#8230; ) Amazon considerably more in Visa &#8216;taxes&#8217; than it would like to pay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian startup INDmoney has raised $75 million in a new round as it attempts to build a super finance app to become a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for people’s investments and expenses, a top executive said on Monday.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, Steadview Capital, and Dragoneer co-led the startup’s $75 million Series D funding, said Ashish Kashyap, founder and chief executive of <a href="https://www.indmoney.com">INDmoney</a>, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup, which is valued at about $600 million in the new round, is working to raise another $10 million from a fund, said Kashyap, who is also personally investing in the new round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258474" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>INDmoney, which has offices in Gurugram and Bengaluru, has raised $133 million to date. Much of the capital it has raised over the years is still in the bank, he said.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, INDmoney started its journey as a wealth management app, helping users track their investments and expenses and set financial goals by using machine learning. But soon, it expanded its offerings to allow users to make those investments and expenses on the app itself &#8212; at zero commission. The startup, which has amassed over 3.5 million users, enables its members to invest in mutual funds, bonds and stocks. (INDmoney also offers US-listed stocks on the app.)</p>
<p>“We evolved INDmoney through a lot of amazing insights that consumers’ problems with finances are not at the individual level, but at a family level,” he said in the interview.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258489" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258489" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2258489 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="713" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg?resize=150,134 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg?resize=300,267 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg?resize=768,684 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg?resize=680,606 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ashish-kashyap-indmoney.jpg?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258489" class="wp-caption-text">Prior to starting INDmoney, Ashish Kashyap co-founded Ibibo and PayU. (Image credits: INDmoney)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which works with banks and non-banking financial institutions, is planning to further expand its product stack to offer lending and card to customers, said Kashyap, who previously co-founded travel ticketing firm Ibibo and financial services giant PayU.</p>
<p>INDmoney is catering to the &#8220;mass affluent&#8221; demographic in the age range of 21 to 45, he said. The startup plans to deploy the fresh funds to make deeper inroads in the market and win more customers, he said. &#8220;We have already invested a lot in machine learning, which powers our robo advisor, and research and development. A lot of the new capital will go into broadening our technology,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Millions of Indians are beginning to make investments for the first time in their lives, thanks to the proliferation of modern investment apps such as INDmoney, Jar, and Dhan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steadview has been especially impressed with the INDmoney team’s ambition and execution towards building India’s premier digital bank, redefining how people build financial security with a user-friendly, easy-to-use, mobile-native platform,&#8221; said Ravi Mehta, founder of Steadview Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We couldn’t be more excited to continue supporting Ashish and team’s remarkable vision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another regulatory brick in the wall for Apple: The iPhone maker agreed this weekend to changes to its App Store in the Netherlands focused on dating apps, agreeing to allow local developers of dating apps to be able to offer non-Apple based payments (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-complies-with-dutch-watchdog-ruling-payment-options-netherlands-2022-01-15/">Reuters</a>).</p>
<p>In December, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/summary-decision-abuse-dominant-position-apple">found</a> Apple in breach of national competition rules &#8212; ordering it to adjust what it described as &#8220;unreasonable conditions&#8221; in the App Store that apply to dating app providers.</p>
<p>Apple had been facing the threat of a financial penalty if it failed to make changes by the weekend.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258440" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The tech giant went to court to seek an injunction against the order last month, including seeking to prevent the regulator from publishing its decision and applying for a temporary suspension of the order.</p>
<p>However, in a December <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBROT:2021:12851&amp;showbutton=true">ruling</a>, the court largely rejected Apple&#8217;s arguments &#8212; giving the company until January 15 to comply with the order to let dating app providers offer alternative payment options to their users.</p>
<p>&#8220;The case concerns the conditions Apple imposes on dating app providers if they want to sell digital content in their apps (such as &#8216;superlikes&#8217; and &#8216;boosts&#8217;). Those conditions mean, among other things, that payments from consumers must be made to Apple as a so-called commission agent of the dating app providers using certain software (the IAP API) that Apple has built into its iOS operating system. The dating app providers may not use any other payment settlement method and may not refer to another payment method in their apps,&#8221; the Rotterdam Court wrote [translated from Dutch using machine translation] at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard to this part of the conditions, the preliminary relief judge follows the position of ACM that with these conditions Apple is abusing its dominant position in the market for app store services for dating app providers. Apple&#8217;s arguments that it would not have an economic dominant position and that the conditions are necessary are not successful.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Mzh9hmSpo9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">Europe charges Apple with antitrust breach, citing Spotify App Store complaint</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe charges Apple with antitrust breach, citing Spotify App Store complaint&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/embed/#?secret=Mzh9hmSpo9" data-secret="Mzh9hmSpo9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The ruling means that Apple must allow dating app providers for their dating apps that they offer or want to offer in the Dutch Store Front of the App Store to choose which party they have to settle payments for digital content and services sold within the app, and that those dating app providers may refer to payment systems outside the app for in-app purchases,&#8221; the court added, giving Apple a six weeks grace before the financial penalty for continued non-compliance would apply.</p>
<p>In the event, Apple has chosen compliance &#8212; while it continues to fight to overturn the order in the courts.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">statement</a> late Friday, ahead of the court-amended deadline to comply, Apple informed developers of the change to how it operates its store in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It also confirmed it is appealing the ACM ruling, laying out its case that the changes risk degrading the user experience and could create risks for user privacy and security &#8212; with Apple writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Because we do not believe these orders are in our users’ best interests, we have appealed the ACM’s decision to a higher court. We’re concerned these changes could compromise the user experience, and create new threats to user privacy and data security. In the meantime, we are obligated to make the mandated changes which we’re launching today and we will provide further information shortly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the statement Apple also takes great care to warn local developers that if they take up the option to include non-Apple payment options in their apps there will be a reduction in the services Apple can provide their users as a result &#8212; while also emphasizing that app makers can choose to continue to use its in-app payment system without the need for any changes to how they operate.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the relevant chunk of text:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To comply with the ACM’s order, we’re introducing two optional new entitlements exclusively applicable to dating apps on the Netherlands App Store that provide additional payment processing options for users. Dating app developers who want to continue using Apple’s in-app purchase system may do so and no further action is needed. Before considering applying for one of these entitlements, it’s important to understand that some App Store features that you may use won’t be available to your customers, in part because we cannot validate the security and safety of payments that take place outside of the App Store’s private and secure payment system. Because Apple will not be directly aware of purchases made using alternative methods, Apple will not be able to assist users with refunds, purchase history, subscription management, and other issues encountered when purchasing digital goods and services through these alternative purchasing methods. You will be responsible for addressing such issues with customers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>An Apple spokesman confirmed to TechCrunch that the restrictions on local dating apps that offer users non-Apple based payment methods for in-app purchases relate to refunds, subscription management and similar services &#8212; pointing to the portion of the statement where it underscores how app users will be on their own if purchasing digital goods from a developer that&#8217;s taking payment via non-Apple infrastructure.</p>
<p>In additional information to local dating app developers, Apple further emphasizes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It will be your responsibility to assist your users if questions or issues arise stemming from alternative payment options. Because Apple will not be directly aware of purchases made using alternative methods, Apple will not be able to assist users with refunds, payment history, subscription management, and other issues encountered when purchasing digital goods and services through these alternative purchasing methods. You will be responsible for addressing such issues with customers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple&#8217;s spokesman confirmed that developers who choose not use <span class="il">Apple</span>’s In-App Purchase (IAP) technology can either link out or use a third-party payment method within the app &#8212; pointing to further information it has provided developers <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1642498540822000&amp;usg=AOvVaw16WQPbgn-c-B_aOouxmKyD">here</a><span style="color: #1d1d1f;">.</span></p>
<p>It does not appear that local developers switching away from Apple&#8217;s IAP tech will be able to access entirely commission-free payments, however.</p>
<p>In information provided to developers, Apple also notes [emphasis ours]: &#8220;Consistent with the ACM’s order, dating apps that are granted an entitlement to link out or use a third-party in-app payment provider <em>will pay Apple a commission on transactions</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s spokesman declined to provide any additional details about this &#8212; such as whether the commission Apple will charge on any non-Apple/third party payments is lower than its standard IAP commission. But presumably it is. (Or, well, <a href="https://twitter.com/GeradinLaw/status/1483010194519072771">maybe not</a>&#8230;)</p>
<p>On its website the company further notes that &#8220;more information on all aspects of the entitlements will be available shortly&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong> In a <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/apple-has-adjusted-its-policy-dating-apps-acm-assess-these-adjustments">statement</a> today, the Dutch regulator has confirmed Apple has informed it of the adjustment &#8212; and said it will now assess whether the company is meeting its requirements.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of that assessment, ACM will sit down with dating-app providers, among other interested parties,&#8221; it added, suggesting it will be taking active steps to monitor Apple&#8217;s compliance.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked the regulator for a response to Apple&#8217;s claim that charging a commission on transactions which use third party payment infrastructure (i.e. rather than Apple&#8217;s own) is &#8220;consistent with the ACM&#8217;s order&#8221;, and will update this report with any response.</p>

<h2>Big Tech&#8217;s Big Antitrust Reckoning</h2>
<p>While this regulator-enforced change only applies to iOS developers in the Netherlands &#8212; and only to dating apps &#8212; it offers a taster of additional App Store rule changes that could follow as European regulators continue to dial up their attention on how Apple operates the store after years of complaints over its &#8220;tax&#8221; on in-app payments.</p>
<p>A number of competition regulators in Asia have also targeted Apple over in-app payments &#8212; and, earlier this month in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-to-allow-third-party-app-payment-options-in-south-korea/">South Korea</a>, Apple agreed to let local devs use third party payment options in their apps following a law banning payment mandates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, over in the US, Apple has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed/">appealing</a> against an order following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/">litigation by developers</a> that it must allow devs to communicate with users about alternative payment methods available outside their iOS apps.</p>
<p>In Europe, the App Store remains under close antitrust scrutiny across the region &#8212; with open investigations by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/apple-pay-and-ios-app-store-under-formal-antitrust-probe-in-europe/">the European Commission</a> (which issued a formal charge focused on the music streaming market<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/"> last April</a>) and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)</a>, to name two.</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">begun its own Apple App Store probe this summer</a>.</p>
<p>A major mobile market study &#8212; looking at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/uks-cma-opens-market-study-into-apple-googles-mobile-duopoly/">Apple and Google&#8217;s duopoly control of the ecosystem</a> &#8212; by the UK&#8217;s CMA is also ongoing. But in a preliminary finding in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/cma-mobile-ecosystem-market-study/">December</a> the regulator gave a heavy hint that enforcement is coming &#8212; highlighting in-app payments as a concern, with the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">CMA suggesting that current approaches by Apple and Google could be contributing to higher prices for consumers and squeezing competition.</span></p>
<p>The UK is in the process of reforming digital competition law to create a new ex ante &#8212; and explicitly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">pro-competition</a> &#8212; regime that will apply to the most powerful platforms, aka those judged to have so-called &#8216;strategic market status&#8217;.</p>
<p>Whether Apple meets the bar of that future law remains to be seen but the company is already in the CMA&#8217;s crosshairs &#8212; and enforcements could be on the horizon as a result of the investigation the regulator started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">last March </a>to consider whether Apple imposes &#8220;unfair or anti-competitive terms on developers&#8221;.</p>
<p>Similar legislative reforms targeting Big Tech are in train in the EU &#8212; where lawmakers are busy hashing out the fine details of the Digital Markets Act.</p>
<p>The Commission proposed the regulation at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">the end of 2020</a>, suggesting a fixed set of operational requirements on gatekeeping Internet giants &#8212; coupled with centralized enforcement to avoid regulatory capture and enforcement bottlenecks &#8212; which means the biggest tech companies are facing<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/"> far tighter limits</a> on how they can do business in the EU in the near future.</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s FCO, meanwhile, already has ex ante powers to smack tech giants &#8212; with so-called paramount market significance in its case. And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/germany-fco-google-decision/">earlier this month</a>, Google was the first tech giant to get a taster of its more alacritous antitrust action, as the FCO confirmed it meets the legal threshold for special powers to kick in. Soon after, Google made an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/google-news-showcase-fco-offers/"> offer of operational commitments</a> related to how it operates News Showcase, one of its products that remains under FCO probe.</p>
<p>The German regulator is, similarly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/">in the process of deciding if Apple&#8217;s business meets the operational bar</a> for faster antitrust enforcement. So a pipeline of enforcements looks likely.</p>
<p>In a set of further competition-related enforcements, France has also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">going after Google hard on the news front</a> &#8212; hitting the company with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">a massive fine last summer</a>. Its antitrust regulator has leveraged a pan-EU update to digital copyright law to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/google-france-antitrust-news-litigation-settlement-offer/">extract local operational commitments</a> soon after the update was transposed into national law.</p>
<p>Also recently, France&#8217;s antitrust watchdog has obtained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">a series of commitments from Google around adtech</a>, following another bevvy of complaints.</p>
<p>As has the UK&#8217;s CMA &#8212; which is busy forcing Google to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">reshape its plans around Privacy Sandbox</a>. In that case the tech giant has offered to make the commitments global if the UK regulator accepts them.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: Big Tech&#8217;s operational room for manoeuvre is shrinking fast as regulators around the world up their interventions and get smarter about joint working, digital market analysis and knowledge sharing.</p>
<p>The only silver lining for the biggest beasts of tech is perhaps that talk of breaking up platform empires has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">dialled back</a> in regions like Europe.</p>
<p>Tighter regulation appears to be the preference for Europe&#8217;s competition regulators &#8212; likely as it&#8217;s seen as a more realistic (and faster) route for reshapeing the local market impact of US Internet giants.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to major structural remedies that could see tech empires drastically reshaped, US giants now have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">plenty of problems</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/justice-department-will-reportedly-file-its-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-today/">on home turf</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s call to foster semiconductor independence has sent investors chasing after chip startups of all sorts. Moffett AI, a Shenzhen-based chip design company, has received a fresh Series A injection. The company did not disclose the exact amount, only saying that the proceeds were in the &#8220;several tens of millions of dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round was led by <a href="https://en.stonevc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoStone Capital</a> and the <a href="http://www.gbahomeland.com/lists/about.html?l=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greater Bay Area Homeland Development Fund</a>, a financial vehicle set up to support startups in the GBA economic zone, which is China&#8217;s grand project to integrate Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen and several other cities in the southern province of Guangdong.</p>
<p>Other investors in the Series A financing include <a href="http://www.chinacopower.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Co-Power</a>, <a href="http://www.grandchncap.com/">Grand China Capital</a>, and Shenzhen Angel Fund of Funds, a strategic fund set up by Shenzhen&#8217;s municipal government to &#8220;hunt down the next Huawei, Tencent and DJI.&#8221; Moffett&#8217;s last round from March 2020 closed at 100 million yuan (around $16 million).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258408" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>From autonomous driving vehicles to video streaming recommendations, artificial intelligence has become an essential part of our digital life. The skyrocketing demand for AI capabilities has put a strain on computing performance, so companies that provide AI acceleration, such as Moffett and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/kneron-foxconn-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foxconn-backed Kneron</a>, become coveted.</p>
<p>Moffett vows that its AI chips differentiate by using a technology called &#8220;<a href="http://www.moffettai.com/aboutus.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparsification</a>&#8220;, a process that prunes redundant information from neural network models and ultimately leads to faster processing. The startup plans to spend its new funding on expanding the &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; of partners and clients that use its sparse technologies and mass-producing its first chip, Antoum, which is manufacturered by TSMC.</p>
<p>The startup claims that its chip has a sparsity rate of 32x, which makes its processing power 5-10 times higher than that of &#8220;international flagship products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Headquartered in Shenzhen, Moffett also keeps R&amp;D teams in Beijing, Shanghai and Silicon Valley, where it was founded in 2018. The startup is run by a group of AI research scientists from Carnegie Mellon University and semiconductor veterans from Intel, Qualcomm, Marvel and Oracle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms can include anxiety, chronic boredom, impulsiveness, trouble concentrating, controlling anger, and even depression. But ADHD sufferers can face lengthy waiting periods for assessment and prohibitively expensive treatments.</p>
<p>Now a startup, which launched in 2020, hopes to address this by pouring the knowledge of a team of clinicians and coaches into an app with a guided program to address ADHD symptoms. To help, <a href="http://www.getinflow.io">Inflow</a> claims to enable users to implement Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) coping strategies into their daily lives.</p>
<p>In 2020 InFlow raised $680K from Rhythm VC and angel investors. It’s now raised $2.3M in seed funding in a round led by London-based <a href="https://www.hoxtonventures.com/">Hoxton Ventures</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258115" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A former grade of Y Combinator 21’s batch, Inflow also drew in participation from US-based <a href="https://route66ventures.com">Route 66 Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Several prominent angel investors are also backing the company, including the founders of addiction digital clinic Quit Genius (Yusuf Sherwani, Maroof Ahmed, Sarim Siddiqui), and the CEO of legal services chatbot DoNotPay, Joshua Browder.</p>
<p>However, it must be pointed out that the app has yet to go through any independent clinical trial, although the company says this is in the pipeline later this year.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &#8220;In preparation for a clinical trial we’ve done a usability and feasibility study with the University of Richmond in the US with Dr. Laura Knouse. It did a pre and post symptom and impairment assessment which has been submitted to the journal of attention disorders.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2020 by Seb Isaacs, Levi Epstein (formerly Product Manager at Babylon Health), and ADHD expert Dr. George Sachs, Inflow will use the funding to expand its team and roll out additional tools and services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258123" style="width: 709px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258123" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png" alt="InFlow app" width="699" height="1141" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2258123" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png 699w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png?resize=417,680 417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2.png?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258123" class="wp-caption-text">InFlow app</p></div></p>
<p>InFlow competes in an ADHD app market populated by the likes of apps like SimpleMind Pro, Brain Focus and Focus@Will, but, in truth, most apps are simply touted as productivity apps that might be adapted for use by those with ADHD.</p>
<p>How Inflow works is that users complete short daily exercises and challenges to develop healthy habits, learn skills, practice ADHD-specific mindfulness techniques, learn about their neurological differences, and reframe negative thoughts, says the company.</p>
<p>InFlow claims it is being downloaded over 15k times every month.</p>
<p>Co-founder Seb Isaacs said: “We knew we could simplify the ADHD care process and reach millions of underserved people living with ADHD. Inflow can offer immediate, affordable, and on-demand support in ways our burdened mental health system simply cannot. There’s no waitlist, no need for a referral, no complicated intake process.”</p>
<p>Hussein Kanji, Partner at Hoxton Ventures, added: “It’s been a privilege to watch Inflow deliver on its mission to see every person with ADHD thrive.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">nCore Games has raised $10 million in a new financing round as the top Indian gaming firm gears up to launch web3 offerings, its top executives said Monday.</p>
<p>Animoca Brands and Galaxy Interactive, two high-profile investors in the crypto space, led the funding. Polygon, a popular layer 2 Ethereum scaling solution, and Hyperedge Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Scores of angel investors including Amitabh Singhal, Sandeep Nailwal, Kanwaljit Bombra, Sohil Chand, Ashish Chand, Ram Madhvani, Rakesh Kaul, Mannan Adenwala, Sanjay Narang, Taj Haslani, Kristian Segerstrale, Sanjay Gondal, Vedant Baali, Kartik Prabhakara, Peter Leung, Yashraj Akashi and Akshay Chaturvedi also invested in the round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258426" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>nCore Games houses a number of gaming studios including Studio nCore, Dot9 Games, and IceSpice. Its portfolio includes multiplayer action-title Fau-G and Pro Cricket Mobile that have garnered tens of millions of downloads.</p>
<p>The startup plans to launch and invest in more games this year, said Vishal Gondal, co-founder of nCore Games, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>But the bigger focus with the funding is expansion into the metaverse, he said. nCore Games is evaluating launching its own NFTs and tokens and may do so in the next few months, he said.</p>
<p>India has emerged as one of the largest mobile games markets globally by download counts. PUBG Mobile, before it was banned by New Delhi, had amassed over 50 million monthly active users in India. But gaming firms have struggled to efficiently monetize this user base because of low-penetration of in-app purchases and small ticket advertising dollars.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The growth of gaming in India is already undeniable and the market is poised to take another huge leap forward,&#8221; said Sam Englebardt, General Partner at Galaxy Interactive, in a statement.</p>
<p>Gondal, an industry gaming veteran who sold his previous venture to Disney, said there&#8217;s a shift in the gaming economy, especially in the developing markets where firms have largely relied on advertisement to generate revenue. He cited the popularity of Axie Infinity in the Philippines, a market similar to India where in-app purchase revenue is not high.</p>
<p>Drawing parallels between India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, Gondal said he is optimistic that web3 offerings that have made inroads in several categories and in many markets will prove popular with gaming in India. Gondal said web3 is positioned to enable the right incentive structure to all stakeholders.</p>
<p>“Currently when you’re playing a game, the maximum upside for you was to become part of some community. Now while you’re playing the game, you also have the chance to own the value of the game,” he said.</p>
<p>Tejraj Parab, the chief executive of IceSpice, said nCore Games is eyeing making a universal token that all of its games as well as those of the partner firms will provide to the community. The startup is also hoping to make its technology available to other game developers to leverage, he said.</p>
<p>Dayanidhi MG, the chief executive of Studio nCore, said, &#8220;we are excited to embrace the emerging trends and technologies in the company of global leaders and highly successful funds, companies and veterans to take nCore to the next level with exponential growth.”</p>
<p>Web3 is beginning to gain traction in India. Indian startup Faze, backed by Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India, last year partnered with ICC, the global governing body of cricket, to launch NFTs for cricketers. The startup is currently holding talks to raise a new financing round from Insight Partners, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Several Bollywood celebrities have also partnered with firms to launch their own NFTs.</p>
<p>&#8220;nCORE Games was started by experienced gaming industry professionals with strong pedigrees. This is one of our most promising investments in India, which has a large gaming market with a massive growth potential,&#8221; said Yat Siu, the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, in a statement. &#8220;nCORE Games has the right team to leverage blockchain and NFTs in games to deliver digital property rights to players, and we look forward to many successful products as we move toward a global open metaverse.&#8221;</p>

<div class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr" data-offset-key="bfq2-0-0">
<p id="speakable-summary">Cash flow is a major pain point for small businesses in Africa. Long payment cycles, which can take 30-90 days after services or products have been rendered, and little or no capital, of which <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zuzana-Brixiova-Schwidrowski/publication/345177624_Access_to_finance_among_small_and_medium-sized_enterprises_and_job_creation_in_Africa/links/5fa3e40f299bf10f73251ec9/Access-to-finance-among-small-and-medium-sized-enterprises-and-job-creation-in-Africa.pdf?origin=publication_detail">research says</a> 85% of African small and medium businesses are subject to, are the main culprits of cash flow issues.</p>
<p>Many startups are solving these problems for African SMBs in one form or another, and the demand for their services has seen Ghanaian startup <a href="https://float.africa/">Float</a> pick up a significant round of funding. The fintech which provides credit lines for businesses has raised $17 million, funding that it will be using to bolster its offerings and expand geographically.</p>
<p>The seed round was a mix of $7 million equity and $10 million debt. While <a href="https://www.caurisfinance.com/">Cauris</a> provided debt financing, Tiger Global and JAM Fund, the investment firm of Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen co-led the equity bit. Other VC firms involved in the equity round include Kinfolk, Soma Capital, Ingressive Capital and Magic Fund.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258224" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A couple of angel investors also took part: Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, Sandy Kory of Horizon Partners, Ramp founders Karim Atiyeh and Eric Glyman, Gregory Rockson of mPharma and Dutchie founders Zach Lipson and Ross Lipson.</p>
<p>CEO <a href="https://gh.linkedin.com/in/jesseaholmes">Jesse Ghansah</a> started the company, formerly known as Swipe, with <a href="https://gh.linkedin.com/in/barima-effah-adjei-7498ab1bb">Barima Effah</a> in 2020, and following its rebrand as Float, went live with its product in June 2021. The idea for the YC-backed Ghanaian fintech came during the chief executive’s time at OMG Digital, a media company he founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/10/omg-digital-africa/">that also got into YC</a>, in 2016.</p>
<p>“We needed credit and proceeded to get an overdraft from a long-term partner bank where we had transacted more than $100,000. But the bank wanted us to deposit 100% collateral in cash before they could give the overdraft,” the two-time YC founder told TechCrunch in a June interview.</p>
<p>“I also remember taking money from loan sharks with ridiculous interest rates, sometimes as high as 20% a month, to meet payroll. That threw me into solving those problems with Float.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s an identical problem for more than 51% of 44 million formal SMBs in sub-Saharan Africa who say they need more finance than they can access to grow their businesses, per <a href="https://pressroom.ifc.org/all/pages/PressDetail.aspx?ID=17513">research</a>. Float provides credit to some of these businesses that find it challenging to get from traditional banks.</p>
<p>In addition to flexible credit lines for businesses to cover cash flow gaps, Float also has software tools for businesses to manage accounts and wallets in one dashboard, as well as automate bills, vendor or supplier payments and invoice collections. The company aims to serve as the “financial operating system” for Africa’s small and medium businesses.</p>
<p>Other features on the platform include invoice advance, opening a business account, payment links, managing budgets and spend cards.</p>
<p>The company has also introduced some more features recently: revenue advances and instant payouts. With the latter, Float wants small businesses to use its platform to tap into their revenues instantly instead of using gateways, which take days to settle. Its invoice factoring helps businesses with outstanding invoices get cash advances.</p>
<p>Ghansah stated all these features provide different forms of credit for various industries and verticals across the continent.</p>
<p>“The big challenge is that credit needs of businesses are very different. The credit needs of retail are very different from the credit needs of a services business, or the credit needs of agriculture, business or pharmaceutical or medical supplies businesses,” said the chief executive.</p>
<p>“So we are trying to dig deep into which credit products work for certain verticals. And so that’s what we’ve been working on so far.”</p>
<p>In the seven months since Float’s launch, the cash flow management and spend platform has onboarded hundreds of businesses in a wide range of industries &#8212; retail and manufacturing, fintech, e-commerce, media and health.</p>
<p>Float has also hit $10 million in credit spend and cash advances to businesses in that time. The company claims to have seen its payment transaction (invoicing and vendor payments) volume, in eight figures, increase 26x.</p>

<p>Float isn’t the only African fintech newcomer with plans to be the “operating system” for small and medium businesses in the region. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/nigerias-prospa-gets-3-8m-pre-seed-to-offer-small-businesses-banking-and-software-services/">Prospa</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/ventures-platform-hustle-fund-back-nigerian-fintech-brass-in-1-7m-round/">Brass</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/uzoma-dozies-sparkle-raises-3-1m-for-personal-business-neobank-play-in-nigeria/">Sparkle</a> are a few of these startups that provide financial and cash flow support and software services to businesses.</p>
<p>Each company claims not to see the others as competition; first, they believe the market is big enough for all parties to coexist. Second, there’s a feeling of superiority in their products &#8212; though they won’t say this publicly.</p>
<p>For Float, it prides itself on giving businesses access to financial and software services simultaneously. And then in providing readily available flexible and short duration working capital instead of outright expensive loans.</p>
<p>“I think that a part of how we differentiate ourselves is just how flexible our credit is, in terms of the speed of access, how quickly you can draw down on credit,” said Ghansah. “And then, like it’s flexible in terms of how you can just take it out for a day and then repay the next day, for example.”</p>
<p>Float, present in Ghana and Nigeria, intends to use this new capital to set up entities in Kenya and South Africa by Q2 as soon as it gets licenses to operate, Ghansah said on the call.</p>
<p>The company will also use the investment to improve its cash management platform and launch new credit products tailored to specific business verticals and industries.</p>
<p>“Float set out on a mission to provide more cash flow and liquidity for millions of businesses across the continent to help them grow and reach their true potential,” said the chief executive in a statement.</p>
<p>“With this new funding, we will continue to refine both our credit and software products to deliver the best experiences for our fast-growing customer base. We are excited to be the growth partner of choice for businesses in Africa.”<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Customer service tickets tend to fall into the same few buckets — returns, refunds or quality control questions. Not only are these repetitive, but it leaves little time for customer engagement on more complex requests, like relaying information on products or helping a customer find the best product for them.</p>
<p>Maja Schaefer and Matt Ciolek, co-founders of <a href="https://getzowie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zowie</a>, believe much of that repetitive work can be automated. They founded the company in 2019, blending their experiences of working with an e-commerce startup on both the product development and customer survey sides.</p>
<p>“We realized that customer service was not being solved by existing solutions because their implementation was so hard,” CEO Schaefer told TechCrunch. “It would take months to implement and then end up being hard to maintain.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258136" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>They proposed to a client chatbots as a solution for repeatable work, and after being tasked with building those in a matter of weeks, they had the idea for Zowie.</p>
<p>Using AI-powered chatbots for customer service is not new. In the past year, we saw companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/forethought-nabs-65m-series-c-to-improve-customer-service-with-ai/">Forethought</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/heyday-seed-funding-2/">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/cognigy-raises-44m-to-scale-its-enterprise-focused-conversational-ai-platform/">Cognigy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/landbot-closes-8m-series-a-for-its-no-code-chatbot-builder/">Landbot</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/no-code-tool-maker-heyflow-nabs-6m-to-fix-your-customer-conversions/">Heyflow</a> announce funding in this area.</p>
<p>However, Schaefer says some competitors require the company to input responses and other workflow information into the tool. Instead, Zowie’s Zowie X1 technology does the job of automating the request workflows specific to a product or brand from the very beginning. The company can analyze data in minutes and tell a customer the percentage of support tickets Zowie can support, in some cases 50%.</p>
<p>Schaefer estimates the chatbots free up about two hours per agent per day, leaving them open to take on questions not answered by the chatbot, resolve more complicated issues and turn more support into sales. On average, customers are able to realize up to 45% more sales, she added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After experiencing its revenue tripling between 2020 and 2021, the company decided to go after a round of funding, raising $5 million in a seed round led by Gradient Ventures and 10xFounders, with participation from Lattice CEO Jack Altman, Giesswein CEO Markus Giesswein and returning investor Inovo Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The company is working with about 100 customers, including Giesswein. She expects to use the funding on product development, marketing, sales and growth of the commercial team in the United States and across North America. Zowie has 36 employees currently and the plan is to double the team this year.</p>
<p>Some of the product features the company is looking to expand include automation across as many channels as possible, from websites to email to Whatsapp, and to enable features on the sales side so they can navigate through the customer journey.</p>
<p>Darian Shirazi, general partner at Gradient Ventures, says his firm was attracted to Zowie, in part by its significant revenue traction in a short period of time and the business that the founders are building.</p>
<p>“One of the differentiations we saw when looking at Zowie was that it was the first AI chatbot for e-commerce that generates your knowledge base,” he said. “Others have to provide the knowledge base to answer the questions, and some companies don&#8217;t have time to do that. We’d been looking in the chatbot space, and no one has done it well for e-commerce, which is a massive vertical.”</p>
