										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas flaunted a dangerous ignorance regarding matters digital in an opinion published today. In attempting to explain the legal difficulties of social media platforms, particularly those arising from Twitter&#8217;s ban of Trump, he makes an ill-informed, bordering on bizarre, argument as to why such companies may need their First Amendment rights curtailed.</p>
<p>There are several points on which Thomas seems to willfully misconstrue or misunderstand the issues.</p>
<p>The first is in his characterization of Trump&#8217;s use of Twitter. You may remember that several people sued after being blocked by Trump, alleging that his use of the platform amounted to creating a &#8220;public forum&#8221; in a legal sense, meaning it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/its-unconstitutional-for-trump-to-block-people-on-twitter/">unlawful to exclude anyone from it for political reasons</a>. (The case, as it happens, was rendered moot after its appeal and dismissed by the court except as a Thomas&#8217;s temporary soapbox.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CqUw91dVcf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/">Supreme Court tosses ruling that said Trump blocking Twitter critics was unconstitutional</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Supreme Court tosses ruling that said Trump blocking Twitter critics was unconstitutional&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/embed/#?secret=CqUw91dVcf" data-secret="CqUw91dVcf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;But Mr. Trump, it turned out, had only limited control of the account; Twitter has permanently removed the account from the platform,&#8221; writes Thomas. &#8220;[I]t seems rather odd to say something is a government forum when a private company has unrestricted authority to do away with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Does it? Does it seem odd? Because a few paragraphs later, he uses the example of a government agency using a conference room in a hotel to hold a public hearing. They can&#8217;t kick people out for voicing their political opinions, certainly, because the room is a <em>de facto</em> public forum. But if someone is loud and disruptive, they can ask hotel security to remove that person, because the room is <em>de jure</em> a privately owned space.</p>
<p>Yet the obvious third example, and the one clearly most relevant to the situation at hand, is skipped. What if it is the government representatives who are being loud and disruptive, to the point where the hotel must make the choice whether to remove them?</p>
<p>It says something that this scenario, so remarkably close a metaphor for what actually happened, is not considered. Perhaps it casts the ostensibly &#8220;odd&#8221; situation and actors in too clear a light, for Thomas&#8217;s other arguments suggest he is not for clarity here but for muddying the waters ahead of a partisan knife fight over free speech.</p>
<p>In his best &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying, I&#8217;m just <em>saying</em>&#8221; tone, Thomas presents his reasoning why, if the problem is that these platforms have too much power over free speech, then historically there just happen to be some legal options to limit that power.</p>
<p>Thomas argues first, and worst, that platforms like Facebook and Google may amount to &#8220;common carriers,&#8221; a term that goes back centuries to actual carriers of cargo, but which is now a common legal concept that refers to services that act as simple distribution &#8211; &#8220;bound to serve all customers alike, without discrimination.&#8221; A telephone company is the most common example, in that it cannot and does not choose what connections it makes, nor what conversations happen over those connections &#8211; it moves electric signals from one phone to another.</p>
<p>But as he notes at the outset of his commentary, &#8220;applying old doctrines to new digital platforms is rarely straightforward.&#8221; And Thomas&#8217;s method of doing so is spurious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though digital instead of physical, they are at bottom communications networks, and they &#8216;carry&#8217; information from one user to another,&#8221; he says, and equates telephone companies laying cable with companies like Google laying &#8220;information infrastructure that can be controlled in much the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, this is certainly wrong. So wrong in so many ways that it&#8217;s hard to know where to start and when to stop.</p>
<p>The idea that companies like Facebook and Google are equivalent to telephone lines is such a reach that it seems almost like a joke. These are companies that have built entire business empires by adding enormous amounts of storage, processing, analysis, and other services on top of the element of pure communication. One might as easily suggest that because computers are just a simple piece of hardware that moves data around, that Apple is a common carrier as well. It&#8217;s really not so far a logical leap!</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;FCC Commissioner disparages Trump&#8217;s social media order: &#8216;The decision is ours alone&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/fcc-commissioner-disparages-trumps-social-media-order-the-decision-is-ours-alone/embed/#?secret=RBgY7UsnGo" data-secret="RBgY7UsnGo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There&#8217;s no real need to get into the technical and legal reasons why this opinion is wrong, however, because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/commission-impossible-how-and-why-the-fcc-created-net-neutrality/">these grounds have been covered so extensively over the years</a>, particularly by the FCC — which the Supreme Court has deferred to as an expert agency on this matter. If Facebook were a common carrier (or telecommunications service), it would fall under the FCC&#8217;s jurisdiction — but it doesn&#8217;t, because it isn&#8217;t, and really, no one thinks it is. This has been supported over and over, by multiple FCCs and administrations, and the deferral is itself a Supreme Court precedent that has become doctrine.</p>
<p>In fact, and this is really the cherry on top, freshman Justice Kavanaugh in a truly stupefying legal opinion a few years ago argued so far in the other direction that it became wrong in a totally different way! It was Kavanaugh&#8217;s considered opinion that the bar for qualifying as a common carrier was actually so high that even broadband providers don&#8217;t qualify for it (This was all in service of taking down net neutrality, a saga we are in danger of resuming soon). As his erudite colleague Judge Srinivasan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-brutal-education-in-net-neutrality/">explained to him at the time</a>, this approach too is embarrassingly wrong.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9ZNWuu2sUo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-brutal-education-in-net-neutrality/">Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh&#8217;s brutal education in net neutrality</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh&#8217;s brutal education in net neutrality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-brutal-education-in-net-neutrality/embed/#?secret=9ZNWuu2sUo" data-secret="9ZNWuu2sUo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Looking at these two opinions, of two sitting conservative Supreme Court Justices, you may find the arguments strangely at odds, yet they are wrong after a common fashion.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh claims that broadband providers, the plainest form of digital common carrier conceivable, are in fact providing all kinds sophisticated services over and above their functionality as a pipe (they aren&#8217;t). Thomas claims that companies actually providing all kinds of sophisticated services are nothing more than pipes.</p>
<p>Simply stated, these men have no regard for the facts but have chosen the definition that best suits their political purposes: for Kavanaugh, thwarting a Democrat-led push for strong net neutrality rules; for Thomas, asserting control over social media companies perceived as having an anti-conservative bias.</p>
<p>The case Thomas uses for his sounding board on these topics was rightly rendered moot — Trump is no longer president and the account no longer exists — but he makes it clear that he regrets this extremely.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Twitter made clear, the right to cut off speech lies most powerfully in the hands of private digital platforms,&#8221; he concludes. &#8220;The extent to which that power matters for purposes of the First Amendment and the extent to which that power could lawfully be modified raise interesting and important questions. This petition, unfortunately, affords us no opportunity to confront them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Between the common carrier argument and questioning the form of Section 230 (of which in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/supreme-court-trump-clarence-thomas/">this article</a>), Thomas&#8217;s hypotheticals break the seals on several legal avenues to restrict First Amendment rights of digital platforms, as well as legitimizing those (largely on one side of the political spectrum) who claim a grievance along these lines. (Slate legal commentator Mark Joseph Stern, who spotted the opinion early, goes further, calling Thomas&#8217;s argument <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/04/clarence-thomas-social-media-first-amendment-censorship.html">a &#8220;paranoid Marxist delusion&#8221;</a> and providing some other interesting context.)</p>
<p>This is not to say that social media and tech do not deserve scrutiny on any number of fronts — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/who-regulates-social-media/">they exist in an alarming global vacuum of regulatory powers</a>, and hardly anyone would suggest they have been entirely responsible with this freedom. But the arguments of Thomas and Kavanaugh stink of cynical partisan sophistry. This endorsement by Thomas amounts accomplishes nothing legally, but will provide valuable fuel for the bitter fires of contention — though they hardly needed it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last year, Amazon fired Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa. The pair of employees had been among the company’s most outspoken critics on staff, openly taking Amazon to task for environmental and labor issues.</p>
<p>This week, the National Labor Relations Board determined that the pair’s firing was an illegal form of retaliation. Speaking with The New York Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html">Cunningham noted</a> that the board would issue a more public criticism of Amazon’s action if the company does not take steps to address the issue.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Amazon for comment, but has yet to hear back. Cunningham, meanwhile, called the decision a “moral victory.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Following last year’s firing, Amazon told TechCrunch that the decision was not a direct result of the pair’s criticism, but rather a product of other, unstated polices. “We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions,” a spokesperson said at the time, “but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies. We terminated these employees for repeatedly violating internal policies.”</p>

<p>The news came amid widescale ramp-ups as Amazon was declared an essential service while COVID-19 bore down on the U.S. in April. Two weeks prior, the company opened a massive fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, which has become the focal point of yet another labor battle for the online retail giant.</p>
<p>The warehouse is currently ground zero for the largest unionizing effort in the company’s history. The National Labor Relations Board is tasked with ballot counting, which kicked off on Tuesday of last week. In the final days of voting, the company made an aggressive social media push against union allies, though it has since walked it back some, including a soft apology for comments surrounding reports that employees regularly pee in bottles to meet stringent quotas.</p>
<p>In addition to its rulings on Cunningham and Costa, the NLRB has also found for Amazonians United co-founder, Jonathan Bailey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A grand jury has indicted a California resident accused of stealing Shopify customer data on over a hundred merchants, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20580321-us-grand-jury-indictment-tassilo-heinrich">indictment</a> charges Tassilo Heinrich with aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit wire fraud by allegedly working with two Shopify customer support agents to steal merchant and customer data from Shopify customers to gain a competitive edge and &#8220;take business away from those merchants,&#8221; the indictment reads. The indictment also accuses Heinrich, believed to be around 18-years-old at the time of the alleged scheme, of selling the data to other co-conspirators to commit fraud.</p>
<p>A person with direct knowledge of the security breach confirmed Shopify was the unnamed victim company referenced <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20580321-us-grand-jury-indictment-tassilo-heinrich">in the indictment</a>.</p>
<p>Last September, Shopify, an online e-commerce platform for small businesses, revealed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/shopify-data-merchant-breach/">a data breach</a> in which two &#8220;rogue members&#8221; of its third-party customer support team of &#8220;less than 200 merchants.&#8221; Shopify said it fired the two contractors for engaging &#8220;in a scheme to obtain customer transactional records of certain merchants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shopify said the contractors <a href="https://community.shopify.com/c/Shopify-Discussion/Incident-Update/m-p/888971/highlight/true#M197487">stole customer data</a>, including names, postal addresses and order details, like which products and services were purchased. One merchant who received the data breach notice from Shopify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/shopify-data-merchant-breach/">said</a> the last four digits of affected customers&#8217; payment cards were also taken, which the indictment confirms.</p>
<p>Another one of the victims was Kylie Jenner&#8217;s cosmetics and make-up company, Kylie Cosmetics, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54354526">the BBC reported</a>.</p>
<p>The indictment accuses Heinrich of paying an employee of a third-party customer support company in the Philippines to access parts of Shopify&#8217;s internal network by either taking screenshots or uploading the data to Google Drive in exchange for kickbacks. Heinrich paid the employee in thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency, and also fake positive reviews claiming to be from merchants to whom the employee had provided customer service but had not left feedback. The indictment alleges that Heinrich received a year&#8217;s worth of some merchants&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Heinrich allegedly spent at least a year siphoning off incrementing amounts of data from Shopify&#8217;s internal network, at one point asking if he could &#8220;remotely access&#8221; the customer support employee&#8217;s computer while they were asleep.</p>
<p>Heinrich was arrested by the FBI at Los Angeles International Airport in February,and is currently detained in federal custody pending trial, set to begin on September 7. Heinrich has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>A Shopify spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">As consumers build their wealth, assets are typically tangible: cash, investments, property, cars, jewelry, art. But increasingly we’re adding a new type of asset to the mix: digital assets, whether in the form of cryptocurrency or a new asset class, NFTs.</p>
<p>We’re going through the biggest wealth transfer in history right now, with an estimated $16 trillion <a href="https://www.wealthx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WealthX_NFP_FamilyWealthTransfersReport-2014.pdf">expected to change hands</a> in the coming decades. While it’s easy to hand over the reins of a physical asset in the event of an emergency or death, it’s not as simple with digital assets.</p>
<p>A new Angus Reid study commissioned by Canadian online will platform <a href="https://www.willful.co/">Willful</a> finds that only one in four consumers have someone in their life who knows all of their passwords and account details, which begs the question: Will consumers be prepared to pass on digital assets, or will billions in virtual goods be stuck in the digital ether?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

			While it’s easy to hand over the reins of a physical asset in the event of an emergency or death, it’s not as simple with digital assets.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Digital assets have been dominating the news cycle in 2021. While cryptocurrency isn’t new, it’s attracted a lot of attention in the past year because of its skyrocketing value, promotion from prominent figures like billionaire Elon Musk, and bitcoin offerings from traditional financial firms like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/bitcoin-morgan-stanley-is-the-first-big-us-bank-to-offer-wealthy-clients-access-to-bitcoin-funds.html">Morgan Stanley</a>. If you hold any type of cryptocurrency, the only way to access it is via a private key &#8212; typically a 64-digit passcode. No private key, no access to the virtual currency.</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html">many stories reported</a> about people who purchased bitcoin and would be millionaires today if they hadn’t thrown out their hard drive or lost track of their key. One high-profile case is that of Gerald Cotten, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/the-strange-tale-of-quadriga-gerald-cotten">Quadriga</a>. When Cotten died in 2018, he took with him the private keys to over $250 million in client assets.</p>
<p>Consumers have also been inundated with stories about NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which are digital assets hosted on the same blockchain that makes cryptocurrency possible. To most, it seems absurd that artist Beeple could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">sell a $69 million piece of art </a>through a Christie’s auction, or that a virtual home in Toronto could <a href="https://www.blogto.com/tech/2021/03/toronto-digital-house-nft-600k/">sell for over $600,000</a>, or that people would spend over $200 million <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html">trading virtual NBA highlights</a> like we used to trade baseball cards. But this new asset class is proving that digital assets can be as valuable if not more valuable than physical assets &#8212; and similar to cryptocurrency, they likely require a private key to access them.</p>
<p>When someone dies, they either have a will that dictates how their assets will be distributed, or, if they die without a will, a government formula outlines how their assets will be divided. While a will outlines who should receive what, it typically doesn’t have an up-to-date asset list, nor does it contain passwords or access keys. There’s an estimated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/your-money/unclaimed-assets.html">tens of billions in unclaimed assets</a> sitting in banks today as a result of a family or executor not knowing about those accounts following an individual’s death.</p>
<p>But an executor can do due diligence by calling financial institutions to double-check whether the person held accounts and get access to those funds, which typically requires providing copies of the will and/or death certificate. With digital assets, it’s not as simple as calling the bank and finding out a relative had a valuable NFT. There’s no directory or central body that governs NFTs or cryptocurrency &#8212; it’s purposely decentralized, which is great for privacy but less than ideal for family members who want to figure out if someone held valuable digital assets.</p>
<p>And it’s not just about knowing digital assets exist &#8212; it’s about knowing how to access them. A recent study from the Angus Reid Forum, commissioned by Willful, showed that consumers under 35 are way less likely to have shared account access with loved ones (19% of those under 35 have shared account info, compared with 32% of those over 55). This makes sense, since the younger you are, the less likely you are to think about passing on assets after you die. But this tech-savvy younger demographic may leave their families in the lurch if something happens.</p>
<p>So what can consumers do to ensure their digital assets are protected? First, consider using a password manager like 1Password &#8212; which can store all of your account information, logins, private keys to digital assets and any other key information &#8212; and share the master access password with your executor or store it with your will.</p>
<p>While this can ensure easy access to your accounts in an emergency, Lee Poskanzer, the founder of <a href="https://www.directivecommunications.com/">Directive Communication Systems</a>, says it can also put your family or executors at risk, highlighting that in many cases, website and app owners explicitly prohibit password sharing in their terms of service, and privacy laws in some jurisdictions prohibit account holder impersonation (in the U.S., that’s covered by the Stored Communications and Electronic Communications Privacy Act). Not to mention, accounts increasingly require two-factor authentication, which may not be easy to confirm if executors don’t have access to the person’s smartphone.</p>
<p>Directive Communication Systems’ platform helps manage the transfer of digital assets upon death, and Poskanzer says they don’t collect passwords for this reason. Instead, they work with the estate to provide content providers (Google, social media platforms, etc.) with required documentation, which can include a death certificate, obituary, ID or other documents. Upon meeting those requirements, which vary by company, content providers provide a data dump of an account’s contents, making them available via the cloud.</p>
<p>Second, consider using a digital wallet or exchange to store your digital assets &#8212; if your family has access to that, it may also include access to your private keys, depending on the wallet&#8217;s features, or the exchange itself may have a death-management process.</p>
<p>For example, Coinbase <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/managing-my-account/other/how-do-i-gain-access-to-a-deceased-family-members-coinbase-account">clearly outlines </a>what an executor or family member can do to retrieve digital assets in case of the death of the account holder. As a backup, you can store your private key on a physical piece of paper and ensure it’s stored in a safe deposit box, fireproof safe or other safe place your executor can access in the event of your passing.</p>
<p>Third, create an up-to-date list of your assets that your <a href="https://www.willful.co/learn/what-is-an-executor-and-how-do-i-choose-one">executor</a> and/or key family members have access to &#8212; this should include physical and digital assets, and should be reviewed and updated either annually or when you acquire a new asset or change financial institutions. Finally, <a href="https://www.willful.co/">create a will</a> that clearly outlines how you want your assets to be distributed and provide specific instructions on how you want digital assets to be distributed.</p>
<p>Not only is this best practice to protect your assets of any kind and to appoint key roles like guardians for minor children, it will also likely be required in order to release any account contents (for example, Coinbase requires a copy of the will as part of its process to release funds to an estate).</p>
<p>As we go through this major wealth transfer between generations, it’s likely that banks, fintechs, crypto exchanges, social media platforms and other content providers will create clear death-management processes that make it easier to alert people about digital assets before you die and provide easy access instructions. But until that happens, following these steps means you can ensure your assets go to the people or organizations you want them to &#8212; and that they won’t be stuck in digital purgatory.</p>

The Supreme Court weighed in on Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/oracle-v-google/">long legal battle with Oracle</a> on Monday, overturning a prior victory for the latter company that could have resulted in an $8 billion award.</p>
<p>In a 6-2 decision, the court ruled that Google didn&#8217;t break copyright laws when it incorporated pieces of Oracle&#8217;s Java software language into its own mobile operating system. Google copied Oracle&#8217;s code for Java APIs for Android, and the case kicked off a yearslong debate over the reuse of established APIs and copyright.</p>
<p>In 2018, a federal appeals court ruled that Google did in fact violate copyright law by using the APIs and that its implementation didn&#8217;t fall under fair use.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;In reviewing that decision, we assume, for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable. But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law,&#8221; Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the decision, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/oracle-wins-appeal-against-google-in-copyright-case/">reverses Oracle&#8217;s previous win</a>. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google’s copying of the Java SE API, which included only those lines of code that were needed to allow programmers to put their accrued talents to work in a new and transformative program, was a fair use of that material as a matter of law,&#8221; Breyer wrote.</p>
<p>Google SVP of Global Affairs Kent Walker called the ruling, embedded below, a &#8220;big win for innovation, interoperability &amp; computing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Houseparty, the social video app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty/">acquired by</a> Fortnite maker Epic Games in 2019, has just <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/stream-your-fortnite-gameplay-to-friends-inside-houseparty">announced</a> a major new step in terms of integrating these two properties: the company says it will now allow gamers to livestream their Fortnite gameplay directly into Houseparty. The feature works to allow users to share their gameplay with up to nine other friends in a Houseparty room.</p>
<p>The addition follows Houseparty&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/houseparty-adds-fortnite-mode-bringing-video-chat-to-the-popular-game/">launch of a &#8220;Fortnite Mode&#8221;</a> last November, which added a video chat feature to Fortnite where players could see live feeds from their friends while gaming, powered by Houseparty. Today&#8217;s launch is something of a reverse of that, as it lets players stream the game to friends, which is viewable inside Houseparty itself. This allows the users&#8217; friends &#8212; including those who may not be Fortnite gamers themselves &#8212; to watch and and interact with the player.</p>
<p>To use the new feature, the Fortnite player will need to have enabled Fortnite Mode Streaming and be connected to Houseparty. When they begin to stream their gameplay, their friends on Houseparty will be notified that their game feeds are now available to watch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Fortnite player can then see who is watching their stream via a graphic overlaid on their screen which shows their &#8220;watcher count.&#8221; This is represented by a little eye icon in the middle-left of the screen for the gamer, while Houseparty users will see the eye icon in the top-left of their video screen.</p>
<p>During the livestream, the player and their friends can watch and chat, as usual.</p>
<p>If the Fortnite player doesn&#8217;t want to livestream their gameplay, they can change this at any time from a setting inside Fortnite without losing their ability to use the video chat feature. Parents and guardians can also turn on and off Fortnite Mode and other privacy features inside Fortnite&#8217;s settings. The company notes that personal info will be blocked from streams, including payments information. However, The Lobby, your menus and your gameplay can all be streamed when Fortnite Mode is enabled.</p>
<p>Houseparty first gained traction as a way for friends to virtually &#8220;hang out&#8221; online through video chat, but ultimately sold to Epic Games shortly after the gaming giant raised a massive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/26/epic-games-the-creator-of-fortnite-raises-1-25-billion/">$1.25 billion round</a>. So far, Houseparty hasn&#8217;t given up on its other social features, even as it has become more closely integrated with Fortnite. The launch of the new feature creates potential for Houseparty to capture some of the more casual livestreaming that today takes place on other platforms, like Twitch, Facebook or YouTube, where users aren&#8217;t necessarily streaming for fans, but rather for friends.</p>
<p>The company says the new feature won&#8217;t offer a record function for later exporting these livestreams for publishing elsewhere, but notes that Fortnite already allows the ability to save replays.</p>
<p>At launch, Fortnite gameplay integration with Houseparty is available across PC and PlayStation only (PS4 and PS5). Epic Games didn&#8217;t say if or when other platforms would be supported. Houseparty users on iOS, Android and Chrome will be able to watch the livestreams.</p>
<p>The previously launched video chat feature in Fortnite was also supported on PCs and PlayStations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Supreme Court has vacated a previous ruling that found former President Trump violated the First Amendment by blocking his Twitter foes.</p>
<p>The ruling was upheld by a Manhattan federal appeals court in 2019, which deemed Trump&#8217;s actions unconstitutional. The court found that because Trump used Twitter to &#8220;conduct official business&#8221; and interact with the public that his decision to block users ran afoul of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; The First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees,&#8221; a <a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/documents/a07ecc2a26">trio of judges wrote in that decision</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision to vacate the prior ruling isn&#8217;t a total surprise — Trump is no longer president and he&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">banned from Twitter for life at this point</a>.</p>
<p>What was unexpected was an accompanying opinion issued by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas which pushed well beyond the issue at hand into novel criticisms of major tech platforms.</p>

<p>Thomas pivoted away from Trump&#8217;s Twitter behavior in the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040521zor_3204.pdf">12-page opinion</a>, mounting an argument that the moderation powers of digital platforms like Twitter and Facebook are the real problem. &#8220;If the aim is to ensure that speech is not smothered, then the more glaring concern must perforce be the dominant digital platforms themselves,&#8221; Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>He went on to raise concerns about &#8220;concentrated control&#8221; of digital platforms by a handful of decision makers, arguing that digital platforms exercise too much power in making moderation decisions. &#8220;Much like with a communications utility, this concentration gives some digital platforms enormous control over speech,&#8221; Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>Thomas&#8217;s opinion Monday echoed <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/101320zor_8m58.pdf">his previous arguments</a> that the protections conferred to digital platforms by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act should be &#8220;pared back&#8221; and interpreted far more narrowly.</p>
<p>With Democrats at the wheel in Congress, some Republicans have shifted their criticisms of big tech away from its moderation powers and toward other issues, like how those services affect mental health. But the suite of grievances stirred up over the course of Trump&#8217;s four years in office lives on in Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.</p>
<p>In January, Thomas&#8217;s wife Ginni Thomas, a fervent Trump supporter, faced criticism for <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/ginni-thomas-donald-trump-clarence-thomas-capitol-riot.html">cheering on the pro-Trump crowd</a> that went on to violently invade the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Thomas was not joined by other justices in his opinion, but his interest in tech&#8217;s moderation decisions is a signal that the issue is far from dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will soon have no choice but to address how our legal doctrines apply to highly concentrated, privately owned information infrastructure such as digital platforms,&#8221; he warned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Among other technology trends accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of contactless mobile payments boomed in 2020. According to a <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-payment-users-will-surpass-100-million-this-year?ecid=NL1016">recent report</a> by analyst firm eMarketer, in-store mobile payments usage grew 29% last year in the U.S., as the pandemic pushed consumers to swap out cash and credit cards for the presumably safer mobile payments option at point-of-sale.</p>
<p>Last year, 92.3 million U.S. consumers age 14 or older used proximity-based mobile payments at least one time during a six-month period in 2020 &#8212; a figure the firm expects to grow to reach 101.2 million this year. And that usage is now on track to surpass half of all smartphone users by 2025, eMarketer forecasts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134065" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134065" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134065" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264707.png?w=470" alt="" width="470" height="457" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264707.png 470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264707.png?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264707.png?resize=300,292 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264707.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264707.png?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134065" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> eMarketer</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Adoption last year was largest among younger consumers, including Gen Z and millennials. The former is expected to account for more than 4 million of the total 6.5 million new mobile wallet users per year from 2021 to 2025. Millennials, meanwhile, will continue to account for around four in 10 mobile wallet users.</p>
<p>Several industry reports had already noted the pandemic impacts on the mobile wallet industry in general, with one from <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/mobile-wallet-industry-to-reach-35-trillion-by-2023-report/596621/">earlier this month</a> by finance and investment company Finaria estimating that the industry would grow 24% from last year to reach $2.4 trillion in 2021. It had said that while Asian markets and particularly China had been leading the way in mobile payments adoption, the U.S. had earlier struggled due to the slow rollout of mobile payment technologies by retail stores. But now, the U.S.<a href="https://www.finaria.it/pr/mobile-wallets-to-become-3-5t-worth-industry-by-2023/"> has grown to</a> become the second-largest market with $465.1 billion worth of mobile payment transactions, which will grow to $698 billion in 2023.</p>
<p>The pandemic had pushed lagging retailers to finally get on board with mobile payments. A mid-year <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/coronavirus-leads-more-use-contactless-credit-cards-and-mobile-payments">survey</a> published in 2020 by the National Retail Federation and Forrester found that no-touch payments had increased for 69% of retailers, and that 67% now accept some form of contactless payment, including both mobile payments and contactless cards.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2134063" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2134063" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2134063" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264709.png?w=470" alt="" width="470" height="516" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264709.png 470w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264709.png?resize=137,150 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264709.png?resize=273,300 273w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/264709.png?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2134063" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> eMarketer</p></div></p>
<p>As a result of the industry changes, eMarketer reports that not only has mobile wallet usage increased, the average annual spend per user is increasing, as well. The firm predicts that figure will grow 23.6% from ~$1,973.70 in 2020 to $2,439.68 in 2021, and will surpass $3,000 by 2023.</p>

<p>In the U.S., Apple Pay remains the top mobile payment player, with 43.9 million users in 2021, growing by 14.4 million between 2020 and 2025 &#8212; more than its competitors. Starbucks will remain the No. 2 player with 31.2 million users, followed by Google Pay, which will add 10.2 million users during that time frame. Samsung Pay, meanwhile, is seeing stagnant growth, adding just 2 million more users between 2020 and 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It appears that the slowdown in tech debuts is not a complete freeze; despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">concerning news</a> regarding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/as-compass-downsizes-its-ipo-signs-of-weakness-appear-for-high-growth-companies/">the IPO pipeline</a>, some deals are chugging ahead. This morning, we&#8217;re adding Alkami Technology to a list that includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/coinbase-to-direct-list-on-april-14th-provide-financial-update-on-april-6th/">Coinbase&#8217;s impending direct listing</a> and Robinhood&#8217;s expected IPO.</p>

After all, if Kaltura and others are going to hit the brakes, we must turn our attention to companies that are still putting the hammer down.</p>
<p>Frankly, we should have known about Alkami&#8217;s IPO sooner. One of a rising number of large tech companies based in nontraditional areas, the bank-focused software company is based in Texas, despite having <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/business/columns/2020/11/29/column-a-unicorn-in-oklahoma/327536007/">roots in Oklahoma</a>. The company raised $385.2 million during its life, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alkami-technology/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>. That sum includes a September 2020 round worth $140 million that valued the company at $1.44 billion on a post-money basis, PitchBook reports.</p>
<p>So, into the latest SEC filing from the software unicorn we go!</p>
<h2>Alkami Technology</h2>
<p>Alkami Technology is a software company that delivers its product to banks via the cloud, so it&#8217;s not a legacy player scraping together an IPO during boom times. Instead, it is the sort of company that we understand; it&#8217;s built on top of AWS and charges for its services on a recurring basis.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s core market is all banks smaller than the largest, it appears, or what Alkami calls &#8220;community, regional and super-regional financial institutions.&#8221; Its service is a software layer that plugs into existing financial systems while also providing a number of user interface options.</p>
<p>In short, it takes a bank from its internal systems all the way to the end-user experience. Here&#8217;s how Alkami explained it in its S-1/A filing:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, we covered the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/a-look-at-how-proptech-startup-knotel-went-from-a-1-6b-valuation-to-filing-for-bankruptcy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of flexible workspace operator Knotel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The once high-flying startup had just announced it had filed for bankruptcy and that its assets were </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newmark-to-acquire-assets-of-knotel-301218584.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by investor and commercial real estate brokerage Newmark for</span><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/knotel-approved-to-borrow-initial-30-million-on-bankruptcy-loan"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a reported $70 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a hard fall for a company that just one year prior had been valued at $1.6 billion.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was hard to pinpoint exactly the beginning of the end for Knotel, which had raised about $560 million in funding. Some said the pandemic was the nail in Knotel’s coffin, while others pointed out the proptech was already in trouble before the pandemic hit, facing a number of lawsuits and evictions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then this past weekend, Knotel co-founder Amol Sarva shed some more light on the situation &#8212; essentially publicly trashing Newmark, which had co-led the startup’s $70 million Series B in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter that he emailed to an unspecified group of people, Sarva points out that the company had reached “nearly $400mm of run rate in early 2020, posted gross profit, and even kept more than 2/3 of revenue intact while doing everything we could to support customer continuity and work with landlord partners amicably.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to describe Newmark as “a stalking horse” that used bankruptcy to take control of Knotel with around $100 million of new capital. That process, he said, undermined important relationships and “hurt lots of customers and partners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m so disappointed that this was the direction pressed. The process made clear to me that I would not choose to be part of the new owners&#8217; way of moving forward,” Sarva continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He further criticized Newmark, saying the brokerage has hired “a group of Adam Neuman-era [sic] WeWork bros to lead the company forward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newmark had not yet responded to a request for comment at the time of writing. While it&#8217;s safe to say that Sarva is bitter about the way things turned out, it would be interesting to know exactly at what point he came to this conclusion.</span></p>
<p>He did say that he&#8217;s heading back to the lab where <span class="il">Knotel</span> was invented originally, as co-founder/CEO of <a href="https://knote.com/p/ASdFMM/Knotes-on-the-Knotel-Journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://knote.com/p/ASdFMM/Knotes-on-the-Knotel-Journey&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617496754614000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOWqcMkRDUhKHlcYCEez5wJk9Nqw">Knote.</a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[StockX is a unique company at the nexus of two radical transitions that isn’t just redefining markets, but our culture as well.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Societies are defined by their markets. What people value, what they actually buy, how they transact and who they purchase from determine not just the goods in their possession, but the very society and culture they construct. It might seem that after thousands of years of evolution and refinement, concepts like quality, authenticity, value and price would be static. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p><b>StockX</b> is a unique company at the nexus of two radical transitions that isn’t just redefining markets, but our culture as well. E-commerce upended markets, diminishing the physical experience by intermediating and aggregating buyers and sellers through digital platforms. At the same time, the internet created rapid new communication channels, allowing euphoria and desire to ricochet across society in a matter of seconds. In a world of plenty, some things are rare, and the hype around that rarity has never been greater. Together, these two trends demanded a stock market of hype, an opportunity that StockX has aggressively pursued.</p>
<p>It’s a foundational new category of market — and a lucrative one. Now valued at $2.8 billion, StockX has facilitated over 10 million transactions. Its online-only marketplace is used for buying and selling sneakers, streetwear, electronics, collectibles, handbags and watches that are primarily sneaker and streetwear culture-adjacent, are in high demand and only available in low quantities. Sellers post their asking price and buyers share the price they want to pay anonymously. The platform makes all transactional data completely available to anyone that visits the site, and it authenticates every product by hand, acting as a safeguarded, price-regulating middleman.</p>
<p>It’s Amazon, but not exactly. It’s an auction, but not really. It conveys values like a stock market, but unlike the New York Stock Exchange, the company is defined less by financial instruments than its method of connecting buyers and sellers. It’s a local store with vetted products, but online and global. In short, it’s a unique marketplace that requires careful analysis of not just the cultural context it operates in, but the economics and incentives of the players on both sides.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s writer and analyst for this EC-1 is <b>Rae Witte</b>. She has written extensively on technology, business and culture for publications like TechCrunch as well as the Wall Street Journal, Vogue Business and our corporate sister publication Engadget. She’s followed the rise of StockX since nearly its founding, and is in a lead position to tell this nuanced story. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>William E. Ketchum III</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>StockX had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Witte has no financial ties to StockX or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The StockX EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 11,700 words and a reading time of 47 minutes. Let’s take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part 1: Origin story</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-origin/">How StockX became the stock market of hype</a>” (2,500 words/10 minute reading time) — Investigates how StockX evolved from a basic aggregation of price data into the multibillion dollar juggernaut we see today.</li>
<li><b>Part 2: E-commerce authentication</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-authentication/">Authentication and StockX’s global arms race against fraudsters</a>” (3,700 words/15 minute reading time) — A deeply nuanced analysis of StockX’s key product of authentication and the challenges of building a trusted market against an onslaught of scammers heavily incentivized to get a fake good sold.</li>
<li><b>Part 3: Competitive and consumer landscape </b>“<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stocks-ec1-business/">Where StockX fits in the business of sneakers</a>” (2,800 words/11 minute reading time) — Explores how the company connected buyers and sellers, as well as its long-term impact on both groups.</li>
<li><b>Part 4: Future and impact </b>“<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-culture/">The consequences of scaling up sneaker culture</a>” (2,700 words/11 minute reading time) — Looks at how StockX and the changes it has wrought have led to a massive change in the culture of sneakers and what that portends long term.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[StockX may be a multibillion dollar juggernaut with massive influence radiating throughout sneaker culture today, but it started with taking the leap to transforming a personal passion into a business plan.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the old adage goes, “Find a job you love doing, you’ll never work a day in your life,” it’s safe to assume this was well before the age of the YouTuber, “plandids” and the stock market of things. StockX may be a multibillion dollar juggernaut with massive influence radiating throughout sneaker culture today, but it started with taking the leap to transforming a personal passion into a business plan.</p>
<p>For founder Josh Luber, keeping his love for sneakers separate from his career was very intentional at first. As he continued to invest into his hobby, he saw something from his corporate jobs that was altogether missing from sneakers — data. As he established and dove deeper into the numbers, an entirely different vision arose. A basketball game, a check and a business later, StockX was born.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			What began as a basic price chart of online sales that screamed more Microsoft Excel than startup unicorn has now become one of the most intriguing marketplaces in the world.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The timing was remarkably fortuitous. Sneakers crescendoed from a rising niche to a frenzy over the past decade, and the demand for authenticated goods likewise soared. Few other companies put together the core mechanisms required for a market to function effectively for this category. What began as a basic price chart of online sales that screamed more Microsoft Excel than startup unicorn has now become one of the most intriguing marketplaces in the world.</p>
<h2>What’s a sneaker worth?</h2>
<p>Before co-founding StockX, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/01/31/how-stockx-built-a-1-billion-sneaker-resale-empire.html">Josh Luber was consulting at IBM</a>, deliberately working outside of sneakers to maintain it strictly as a hobby. That setup continued until he realized the opportunity to organize data around his beloved collection.</p>
<p>Markets can’t exist without prices, and the price of a sneaker in the secondary market a decade ago was difficult to discern. There was, of course, the retail price, but popular sneakers often gained value over time based on demand, which could wildly fluctuate over time. By scraping data openly available on <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/sneakerheads-doing-analytics-athletic-shoe-enthusiasts/">eBay for over 13 million transactions</a>, Luber and a team of 17 volunteers established Campless, a constantly updated sneaker secondary market pricing guide that launched in 2012.</p>
<p>“While it had a lot of flaws in it and required a lot of manual work, it gave probably the best reference point at the time,” COO and co-founder of StockX Greg Schwartz says. The Campless team was simply pulling prices from closed eBay auctions and analyzing trends from there, much like any individual seller would probably do before posting their own shoes. By scaling up the size of the dataset though, they were getting much more accurate market-clearing prices than were previously available for both buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>Similar to the auto industry’s Kelley Blue Book that offers estimated values for cars by model and year, Campless offered in-depth numbers on the secondary sneaker market that would eventually become a tentpole and proprietary offering of StockX.</p>
<h2>Helicopters over malls and the chaotic rise of the sneaker craze</h2>
<p>When Luber and his team launched Campless, there weren’t easily accessible options for buying sneakers in limited releases. Enthusiasts could buy directly from the retailer by lining up and camping out for in-store drops, scour eBay for the most legit-looking seller with the best price, or have a plug or backdoor avenue to get their prized pairs. All three options were fraught.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1491486" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1491486" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1491486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_1370.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_1370.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_1370.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_1370.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_1370.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_1370.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_1370.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/img_1370.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1491486" class="wp-caption-text">Josh Luber at TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2017.</p></div></p>
<p>Campless’ name and “know more, camp less” tagline referred to consumers camping out — sometimes spending days in line — for the latest, most coveted sneaker releases. Flight Club, which opened in New York City in 2005, was initially for consignment and typically carried rare, older shoes rather than new pairs. For individual resellers though, eBay and Craigslist were the only options to set up a one-on-one transaction at their own discretion, and neither platform had the necessary safeguards for sneaker authentication or price regulation.</p>
<p>This fractured system might have been sufficient for a market that remained a relatively small niche. But it had been steadily growing in popularity since the 1980s, and the scale got even bigger in the 2010s.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/sneakerheads-doing-analytics-athletic-shoe-enthusiasts/">In a 2014 interview with eBay</a>, Luber shared the significance of this period, pointing to one shoe as causing a sea change in the popularity of the category: the February 2012 NBA All-Star Weekend release of Nike’s &#8220;Galaxy&#8221; Foamposite, part of a celestial-themed pack worn by basketball greats like LeBron James, Penny Hardaway, Amar&#8217;e Stoudemire and Kevin Durant.</p>
<p>Trusted sneaker blog <a href="https://solecollector.com/news/2012/09/a-look-back-at-the-galaxy-footwear-collection-by-nike">Sole Collector called this specific release</a> “one of the most chaotic sneaker releases of the last decade” because it caused “riots nationwide as sneakerheads tried desperately to get their hands on pairs.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2133944" style="width: 456px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133944" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2133944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MJ2012_original.jpg?w=446" alt="" width="446" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MJ2012_original.jpg 1969w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MJ2012_original.jpg?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MJ2012_original.jpg?resize=197,300 197w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MJ2012_original.jpg?resize=768,1170 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MJ2012_original.jpg?resize=446,680 446w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MJ2012_original.jpg?resize=1008,1536 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MJ2012_original.jpg?resize=1344,2048 1344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MJ2012_original.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133944" class="wp-caption-text">Michael Jordan attends Jordan All-Star With Fabolous 23 in 2012. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nike (Alexander Tamargo/WireImage)</p></div></p>
<p>“That was definitely the first time I remembered people other than my group of friends that loved shoes talking about a ‘drop,’” 24-year-old sneaker enthusiast Mark Sabino said.</p>
<p>Andy Oliver, director of e-commerce at the sneaker and streetwear lifestyle brand Kith, looks back on it as a tipping point as well. “I think it was a combination of the right model — Foams were super hot — with a graphics treatment that was really unique at the time. Then, from a marketing perspective, it’s tied to All-Star Weekend, which was a huge deal in 2012. When everyone started to get a sense that they were mostly unattainable, they blew up on another level.”</p>
<p>Brendan Dunne, co-host of <a href="https://www.complex.com/video/full-size-run-show">Complex Media’s sneaker show Full Size Run</a>, said the release set a new benchmark for chaos and hype. “I think the image of helicopters flying over the mall in Orlando where they released is the enduring image.”</p>
<p>A community that had been around since the 1980s was hurtled into the mainstream eye. Yet even more fuel was added to what Luber called “limited edition sneaker collecting” with the growing popularity of Instagram. For the first time, sneaker enthusiasts could share their favorites with the entire world, showing off their rare finds to potentially millions of people on their feeds and not just their friends in person. Securing that All-Star Weekend drop meant not just being cool, but globally cool, intensifying the pressure on a market that was completely unprepared for the scale of demand that was arriving.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In this part of the EC-1, we’ll explore how authentication got started at StockX and how it has grown, as well as what it takes to compete with the fakes — and the fallout when the company gets a decision wrong.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we saw in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-origin/">part one of this EC-1</a>, sneakers have evolved from an enthusiast community of collectors into a global multibillion dollar business, in part due to StockX’s influence over this burgeoning market. Individual pairs can sell for well over $100,000, and as sneakers have gone from cultural symbol to cultural asset, they have increasingly become the target for criminal groups looking to make a quick buck from counterfeits.</p>
<p>StockX is fighting an arms race against international criminals who can make a killing if they can get a fake through its authentication processes. Every year, StockX improves its practices, and every year, its opponents sharpen their skills, getting just one more detail right. Sneaker fraud is big business: <a href="https://robbreport.com/style/footwear/u-s-customs-agents-seized-32-million-fake-goods-sneakers-1234587792/">The feds seized tens of millions of dollars in fake shoes last year in just one haul</a>. By some estimates, the sneaker fake goods market is growing and is now well into the nine figure range.</p>
<p>As the key to the community’s trust and the company’s international expansion, StockX reveres themselves most on the constantly evolving process of authentication. Yet even with all its resources and skill, it can’t always get it 100% right.</p>

<p>In this part of the EC-1, we’ll explore how authentication got started at StockX and how it has grown, as well as what it takes to compete with the fakes — and the fallout when the company gets a decision wrong.</p>
<h2>“It was a crazy feeling — the worst.”</h2>
<p>Longtime sneaker collector and newish sneaker YouTuber Blake Yarbrough always wanted Nike’s Tom Sachs Mars Yard sneakers. The 2012 extra exclusive release features Vectran fabric from the airbags on the actual Mars Excursion rover. However, as a one-time manager at FinishLine, he couldn’t see himself spending more than retail on sneakers.</p>
<p>“The original pair from 2012 is the one I really wanted and still want, but they&#8217;re just so much more money. When the 2.0 came out in 2017 I was like, they changed the materials and whatever, the color is a little bit different, but I still love it.”</p>

<p>He picked up a pair for $1,650 — the most he’d ever spent on shoes at the time — from StockX in 2018 and wore them often and carefully, even removing the insoles and replacing them with other inserts so as not to wear off the insole graphics. The Tom Sachs Nike box has a quote that says, “These shoes are only valid if worn, and worn to death, by you. Poser need not apply.” Unlike some sneaker collectors or resellers who keep their shoes “deadstocked” or unworn, Yarbrough took that message to heart.</p>
<p>By the end of 2020 the resale value of his sneakers had significantly increased, ranging from $2,400 to $4,500. Yarbrough decided it was time to part ways with the shoes. They had a good run and he wanted to make some money to put toward other things. He posted the used pair on StockX-competitor <a href="https://www.goat.com/">GOAT</a> for $3,000 and quickly received an offer for $2,600. Pleased with this number, he packaged them up in the original box along with a booklet that came with the shoes and sent them to GOAT to be authenticated and sent to the purchaser.</p>
<p>Yarbrough received an email saying the shoes would not be accepted, the transaction would not go through and that they were fakes. “It was a crazy feeling — the worst.” Yarbrough recalls it derailing his entire day and taking about two weeks to decide what to do about it.</p>
<p>“To open that email, see that it said that they are replicas, and know, essentially, that I&#8217;m stuck with these shoes, and I&#8217;m out this amount of money is a really terrible feeling. It was something I haven&#8217;t ever really felt before, like getting scammed,” he says.</p>
<h2>The dream and nightmare of Black Friday</h2>
<p>Before we continue with Yarbrough, let’s rewind the clock a few years back to the genesis of StockX. Sadelle Moore recalls the early days when he’d be sitting around the StockX Detroit headquarters waiting for sneakers to arrive. The brand launched with four dedicated authenticators in 2016, and he joined pre-launch during beta testing.</p>
<p>“Early on we were getting 10 boxes a day and didn’t have a set process. We’d wait for UPS to come with our orders and each have to make our own boxes. It was just me and a couple other guys, and it took us all a day to go through 10 shoes. It was such a long process,” Moore recalls.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2133684" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133684" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2133684" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Delle_Authentication.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Delle_Authentication.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Delle_Authentication.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Delle_Authentication.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Delle_Authentication.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Delle_Authentication.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Delle_Authentication.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Delle_Authentication.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Delle_Authentication.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133684" class="wp-caption-text">Sadelle Moore was one of the first authenticators to join StockX. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> StockX</p></div></p>
<p>As an early-stage company, processes were vague. “We’d have to fulfill our own orders as authenticators then. Once I authenticated the shoe, I’d put it right back in the box and I just may have to ship it right out, and that would take all day,” he said.</p>
<p>COO Greg Schwartz points to StockX’s first Black Friday in November 2016 as a particularly pivotal day in the company’s transformative early years. “We all went from sitting behind a computer or traveling or whatever anyone was doing at the time to literally everyone working in that authentication center — which was really just the basement of the building we were in — as boxes were piling up. UPS was unable to even deliver them all because it exceeded the loading dock capacity.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[E-commerce startups and tech companies have sprouted up to target this connected cultural consumer, and StockX has had to run quickly to maintain its product and marketplace lead.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before StockX, sneaker buyers had eBay, campouts at sneaker stores and internet forums as avenues to connect with other enthusiasts and find the most desired shoes. Five years later, the data-based secondary marketplace’s impact is pervasive across tech, secondary marketplaces, the business of sneakers, entrepreneurship, hype culture or even just retail stores as a whole.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Instagram brought sneaker culture to the masses, and so timing was on StockX’s side for its 2015 launch, specifically with their focus on hype footwear just as it catapulted into the mainstream.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The company’s timing was keen, riding the wave of Instagram’s rise while bringing a marketplace mechanism to the surging popularity of this category. Yet, StockX is not alone in targeting this increasingly lucrative sector. E-commerce startups and tech companies have sprouted up to target this connected cultural consumer, and StockX has had to run quickly to maintain its product and marketplace lead. Meanwhile, external changes can have large effects on the prices of sneakers and Gen Z is increasingly determining the future of this market. It’s a fast-moving business, and how StockX leads and competes is critical to understanding its future.</p>
<h2>Sneaker culture filtered by Instagram</h2>
<p>While sneaker culture had long been vibrant, Instagram and social media allowed worldwide access to subcultures like sneakers and streetwear and ushered them into the mainstream. Sneaker conversations and communities that were once hosted in online forums like NikeTalk, Reddit and <a href="https://twitter.com/kicksonfire">Kicks On Fire’s Twitter feed</a> began to spill over onto Instagram around 2013 as the platform grew.</p>
<p>“A scroll through Instagram in the morning — depending on what the algorithm gives you and who you&#8217;re following — without reading a single word can give you a peek into what&#8217;s happening, and in this case, it&#8217;s what’s happening within the global sneaker community, which Instagram not only brought together, [but] in a sense, created,” sneaker journalist Russ Bengtson mused.</p>
<p>He goes on to say how it amplified the community around sneaker stores as well. “Before Instagram, maybe you only heard someone with a job there or of someone who actually had a pair of the shoes, but now, without ever going into the city where the shop is based, you can see what that shop has on its shelves, you can see the outside of the shop, you can actually talk to the people who run it or the people who design things for it. You can be a more integrated part of that community without leaving your house.”</p>
<p>Instagram brought sneaker culture to the masses, and so timing was on StockX’s side for its 2015 launch, specifically with their focus on hype footwear just as it catapulted into the mainstream. The company offered the easiest entry point for outsiders to purchase with its bid/ask format, its one-click buying and selling as well as its authentication procedures. With each purchase, outsiders who knew little about the sneaker market became that much closer to belonging to a culture that had previously set such high barriers to entry.</p>
<p>StockX is to hype trends as Instagram is to popularity. The “best” product doesn’t necessarily reflect the highest price point. Instead, it’s representative of the most demand by the masses, and the platform offers data on how the hype translates into dollars.</p>
<p>“Instagram, and other platforms, have been key to the demand side of the equation being able to highlight items that represent brand heat and influence in the industry. We are a perfect reflection as a platform of what&#8217;s happening in current culture,” StockX CEO Scott Cutler says.</p>
<h2>Where StockX fits in the business of sneakers</h2>
<p>That combination of popularity and hype trends has created a massive economy. In 2014, co-founder and former CEO of StockX Josh Luber said <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-see-sneakers-these-guys-see-hundreds-of-millions-in-resale-profit/">eBay’s sneaker business totaled $338 million</a>, which was 31% higher than 2013. By spring of 2015, <a href="https://www.complex.com/sneakers/2015/04/sneaker-resell-market-worth-one-billion-dollars">the secondary sneaker market was reportedly estimated to be worth $1 billion</a>. In total, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/246496/athletic-footwear-industy-revenue/">U.S. athletic footwear industry was worth</a> $17.2 billion and $17.5 billion in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and by 2017, it grew to $19.6 billion. There’s no doubt the sneaker community was spending the money in a market with a lot of risk, rapid growth and very few safeguards or price regulations.</p>
<p>With so much money at stake, it’s not surprising that a bevy of companies have targeted the category. Perhaps no marketplace has had the longevity of eBay, which has always been a marketplace for everyone and everything, with sneakers making up only a fraction of its transactions. Education is key and barriers to entry for the platform are high though: Sellers need to build a positive reputation, and in order to shop for sneakers, buyers need to be sufficiently up to speed on what to look for in terms of fakes, scams and pricing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While StockX’s idea of access does circumvent gatekeeping and the backdoor deals of the past to an extent, it has come at the cost of having access taken from vibrant regions, brick-and-mortar stores and small businesses to those with more capital.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">StockX’s mission is “to provide access to the world’s most coveted items in the smartest way possible.” It says it right on the website, and it’s incontestable that the infinite data StockX makes transparent to anyone for free allows for smart participation in the business of sneakers.</p>
<p>But, smartest participation by whom?</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			As the business of sneakers commoditized alongside the boom of social media, plenty of the culture’s stories went largely overlooked by hype-pedaling media outlets and social media algorithms in addition to the influx of people with little familiarity or exposure to sneaker culture.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We often see “access” leveraged as marketing jargon, or the concept of democratization applied to opening up once exclusive spaces, which have often excluded marginalized communities. It&#8217;s become trendy to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/what-does-accountability-look-like-in-2020/">advertise the concepts of representation and inclusivity</a> without actually doing the work internally: Adidas’ <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2020/01/07/adidas-smashes-stereotype-perfect-athletic-body-with-all-inclusive-collection">campaign imagery featuring a diverse set of models</a> was released at the same time the company was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/business/adidas-diversity-employees.html">under fire for overt racism and discriminatory hiring practices</a>.</p>
<p>“Smartest” could be exchanged for “simplest” or at least used in tandem for a more accurate description. There’s no need to be educated on the shoes’ functionality, what replicas may look like, or even the story behind them or their history of releases and rereleases. StockX’s data offers education on the market. Access is granted to any person to easily make a financially smart purchase as long as they have an internet connection and the funds.</p>
<p>While StockX’s idea of access does circumvent gatekeeping and the backdoor deals of the past to an extent, it has come at the cost of having access taken from vibrant regions, brick-and-mortar stores and small businesses to those with more capital. In short, the access afforded to the most coveted items is a premium pass rather than democratization.</p>
<h2>Users’ love/hate relationship with StockX</h2>
<p>Andrew Zachary decided to sell off his sneaker collection around 2011 while he was in college. At the time, eBay was the best option, and he had to do quite a bit of legwork to price his pairs without any centralized data on the secondary sneaker market.</p>
<p>“I would have to go research the shoe on eBay to see how much people wanted for it and see what the shoe sold for by going through all of the closed auctions, and that&#8217;s how I generated the price. StockX definitely makes it a lot easier.”</p>
<p>The now 27-year-old, Chicago-based reseller still primarily operates on eBay because of the years he put into building his seller reputation on the platform. “If I&#8217;m looking to sell something on eBay, I go over to StockX, check the market price and list mine within that range.”</p>
<p>Although he never buys on StockX — he doesn’t want to pay retail nor depend on the company’s authentication services — Zachary recognizes the value the platform offers him. “Before [StockX], sneaker reselling was really like the Wild West. People would charge whatever they want and there was no reference point.” Looking back, he says, “If I was negotiating with someone and looking to buy a pair of shoes that they wanted $450 for, back in the day I couldn&#8217;t go to StockX and say, ‘Well, they have it for $350.’”</p>
<p>On the other hand, he has used StockX to sell on occasion. When he wants to offload a pair of shoes quickly, StockX’s model of users listing their bids (buyers) and their asks (sellers) enables speed. The buyers are essentially there waiting to be chosen. “It’s one click and right out the door.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2133934" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133934" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2133934" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/StockX-Interface.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="387" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/StockX-Interface.png 1998w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/StockX-Interface.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/StockX-Interface.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/StockX-Interface.png?resize=768,437 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/StockX-Interface.png?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/StockX-Interface.png?resize=1536,873 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/StockX-Interface.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133934" class="wp-caption-text">StockX&#8217;s interface allows for extremely easy one-click buying and selling of sneakers, such as this Jordan 12 Retro Low Easter (2021). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> StockX</p></div></p>
<p>Despite recognizing the obvious opportunities the growth of the business of sneakers has afforded him, Zachary, like many other enthusiasts who have been into sneakers well before StockX, expressed the negative implications of its dominance in the market. “Because StockX made it so easy to resell shoes, anyone can do it. You don&#8217;t have to have any interest in sneakers. You can look up that shoe on StockX, see its resale value [and] go after that shoe on release day. You could have no idea what it really is or anything about it,” he laments.</p>
<p>The option to buy or sell in one click plus the combination of authentication, real-time pricing, data transparency as well as transaction anonymity affords a low-risk, easy entry point into the secondary sneaker market that did not exist pre-StockX. Yet, popularizing the sneaker space and enabling little to no effort for access also dilutes the culture of sneakers.</p>
<h2>Sneaker culture, gentrified</h2>
<p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teen-makes-money-selling-sneakers-stockx-2019-8">Business Insider profiled a 15-year-old</a> who financed his sneaker-selling business with the money he made doing yard work. He’s since quit playing sports to focus on school and building his business. He raked in six figures last year.</p>
<p>In the story, he said, &#8220;Everyone wants shoes, and there&#8217;s always someone who will spend an absurd amount, so it&#8217;s just about getting those pairs and building the right connections and understanding the market.&#8221; He plans on netting enough savings to eventually transfer his network and financial skills to real estate.</p>
<p>Such seemingly feel-good tales of young entrepreneurship — the new paper route, if you will — are rife and have also fueled scandal in the industry. Nineteen-year-old Joe Hebert built a $200,000-monthly-revenue sneaker-reselling business, even hitting sales of $600,000 in May of 2020, as described <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2021-sneaker-investment/">in a profile by Bloomberg Businessweek</a>. All of the math in the Bloomberg story was impressive until it was revealed Hebert was leveraging access to discounted shoes via his mother Ann Hebert, who had a 25-year tenure with Nike and was most recently vice president and general manager of Nike North America. Industry critics also questioned whether her senior position offered her son easier access to limited-edition products, and her Nike affiliation <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/style/nike-reselling-scandal-sneakers-vp-ann-hebert-son-joe-employee-family-discount">went largely without consequence</a> until the story was published. She stepped down from her position in the resulting furor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cora.com.br">Cora</a>, a São Paulo-based technology-enabled lender to small and-medium-sized businesses, has raised $26.7 million in a Series A round led by Silicon Valley VC firm Ribbit Capital.</p>
<p>Kaszek Ventures, QED Investors and Greenoaks Capital also participated in the financing, which brings the startup’s total raised to $36.7 million since its 2019 inception. Kaszek led Cora’s $10 million seed round (believed at that time to be one of the largest seed investments in LatAm) in December 2019, with Ribbit then following.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brazil&#8217;s new fintech startup Cora raised $10 million on the strength of its founding team&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/brazils-new-fintech-startup-cora-raised-10-million-on-the-strength-of-its-founding-team/embed/#?secret=C4IM76HTpF" data-secret="C4IM76HTpF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Last year, Cora got its license approved from the Central Bank of Brazil, making it a 403 bank. The fintech then launched its product in October 2020 and has since grown to have about 60,000 customers and 110 employees.</p>
<p>Cora offers a variety of solutions, ranging from a digital checking account, Visa debit card and management tools such as an invoice manager and cashflow dashboard. With the checking account, customers have the ability to send and receive money, as well as pay bills, digitally.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first venture for Cora co-founders Igor Senra and Leo Mendes. The pair had worked together before — founding their first online payments company, MOIP, in 2005. That company sold to Germany’s WireCard in 2016 (with a 3 million-strong customer base), and after three years the founders were able to strike out again.</p>

<p>With Cora, the pair’s long-term goal is to “provide everything that a SMB will need in a bank.”</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the pair has the ambitious goal of being “the fastest growing neobank focused on SMBs in the world.” It plans to use the new capital to add new features and improve existing ones; on operations; and launching a portfolio of credit products.</p>
<p>In particular, Cora wants to go even deeper in certain segments, such as B2B professional services such as law and accounting firms, real estate brokerages and education.</p>
<p>Ribbit Capital partner Nikolay Kostov believes that Cora has embarked on “an ambitious mission” to change how small businesses in Brazil are able to access and experience banking.</p>
<p>“While the consumer banking experience has undergone a massive transformation thanks to new digital experiences over the last decade, this is, sadly, still not the case on the small business side,” he said.</p>
<p>For example, Kostov points out, opening a traditional small business bank account in Brazil takes weeks, “reels of paper, and often comes with low limits, poor service and antiquated digital interfaces.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of new small businesses in the country continues to grow.</p>
<p>“The combination of these factors makes Brazil an especially attractive market for Cora to launch in and disrupt,” Kostov told TechCrunch. “The Cora founding team is uniquely qualified and deeply attuned to the challenges of small businesses in the country, having spent their entire careers building digital products to serve their needs.”</p>
<p>Since Ribbit&#8217;s start in 2012, he added, LatAm has been a core focus geography for the firm “given the magnitude of challenges, and opportunities in the region to reinvent financial services and serve customers better.”</p>
<p>Ribbit has invested in 15 companies in the region and continues to look for more to back.</p>
<p>“We fully expect that several fintech companies born in the region will become global champions that serve to inspire other entrepreneurs across the globe,” Kostov said.</p>

<p>Rebecca Bellan is back with some micromobbin&#8217; insights. Let&#8217;s dig in and take a look at this roundup of news.</p>
<p>It was a buzzy week for e-bike news, another indication that there is still demand — or at least the perception of demand — for this form of mobility.</p>
<p>Take <strong>Gocycle</strong> as just one example. The U.K.-based company released its fourth generation of folding electric bikes, which are claimed to be lighter and more powerful. The new line has three models &#8212; the G4 ($3,999), G4i ($4,999) and G4i+ ($5,999) &#8212; and they all have 20-inch wheels, a sealed chain drive with a three-speed rear-hub transmission, hydraulic disc brakes, a polymer reach shock and a 500-watt front motor. This is all to say, this bike can rip.</p>
<p>E-bike sharing also continues to be a busy market with startups making plans and governments making orders.</p>
<p><strong>Smoove</strong>, a French mobility startup, is partnering with <strong>Zoov</strong>, another mobility startup that focuses on IoT and self-diagnosis features, to try to become leaders in the <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/2021/03/french-mobility-companies-smoove-and-zoov-merge-to-help-cities-shift-from-cars-to-bikes/">European e-bike sharing market</a>. Smoove is already well-placed in major cities like Paris, Vancouver, Lima and Moscow, and now will be joining forces with Zoov&#8217;s high-quality tech and compact docking stations.</p>
<p>China-based <strong>EZGO</strong> announced an <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ezgo-announces-receipt-of-over-1-million-rmb-international-order-for-its-e-bicycles-301260228.html">order of e-bikes</a> to the Ukraine worth 1 million RMB, or about $150,000. Ukraine is also purchasing EZGO&#8217;s &#8220;Dilang&#8221; brand of e-modes, as well as some electric tricycles. The company hopes to begin distribution within the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, in the land of policy &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>A council committee has delayed votes to make changes to e-scooter and e-bike sharing schemes in Denver.</p>
<p>The deal they&#8217;re working out involves allowing the two micromobility companies to get free access to operating on the city&#8217;s streets. Usually, these companies would pay the city for the right to operate, but if the Denver City Council approves their licenses, Lyft and Lime will just be making profits. The upside is that it (hopefully) gets more people out of cars and into more sustainable modes of transport. This deal also doesn&#8217;t require Denverites to contribute to funding, unlike the deal Denver had with B-cycle, the city&#8217;s original bike share nonprofit.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Lilium</strong> became the latest electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft startup to seek capital by going <a href="https://lilium.com/newsroom-detail/Lilium-intends-to-list-on-Nasdaq-through-merger-with-qell-and-reveals-serial-aircraft?fbclid=IwAR22gl4nMtJ95ufTOZ7WcQhG8VHhHlvmliEhRuBkLC4UsxRvZo7PTI4PoyE">public via a reverse merger</a> with a &#8220;blank check&#8221; company. In this deal, Lilium announced a merger with special purpose acquisition company Qell Acquisition Corp., in a deal valuing the combined business at $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>(Side note: Qell Acquisition Corp. is a SPAC led by Barry Engle, a former president of General Motors North America.) Once the merger is complete, Lilium will trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol LILM.</p>
<p>The German-based startup designs and builds eVTOLs and has aspirations to launch commercial air taxi operations in 2024. Lilium plans to launch an air taxi network in Florida with up to 14 vertiport development sites, which the company says will be built and operated by its infrastructure partners.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p id="first-graph" class="inline-ad-para paragraph-newsletter-1"><strong>Cazoo</strong>, the U.K.-based used car sales platform, announced it too will merge with a special purpose acquisition company in a deal that values it at an eye-popping $7 billion, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/online-car-dealer-cazoo-agrees-sell-spac-7-billion?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FBreakingNews+%28Automotive+News+Breaking+News+Feed%29">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Chargerhelp!</strong>, an on-demand EV charger repair startup, has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/chargerhelp-raises-2-75m-to-keep-ev-chargers-working/"> raised $2.75 million</a> from investors Trucks VC, Kapor Capital, JFF, Energy Impact Partners and The Fund. This round values the startup, which was founded in January 2020, at $11 million post-money. The startup is interesting to me because as far as my research has shown there isn&#8217;t a lot of competition; and there should be. They also have a progressive (dare I suggest sustainable) approach to hiring.</p>
<p><strong>Glovo</strong>, a startup out of Spain with 10 million users that delivers restaurant takeout, groceries and other items in partnership with brick-and-mortar businesses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/">raised $528 million</a> in a Series F round. The round is significant not just because of its size, but because of its proximity to Deliveroo&#8217;s raising more than $2 billion ahead of its debut on the London Stock Exchange this week.</p>
<p>To offset the thin (or even negative) margins that are typically associated with a lot of delivery startups, Glovo aims to become the market leader in the 20 markets in Europe where it is live today, in part by expanding its &#8220;q-commerce&#8221; service &#8212; the delivery of items to urban consumers in 30 minutes or less, TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden reported. It will be using the money to double down on that strategy, including hiring up to 200 more engineers to work in its headquarters in Barcelona, as well as hubs in Madrid and Warsaw, Poland to build out the technology to underpin it.</p>

<p><strong>LGN</strong>, a U.K.-based startup focused on edge AI,<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/23/lgn-which-helps-companies-deploy-ai-at-scale-raises-2m/"> raised $2 million</a> in a round that included investors Trucks VC, Luminous Ventures and Jaguar Land Rover.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2018 by former Apple and BMW executive Daniel Warner, Oxbridge research fellow Dr. Luke Robinson and Professor Vladimir Čeperić of MIT and the University of Zagreb, plans to use the funds to develop its product and hire more employees. Specifically, the company said it is working on low-latency inference technology that can process optical data on-chip orders faster than current technology allows, VentureBeat reported.</p>
<p><strong>WaveSense</strong>, the Massachusetts-based startup that makes ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technology for self-driving cars, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210330005267/en/">raised $15 million</a> in a round led by Rhapsody Venture Partners and Impossible Ventures.</p>
<h2>Takeaways from Biden&#8217;s plans</h2>
<p>What will it take to get Americans to choose an electric vehicle for their next car and to get American supply chains up to the task of manufacturing them in-house? According to President Joe Biden&#8217;s ambitious infrastructure plan unveiled Wednesday, the answer is $174 billion.</p>
<p>The funds are just one part of the $2 trillion plan that seeks to overhaul the lifelines that keep the country running, such as our transportation networks, electric grid and even broadband. In some ways, the plan is bipartisan genius: it combines Democrats&#8217; concern over climate change with Republicans&#8217; concern over Chinese dominance in manufacturing, and appeals to both parties in its promise to revitalize domestic jobs. But the plan still needs approval from Congress before it can move forward.</p>
<p>To spur Americans to buy electric, Biden has taken a two-pronged approach: make them cheaper (through tax credits and rebates) and make EV chargers more readily available (by building a staggeringly large network of 500,000 chargers by 2030). His administration hasn&#8217;t released details on the size of the incentives, so it&#8217;s unclear whether they will be larger than the $7,500 tax credit already available for EVs. It&#8217;s also unclear whether Tesla and GM will qualify, as the current credit isn&#8217;t available for manufacturers that have already sold more than 200,000 EVs.</p>
<p>For now, Biden&#8217;s administration is withholding a lot of details &#8212; how will his plan help automakers &#8220;spur domestic supply chains from raw materials to parts&#8221; and &#8220;retool factories to compete globally&#8221;? &#8212; so we&#8217;ll keep an eye out for these details in the future. <em>— Aria Alamalhodaei</em></p>

<h2>Argo AI plots its fundraising course</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896325 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png" alt="the station autonomous vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>I dared to take some time off, which is all well and good until news breaks in the world of autonomous vehicles. A report from The Information said that Argo AI CEO and co-founder Bryan Salesky told employees in an all-hands meeting that the autonomous vehicle startup was planning for a public listing later this year.</p>
<p>I connected with some sources &#8212; vacation be damned &#8212; and have more context to share with you. Salesky did indeed mention the prospect of an IPO during the company&#8217;s regular weekly all-hands meeting. There is a bit more to the story though. The comments were made as the CEO discussed upcoming important milestones in 2021 that will lead to an IPO or a significant raise of some kind. The upshot: apparently all fundraising options are on the table, including a merger with a special acquisition company, or SPAC.</p>
<p>Argo, as one source told me, is intent on scaling. Raising capital is a key part of that plan. The company also plans to expand testing beyond the six cities it currently is in — including into Europe. (Remember, Volkswagen is a backer and a customer.)</p>
<p>All of that takes money. Argo has raised $2 billion to date. That&#8217;s no small sum and yet far below the war chests of Cruise and Waymo.</p>
<p>The fundraising effort has not started in earnest. There is no roadshow, according to folks familiar. The broad plan is to secure investors, which could turn into the PIPE (private investment in public equity) for a SPAC or a &#8220;fairly substantial private round,&#8221; according to one insider.</p>

<p>Waymo CEO John Krafcik announced on Friday that he is <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/04/capstone-of-my-career-email-from-john.html">stepping down</a> from the leadership position he held for five years. The CEO position will now be held by two people: Tekedra Mawakana, who was COO, and Dmitri Dolgov, who was part of the original Google self-driving project and was most recently CTO.</p>
<p>The idea is that the co-CEOs will take their respective expertise — business and engineering — and combine them to help Waymo scale up commercially. Co-CEO models are risky, so it will be interesting to see if the pair can work together, and, importantly, get their employees to buy into the idea. Dolgov and Mawakana apparently brought the co-CEO idea to the board, one source told me. (Remember Waymo is an Alphabet company, and so its leaders ultimately answer to their parent.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-adventures-john-krafcik/?trackingId=FTwGPU7BTUafQzrbI%2FPRzQ%3D%3D">post on LinkedIn</a>, Krafcik described his time at the company and hinted at a few of his plans, which for now seems to be focused on settling in Austin, Texas and regrouping with family and friends. He&#8217;s also now listed as an advisor to Waymo, a contractual position that doesn&#8217;t have a specific end date.</p>
<p>As you might suspect, I received lots of texts and email messages from sources within the industry wanting to weigh in or provide inside information (or speculate) why Krafcik left.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I can tell you. Krafcik could be a polarizing figure within Waymo, particularly in the early days of his employment when it was still a &#8220;project&#8221; and had not yet become an independent company under Alphabet. That transition led to the departure of some of the Google self-driving project&#8217;s key engineers and leaders, including Chris Urmson, Bryan Salesky and Dave Ferguson, who went on to found AV startups Aurora, Argo AI and Nuro, respectively.</p>
<p>Krafcik&#8217;s tenure was also marked by extreme growth — in terms of number of employees — as well as an aggressive push to lock up OEM and supplier partners, the launch of a ride-hailing service in the suburbs of Phoenix, expanded testing and its first external investment round of $2.25 billion. That round was extended by another $750 million, bringing the total size of the financing to $3 billion.</p>
<p>Dolgov and Mawakana have some decisions to make on how they want to proceed and where to place their bets. My educated forecast? Waymo Via, the company&#8217;s autonomous delivery unit, will become a bigger priority along with a more visible push into complex urban environments like San Francisco.</p>

<p>Here are a few other items worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s electric</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> is expanding its offerings and anticipating the inevitable spike in EVs by partnering with Swiss automation company ABB. The two are working on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/29/abb-and-aws-team-up-to-create-an-ev-fleet-management-platform/">single-view electric fleet management platform</a> that can work with any charging infrastructure or EV.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>“Not only do fleet managers have to contend with the speed of development in charging technology, but they also need real-time vehicle and charging status information, access to charging infrastructures and information for hands-on maintenance,” Frank Muehlon, president of ABB’s e-mobility division, told TechCrunch. “This new real-time EV fleet management solution will set new standards in the world of electric mobility for global fleet operators and help them realize improved operations.”</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Cartken</strong>, the robotics startup founded by ex-Google employees, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-spinoff-cartken-and-reef-technologies-launch-miamis-first-delivery-robots/">partnered with REEF Technology</a> to bring self-driving delivery robots to the streets of downtown Miami. REEF is a startup that operates parking lots and tech-focused neighborhood hubs. They are now delivering dinner orders from REEF&#8217;s network of delivery-only kitchens to people located within a 3/4-mile radius of its delivery hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Geodis</strong>, the global logistics company, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/logistics-giant-geodis-partners-with-phantom-auto-to-deploy-remote-controlled-forklifts/">tapped startup Phantom Auto</a> to help it deploy forklifts that can be controlled remotely by human operators located hundreds, and even thousands, of miles away. The aim is to use the technology to reduce operator fatigue — and the injuries that can occur as a result — as well as reduce the number of people physically inside warehouses, according to the Geodis.</p>
<p><strong>Motional</strong>, which is partnering with Lyft for ride-hailing services, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/hyundai-ioniq-5-will-be-motional-and-lyfts-first-robotaxi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/hyundai-ioniq-5-will-be-motional-and-lyfts-first-robotaxi/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1617376482084000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGUHo17e9iMacVrIV12yDcywIFUSQ">revealed this week that it would be integrating its tech with the Hyundai IONIQ5</a>. Customers in certain markets will be able to book this vehicle starting in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Optimus Ride</strong>, an autonomous electric mobility company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/optimus-ride-partners-with-polaris-to-commercialize-electric-autonomous-vehicles/">announced a partnership</a> with sports car manufacturer Polaris to commercialize a new breed of Polaris GEM low-speed vehicles. The vehicles will serve as microtransit for certain academic or corporate campuses, mixed-use developments and other geofenced, localized environments. Side note: 2023 seems to be a big year for upcoming electric, autonomous vehicles.</p>

<h3>Delivery</h3>
<p><strong>Zipline</strong>, the drone delivery service startup, announced a partnership with Toyota Tsusho Corporation that will focus on bringing medical and pharmaceutical supplies to healthcare facilities in Japan. Toyota Tsusho is already an investor in Zipline, so this is a deepening of that relationship.</p>
<p>The partnership also marks Zipline&#8217;s entrance into Japan. The company already delivers medical supplies in Ghana and Rwanda, and also operates in the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is opening up its personalized playlist, &#8220;On Repeat,&#8221; to advertising sponsorship. This playlist, launched in 2019 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/spotify-adds-two-personalized-playlists-focused-on-your-repeat-listens/">featuring users&#8217; favorite songs</a>, is only the second personalized playlist on the music streaming service that&#8217;s being made available for sponsorship. Spotify&#8217;s flagship playlist, &#8220;Discover Weekly,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/spotify-will-let-now-brands-sponsor-its-discover-weekly-weekly-playlist/">became the first in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>The sponsorship is made possible through the company&#8217;s <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/ad-experiences/sponsored-playlist-ad-specs/">Sponsored Playlist ad product</a>, which gives brands the ability to market to Spotify&#8217;s free users with audio, video and display ad messages across breaks, allowing the advertiser to own the experience &#8220;end-to-end,&#8221; the company says.</p>
<p>It also gives brands an opportunity to reach Spotify&#8217;s most engaged users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When Spotify opened up &#8220;Discover Weekly&#8221; to sponsorship, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/spotify-will-let-now-brands-sponsor-its-discover-weekly-weekly-playlist/">it noted that</a> users who listened to this playlist streamed more than double those who didn&#8217;t. Similarly, &#8220;On Repeat&#8221; caters to Spotify&#8217;s more frequent users because of its focus on tracks users have played most often.</p>
<p>Since the launch of &#8220;On Repeat&#8221; in September 2019, Spotify says the playlist has reached 12 billion streams globally. Fans have also spent over 750 million hours listening to the playlist, where artists like Bad Bunny, The Weeknd and Ariana Grande have topped the list for &#8220;most repeated&#8221; listens.</p>
<p>Though Spotify today offers its numerous <a href="https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/ad-experiences/sponsored-playlist-ad-specs/">owned and operated playlists for sponsorship</a>, its personalized playlists have largely been off-limits &#8212; except for &#8220;Discover Weekly.&#8221; These are highly valued properties, as Spotify directs users to stream collections powered by its algorithms, which Spotify organizes in its ever-expanding &#8220;Made for You&#8221; hub in its app. Here, users can jump in between &#8220;Discover Weekly,&#8221; and other collections organized by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spotify-adds-three-new-types-of-personalized-playlists-with-launch-of-spotify-mixes/">genre, artist, decade</a> and more &#8212; like new releases, favorites, suggestions and more.</p>

<p>With the launch of sponsorship for &#8220;On Repeat,&#8221; brands across 30 global markets, including North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific, will be able to own another of Spotify&#8217;s largest personalized properties for a time.</p>
<p>The first U.S. advertiser to take advantage of the sponsorship is TurboTax, which cited the personalization elements and user engagement with the playlist among the reasons why the ad product made sense for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like music, taxes are not one size fits all. Every tax situation is unique and every individual&#8217;s needs are different,&#8221; said Cathleen Ryan, VP of Marketing for TurboTax, in a statement about the launch. &#8220;We’re using Spotify’s deep connection to its engaged listeners to get in front of consumers and show them that with TurboTax you can get the expertise you need on your terms. With Spotify, we&#8217;re able to get both reach and unique targeting that ensures the right audiences know about the tools, guidance and expertise that TurboTax offers,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Brooks grew up on credit. And for him, that’s a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks is from a small town in Colorado that took a big hit when the steel factory &#8212; the main driver of its economy &#8212; shut down. A couple of years later, when Brooks was 14, his father passed away, and it became very clear to Brooks that if he wanted “any kind of life,” he’d have to hustle. He got a job and, in order to go to college and then law school, he took out six figures&#8217; worth of student loans at an 8% interest rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But instead of being bitter, Brooks is grateful that he even had that opportunity.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Credit is what allows you to get something that you couldn&#8217;t otherwise afford to pay cash for,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years later, Brooks would go on to serve as chief legal officer of Coinbase, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multibillion-dollar Silicon Valley startup that has become one of the world’s largest digital currency platforms. To Brooks, blockchain and cryptocurrency hold great potential to further financial inclusion, a cause he holds close to his heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in May 2020, Brooks moved from the private sector to the public sector, when he took on the role of Acting Comptroller of the Currency of the OCC. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks’ tenure at the OCC was short, but eventful. He helped enact some controversial legislation around bank charters, cryptocurrency and lending. In January, he left that post with plans to return to the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Brooks announced he’d be joining </span><a href="https://www.springlabs.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the company’s first independent director. Brooks had come full circle with the data-sharing startup, considering he was among the group that first conceived the idea of Spring Labs five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His goal there is to bring to bear a combination of an innovation mindset coupled with a knowledge of the traditional banking system that fintechs are trying to disrupt. Having actually been responsible for running the banking system, Brooks believes he has “a good sense of what&#8217;s broken.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that there are a lot of tech companies that have really great ideas but they&#8217;re not very expert in what it is that they&#8217;re trying to fix,” he says. “And, for me, having spent so much time inside of banks and inside of the credit infrastructure, it&#8217;s pretty clear to me what it is that needs to be better. And it really is secure, anonymous data sharing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch sat down with Brooks to hear more about his return to the private sector, his thoughts on why blockchain is the answer to financial inclusion and why he thinks politics need to be taken out of tech.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</span></em></p>
<p><b>TC: What does Spring Labs do exactly? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks: The purpose of Spring Labs is to use blockchain to create a much richer network effect of data that allows the credit bureaus and others to predict the creditworthiness of people who are not in the traditional credit bureau system. And that&#8217;s one of the amazing promises of blockchain, considering that all blockchain is an open-source network of nodes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the more data sources you can connect up to that network, the richer the environment is to allow you to assess people&#8217;s credit worthiness. The vision is that once Spring Labs is successful and has scaled this, we will no longer have to exclude 45 billion people from the credit system because we&#8217;ll have data&#8230;that allows us to predict that this person is a good credit risk and should get a credit card, regardless of whether they have a mortgage or a credit card. The core mission of the company is to bring credit to more people.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: When you say richer data, you mean things like paying rent on time?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks: Yes, stuff like that, but also for example, information about recurring bank credits and debits. Also subscription payments, recurring payments of any kind and also asset and income information &#8212; all of which is relevant to whether you&#8217;re a good credit risk.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: Yes, I&#8217;ve written about a couple of other startups that have similar missions.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks: Yes, but the reason I’ve spent so much time on crypto and blockchain personally over the last four or five years is the idea that a decentralized network is always going to gather more data than a company that has focused for example on signing up all of the landlords in America to do a data-sharing service where you can track rent. I mean rent is a good element, but there are hundreds of elements that can be relevant.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crypto Startup School: The legal and fundraising implications of crypto tokens&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/crypto-startup-school-the-legal-and-fundraising-implications-of-crypto-tokens/embed/#?secret=0IxzDJ7mS8" data-secret="0IxzDJ7mS8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you own a car, for example? Whether it&#8217;s on credit or not is a relevant element to whether you&#8217;re likely to pay. Or whether home prices in your neighborhood are rising or falling, that&#8217;s another thing that&#8217;s relevant. So the point is to be agnostic about the kind of data but to generate a data environment that is rich enough that any given person can be assessed, even if they don&#8217;t have this or that element. There are still data elements that would predict future credit performance and it&#8217;s refining that and assembling all of that on the network that is kind of the Spring Labs secret sauce.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: What do you believe were some of your biggest accomplishments during your time at the OCC?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks: When I was running the OCC, we enacted two regulations, one of which was called a “Valid When Made” rule and the other was called the True Lender Rule. And the purpose of those rules was to provide clarity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing I did during my time there was to grant the first charter to a crypto company called Anchorage. We also provided guidance about what banks can permissibly do with cryptocurrencies. Which I believe had a lot to do with driving the adoption of crypto over the last 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the biggest problems and challenges in the world of crypto is how do you make sure that people who are transacting in crypto are not sending money to terrorists or not using crypto to engage in money laundering. And it&#8217;s a problem because the whole promise of crypto is to allow people to transact peer to peer without the need for a bank limit, right? So normally if you&#8217;re writing a check, it goes to the banking system and the bank looks to see who the payee is and figure out if they&#8217;re on some list or if you&#8217;re using cash there are these currency transaction reports you have to fill out. That&#8217;s not the case with crypto. So one of the things that Spring Labs has built &#8212; coming back to this idea of blockchain validation &#8212; is a solution that allows people, including the government, to say “I don&#8217;t know who the person is that Mary Ann is sending bitcoin to.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Spring Labs solution tells us that person isn&#8217;t a bad guy. We may not know that that person is Brian Brooks because Spring Labs anonymizes the data. But we have brought a lot of identifying information on the blockchain and can tell you that it&#8217;s safe, or it&#8217;s not safe, without violating the basic principles of anonymity that normally exist on blockchain. It’s one of the reasons why having anonymized data sharing is one of the most important breakthroughs in fintech itself.</span></p>
<p><b>TC: How is it able to tell whether it&#8217;s safe or not?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks: Blockchain identity verification is making probabilistic judgments based on a large amount of data. So, it may not know for sure that you&#8217;re not Vladimir Putin. But what it does know is that you’re a person who bought a latte at a Starbucks in Palo Alto yesterday of that you&#8217;re a person who has a Netflix subscription you&#8217;ve been paying on for 23 months. And so when we make these probabilistic judgments, we can reduce to a statistical low rate the likelihood that you&#8217;re engaged in some kind of malfeasance. It turns out that&#8217;s actually much more likely to be accurate than if we&#8217;re pinging a government list to see if you&#8217;re on it, because government lists have typos and misspellings and at times, the last name is the first and the first name is the last. So there are all kinds of errors in that. </span></p>
<p><b>TC: A founder I spoke to recently said that this younger generation has a distrust of the banking system and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re so open to all these new digital offerings and neobanks. What are your thoughts on this perceived distrust of the banking system right now by the younger generation?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks: I think there are plenty of people in the older generation who have also had trust issues with banking. Anybody who went through the financial crisis probably has a feeling about that. I would say that the banking system as a system is strong and deserves people&#8217;s trust. And what I mean by that is you have the agency I used to lead and other agencies who you know have thousands of seasoned professionals who are examining these banks for safety and soundness and compliance, every day. Where they find mistakes and malfeasance, they address it in real time. So I have a lot of confidence in that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is though, there are things about just the nature of finance &#8212; the idea that somebody is charging you a significant interest rate to borrow money for a period of time because you had a ding on your credit, say five years ago. Those are things that are inherent in the credit management and business of banking, and that’s the thing that makes a lot of people &#8212; especially young kids &#8212; feel excluded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So imagine, for example, if you&#8217;re a young kid who just graduated college last year in the pandemic. And you can&#8217;t find a job and you don&#8217;t have the traditional indicators of creditworthiness, so it&#8217;s hard for you to buy a car or get a credit card. Now you feel like the whole banking system exists to exclude you in some way. So that sort of sucks, except it turns out that there are peer-to-peer lending platforms, decentralized finance platforms and other things that will allow you to access credit. So that&#8217;s a reason I think why young people are looking to these fintechs &#8212; because the fintechs exist to fill the gaps that are left behind by traditional banking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The banks are trustworthy, but the banks are trying to serve sort of like the middle 60% of society. But if you&#8217;re young, lower income or a minority or an immigrant or whatever&#8230;there&#8217;s a big gap in the banking sector which we&#8217;re always trying to improve. So at some level the banking sector is about serving the middle part of the country, and fintechs are harnessing market incentives to build products for those people that have been excluded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t understand why fintech has become so politicized. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seems to be a war on fintech and I don&#8217;t understand where it&#8217;s coming from. And it seems to be kind of like a bipartisan war. If you go back and look at the letter that Maxine Waters, the House Financial Services Committee chairman, sent to the Biden transition team back in December &#8212; among the things she wanted them to do was to roll back every single thing we did on fintech. I just asked myself, “Why?” I understand there were some things we did that were somewhat political but why is it political to say that we think Stripe should be eligible for a bank charter? What is political about that? Stripe is a company that is engaged in major financial intermediation, which is what the bank charter is all about. Why is that political? And that extends to bank charters and the true lender rule that I talked about earlier. </span></p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you elaborate on how you think fintech has become politicized?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks: It seems to be that people, especially Democrats, don&#8217;t like fintech. You&#8217;d argue that that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s a particular candidate for my old job, that apparently was kiboshed because he said positive things about fintech. The whole point of fintech is to serve people that aren’t well-served by the banking system, right? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if Americans really think that we should ban fossil fuels, then we should ban fossil fuels. Politicians should enact that and bear the consequences if that isn&#8217;t what people want. We don&#8217;t want bank CEOs making those decisions for us as a society, in terms of who they choose to lend money to, or not. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to take the politics out of tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of us do a lot of different things, and we have no idea on a given day, whether what we&#8217;re doing is popular with our neighbors or popular with our bank president or not. I don&#8217;t want the fact that I sometimes feel Republican to be a reason why my local bank president can deny me a mortgage. </span></p>
<p><b>TC: I read that you had a personal experience growing up that maybe led you to this desire to help increase financial inclusion in the country. Is that something you&#8217;re comfortable talking about?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brooks: It’s no big secret that I grew up on credit. I grew up in a small town and I guess the way I usually put it there were sort of these two seminal tragedies in my life. I don&#8217;t want to say that my town died when I was growing up&#8230;but I was a young kid in this lovely prosperous factory town in Colorado that was pretty and had high employment with good union jobs for steel workers. It was great. And then when I was like 11 or 12 or whatever age, the factory closed, and suddenly we went from being a lovely prosperous little town to having enormously high double-digit unemployment. It was a disaster and really really sad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then a couple years after that, my dad died, and so the town died and then my dad died. What I had to do pretty quickly, if I was going to have anything like a life, is I had to get a job on my 16th birthday. I also had to borrow a lot of money to go to college and law school. And as I tell everybody, I didn&#8217;t borrow it at a federally subsidized rate. Those days you couldn&#8217;t deduct your student loans on your income tax, so I had to pay 8% interest on my six figures of student loans. And thank God that was available. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I&#8217;m not one of these people who thinks it&#8217;s a bad thing for people to have credit. I mean, all of the studies show that more credit equals less poverty. And yet whenever I say that on Twitter or whatever, the politically minded will say “No, more credit equals more debt.” It&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t know what that means because credit and debt are the same thing, but what I mean by it is that credit is what allows you to get something that you couldn&#8217;t otherwise afford to pay cash for &#8212; whether that&#8217;s an education or start a business, or buy a house, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a guy who benefited from all of that, I don&#8217;t take a moralistic or elitist stance that other people should be able to take a risk on themselves. I took a risk on myself at 8% interest, and it&#8217;s what allowed me to have the life that I have and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s up to me to tell other people that they shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to do that. So I&#8217;m a big credit evangelist. I really believe that more credit is better for society than less. And I think fintechs are likely to deliver that to people that are not well-served by the banking system. I am a believer in the idea that decentralized networks take some of the discrimination out.</span></p>
