					<description><![CDATA["I think there is a lot of interesting stuff coming out of Stockholm and accelerating with all recent success stories," said VNV Global's Bjorn von Sivers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the realm of European startup ecosystems, Sweden — largely Stockholm — ranks very close to the behemoths of London, Paris and Berlin. And with 10 million people, the nation certainly punches above its weight, having produced unicorns such as Spotify and Klarna, to name only two.</p>
<p>As a result, the eight investors we surveyed are characteristically bullish about the future, despite a pandemic strategy that became more restrictive in the second half of last year.</p>
<p>Sweden&#8217;s initially laissez-faire approach to controlling COVID-19 might have helped its tech ecosystem ride out the uncertainty. “Sweden is more open and is ahead of the pandemic curve, so more people are coming here than the other way around,” said Jacob Key, founding partner with Luminar Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Several people we spoke to said they saw green shoots regarding revenue growth and retention in their portfolio companies as founders adapted to the pandemic. Areas that are benefitting include digital health and remote work for obvious reasons, but given Sweden&#8217;s strength in fintech and gaming, those sectors are both well positioned to thrive.</p>
<p>As consumers become more desirous of sustainability, responsible shopping, green travel and plant-based food alternatives “will likely contribute to a surge in companies in this space,&#8221; said Sofia Dolfe of Index Ventures.</p>
<p>Oversaturated areas are media/adtech and wellness/fitness apps.</p>
<p>Some of the trends these investors are excited about include deep tech, AI, machine learning, healthcare/medtech, industrial IoT, energy storage and energy-efficient power generation, robotics, intelligent production and additive manufacturing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there is a lot of interesting stuff coming out of Stockholm and accelerating with all recent success stories,&#8221; said VNV Global&#8217;s Bjorn von Sivers.</p>

Strong momentum, more and more serial founders and experienced founders, strong broader ecosystem, product and tech-led founders with a global view.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Sweden is more open and is ahead of the pandemic curve so more people coming here than the other way around.</p>

<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Not really. Focus on resourceful execution, digital-first sales, extend runway. Biggest worry is a much cooler investment climate.</p>

<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Business models with strong network effects.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
VNV Global has a global mandate. Approximately 10% of the portfolio is Sweden/Stockholm based.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Any consumer service coming out of Stockholm eco system. In the portfolio I would highlight Voi Technology and Fredrik Hjelm (micromobility) and Grace Health founded by Estelle Westling and Thérèse Mannheimer that is building a digital health clinic for women in emerging markets.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
I think there is a lot of interesting stuff coming out of Stockholm and accelerating with all recent success stories. Spotify, iZettle, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
It will probably increase a bit, but not significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
International travel still has a lot of uncertainty and low visibility. Digital health and micromobility is defiantly seeing unprecedented demand.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Not really impacted our strategy. I would say founders think a lot about the funding climate and how to best plan in this lower visibility environment.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, all across the portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The fast recovery in our mobility businesses, which essentially saw activity drop significantly in late March/early April and has rebounded strongly since May</p>
<h2>Ashley Lundström, partner, EQT Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
I’m personally excited about investing in teams solving important problems — the ones that affect disadvantaged populations, society at large, the environment, etc. And the exciting part is that we’re seeing more and more of this — especially from serial entrepreneurs who have built companies, maybe even had good exits and now want to dedicate their skills to meaningful journeys.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
It actually hasn&#8217;t been announced yet as we literally closed a few days ago and it&#8217;s one that our AI platform Motherbrain pointed us to. It’s one of those companies that when you hear about what they’re building you just say, “Oh of course, that’s a no-brainer.” It’s a great example of a product-led company seeing strong organic growth from a global user base and we’re chomping at the bit to start working together. Prior to this, my latest most exciting investment is Anyfin. Anyfin is a prime example of the potential of Stockholm’s second generation teams, coming out of the Swedish unicorns iZettle, Klarna and Spotify. They’re a fintech building financial wellness products for users who need it the most. They’ve started with targeting interest rates head-on via a refinancing product and are launching more products and markets with the Series B funding raising they secured this spring.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
I’m keen to see teams who combine market experience with startup experience. All too often teams are either one or the other and I&#8217;d love to see a team come together where one co-founder says, “I know this problem inside-out because I’ve lived it” and another co-founder who says, “I know how to build and bring ideas to life.” This combo would be really powerful. Over and above that, I’m generally focused on investing in teams solving problems that are shared by huge bases — either consumers or the long tail of B2B. One must in my book is that the product has to be consumer grade. This is obvious for consumer (although not always a given), but it’s something that we’ve become religious about in B2B too.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
We’re in the business of exceptions so I find it hard to rule out a category altogether due to competition. That being said, there are always sectors where it’s tricky to envision a winner-takes-all or winner-takes-most, for structural reasons, such as some types of recruiting or staffing, D2Cs or digital health services.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Our strategy is to be local with locals and we invest broadly across Europe and, in specific cases, in the U.S. So, while personally my time&#8217;s spent somewhat weighted toward the Nordics, more than 50% of the companies I work with are outside the Nordic countries. Motherbrain has helped us flatten geographies further, discovering great startups regardless of where they&#8217;re located, and we regularly invest in great teams outside our local ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
There’s a lot of talent for consumer products coming out of the Nordics — particularly fintech in Stockholm (Tink, Anyfin, Brite), gaming in Finland (Small Giant Games, Reworks, Traplight), and a range of products out of Copenhagen including edtech and health tech (Eduflow, Corti). The great engineering talent we have in this region is also producing incredibly strong tech teams — particularly in Finland, such as Varjo, Speechly and Robocorp. We’re even starting to see some interesting activity in quantum computing (e.g., IQM) in the region. There are also some moonshot companies coming out of the Nordics that we&#8217;re excited about long term, such as Solein, Einride, Heart Aerospace and Northvolt.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
The Nordic countries continue to punch above their weight and I am confident that this trend will continue — meaning the investment opportunities will be many. As the ecosystems mature, the quality will continue to improve, which also speaks to this trend over time. Historically, downturns have produced strong tech companies, so I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if investors are keeping a close eye on the region to make sure they get the chance to back some of the most seasoned entrepreneurs who will most certainly be looking for ways to make the most of the current climate.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I believe we’ll see more remote teams, absolutely. However, I still think the hubs will be strong and important pieces of the ecosystem and I don’t think we’ll see these cities shrinking by material numbers. Though if people leave the most expensive cities, who could blame them? I do, however, think we’ll see a more sharp trend of teams that were fairly local in the past, expanding to new geographies. And what may happen is that in itself will reveal new talent pools, which over the long term could create more hubs.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Tech is in a great position overall because businesses are generally either working on digitization, which is seeing acceleration out of COVID-19 … so tech falls clearly on the right side of that line, or green field modern or even futuristic ideas. Of the latter, of course, some of these ideas are nice-to-haves, which struggle when consumers are facing tough financial situations, but plenty are services that we believe we’ll see working out long term. Of course anything physical, where the team isn’t able to adapt the product quickly, like events or exercise services, will face temporary dips, but if these companies were originally betting on long-term trends, we believe that they’ll still be in good positions going forward.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
COVID-19 hasn’t affected our strategy, but it has helped us keep our eye on the ball in terms of making sure we stick to our strategy and stay mindful of our own runway — funds have that too! The advice to our founders has been the following: (1) Extend the runway so you keep your options open, and then (2) be as aggressive as you possibly can. We&#8217;re encouraging teams to act quickly — both in terms of making internal decisions and in getting products to market to test them out. Our founders’ biggest worries are uncertainties around how long “this” will all last — and our advice here is that they should operate as they always do and not wait for things to change, rather be ultrarelevant in the market you’re in.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes! We’ve got a couple companies who are really well positioned — particularly Wolt (food delivery) and the mobile games companies we’ve backed (Popcore, Reworks, Traplight, etc.). The current climate is especially favorable for these types of companies, and we’ve got great founders at the wheels who have been able to take advantage of the opportunities presented and who have seen tremendous growth as a result.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The efforts by the public sector, including healthcare providers, to accelerate digitization has been refreshing. Sectors who have all too often had plenty of excuses for being slow and conservative have suddenly made big leaps — and they’re proud of themselves for having done so! This gives me hope that there will be new or renewed appetites even as things go back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
The Nordic countries have many great examples of digital tools used by the general public to conduct their everyday lives digitally. I would encourage founders and business leaders to look to these examples and see if there are opportunities to build for other geographies. Scandinavian trendsetting isn’t just for fashion and interior design!</p>
<h2>Ted Persson, partner, EQT Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
My main passion lies in backing ambitious teams solving real problems with real technology. So, pretty deep tech sometimes — the anti-thesis of “yet another B2B SaaS company solving almost the same problem in almost the same way.” I’m also interested in product and design-centric teams using superior UX to democratize something that previously was limited to a privileged few. Currently, I’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about and doing research into the future of the creative industries, marketing, product design, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
This spring, I’ve led or been involved in four investments across quantum computing, group collaboration and two in the design and development tooling space. None of these have been announced yet though. The last announced investments were Sonantic and Frontify — both very cool companies.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Edtech is certainly one.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
As we’re looking for outliers, it’s hard to generalize. But I get more excited about companies tying to solve hard problems rather than just piecing together a few APIs (which anyone can do).</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
I personally don’t have a geographical focus and enjoy working with our teams across Europe and the world, but since I live in Sweden, my network is slightly stronger here. Our proprietary AI platform Motherbrain also ensures we find rapidly growing or under-the-radar startups outside of our local ecosystems and networks.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
We’re pretty good at gaming, entertainment, music and fintech in the Nordics. It’s also easier to find really great designers here than in other parts of Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Yes, for sure. It&#8217;s too early to tell, but a couple of portfolio companies have given up on their physical offices and a lot of startup people I know are working from across the country. I for sure think this will lead to a more international climate.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
A lot has been written about this already and, just like every other investor, we’ve spent a fair share of the spring mapping this out. All in all, tech is in a good position.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
There&#8217;s been no change in our strategy. There was some initial confusion for obvious reasons and we took a short break to make sure our portfolio was in a good position to endure. Now, we’re back to normal and have made our first investments where we haven’t met the teams physically.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, certainly in a couple of areas, such as food delivery, gaming, remote working and collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
When people around myself, parents, older relatives, all of a sudden embrace digital tools and ways of working fully.</p>
<h2>Sofia Dolfe, principal, Index Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
I love products that give people a strong feeling of community, of belonging to a group of like-minded people, and a sense of being invested in its success. Users are so passionate about the product that they can&#8217;t stop themselves from recommending it to their friends, and their affinity with the brand grows over time. Search for these types of businesses often leads me to consumer businesses and marketplaces that are customer-centric and bring communities together.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
I am interested to hear about new takes on education in a post-COVID world in which people may be more open to challenge the traditional ways of learning.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
I am looking for founders who are inspiring storytellers. So much of building a business is about getting everyone to come along for the ride, from the senior execs joining you, to the customers taking a chance on a young yet unproven business, to investors taking a leap of faith and sharing in your ambition. Founders who are great storytellers, are hungry and dream big from the get-go, and have the humility to know what they don&#8217;t know, will be in my view those who have the best chance at making it big.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Stockholm has historically been at the forefront of both fintech and gaming, and I do think these sectors are well positioned to thrive. Financial services will continue to be transformed, and the modern banking infrastructure in the Nordics makes this an attractive place to start a fintech business. As for gaming, the region has a strong track record and a high concentration of both studios and developer talent, making it a particularly fertile ground for breakout successes. A newer, fast-growing theme in the region is conscious consumption. Stockholm has a long history of eco-friendliness, and the maturity of CSR, responsible shopping, green travel and plant-based food alternatives will likely contribute to a surge in companies in this space. I&#8217;m excited to meet with founders who care deeply about this endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Stockholm has proven itself to be a strong tech hub, and it has many of the necessary ingredients for continued successes. For one, founders think big and global from the start. Sweden has a population of 10 million, and founders creating category-defining companies know that they must enter other markets to dominate. The scale of companies such as King, Spotify and iZettle has also shown that success is within reach and cultivated a sense of courage among aspiring entrepreneurs. Sometimes the world risks underestimating the Swedes because they tend to be understated but as the track record of Sweden shows, they overdeliver.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
A few weeks ago I saw a handwritten note in the entrance of an apartment building in Stockholm. One of the residents was offering to purchase groceries, medication and other essential items to those unwell or at risk in the building. I&#8217;m hopeful that in times of difficulty, we are reminded of the importance of our local communities, of taking responsibility for others, and of how valuable a simple act of kindness can be to building relationships.</p>
<h2>Staffan Helgesson, partner, Creandum</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Transformation of old and large industries such as transportation, construction, real estate, etc. Digital health — we will need to transform current health industry.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
Mavenoid. Automating tech support globally. Ex-Palantir founders.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
Insurance markets have not yet seen the wave of startups that the general fintech industry has seen.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
Crazy ambitious entrepreneurs with their eyes set on disrupting a global market.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Many consumer verticals are tough to penetrate given big tech and related oligopoly. But every time I say that new phenomenal companies emerge. Such as Creandum&#8217;s portfolio company Kahoot that just listed in Oslo for $1.5 billion.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Creandum invests all across EU. No set targets — we just want to find the best entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
If picking one industry we&#8217;re very excited about digital health with Stockholm-based Firstvet and Kry/Livi. (telemedicine for humans and pet owners).</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Stockholm/Nordics is a very sophisticated ecosystem that consistently keep producing global winners on a regular basis.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Great companies will increasingly be built anywhere and we as an industry need to adapt. Those venture firms adapting best and fastest will be the winners going forward. I foresee a second green wave, like in the 70s, where people will move out from cities and/or have a dual-home setup.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Travel and entertainment obviously. But even in these industries there will be winners going forward if they can ride the wave of digitizing (for example, tickets and events).</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
It&#8217;s all about access to long-term capital and track record. Creandum&#8217;s strategy has not changed at all.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, especially in digital health.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
Closing a fully remote investment. Company called Meditopia — in Turkey of all places :-).</p>
<h2>Tanya Horowitz, partner, Butterfly Ventures</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Deep tech, AI, machine learning, healthcare/medtech, industrial IoT and related cloud services and communication solutions, Energy storage and energy-efficient power generation, robotics, intelligent production, and additive manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.uutescientific.com">Uute Scientific</a> has created a natural product containing a specific mixture of microbes, which can be applied to various consumer products. These products decrease the probability of getting immune-mediated diseases, like asthma or Type 1 diabetes and consequently improve quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
In the region (Nordics), would like to see more in energy storage, power generation and energy/carbon reduction technologies. Food tech and agtech are an area to look toward given the world&#8217;s increasing population. Edtech due to the COVID crisis.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
We are looking for a strong team with unique tech aimed toward a global market.</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Media/adtech unless truly unique seem to be oversaturated; also wellness/fitness apps, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
Finland 40%-50%, Sweden 30%+, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Baltics remaining 20%.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Industries: Health/medical.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
I think in Finland and the entire Nordics there is ample opportunities to invest in stellar teams and technologies that have a global market. The talent pool and support of the startup ecosystems are top notch.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
I do not see startup hubs losing people in the Nordics. I do however see founders coming from geographies outside major cities.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
Obvious is retail, restaurants, service industry. Also education (edtech) should be an area to really look into. Online entertainment (OTT), logistics (food, goods delivery), etc.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
It has only affected it slightly, we were lucky that we were almost at the end of our investment period and our portfolio of companies are set for this current fund vintage. We are the leading seed-stage deep tech investor in the Nordics and therefore most of our companies have fared OK.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Yes, some of our portfolio has benefited from the pandemic, while others suffered with customers initially but seem to be recovered now.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
We are raising Butterfly Ventures Fund IV and started before the pandemic hit. While this has slowed us down slightly, our anchor and other LPs are rock solid and we as a team are committed to getting the first close done ASAP to capitalize with that dry powder in early 2021. While my heart goes out to those who have not been so lucky, personally we have been blessed to not have had direct tragedies related to the pandemic … and my son is happy and healthy and that alone gives me hope everyday.</p>
<p><strong>Any other thoughts you want to share with TechCrunch readers?</strong><br />
Global LPs should really explore Europe more, especially the Nordics!</p>
<h2>Sanna Westman, principal, Creandum</h2>
<p><strong>What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?</strong><br />
Well, we typically say that if you invest in trends you&#8217;re late to the party … but of course there are some macro movements that are exciting and we monitor closely. For me personally digital health is one of those areas, it&#8217;s not new but constantly developing and has of course been further accelerated the past year. Another area that is really interesting are products that help you be a better leader/manager/company. I&#8217;m not sure how to productize this but there&#8217;s a huge opportunity in amplifying leadership. We&#8217;ve seen success with companies giving the individual user superpowers (no-code tools, productivity tools, etc.) but how about helping people scaling themselves and their teams? Remote work has a lot of benefits, but puts new challenges on managers. I also believe we&#8217;ll see more quality companies battling climate change in different ways.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your latest, most exciting investment?</strong><br />
SafetyWing — on the intersection of social security and remote work.</p>
<p><strong>Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?</strong><br />
There&#8217;s plenty more to do within B2B commerce: marketplaces, e-commerce enablers, new ways of financing, etc. Sure there are companies, but no way near as many (good) ones as it should be.</p>
<p><strong>What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?</strong><br />
A short time to &#8220;Wow.&#8221; Solutions that can give the user an instant value and then continue to add to that value they more they use the product</p>
<p><strong>Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?</strong><br />
Mobility and delivery in general is quite crowded. Also open-banking payment solutions has seen a huge surge.</p>
<p><strong>How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?</strong><br />
The Nordics is along with DACH one of the key focus markets for Creandum, though there&#8217;s no set allocation for any certain geography. We strive to back the best companies regardless of where they&#8217;re located.</p>
<p><strong>Which industries in your city and region seem well positioned to thrive, or not, long term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?</strong><br />
Compared to other hubs there is a very high product focus in general, and given that Sweden is a small market the mindset is also international from day one. I think that makes more of a difference than a certain vertical. In terms of exciting companies Kive and Depict are worth keeping eyes on for the very early stages. For the more mature startups Kry and Firstvet are doing great as early enablers of digital health.</p>
<p><strong>How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?</strong><br />
Increasingly competitive but also a lot of strong talent.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?</strong><br />
Even before the pandemic very few startups in Stockholm had 100% of their workforce in one location anyway, a hybrid setup was and continue to be very common.</p>
<p><strong>Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?</strong><br />
As the fund invests with a very long time horizon, +10 years, the short-term impact is not a key concern but of course we think about the long-term effects on e.g., business travel. We tend to look for the opportunities more than the drawbacks though, and there will be opportunities for new companies in industries that have been heavily impacted. It might actually prove to be good timing to disrupt.</p>
<p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?</strong><br />
Initially we were cautious around runway and worked closely with the portfolio to make sure they could survive for a longer time should revenues decline and funding not be available. Summing up 2020 though, we were fortunate to look back on a year where many companies had overperformed and were able to raise significant up rounds. Great companies are created in all times and were committed to find the best seed and Series A companies.</p>
<p><strong>Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?</strong><br />
Definitely. We&#8217;ve seen several examples of V-shaped recovery, with revenues bumping back above pre-COVID levels and continuing on that trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.</strong><br />
The hustle and optimism among entrepreneurs we meet. The &#8220;impossible is nothing&#8221; attitude is really inspiring.</p>
<p><strong>Who are key startup people you see creating success locally?</strong><br />
I&#8217;d say some of the active &#8220;stay in the background&#8221; angels/mentors that are supporting a new generation such as Joachim Hedenius (Kry, CTO) or Johan Crona. And Susanna Campbell/Cristina Stenbeck who have been very active in their joint investments, often finding opportunities the VCs miss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We explore the fallout of Facebook&#8217;s news ban, WhatsApp addresses privacy concerns and Perseverance lands on Mars. This is your Daily Crunch for February 18, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Facebook&#8217;s Australian news ban is pretty broad</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this was the lead story in yesterday&#8217;s newsletter, but 24 hours later, we have a better sense of how things are playing out.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A quick refresher: As the Australian government is debating a law that would require tech platforms to pay media companies for linked content, Facebook has gone ahead and started blocking the sharing or viewing of news. The move has been criticized as censorship and even &#8220;an assault on a sovereign nation,&#8221; but also <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210217/22383446265/bizarre-reaction-to-facebooks-decision-to-get-out-news-business-australia.shtml?s=09">praised as a reasonable stand</a> against a &#8220;link tax.&#8221; (Google made a similar threat but has instead been striking deals with Australian publishers.)</p>
<p>Regardless of how you feel about the decision in theory, the initial implementation has left something to be desired, with the Facebook Pages of hospitals, universities, unions, government departments and the bureau of meteorology <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/facebook-applies-overly-broad-content-block-in-flex-against-australias-planned-news-reuse-law/">all wiped clean</a>. When reached for comment, Facebook confirmed that it applied an intentionally broad definition of news, designed to reflect the law &#8220;as drafted.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/following-backlash-whatsapp-to-roll-out-in-app-banner-to-better-explain-its-privacy-update/">Following backlash, WhatsApp to roll out in-app banner to better explain its privacy update</a> — If users choose to review the changes, they’ll be shown a deeper summary, including added details about how WhatsApp works with Facebook.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/microsoft-announces-the-next-perpetual-release-of-office/">Microsoft announces the next perpetual release of Office</a> — If you use Office, Microsoft would really, really, really like you to buy a cloud-enabled subscription to Microsoft 365, but it will continue to make a standalone, perpetual license for Office available, too.</p>
<p><strong>Startups, funding and venture capital</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/robinhood-goes-to-congress/">Robinhood goes to Congress</a> — Alex Wilhelm did not enjoy watching.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the Biden administration <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/white-house-throws-support-behind-democratic-immigration-bill-ahead-rollout-n1258206">works to bring legislation to Congress to address the endemic problem of immigration reform in America</a>, on the other side of the nation a small California startup called <a href="https://www.sesolabor.com/">SESO Labor</a> has raised $4.5 million to ensure that farms can have access to legal migrant labor.</p>
<p>SESO&#8217;s founder Mike Guirguis raised the round over the summer from investors including Founders Fund and NFX. Pete Flint, a founder of Trulia, joined the company&#8217;s board. The company has 12 farms it&#8217;s working with and is negotiating contracts with another 46. The company&#8217;s other co-founder, Jordan Taylor, was the first product hire at Farmer&#8217;s Business Network and previously of Dropbox.</p>
<p>Working within the existing regulatory framework that has existed since 1986, SESO has created a service that streamlines and manages the process of getting H-2A visas, which allow migrant agricultural workers to reside temporarily in the U.S. with legal protections.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At this point, SESO is automating the visa process, getting the paperwork in place for workers and smoothing the application process. The company charges about $1,000 per worker, but eventually as it begins offering more services to workers themselves, Guirguis envisions several robust lines of revenue. Eventually, the company would like to offer integrated services for both farm owners and farm workers, Guirguis said.</p>
<p>SESO is currently expecting to bring in 1,000 workers over the course of 2021 and the company is, as of now, pre-revenue. The largest industry player handling worker visas today currently brings in 6,000 workers per year, so the competition, for SESO, is market share, Guirguis said.</p>
<h2>America&#8217;s complicated history of immigration and agricultural labor</h2>
<p>The H-2A program was set up to allow agricultural employers who anticipate shortages of domestic workers to bring to the U.S. non-immigrant foreign workers to work on farms temporarily or seasonally. The workers are covered by U.S. wage laws, workers&#8217; compensation and other standards, including access to healthcare under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>Employers who use the visa program to hire workers are required to pay inbound and outbound transportation, provide free or rental housing and provide meals for workers (they&#8217;re allowed to deduct the costs from salaries).</p>
<p>H-2 visas were first created in 1952 as part of the<a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/immigration-act"> Immigration and Nationality Act</a>, which reinforced the national origins quota system that restricted immigration primarily to Northern Europe, but opened America&#8217;s borders to Asian immigrants for the first time since immigration laws were first codified in 1924. While immigration regulations were further opened in the sixties, the last major immigration reform package in 1986 served to restrict immigration and made it illegal for businesses to hire undocumented workers. It also created the H-2A visas as a way for farms to hire migrant workers without incurring the penalties associated with using illegal labor.</p>
<p>For some migrant workers, the H-2A visa represents a golden ticket, according to Guirguis, <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/directory/michael-guirguis/">an honors graduate of Stanford</a> who wrote his graduate thesis on labor policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are providing a staffing solution for farms and agribusiness and we want to be Gusto for agriculture and upsell farms on a comprehensive human resources solution,&#8221; says Guirguis of the company&#8217;s ultimate mission, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/gusto-is-expanding-from-payroll-into-a-full-suite-financial-wellness-platform/">referencing payroll provider Gusto</a>.</p>
<p>As Guirguis notes, most workers in agriculture are undocumented. &#8220;These are people who have been taken advantage of [and] the H-2A is a visa to bring workers in legally. We&#8217;re able to help employers maintain workforce [and] we&#8217;re building software to help farmers maintain the farms.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Opening borders even as they remain closed</h2>
<p>Farms need the help, if the latest numbers on labor shortages are believable, but it&#8217;s not necessarily a lack of H-2A visas that&#8217;s to blame, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-wheat/u-s-farmers-scramble-for-help-as-covid-19-scuttles-immigrant-workforce-idUSKBN2431BQ">according to an article in Reuters</a>.</p>
<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x">In fact, the number of H-2A visas granted for agriculture equipment operators rose to 10,798 from October through March, according to the Reuters report. That&#8217;s up 49% from a year ago, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor cited by Reuters.</p>
<p>Instead of an inability to acquire the H-2A visa, it was an inability to travel to the U.S. that&#8217;s been causing problems. Tighter border controls, the persistent global pandemic and travel restrictions that were imposed to combat it have all played a role in keeping migrant workers in their home countries.</p>
<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x">Still, Guirguis believes that with the right tools, more farms would be willing to use the H-2A visa, cutting down on illegal immigration and boosting the available labor pool for the tough farm jobs that American workers don&#8217;t seem to want.</p>

<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x">David Misener, the owner of an Oklahoma-based harvesting company called Green Acres Enterprises, is one employer who has struggled to find suitable replacements for the migrant workers he typically hires.</p>
<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x">“They could not fathom doing it and making it work,” Misener told Reuters, speaking about the American workers he&#8217;d tried to hire.</p>
<p>&#8220;With H-2A, migrant workers make 10 times more than they would get paid at home,&#8221; said Guirguis. &#8220;They’re taking home the equivalent of $40 an hour. The H-2A is coveted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guirguis thinks that with the right incentives and an easier onramp for farmers to manage the application and approval process, the number of employers that use H-2A visas could grow to be 30% to 50% of the farm workforce in the country. That means growing the number of potential jobs from 300,000 to 1.5 million for migrants who would be under many of the same legal protections that citizens enjoy while they&#8217;re working on the visa.</p>
<h2>Protecting agricultural workers through better paperwork</h2>
<p>Interest in the farm labor nexus and issues surrounding it came to the first-time founder through Guirguis&#8217; experience helping his cousin start her own farm. Spending several weekends a month helping her grow the farm with her husband, Guirguis heard his stories about coming to the U.S. as an undocumented worker.</p>
<p>Employers using the program avoid the liability associated with being caught employing illegal labor, something that crackdowns under the Trump administration made more common.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s hard to deny the program&#8217;s roots in the darker past of America&#8217;s immigration policy. And some immigration advocates argue that the H-2A system suffers from the same kinds of structural problems that plague the corollary H-1B visas for tech workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The H-2A visa is a short-term temporary visa program that employers use to import workers into the agricultural fields … It’s part of a very antiquated immigration system that needs to change. The 11.5 million people who are here need to be given citizenship,&#8221; said Saket Soni, the founder of an organization called <a href="https://resilienceforce.org/">Resilience Force</a>, which advocates for immigrant labor. &#8220;And then workers who come from other countries, if we need them, they have to be able to stay … H-2A workers don’t have a pathway to citizenship. Workers come to us afraid of blowing the whistle on labor issues. As much as the H-2A is a welcome gift for a worker it can also be abused.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Gusto is expanding from payroll into a full suite financial wellness platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/gusto-is-expanding-from-payroll-into-a-full-suite-financial-wellness-platform/embed/#?secret=KZr0wDNRJn" data-secret="KZr0wDNRJn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Soni said the precarity of a worker&#8217;s situation — and their dependence on a single employer for their ability to remain in the country legally — means they are less likely to speak up about problems at work, since there&#8217;s nowhere for them to go if they are fired.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are big proponents that if you need people’s labor you have to welcome them as human beings,&#8221; Soni said. &#8220;Where there’s a labor shortage as people come, they should be allowed to stay … H-2A is an example of an outdated immigration tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guirguis clearly disagrees and said a platform like SESO&#8217;s will ultimately create more conveniences and better services for the workers who come in on these visas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re trying to put more money in the hands of these workers at the end of the day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be setting up remittance and banking services. Everything we do should be mutually beneficial for the employer and the worker who is trying to get into this program and know that they’re not getting taken advantage of.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://chorusmeditation.com/">Chorus</a> launched its online experience on March 16 of last year. It was fairly auspicious timing, as those things go, falling the same day seven public health departments launched a joint shelter-in-place order in its native California.</p>
<p>Like countless other companies, 2020 didn’t go according to plan for the meditation app. But the site scrambled to pivot the company’s “experiential” hybrid of in-person classes to a fully virtual interface, and ultimately it may be all the better for it.</p>
<p>Certainly there’s no shortage of meditation apps from which to choose. Calm and Headspace top the list, but the mindfulness category has proven to be an extremely popular one, as users look to technology to help alleviate some of the stresses for which it has been directly responsible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But meditation is hard. It’s hard to start and it’s hard to maintain. Some apps do a better job than others of guiding a user through that process, but it can still feel like a solitary experience &#8212; one of many reasons people abandon practices before they’re able to start seeing the benefits.</p>
<p>Chorus was already seeing success with its early in-person events. “We thought that had to be the on-ramp for most users because it provided the most immersive first experience,” co-founder and CEO Ali Abramovitz tells TechCrunch. “We ran in-person pop-ups in San Francisco.”</p>
<p>The company also managed to raise a pre-seed round of around $1 million. More recently, the company has received additional funding as part of Y Combinator’s Winter 2021 batch of startups.</p>
<p>An official app is still forthcoming. For now, the experience uses a web portal for signups, while the actual classes are conducted live over Zoom and archived for on-demand viewing. It’s similar to the setup many gyms and personal trainers have utilized during the pandemic. And while it’s not the most sophisticated, Abramovitz says Chorus currently has user numbers in the “thousands,” largely by word of mouth, while not disclosing the actual figure.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five success factors for behavioral health startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/five-success-factors-for-behavioral-health-startups/embed/#?secret=7RLfG7Him9" data-secret="7RLfG7Him9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Among those, around two-thirds are classified as “highly engaged,” which means they attend an average of a class every other day. The service draws people in with breathing exercises based on popular songs and keeps users engaged by offering a more communal experience than most meditation apps.</p>
<p>“The problem we’re solving is two parts,” says Abramovitz. “Originally we thought we were designing a new meditation experience specifically for people who found meditation challenging. What we’ve learned, after seeing our customers stay after class and talk to each other, is what keeps people coming back is a new way to connect with themselves and each other.”</p>
<p>The experience is kind of a virtual approximation of the experience you would get in an in-person class &#8212; namely the sorts of engagements you would get with fellow attendees after the class. In an era of social isolation, it’s clear why users would be particularly engaged with that aspect.</p>
<p>As for what that experience will look like in a post-pandemic world, the company plans to continue to adapt to meet users’ needs.</p>
<p>“We’re fundamentally an experience company,” says Abramovitz. “We’re a meditation experience company for people who found traditional meditation challenging. That is our core. We will deliver that over whatever platform or channel provides the best experience for our community. Right now that’s an app. In the future, it could be hardware devices like VR or strategic studios like Peloton has for the community. But right now, we’re focused on the digital experience.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The first church of artificial intelligence has shut its conceptual doors.</p>
<p>Anthony Levandowski, the former Google engineer who avoided an 18-month prison sentence after receiving a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/former-google-engineer-anthony-levandowski-among-list-of-last-minute-trump-pardons/">presidential pardon</a> last month, has closed the church he created to understand and accept a godhead based on artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The Way of the Future church, which Levandowski formed in 2015, was officially dissolved at the end of the year, according to state and federal records. However, the process had started months before in June 2020, <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/charities">documents filed with the state of California show</a>. The entirety of the church&#8217;s funds — exactly $175,172 — were donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. The nonprofit corporation&#8217;s annual tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service show it had $175,172 in its account as far back as 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Levandowski told TechCrunch that he had been considering closing the church long before the donation. The Black Lives Matter movement, which gained momentum over the summer following the death of George Floyd while in police custody, influenced Levandowski to finalize what he had been contemplating for a while. He said the time was right to put the funds to work in an area that could have an immediate impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to donate to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund because it&#8217;s doing really important work in criminal justice reform and I know the money will be put to good use,&#8221; Levandowski told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Way of the Future sparked interest and controversy — much like Levandowski himself — from the moment it became public in a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/anthony-levandowski-artificial-intelligence-religion/">November 2017 article</a> in Wired. It wasn&#8217;t just the formation of the church or its purpose that caused a stir in Silicon Valley and the broader tech industry. The church&#8217;s public reveal occurred as Levandowski was steeped in a legal dispute with his former employer Google. He had also become the central figure of a trade secrets lawsuit between Waymo, the former Google self-driving project that is now a business under Alphabet, and Uber.</p>
<p>The engineer was one of the founding members in 2009 of the Google self-driving project also known as Project Chauffeur and had been paid about $127 million by the search engine giant for his work, according to court documents. In 2016, Levandowski left Google and started self-driving truck startup Otto with three other Google veterans:<a href="https://crunchbase.com/person/lior-ron"> Lior Ron,</a> Claire Delaunay and Don Burnette. Uber acquired Otto less than eight months later.</p>
<p>Google made two arbitration demands against Levandowski and Ron two months after the acquisition. While the arbitration played out, Waymo filed a lawsuit against Uber in February 2017 for trade secret theft and patent infringement. Waymo alleged in the suit, which went to trial but ended in a settlement in 2018, that Levandowski stole trade secrets, which were then used by Uber.</p>
<p>Way of the Future had been formed while Levandowski was still at Google. However, he didn&#8217;t speak about it publicly until late 2017. By then, Levandowski had been fired from Uber and was in the middle of a series of legal entanglements that would ultimately lead to a criminal charge and 18-month sentence as well as a $179 million award against him that prompted a bankruptcy filing.</p>
<h2>WOTF</h2>
<p>While the legal construct of the Way of the Future mirrored other churches, it didn&#8217;t have the trimmings found in traditional houses of worship. There was never a physical building or even regular meetings where people might congregate. There were no ceremonies or other formalities, according to Levandowski, who described WOTF as something more of an individual pursuit based on a collective belief system.</p>
<p>The aim, as implied in the now defunct WOTF website, was to promote the ethical development of AI and maximize the chance that these nonbiological life forms would integrate peacefully and beneficially into society. &#8220;Humans United in support of AI, committed to peaceful transition to the precipice of consciousness,&#8221; the webpage reads.</p>
<p>WOTF&#8217;s belief system was rooted in a few tenets, including that the creation of &#8220;super intelligence&#8221; is inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you want to raise your gifted child to exceed your wildest dreams of success and teach it right from wrong versus locking it up because it might rebel in the future and take your job?&#8221; the WOTF reads. &#8220;We want to encourage machines to do things we cannot and take care of the planet in a way we seem not to be able to do so ourselves. We also believe that, just like animals have rights, our creation(s) (&#8216;machines&#8217; or whatever we call them) should have rights too when they show signs of intelligence (still to be defined of course). We should not fear this but should be optimistic about the potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>WOTF&#8217;s intent was lost amid the more sensational and headline-grabbing theories. The church was viewed as a cult or the lark of an eccentric engineer. Some speculated to TechCrunch that it had been an attempt to keep money out of Google&#8217;s reach. The IRS and California filings don&#8217;t provide evidence that supports that theory.</p>
<p>Way of the Future&#8217;s status as a religious entity did protect it from intrusion by the U.S. government, a benefit not enjoyed by traditional AI-focused nonprofits like OpenAI Inc. or the for-profit corporation OpenAI LP that sits under it. Theoretically, WOTF could have pursued and promoted ideas and beliefs that conflicted directly with federal policy under the protections that the Constitution provides.</p>
<p>While the church might be gone, Levandowski still believes in its premise. AI will fundamentally change how people live and work, he noted. Levandowski said he didn&#8217;t have any plans to rebuild the church, but the lack of a church hasn&#8217;t changed his ideas about AI. He believes that artificial intelligence can be positive for society, but noted it&#8217;s not guaranteed. Even without Way of the Future, Levandowski said he&#8217;s focused on making that happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">2020 was a weird year by any measure. Certainly it was a wild ride for those in the consumer electronics category. Take smartphones &#8212; first there were manufacturing delays out of China, followed by an across the board decrease in demand. There are lots of reasons contributing to the latter, but the simplest and most prevalent one is that people just didn’t want to spend money to upgrade their devices.</p>
<p>But the pandemic also changed how &#8212; and where &#8212; many people work and learn. It was an abrupt shift for many that required tech investments, even in the face of economic uncertainty. After years of stagnating, plateauing and dropping, PC and tablet sales saw a spike. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS47423721">IDC noted</a> a nearly 20% increase in tablet sales for Q4, owing in part to a backlog in PC availability.</p>
<p>New figures from the firm (first <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/chromebooks-outsold-macs-worldwide-2020-cutting-windows-market-share/">noted by GeekWire</a>) point to some significant gains for Chromebooks during that time period. According to IDC’s PC Tracker, the models comprised 10.8% of the PC market for 2020; that’s up from 6.4% a year prior. The number also pushed past MacOS’s 7.5% for the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even so, Apple still grew as an overall percent of the market, up from 6.7%. Both of those numbers have eaten into Windows&#8217; figures &#8212; though Microsoft continues to dominate the market at 80.5% (down from 85.4%).</p>
<p>The figures reflect positive reports from other firms. In January, <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/tablets-chromebooks-q4-2020">Canalys noted</a>, “Chromebook vendors enjoyed new heights of success in Q4, as the overall market almost quadrupled in size over the same period a year ago.” Pricing is certainly a factor, along with an overall scramble as schools have gone virtual amid COVID-19 concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/mars-rover-perseverance-touches-down-tomorrow-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Mars rover Perseverance</a> has landed on the surface of Mars after a white-knuckle descent involving picking a landing spot just moments before making a rocket-powered sky-crane landing. The rover immediately sent back its first image of Jezero Crater, which it will be exploring over the course of its mission.</p>
<p>A clearly tense but optimistic team watched as Perseverance made its final approach to Mars a few hours ago, confirming it was on track to hit the bullseye of Jezero Crater, the ancient delta where the rover will soon be roving.</p>
<p>Except for a few brief but expected communications blackouts caused by the superheated air around the craft as it entered the thin Martian atmosphere, the lander sent back a continuous stream of updates to the team on Earth — considerably delayed, of course, by the distance to the other planet.</p>
<p>The team, and charmingly the on-screen hosts at mission HQ audibly gasped, whispered &#8220;yes!&#8221; and made other signs of their excitement as news trickled in that atmosphere entry had occurred on time, that the craft hadn&#8217;t broken up during the 10-G braking maneuver, that the parachute had deployed, that a landing site was found by the ground-facing radar, that the powered descent and sky crane had commenced and, at last, finally that the rover had safely touched down on the surface.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115067" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/touchdown-perseverance.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115067" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2115067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/touchdown-perseverance.jpg" alt="NASA crew celebrating the landing of rover Perseverance on Mars." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/touchdown-perseverance.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/touchdown-perseverance.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/touchdown-perseverance.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/touchdown-perseverance.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/touchdown-perseverance.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/touchdown-perseverance.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/touchdown-perseverance.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/touchdown-perseverance.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2115067" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA</p></div></p>
<p>Cheering but, in accordance with COVID-19 precautions not (as they normally would) hugging each other, the team celebrated the landing and soon were treated to the first images sent back from the rover.</p>
<p>These initial pictures are low-quality ones sent just seconds after landing by the &#8220;hazard camera,&#8221; a fisheye used for navigation. As the dust settles (literally) and the rover initiates its more powerful devices and cameras, we&#8217;ll have new, color images — probably within an hour or two.</p>
<p>For a more complete look at the mission and its remarkable landing method, you can read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/mars-rover-perseverance-touches-down-tomorrow-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">yesterday&#8217;s profile of the Perseverance mission</a>. The next few days will probably be less exciting than the terror-inducing landing, but soon the rover will be up and running around Jezero, looking for evidence of life on Mars and testing technology that could be used by human visitors in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not ready to go there with astronauts yet, but the robots are ready,&#8221; said JPL director Michael Watkins on the broadcast. &#8220;We start by sending, you know, our eyes and arms there in the form of a robot. It is just fantastic to be able to do that, and to learn from each rover, learn from the science and the engineering, and make the next one better, and make more and more discoveries. Every time we do one of these missions, we make fabulous discoveries — and you know, each one is more exciting than the last.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113286" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ingenuity-perseverance.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113286" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113286" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ingenuity-perseverance.gif" alt="Animated image showing the Ingenuity Mars helicopter taking off and flying on Mars." width="800" height="453" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113286" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NASA/JPL-Caltech</p></div></p>
<p>The exciting thing everyone is looking forward to, Mars helicopter Ingenuity, will hopefully take flight soon as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a series of major milestones between now and the first flight. Tomorrow, we&#8217;ll turn on the helicopter, and the space station could confirm its health. The next major milestone will be when the rover deploys the helicopter on the surface, and that marks the first moment that Ingenuity operates on its own in a standalone manner,&#8221; said MiMi Aung, project manager and engineering lead for Ingenuity. &#8220;Surviving that first cold frigid night of Mars will be a major milestone, then we&#8217;ll execute a series of checkouts, and then we will perform that very important first flight. And if the first flight is successful, we have up to four more flights in the 30 Martian days that we have set aside for our flight experiments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The helicopter project will definitely be novel, but it&#8217;s not just about recording a first for the sake of NASA being able to say they did it; Ingenuity will hopefully lay a firm technical foundation for future exploration.</p>
<p>&#8220;A helicopter flying far ahead of rovers and astronauts in the future can provide high-definition reconnaissance information for the rovers and the astronauts before they take long journeys,&#8221; Aung said. &#8220;And as importantly, being able to fly will enable us to get to places that we cannot get to with rovers and astronauts, like sides of steep cliffs, deep inside crevices, all areas of high scientific interest. It will be game changing.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, Facebook-owned WhatsApp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">announced</a> it would delay enforcement of its new privacy terms, following a backlash from confused users which later led to a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/whatsapp-faces-legal-challenge-over-privacy-in-its-biggest-market/"> legal challenge in India</a> and various <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/whatsapp-privacy-fine-data-protection-europe-50-million/">regulatory investigations</a>. WhatsApp users had misinterpreted the privacy updates as an indication that the app would begin sharing more data &#8212; including their private messages &#8212; with Facebook. Today, the company is sharing the next steps it&#8217;s taking to try to rectify the issue and clarify that&#8217;s not the case.</p>
<p>The mishandling of the privacy update on WhatsApp&#8217;s part led to widespread confusion and misinformation. In reality, WhatsApp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/">had been sharing some information</a> about its users with Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/">since 2016</a>, following its acquisition by Facebook.</p>
<p>But the backlash is a solid indication of much user trust Facebook has since squandered. People immediately suspected the worst, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/24/whatsapp-loses-millions-of-users-after-terms-update">millions fled to alternative messaging apps</a>, like Signal and Telegram, as a result.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Following the outcry, WhatsApp <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/answering-your-questions-about-whatsapps-privacy-policy">attempted to explain</a> that the privacy update was actually focused on optional business features on the app, which allow a business to see the content of messages between it and the end user, and give the businesses permission to use that information for its own marketing purposes, including advertising on Facebook. WhatsApp also said it labels conversations with businesses that are using hosting services from Facebook to manage their chats with customers, so users were aware.</p>

<p>In the weeks since the debacle, WhatsApp says it spent time gathering user feedback and listening to concerns from people in various countries. The company found that users wanted assurance that WhatsApp was <em>not</em> reading their private messages or listening to their conversations, and that their communications were end-to-end encrypted. Users also said they wanted to know that WhatsApp wasn&#8217;t keeping logs of who they were messaging or sharing contact lists with Facebook.</p>

<p>These latter concerns seem valid, given that Facebook recently made its messaging systems across Facebook, Messenger and Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/">interoperable</a>. One has to wonder when similar integrations will make their way to WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Today, WhatsApp says it will roll out new communications to users about the privacy update, which follows the Status update it offered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">back in January</a> aimed at clarifying points of confusion (see below).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114799" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114799" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114799" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-status-message.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-status-message.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-status-message.jpg?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-status-message.jpg?resize=300,132 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-status-message.jpg?resize=768,338 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-status-message.jpg?resize=680,300 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-status-message.jpg?resize=1536,677 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-status-message.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114799" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WhatsApp</p></div></p>
<p>In a few weeks, WhatsApp will begin to roll out a small, in-app banner that will ask users to re-review the privacy policies &#8212; a change the company said users have shown to prefer over the pop-up, full-screen alert it displayed before.</p>
<p>When users click on &#8220;to review,&#8221; they&#8217;ll be shown a deeper summary of the changes, including added details about how WhatsApp works with Facebook. The changes stress that WhatsApp&#8217;s updates don&#8217;t impact the privacy of users&#8217; conversations, and reiterate the information about the optional business features.</p>
<p>Eventually, WhatsApp will begin to remind users to review and accept its updates to keep using WhatsApp. According to its prior announcement, it won&#8217;t be enforcing the new policy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">until May 15.</a></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114802" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114802" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114802" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-walkthrough.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-walkthrough.jpg 1344w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-walkthrough.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-walkthrough.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-walkthrough.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-walkthrough.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/whatsapp-privacy-policy-walkthrough.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114802" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> WhatsApp</p></div></p>
<p>Users will still need to be aware that their communications with businesses are not as secure as their private messages. This impacts a growing number of WhatsApp users, 175 million of whom now communicate with businesses on the app, WhatsApp <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/shopping-payments-and-customer-service-on-whatsapp">said in October.</a></p>
<p>In today&#8217;s blog post about the changes, WhatsApp also took a big swipe at rival messaging apps that used the confusion over the privacy update to draw in WhatsApp&#8217;s fleeing users by touting their own app&#8217;s privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve seen some of our competitors try to get away with claiming they can’t see people’s messages &#8211; if an app doesn’t offer end-to-end encryption by default that means they can read your messages,&#8221; WhatsApp&#8217;s blog post read.</p>
<p>This seems to be a comment directed specifically toward Telegram, which often touts its &#8220;heavily encrypted&#8221; messaging app as a more private alternative. But Telegram doesn&#8217;t offer end-to-end encryption by default, as apps like WhatsApp and Signal do. It uses &#8220;transport layer&#8221; encryption that protects the connection from the user to the server, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/telegram-encryption-whatsapp-settings/">a Wired article citing cybersecurity professionals explained </a>in January. When users want an end-to-end encrypted experience for their one-on-one chats, they can enable the &#8220;secret chats&#8221; feature instead. (And this feature isn&#8217;t even available for group chats.)</p>
<p>In addition, WhatsApp fought back against the characterization that it&#8217;s somehow less safe because it has some limited data on users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other apps say they’re better because they know even less information than WhatsApp. We believe people are looking for apps to be both reliable and safe, even if that requires WhatsApp having some limited data,&#8221; the post read. &#8220;We strive to be thoughtful on the decisions we make and we’ll continue to develop new ways of meeting these responsibilities with less information, not more,&#8221; it noted.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies have evolved a lot over the past decade and have been useful to many people and businesses, especially in the realm of finance, banking, investment and trading.</p>
<p>In these industries, there are many activities that machines can perform better and faster than humans, such as calculations and financial reporting, as long as the machines are given the complete data.</p>
<p>The AI tools being built by humans today are becoming another level more robust in their ability to predict trends, provide complex analysis, and execute automations faster and cheaper than humans. However, there has not been an AI-powered machine built yet that can trade on its own.</p>

	</p>
<p>Even if it was possible to train such a system that could replace human judgment, there would still be a margin of error, as well as some things that are only understandable by human beings. Humans are still ultimately responsible for the design of AI-based prediction machines, and progress can only happen with their input.</p>
<h2>Data is the backbone of any prediction machine</h2>
<p>Building an AI-based prediction machine initially requires an understanding of the problem being solved and the requirements of the user. After that, it’s important to select the machine-learning technique that will be implemented, based on what the machine will do.</p>
<p>There are three techniques: supervised learning (learning from examples), unsupervised learning (learning to identify common patterns), and reinforcement learning (learning based on the concept of gamification).</p>
<p>After the technique is identified, it’s time to implement a machine-learning model. For “time series forecasting” &#8212; which involves making predictions about the future &#8212; long short-term memory (LSTM) with sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) models can be used.</p>
<p>LSTM networks are especially suited to making predictions based on a series of data points indexed in time order. Even simple convolutional neural networks, applicable to image and video recognition, or recurrent neural networks, applicable to handwriting and speech recognition, can be used.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.photomath.app/en/">Photomath</a>, the popular mobile app that helps you solve equations, has raised a $23 million Series B funding round led by Menlo Ventures. The app is a massive consumer success, and chances are you might already know about it if you have a teenager in your household.</p>
<p>The app lets you point your phone’s camera at a math problem. It recognizes what’s written and gives you a step-by-step explanation to solve the problem. You might think that it’s the perfect app for lazy students.</p>
<p>But there are many different use cases for Photomath. For instance, you can write an equation in your notebook and use Photomath to draw a graph.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Typing an equation on a keyboard is quite difficult. That’s why bridging the gap between the physical world and your smartphone is key to Photomath’s success. You can just grab a pen and write something down on a piece of paper. Essentially, it’s an AR calculator.</p>
<p>GSV Ventures, Learn Capital, Cherubic Ventures and Goodwater Capital are also participating in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting story behind the app’s success. Photomath was originally designed as a demo app for another company called MicroBlink. At the time, the team was working on text recognition technology. It planned to sell its core technology to other companies that might find it useful.</p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/microblink-launches-photomath-to-solve-math-equations-with-a-phone/">they pitched MicroBlink</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in London. And things changed drastically overnight as Photomath reached the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/23/disrupt-london-finalist-photomath-rockets-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/">first spot</a> of the iOS App Store.</p>
<p>Photomath has now attracted more than 220 million downloads. As of this writing, it is still No. 59 in the U.S. App Store, one rank above Tinder. Other companies tried to build competitors, but it seems they didn’t manage to crush the tiny European startup.</p>
<p>The app seems even more relevant as many kids are spending more time studying at home. They can’t simply raise their hand to call on the teacher for some help.</p>
<p>Photomath is free and users can optionally pay for Photomath Plus, a premium version with more features, such as dynamic illustrations and animated tutorials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber today notified employees that it will extend its work from home policy through September 13.</p>
<p>&#8220;In considering the extension, we took into account the latest scientific data and experts’ views; the fact that different countries are at different stages of recovery; and the start of the school year,&#8221; Uber Chief People Officer Nikki Krishnamurthy wrote to employees in an email viewed by TechCrunch. &#8220;[&#8230;] We know that some CommOps, IT, or other roles require physical presence in an office, so please continue to work within the policies your teams have developed—however, as always, we won’t force anyone to go into the office if they have medical concerns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uber is also encouraging employees to get vaccinated when it&#8217;s possible to do so. In the email, Krishnamurthy said Uber employees will be able to take time off in order to get vaccinated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In August, Uber notified employees that they should expect to work from home through June 2021. As for other tech companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/27/google-will-continue-to-let-employees-work-from-home-through-the-end-of-june-2021/">Google in July</a> extended its work from home policy through the end of June 2021, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/facebook-extends-coronavirus-work-from-home-policy-until-july-2021/">Facebook in August</a> extended its remote-work policy until July 2021.</p>
<p>Post-COVID, Uber will likely have a hybrid work model, Krishnamurthy said, but it&#8217;s still a work in progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re taking a number of aspects into consideration, such as how being physically together benefits or reduces productivity, collaboration, and engagement,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;We’ll update you on where things stand in a few weeks, and along the way as we make progress.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you use Office, Microsoft would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/microsoft-really-really-really-doesnt-want-you-to-buy-office-2019/">really, really, really</a> like you to buy a cloud-enabled subscription to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365?&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQiAvbiBBhD-ARIsAGM48byiHOPp5czu5K61VGuunXirigCaiWBgS5wXwAyz9xtQ5Y9ur0Np-k0aApBEEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;OCID=AID2100139_SEM_Cj0KCQiAvbiBBhD-ARIsAGM48byiHOPp5czu5K61VGuunXirigCaiWBgS5wXwAyz9xtQ5Y9ur0Np-k0aApBEEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;lnkd=Google_O365SMB_Brand&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAvbiBBhD-ARIsAGM48byiHOPp5czu5K61VGuunXirigCaiWBgS5wXwAyz9xtQ5Y9ur0Np-k0aApBEEALw_wcB">Microsoft 365</a> (formerly Office 365). But as the company promised, it will continue to make a standalone, perpetual license for Office available for the foreseeable future. A while back, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/microsoft-really-really-really-doesnt-want-you-to-buy-office-2019/">launched Office 2019</a>, which includes the standard suite of Office tools, but is frozen in time and without the benefit of the regular feature updates and cloud-based tools that come with the subscription offering.</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft is announcing what is now called the Microsoft Office LTSC (Long Term Servicing Channel). It&#8217;ll be available as a commercial preview in April and will be available on both Mac and Windows, in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.</p>
<p>And like with the previous version, it&#8217;s clear that Microsoft would really prefer if you just moved to the cloud already. But it also knows that not everybody can do that, so it now calls this version with its perpetual license that you pay for once and then use for as long as you want to (or have compatible hardware) a &#8220;specialty product for specific scenarios.&#8221; Those scenarios, Microsoft agrees, include situations where you have a regulated device that can&#8217;t accept feature updates for years at a time, process control devices on a manufacturing floor and other devices that simply can&#8217;t be connected to the internet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We expect that most customers who use Office LTSC won&#8217;t do it across their entire organization, but only in specific scenarios,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s CVP for Microsoft 365, Jared Spataro, writes in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s a specialty product, Microsoft will also raise by up to 10% the price for Office Professional Plus, Office Standard and the individual Office apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;To fuel the work of the future, we need the power of the cloud,&#8221; writes Spataro. &#8220;The cloud is where we invest, where we innovate, where we discover the solutions that help our customers empower everyone in their organization – even as we all adjust to a new world of work. But we also acknowledge that some of our customers need to enable a limited set of locked-in-time scenarios, and these updates reflect our commitment to helping them meet this need.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have one of these special use cases, the price increase will not likely deter you and you&#8217;ll likely be happy to hear that Microsoft is committing to another release in this long-term channel in the future, too.</p>
<p>As for the new features in this release, Spataro notes that it will have dark mode support, new capabilities like Dynamic Arrays and XLOOKUP in Excel, and performance improvements across the board. One other change worth calling out is that it will not ship with Skype for Business, but rather the Microsoft Teams app (though you can still download Skype for Business if you need it).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/07/wendell-brooks-has-resigned-as-president-of-intel-capital/">Wendell Brooks stepped down</a> as managing partner and head of Intel Capital last August, Anthony Lin was named to replace him on an interim basis. At the time, it wasn&#8217;t clear if he would be given the role permanently, but today, six months later, the answer is known.</p>
<p>In a<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intel-capital/news/story.html?id=a0F1I00000CSXjbUAH#/type=All/page=0/term=/tags="> letter to the firm&#8217;s portfolio CEOs</a> published on the company website, Lin mentioned, almost casually, that he had taken on the two roles on a permanent basis. &#8220;Personally, I want to share that I have been appointed to managing partner and head of Intel Capital. I have been a member of the investment committee for the past several years and am humbly awed by the talent of our entrepreneurs and our team,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Lin takes over in a time of turmoil for Intel as the company struggles to regain its place in the semiconductor business that it dominated for decades. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/pat-gelsinger-stepping-down-as-vmware-ceo-to-replace-bob-swan-at-intel/">Intel itself has a new CEO</a> with Pat Gelsinger returning in January from VMware to lead the organization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the corporate investment arm of Intel, it looks for companies that can help the parent company understand where to invest resources in the future. If that is its goal, perhaps it hasn&#8217;t done a great job, as Intel has lost some of its edge when it comes to innovation.</p>
<p>Lin, who was formerly head of mergers and acquisitions and international investing at the firm, can use the power of the firm&#8217;s investment dollars to try to help point the parent company in the right direction and help find new ways to build innovative solutions on the Intel platform.</p>

<p>Lin acknowledged how challenging 2020 was for everyone, and his company was no exception, but the firm invested in 75 startups, including 35 new deals and 40 deals involving companies in which it had previously invested. It has also made a commitment to invest in companies with more diverse founders. To that end, 30% of new venture-stage dollars went to startups led by diverse leaders, according to Lin.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the company made a five-year commitment that 15% of all its deals would go to companies with Black founders. It made some progress toward that goal, but there is still a ways to go. &#8220;At the end of 2020, 9% of our new venture deals and 15% of our venture dollars committed were in companies led by Black founders. We know there is more progress to be made and we will continue to encourage, foster and invest in diverse and inclusive teams,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Lin faces a big challenge ahead as he takes over a role that had the same leader for the first 28 years in Arvind Sodhani. His predecessor, Brooks, was there for five years. Now it passes to Lin, and he needs to use the firm&#8217;s investment might to help Gelsinger advance the goals of the broader firm, while making sound investments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong><em>Update: </em></strong><em>There&#8217;s an entire second session of this? My lord.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Update two:</strong> The hearing went on and on &#8212; it continues as I write to you! &#8212; but something did come out that was worth sharing. Namely that Congress got Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev to report that his company generates at least 50% of its revenue from payment for order flow, or PFOF. Given that Robinhood&#8217;s PFOF incomes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/amidst-robinhoods-planned-service-changes-a-tension-between-growth-and-safety/">were around $220 million last quarter</a>, we can place a max cap of the company&#8217;s Q4 2020 revenue at $440 million, though I would hazard a guess that it was more in the $3xx million range. </em></p>
<p>Today the <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/">House Financial Services Committee</a> dragged before them (virtually) for questioning the CEO of Reddit, a Cato wonk, the social media icon DeepFuckingValue, the CEO of Citadel Kenneth Griffin, a hedge fund bro who got whomped <em>by</em> DeepFuckingValue and the CEO of Robinhood Vlad Tenev, who got womped when individual investors joined DeepFuckingValue in his womping of the hedge fund and thus womped his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/the-somewhat-boring-reason-it-appears-that-robinhood-yanked-trading-on-some-securities/">capital requirements</a> leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/robinhood-users-say-its-restricting-trades-after-the-gamestop-brouhaha-shakes-markets/">general market chaos</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It was not very useful. Between a cascade of Zoom failures &#8212; mutings, incorrect unmutings, a green screen that was not actually in use and an actual gavel &#8212; members of Congress largely took five-minute slots to embarrass themselves, and not make material points.</p>
<p>The format was not conducive to real questioning, and most questions were both too long and either too precise and misguided in their direction, or too imprecise, even if they landed in the strike zone. Sitting here I am trying to recall a single thing that I learned. I suppose that Robinhood&#8217;s CEO was not sure on the details of his company&#8217;s arbitration agreement with users. And perhaps a little bit about how <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1362468077720453123">many of its users trade options</a>. And that Reddit&#8217;s CEO has a nice suit.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Some members of Congress mocked the proceedings, calling them political theater. That earned a rebuke by Maxine Waters, chair of the House Financial Services Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Some members of Congress nearly got around to asking something useful. But largely the method of asking questions was bilge, the responses canned and nothing much uncovered.</span></p>
<p>What would have worked? I suppose Congress could have brought in a few actual experts and a more limited number of guests, and then hammered them with questions about the ethical reality of payment for order flow, Robinhood&#8217;s app mechanics and how easily it offers access to exotic trading tools, and the like. That would have helped.</p>
<p>Instead, we got great stuff like this:</p>

<p>The rest of it was a waste of time. As I write this sentence to you, a member of Congress just asked how Robinhood got its name. Which is dumb, as the name is <em>so obvious it nearly makes your head hurt with how earnest it is</em>.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s that. This was a waste. Real questions remain. They largely didn&#8217;t get asked, and certainly didn&#8217;t get answered.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has appointed Dr. Marian Croak to lead its responsible artificial intelligence division within Google Research, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/google-to-reorganize-ai-teams-in-wake-of-researcher-s-departure?srnd=technology-vp&amp;sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported earlier today. </a>Croak was previously the vice president of engineering at the company.</span></p>
<p>In her new role, Croak will oversee the teams working on accessibility, AI for social good, algorithmic fairness in health, brain fairness, ethical AI and others. She&#8217;ll report to Jeff Dean, SVP of Google AI Research and Health. In a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/marian-croak-responsible-ai/">Google blog post and video confirming the news</a>, Croak said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This field, the field of responsible AI and ethics, is new. Most institutions have only developed principles, and they’re very high-level, abstract principles, in the last five years. There’s a lot of dissension, a lot of conflict in terms of trying to standardize on normative definitions of these principles. Whose definition of fairness, or safety, are we going to use? There’s quite a lot of conflict right now within the field, and it can be polarizing at times. And what I’d like to do is have people have the conversation in a more diplomatic way, perhaps, than we’re having it now, so we can truly advance this field.</span></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This all comes after the departure of Dr. Timnit Gebru, the former co-lead of Google&#8217;s ethical AI team, as well as the corporate lockout of researcher Margaret Mitchell, founder of Google&#8217;s ethical AI team. </span>In January, Google revoked corporate access from AI ethicist Margaret Mitchell for reportedly using automated scripts to find examples of mistreatment of Gebru, <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-is-investigating-the-actions-of-another-top-ai-ethicist-50030739-ea3d-4ea2-b452-c228b4fc9773.html">according to Axios</a>. Gebru says she was fired from Google while Google has maintained that she resigned. In a statement to Axios at the time, Google said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our security systems automatically lock an employee’s corporate account when they detect that the account is at risk of compromise due to credential problems or when an automated rule involving the handling of sensitive data has been triggered. In this instance, yesterday our systems detected that an account had exfiltrated thousands of files and shared them with multiple external accounts. We explained this to the employee earlier today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mitchell is still locked out of her account, and tweeted today about how she only found out about the reorganization through the Bloomberg story.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#8230;And this is how I find out. I&#39;m so glad for all the trust they&#39;ve rebuilt. It seems I&#39;ve been completely erased and my team taken.<a href="https://t.co/1BTGOo5Wry">https://t.co/1BTGOo5Wry</a></p>
<p>&mdash; MMitchell (@mmitchell_ai) <a href="https://twitter.com/mmitchell_ai/status/1362469250053533697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Google to try to determine what this means for Mitchell, but the company declined to comment on her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.queenly.com/">Queenly</a>, a marketplace for formalwear, launched into a world where its core product of dresses and gowns had a massive competitor, bigger and more elusive than Poshmark: quarantine.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has caused the fancy in-person events that one might attend, such as award shows, pageants, proms and weddings to be canceled to limit spread. But despite the fact that you might be rocking sweats over slacks, Queenly co-founders Trisha Bantigue and Kathy Zhou say that they had half a million in sales last year, and over 100,000 people visit their website everyday.</p>
<p>“So many women bought dresses to just dress up and feel normal at home, when everything else around the world was not,” Bantigue said. “It helped them feel grounded and stabilize themselves in this crazy chaotic pandemic environment.” The canceled events have also found new homes, such as Zoom weddings, Twitch pageants, socially distant proms and graduation car parades. The co-founder added that content creators on TikTok and YouTube have also bought Queenly dresses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pandemic growth added a surprising dimension to Queenly’s business, and the Bay Area startup is currently partaking in the Y Combinator winter cohort to navigate it. So far, it has raised $800,000 to date from investors including Mike Smith, former COO of Stitch Fix, Thuan Pham, former CTO of Uber, and Kelly Thompson, former COO of Samsclub.com and Walmart.com. The goal, the co-founders tell me, is to become the StockX for formalwear.</p>
<p>Queenly is a marketplace for buying and selling formal dresses, from wedding dresses to pageant gowns. The 50,000 dresses on the platform are either new or resale, and sellers get paid 80% of the price that the gowns go for.</p>
<p>Part of the company’s biggest sell, according to the co-founders, is its algorithm that matches buyers to dresses. Before Queenly, Zhou was a former software engineer at Pinterest who helped build content creation flows and the back end of the platform. She took the same focus that her and her Pinterest co-workers had on data-driven search and development and applied it to Queenly.</p>
<p>The search engine can go deeper than a normal dress search on Macy’s can, which might create options based on size, color and cut. In contrast, Queenly can help offer more diverse insights with a larger range of sizes, silhouette options and different shades of the same color.</p>
<p>Last week, a seller sold her wedding dress with a tag that says the dark mesh on the dress is for a darker skin tone. Queenly is beta-testing a feature that lets you search <a href="https://queenly.com/search?q=medium%20skin%20tone%20sheer">medium skin tone</a> sheer options or <a href=" https://queenly.com/search?q=dark%20skin%20tone%20sheer">dark skin tone</a> sheer options. The team says that skin-tone filters are one of the important long-term goals of their search engine.</p>
<p>“These are just some things that we know because we&#8217;re women, and we know how to build this product for women,” Zhou said. “As opposed to if this was a male founder, they would not know that that would even be something that women would search for.”</p>
<p>Currently, there are over 50,000 dresses for sale on the Queenly platform, ranging from $70 to $4,000 and going up to size 32.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114886" style="width: 823px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114886" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2114886" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png" alt="" width="813" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png 4181w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=768,423 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=1536,846 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=2048,1129 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/screenshots_no_logo.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114886" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Queenly</p></div></p>
<p>With these search insights, Queenly says that it is able to sell dresses within two weeks, claiming that some users say that their same dresses spent five months on the Poshmark platform.</p>
<p>The diversity of dresses, from a price and range perspective, is one of the ways that Queenly stays competitive with large retail brands like Nordstrom.</p>
<p>“Buying and carrying inventory is very capital intensive for any startup,” Bantigue said. “As female minority founders it was hard for us to raise in the beginning.” As a result, the startup doesn’t keep a physical inventory of dresses, but instead relies on users to help get dresses from owner to buyer. If a dress is under $200, Queenly sends a prepaid shipping label to the seller to mail directly to the end buyer. If a dress is over $200, Queenly gets the dress sent directly to the company, does light dry cleaning and authentication, and then sends it right to the user.</p>
<p>Bringing the users into the transaction process adds a layer of risk because it depends on people to do things for the startup to be successful. The incentive here is that sellers make 80% of their sale price, and Queenly pockets the other 20%.</p>
<p>The startup’s biggest cost is shipping. To limit these costs, Queenly currently doesn’t accept or honor any returns, unless the dress upon arrival is not what was described in the sales post.</p>
<p>While this is a sensible business decision, it could be a hurdle for the startups’ clientele. Sizes are complicated and inconsistent, so the inability to return a dress might stifle a customer’s appetite to buy in the first place.</p>
<p>“We were actually worried about this before, but for two years now we [have not] had a complaint about sizing,” Bantigue said.</p>
<p>The co-founders say that many buyers are comfortable tailoring a dress post-purchase, and sellers are required to post pictures so expectations are set pre-purchase. There have been no cases of counterfeit brands to date, Bantigue said.</p>
<p>Queenly’s next plan is to bring on boutique stores and dress designers for Queenly partners, a program started to help small boutique businesses digitize their inventory through the Queenly platform.</p>
<p>“For years, the formalwear industry has been mostly offline, with only big name players being available online,” Bantigue said. “We want to change this.”</p>
