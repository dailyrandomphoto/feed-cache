										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Newly reported <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001861449/000119312521250592/d431538ds4a.htm">financial data from Bird</a>, an American scooter sharing service, shows a company with an improving economic model, and a multi-year path to profitability. However, that path is fraught unless a number of scenarios all work out, in concert and without a glitch.</p>
<p>Bird, well-known for its <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/charting-bird-and-limes-rapid-growth/">early battles with domestic rival Lime</a>, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-to-go-public-via-spac-at-an-implied-value-of-2-3b/">pursuing a SPAC-led deal</a> that will see it go public and raise fresh capital. The former startup is merging with Switchback II Corporation in a deal that values it at around $2.3 billion, including a $160 million PIPE (private investment in public equity) component. (Note: The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">group purchasing TechCrunch&#8217;s parent company from its own parent company</a>, is <a href="https://www.bird.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Switchback-II-Corporation-and-Bird-Investor-Call-Transcript.pdf">part of the Bird PIPE</a>.)</p>

<p>COVID-19 hasn&#8217;t been kind to Bird and similar companies around the world. As many around the world stayed home, usage of shared-asset services and ride-hail applications fell sharply. Bird saw rides decline. Airbnb <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/citing-revenue-declines-airbnb-cuts-1900-jobs-or-around-25-of-its-global-workforce/">took a temporary hit</a>. Uber and Lyft saw ride demand fall.</p>

Airbnb cut costs, and raised external capital. Lyft cut expenses and focused on its core model, while Uber grew its food delivery business, which saw transaction volume soar as demand fell for its traditional business.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bird flipped its entire business model. That decision has helped the scooter outfit improve its economics markedly, giving it a shot at generating profit in the future — provided its forecasts prove achievable.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s talk about how Bird has changed its business, their impacts on its operating results, and how long the company thinks its climb to profitability is.</p>
<h2>Fleet management → Fleet managers</h2>
<p>In their initial forms, Bird and Lime bought and deployed large fleets of electric scooters. Not only was this capital intensive, the companies also wound up with costs that were more than sticky — charging wasn&#8217;t simple or cheap, moving scooters around to balance demand took both human capital and vehicles, and the list went on.</p>
<p>Throw in vehicle depreciation — the pace at which scooters in the wild degraded from use or abuse — and the businesses proved excellent vehicles for raising capital and throwing that money at more scooters, costs, and, as it turned out, losses.</p>
<p>Results improved somewhat over time, though. As scooter-share companies increasingly built their own hardware, their economics improved. Sturdier scooters meant lower depreciation, and better battery tech could allow for more rides per charge. That sort of thing.</p>
<p>But the model wasn&#8217;t incredibly lucrative even before COVID-19 hit. Costs were high, and the model did not break even even on a gross margin basis, let alone when considering all corporate expenses. You can see the financial mess from that period of operations in historical Bird results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/15dd4163-bf59-4c48-8657-5d63d69fb484?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> was back, joining <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> to chat through the week&#8217;s coming and goings. But, before we get to the official news, here&#8217;s some personal news: Danny is stepping back from his role as co-host of the Friday show! Yes, Mr. Crichton will still take part in our mid-week, deep dive episodes, but this is the conclusion of his run as part of the news roundup. We will miss him, glad that his transitions and wit will continue to be part of the Equity universe.</p>
<p>Who will take the third chair? Well, stay tuned. We have some neat things planned.</p>
<p>Now, the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Funding rounds:</strong> Maven has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/mavens-comprehensive-approach-to-womens-health-earns-it-unicorn-status/">built a women&#8217;s health unicorn</a>, Monte Carlo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/monte-carlo-closes-60m-series-c-on-the-back-of-rapid-arr-growth/">raised $60 million for data observability</a>, and Launch House <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/launch-house-raises-millions-to-launch-houses-and-the-next-big-startups/">wants to scale venture community</a> with a fresh $3 million in its accounts. The last round is probably the most controversial one of them all, so each of us took a side and discussed what&#8217;s new and old about hacker homes.</li>
<li><strong>The next crop of key IPOs:</strong> Please say hello to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/?p=2189941&amp;preview=true">rising seniors of the startup world</a>, companies that are the next IPOs that we are excited about. The list includes Discord, Databricks, Chime and Carta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/carta-says-it-just-used-its-own-product-to-establish-a-new-and-far-higher-valuation-for-itself/">which made headlines this week after setting its own valuation with its own tool.</a> Will investors and startups turn to a third-party to value companies? What happens if secondary investors aren&#8217;t as into your product as you are? We had a ton of questions.</li>
<li><strong>Brazil&#8217;s burgeoning startup and exit market: </strong>In the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/brazils-nuvemshop-raises-500m-at-a-3-1b-valuation-months-after-last-raise/">Nuvemshop raising a zillion dollars</a>, it was time to sit down and talk about Brazil. Alex and <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim</a> have been rigorous in their reporting on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/?tpcc=ECTW2020">fascinating exit market.</a> Who knew dual-listings were so dramatic?</li>
<li>After traveling overseas, we went very close to home to speak about the news industry. Danny had a piece about informed., which a trio of media veterans believe could fix the economics that plague subscription-based publications. The nuts and bolts are in the episode, but prepare to debate if you&#8217;re the kind of reader that likes a snack, or the whole lip smackin&#8217; meal.</li>
<li>Finally, we discuss the wack reality that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/yik-yak-is-back/"> YikYak is indeed back. </a></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Poland-based healthtech AI startup <a href="https://cardiomatics.com">Cardiomatics</a> has announced a $3.2M seed raise to expand use of its electrocardiogram (ECG) reading automation technology.</p>
<p>The round is led by Central and Eastern European VC Kaya, with Nina Capital, Nova Capital and Innovation Nest also participating.</p>
<p>The seed raise also includes a $1M non-equity grant from the Polish National Centre of Research and Development.</p>
<p>The 2017-founded startup sells a cloud tool to speed up diagnosis and drive efficiency for cardiologists, clinicians and other healthcare professionals to interpret ECGs &#8212; automating the detection and analyse of some 20 heart abnormalities and disorders with the software generating reports on scans in minutes, faster than a trained human specialist would be able to work.</p>
<p>Cardiomatics touts its tech as helping to democratize access to healthcare &#8212; saying the tool enables cardiologists to optimise their workflow so they can see and treat more patients. It also says it allows GPs and smaller practices to offer ECG analysis to patients without needing to refer them to specialist hospitals.</p>
<p>The AI tool has analyzed more than 3 million hours of ECG signals commercially to date, per the startup, which says its software is being used by more than 700 customers in 10+ countries, including Switzerland, Denmark, Germany and Poland.</p>
<p>The software is able to integrate with more than 25 ECG monitoring devices at this stage, and it touts offering a modern cloud software interface as a differentiator vs legacy medical software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Asked how the accuracy of its AI&#8217;s ECG readings has been validated, the startup told us: &#8220;The data set that we use to develop algorithms contains more than 10 billion heartbeats from approximately 100,000 patients and is systematically growing. The majority of the data-sets we have built ourselves, the rest are publicly available databases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ninety percent of the data is used as a training set, and 10% for algorithm validation and testing. According to the data-centric AI we attach great importance to the test sets to be sure that they contain the best possible representation of signals from our clients. We check the accuracy of the algorithms in experimental work during the continuous development of both algorithms and data with a frequency of once a month. Our clients check it everyday in clinical practice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cardiomatics said it will use the seed funding to invest in product development, expand its business activities in existing markets and gear up to launch into new markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Proceeds from the round will be used to support fast-paced expansion plans across Europe, including scaling up our market-leading AI technology and ensuring physicians have the best experience. We prepare the product to launch into new markets too. Our future plans include obtaining FDA certification and entering the US market,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The AI tool received European medical device certification in 2018 &#8212; although it&#8217;s worth noting that the European Union&#8217;s regulatory regime for medical devices and AI is continuing to evolve, with an update to the bloc&#8217;s Medial Devices Directive (now known as the EU Medical Device Regulation) coming into application earlier this year (May).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">A new risk-based framework for applications of AI</a> &#8212; aka the Artificial Intelligence Act &#8212; is also incoming and will likely expand compliance demands on AI healthtech tools like Cardiomatics, introducing requirements such as demonstrating safety, reliability and a lack of bias in automated results.</p>
<p>Asked about the regulatory landscape it said: &#8220;When we launched in 2018 we were one of the first AI-based solutions approved as medical device in Europe. To stay in front of the pace we carefully observe the situation in Europe and the process of legislating a risk-based framework for regulating applications of AI. We also monitor draft regulations and requirements that may be introduced soon. In case of introducing new standards and requirements for artificial intelligence, we will immediately undertake their implementation in the company&#8217;s and product operations, as well as extending the documentation and algorithms validation with the necessary evidence for the reliability and safety of our product.&#8221;</p>
<p>However it also conceded that objectively measuring efficacy of ECG reading algorithms is a challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;An objective assessment of the effectiveness of algorithms can be very challenging,&#8221; it told TechCrunch. &#8220;Most often it is performed on a narrow set of data from a specific group of patients, registered with only one device. We receive signals from various groups of patients, coming from different recorders. We are working on this method of assessing effectiveness. Our algorithms, which would allow them to reliably evaluate their performance regardless of various factors accompanying the study, including the recording device or the social group on which it would be tested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When analysis is performed by a physician, ECG interpretation is a function of experience, rules and art. When a human interprets an ECG, they see a curve. It works on a visual layer. An algorithm sees a stream of numbers instead of a picture, so the task becomes a mathematical problem. But, ultimately, you cannot build effective algorithms without knowledge of the domain,&#8221; it added. &#8220;This knowledge and the experience of our medical team are a piece of art in Cardiomatics. We shouldn’t forget that algorithms are also trained on the data generated by cardiologists. There is a strong correlation between the experience of medical professionals and machine learning.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Breef’s platform is democratizing how brands and boutique agencies connect with each other in the process of planning, scoping, pitching and paying for projects.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.breef.com/">Breef</a> raised $3.5 million in funding to continue developing what it boasts as “the world’s first online marketplace” for transactions between brands and agencies.</p>
<p>Greycroft led the round and was joined by Rackhouse Ventures, The House Fund, John and Helen McBain, Lance Armstrong and 640 Oxford Ventures. Including the new round, the New York and Colorado-based company has brought in total funding of $4.5 million since its inception in 2019 by husband-and-wife co-founders George Raptis and Emily Bibb.</p>
<p>Bibb’s background is in digital marketing and brand building at companies like PopSugar, VSCO and S’well, while Raptis was on the founding team at fintech company Credible.com.</p>
<p>Both said they experienced challenges in finding agencies, which traditionally involved asking for referrals and then making a bunch of calls. There were also times when their companies would be in high demand for talent, but didn&#8217;t necessarily need a full-time employee to achieve the goal or project milestone.</p>
<p>While the concept of outsourcing is not new, Breef’s differentiator is its ability to manage complex projects: a traditional individual freelance project is less than $1,000 and takes a week or less. Instead, the company is working with team-based projects that average $25,000 with a length of engagement of about six months, Raptis said.</p>
<p>Breef’s platform is democratizing how brands and boutique agencies connect with each other in the process of planning, scoping, pitching and paying for projects, Raptis told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“At the core, we are taking the agency online,” Bibb added. “We are building a platform to streamline a complicated process for outsourcing high-value work and allow users to find, pay for and work with agencies in days rather than months.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brands can draft their own brief to articulate what they need, and Breef will connect them to a short list of agencies that match those requirements. Rather than a one- or two-month search, the company is able to bring that down to five days.</p>
<p>Bibb and Raptis decided to seek venture capital after experiencing demand — millions of dollars in projects are being created on the platform each month — and some tailwinds from the shift to remote work. They saw many brands that may have originally utilized in-house teams or agencies of record turn to distributed or smaller teams.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of agency work being expensive, Breef is processing large amounts of money over the internet, and the founders want to continue developing the technology and hiring talent so that it is a secure and trustworthy system.</p>
<p>It also launched its buy now, pay later project funding service, Breef(pay), to streamline payments to agencies and reduce cash flow challenges. Users can construct their own payment terms, mix up the way they are paid and utilize a credit line or defer payments to control external spend.</p>
<p>To date, Breef has more than 5,000 vetted boutique agencies in 20 countries on its platform and is able to save its users an average of 32% in product costs compared with a traditional agency model. It boasts a customer list that includes Spotify, Brex, Shutterstock, Bluestone Lane and Kinrgy.</p>
<p>Kevin Novak, founder of Rackhouse Ventures, said he met Raptis through the Australian tech community. He recently launched his first fund targeting startups in novel applications of data.</p>
<p>“When they were talking to me about what they wanted to do, I got intrigued,” Novak said. “I like finding marketplaces where the idea is well understood by the people involved. Looking at the matching problem, Emily and George have found a unique way to find ad agencies that hasn’t existed before.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Rutter is developing a unified e-commerce API that enables companies to connect with data across any platform.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.rutterapi.com/">Rutter</a>, a remote-first company, is developing a unified e-commerce API that enables companies to connect with data across any platform.</p>
<p>On Friday the company announced it was emerging from stealth with $1.5 million in funding from a group of investors including Haystack, Liquid 2 and Basis Set Ventures.</p>
<p>Founders Eric Yu and Peter Zhou met in school and started working on Rutter, which Zhou called “Plaid for commerce,” in 2017 before going through the summer 2019 Y Combinator cohort.</p>
<p>They stumbled upon the e-commerce API idea while working in education technology last year. The pair were creating subscription kits and learning materials for parents concerned about how their children would be learning during the global pandemic. Then their vendor customers had problems listing their storefronts on Amazon, so they wrote scripts to help them, but found that they had to write separate scripts for each platform.</p>
<p>With Rutter, customers only need one script to connect anywhere. Its APIs connect to e-commerce platforms like Shopify, Walmart and Amazon so that tech customers can build functions like customer support and chatbots, Yu told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Lan Xuezhao, founding and managing partner of Basis Set Ventures, said via email that she was “super excited” about Rutter first because of the founders’ passion, grit and speed of iteration to a product. She added it reminded her of another team that successfully built a business from zero to over $7 billion.</p>
<p>“After watching them (Rutter) for a few years, it’s clear what they built is powerful: it’s the central nervous system of online commerce,” Xuezhao added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As the founders see it, there are two big explosions going on in e-commerce: the platform side with the adoption of headless commerce — the separating of front end and back end functions of an e-commerce site, and new companies coming in to support merchants.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable Yu and Zhou to build up their team, including hiring more engineers.</p>
<p>Due to the company officially launching at the beginning of the year, Yu did not disclose revenue metrics, but did say that Rutter’s API volume was doubling and tripling in the last few months. It is also supporting merchants that connect with over 5,000 stores.</p>
<p>Some of Rutter’s competitors are building one aspect of commerce, like returns, warranties and checkouts, but Yu said that since Shopify represents just 10% of e-commerce, the company’s goal is to take merchants beyond the marketplace by being “that unified app store for merchants to find products.”</p>
<p>“We think that in the future, the e-commerce stack of a merchant will look like the SaaS stack of a software company,” Zhou added. “We want to be the glue that holds that stack together for merchants.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three University of Michigan students are building <a href="https://www.seechannels.tech/">Channels Inc.</a>, a communication software tailored for physical workers, and already racking up some big customers in the event management industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaul-siddharth">Siddharth Kaul</a>, 18, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elanrosen/">Elan Rosen</a>, 20, and Ibrahim Mohammed, 20, started the company after finding some common ground in retail and events. The company’s customer list boasts names like Marriott Hotels, and it announced a $520,000 seed round, led by Sahra Growth Capital, to give it nearly $570,000 in total funding.</p>
<p>Kaul grew up going to a lot of events in Kuwait and Dubai, but started noticing there was a delay in things that should happen and many processes were being done on pen and paper.</p>
<p>“The technology that was available was inharmonious and made it hard for physical workers to fulfill tasks,” Kaul told TechCrunch. “We saw it happening in the event management space, forcing workers to coordinate across technologies.”</p>
<p>Legacy communication platforms like Slack are aggregating communications, but are better for remote workers; for physical workers, they rely more on text communication, he said. However, the disadvantage with texting is that you have to keep scrolling to get to the new message, and old communication is lost amid all of the replies.</p>
<p>They began developing a platform for small hotels to help them transition to digital and provide communication in a non-chronological order that is easier to access, enables discussion and can be searched. Users of the SaaS platform can build live personnel maps to see where employees are and what the event floor looks like, prioritize alerts and automate tasks while monitoring progress.</p>
<p>Marriott became a customer after one of its employees saw the Channels platform was being tested at an event. He saw employees pulling out their phones and asked the manager why they were doing that, and was told they were testing out the product and referred him to Kaul.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“What they thought was helpful was that it was communication, and though the employees were checking their phones, it was quick and they remained attentive,” Kaul said.</p>
<p>Channels provides a solid platform in terms of analytics and graphical representation, which is a major selling point for customers, leading to initial traction and revenue for the company that Rosen said he expects can occur at the convention level the company is striving for.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to grow in development and bring additional engineering talent to the team. In addition, it will allow Kaul and Rosen to continue with their studies, while Mohammed will be doing more full-time work. They want to increase their recurring revenue in the Middle East while building up operations in the United States.</p>
<p>Jamal Al-Barrak, managing partner of Sahra Growth Capital, said Channels was on his firm’s radar ever since they won the 2020 Dubai X-Series competition it sponsors. As a result of winning the competition, he was able to see the founders on multiple occasions and hear their growth.</p>
<p>Sahra doesn’t typically invest in companies like Channels, but the firm started a “seed sourcing effort” to make investments of between $200,000 and $800,000 into early-stage companies, Al-Barrak said. Channels is one of the first investments with that effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Channels is one of our first investments in this initiative and they look very promising so far even compared to our investments before we started this initiative,&#8221; Al-Barrak said. He liked the founders’ work ethic and their focus on the event industry, which he called, “historically outdated and bereft of technological innovation.”</p>
<p>“Sid, Elan and Ibrahim are some of the youngest yet brightest entrepreneurs I have come across to this day and I have invested in over 25 technology startups,” he said. “Additionally, I enjoyed that they had proof of concept with a prior customer base and revenue. I was most impressed by their vision past their current industry and bounds as they want to encapsulate communication for all physical workers, whether it is events, retail or more.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple recently began a research study designed to collect speech data from study participants. Earlier this month, the company launched a new iOS app called &#8220;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1564003829">Siri Speech Study</a>&#8221; on the App Store, which allows participants who have opted in to share their voice requests and other feedback with Apple. The app is available in a number of worldwide markets but does not register on the App Store&#8217;s charts, including under the &#8220;Utilities&#8221; category where it&#8217;s published.</p>
<p>According to data from Sensor Tower, the iOS app first launched on August 9 and was updated to a new version on August 18. It&#8217;s currently available in the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and Taiwan &#8212; an indication of the study&#8217;s global reach. However, the app will not appear when searching the App Store by keyword or when browsing through the list of Apple&#8217;s published apps.</p>
<p>The Siri Speech Study app itself offers little information about the study&#8217;s specific goals, nor does it explain how someone could become a participant. Instead, it only provides a link to a fairly standard license agreement and a screen where a participant would enter their ID number to get started.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Apple told TechCrunch the app is only being used for Siri product improvements, by offering a way for participants to share feedback directly with Apple. The company also explained people have to be invited to the study &#8212; there&#8217;s not a way for consumers to sign up to join.</p>

<p>The app is only one of many ways Apple is working to improve Siri.</p>
<p>In the past, Apple had tried to learn more about Siri&#8217;s mistakes by sending some small portion of consumers&#8217; voice recordings to contractors for manual grading and review. But a whistleblower alerted media outlet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/26/apple-contractors-regularly-hear-confidential-details-on-siri-recordings">The Guardian</a> that the process had allowed them to listen in on confidential details at times. Apple shortly thereafter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/28/apple-is-turning-siri-audio-clip-review-off-by-default-and-bringing-it-in-house/">made manual review an opt-in process</a> and brought audio grading in-house. This type of consumer data collection continues, but has a different aim that what a research study would involve.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Unlike this broader, more generalized data collection, a focus group-like study allows Apple to better understand Siri&#8217;s mistakes because it combines the collected data with human feedback. With the Siri Speech Study app, participants provide explicit feedback on per request basis, Apple said. For instance, if Siri misheard a question, users could explain what they were trying to ask. If Siri was triggered when the user hadn&#8217;t said &#8220;<a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/hey-siri">Hey Siri</a>,&#8221; that could be noted. Or if Siri on HomePod misidentified the speaker in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204753">a multi-person household</a>, the participant could note that, too.</p>
<p>Another differentiator is that none of the participants&#8217; data is being automatically shared with Apple. Rather, users can see a list of the Siri requests they&#8217;ve made and then select which to send to Apple with their feedback. Apple also noted no user information is collected or used in the app, except the data directly provided by participants.</p>

<p>Apple understands that an intelligent virtual assistant that understands you is a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>This year, the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/345303/apple-scoops-up-ex-google-ai-leader-to-help-fix-siri.html">company scooped up</a> ex-Google A.I. scientist Samy Bengio to help make Siri a stronger rival to Google Assistant, whose advanced capabilities are often a key selling point for Android devices. In the home, meanwhile, Alexa-powered smart speakers are <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-maintains-big-lead-google-apple-u-s-smart-speaker-market-new-study-says/">dominating the U.S. market</a> and <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-maintains-big-lead-google-apple-u-s-smart-speaker-market-new-study-says/">compete with Google</a> in the global landscape, outside China. Apple&#8217;s HomePod has a long way to go to catch up.</p>
<p>But despite the rapid progress in voice-based computing in recent years, virtual assistants can still have a hard time understanding certain types of speech. Earlier this year, for example, Apple said it <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/25/apple-siri-stutter-detection/">would use a bank of audio clips</a> from podcasts where users had stuttered to help it improve its understanding of this kind of speech pattern. Assistants can also stumble when there are multiple devices in a home that are listening for voice commands from across several rooms. And assistants can mess up when trying to differentiate between different family members&#8217; voices or when trying to understand a child&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>In other words, there are still many avenues a speech study could pursue over time, even if these aren&#8217;t its current focus.</p>
<p>That Apple is running a Siri speech study isn&#8217;t necessarily new. The company has historically run evaluations and studies like this in some form. But it&#8217;s less common to find Apple&#8217;s studies published directly on the App Store.</p>
<p>Though Apple could have published the app through the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/">enterprise distribution process</a> to keep it more under wraps, it chose to use its public marketplace. This more closely follows the App Store&#8217;s rules, as the research study is not an internally-facing app meant only for Apple employees.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s not likely consumers will stumble across the app and be confused &#8212; the Siri Speech Study app is hidden from discovery. You have to have the app&#8217;s direct link to find it. (Good thing we&#8217;re nosy!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China has passed a personal data protection law, state media <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/20/c_1310138698.htm">Xinhua</a> reports (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-new-personal-data-privacy-law-take-effect-nov-1-2021-08-20/">Reuters</a>).</p>
<p>The law, called the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), is set to take effect on November 1.</p>
<p>It was proposed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/chinas-internet-regulator-takes-aim-at-forced-data-collection/">last year</a> &#8212; signalling an intent by China&#8217;s communist leaders to crack down on unscrupulous data collection in the commercial sphere by putting legal restrictions on user data collection.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ihxNSUaCeK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/chinas-internet-regulator-takes-aim-at-forced-data-collection/">China&#8217;s internet regulator takes aim at forced data collection</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s internet regulator takes aim at forced data collection&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/chinas-internet-regulator-takes-aim-at-forced-data-collection/embed/#?secret=ihxNSUaCeK" data-secret="ihxNSUaCeK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new law requires app makers to offer users options over how their information is or isn&#8217;t used, such as the ability not to be targeted for marketing purposes or to have marketing based on personal characteristics, according to Xinhua.</p>
<p>It also places requirements on data processors to obtain consent from individuals in order to be able to process sensitive types of data such as biometrics, medical and health data, financial information and location data.</p>
<p>While apps that illegally process user data risk having their service suspended or terminated.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Any Western companies doing business in China which involves processing citizens&#8217; personal data must grapple with the law&#8217;s extraterritorial jurisdiction &#8212; meaning foreign companies will face regulatory requirements such as the need to assign local representatives and report to supervisory agencies in China.</p>
<p>On the surface, core elements of China&#8217;s new data protection regime mirror requirements long baked into European Union law &#8212; where the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides citizens with a comprehensive set of rights wrapping their personal data, including putting a similarly high bar on consent to process what EU law refers to as &#8216;special category data&#8217;, such as health data (although elsewhere there are differences in what personal information is considered the most sensitive by the respective data laws).</p>
<p>The GDPR is also extraterritorial in scope.</p>
<p>But the context in which China&#8217;s data protection law will operate is also of course very different &#8212; not least given how the Chinese state uses a vast data-gathering operation to keep tabs on and police the behavior of its own citizens.</p>
<p>Any limits the PIPL might place on Chinese government departments&#8217; ability to collect data on citizens &#8212; state organs were covered in draft versions of the law &#8212; may be little more than window-dressing to provide a foil for continued data collection by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)&#8217;s state security apparatus while further consolidating its centralized control over government.</p>
<p>It also remains to be seen how the CCP could use the new data protection rules to further regulate &#8212; some might say tame &#8212; the power of the domestic tech sector.</p>
<p>It has been cracking down on the sector in a number of ways, using regulatory changes as leverage over giants like Tencent. Earlier this month, for example, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/china-sues-tencent-over-wechat-105442861.html">Beijing filed a civil suit against the tech giant</a> &#8212; citing claims that its messaging-app WeChat’s youth mode does not comply with laws protecting minors.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="t0OT59D18C"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/">The China tech crackdown continues</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The China tech crackdown continues&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/the-china-tech-crackdown-continues/embed/#?secret=t0OT59D18C" data-secret="t0OT59D18C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The PIPL provides the Chinese regime with plenty more attack surface to put strictures on local tech companies.</p>
<p>Nor is it wasting any time in attacking data-mining practices that are common place among Western tech giants but now look likely to face growing friction if deployed by companies within China.</p>
<p>Reuters notes that the National People&#8217;s Congress marked the passage of the law today by publishing an op-ed from state media outlet People&#8217;s Court Daily which lauds the legislation and calls for entities that use algorithms for &#8220;personalized decision making&#8221; &#8212; such as recommendation engines &#8212; to obtain user consent first.</p>
<p>Quoting the op-ed, it writes: &#8220;Personalization is the result of a user&#8217;s choice, and true personalized recommendations must ensure the user&#8217;s freedom to choose, without compulsion. Therefore, users must be given the right to not make use of personalized recommendation functions.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is growing concern over algorithmic targeting outside China, too, of course.</p>
<p>In Europe, lawmaker and regulators have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/eus-top-privacy-regulator-urges-ban-on-surveillance-based-ad-targeting/">calling for tighter restrictions on behavioral advertising</a> &#8212; as the bloc is in the process of negotiating <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">a swathe of new digital regulations</a> that will expand its power to regulate the sector, such as the proposed Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act.</p>
<p>Regulating the Internet is clearly the new geopolitical battleground as regions compete to shape the future of data flows to suit their respective economic, political and social goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is launching a new program in India to help small and medium-sized businesses secure loans in the South Asian market as the company makes further push to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities/">expand its presence among merchants</a>.</p>
<p>The social conglomerate said its new program, called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/small-business-loans">Small Business Loans Initiative</a>, addresses some of the biggest pain points small businesses face when securing loans.</p>
<p>The company, which last year announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/facebook-announces-4-3-million-grant-for-small-businesses-in-india-introduces-support-for-gift-cards/">a $4.3 million grant for small businesses in India</a>, said the new program will allow its lending partners to grant small ticket loans &#8212; ranging between 500,000 Indian rupees ($6,720) to 50,00,000 ($67,200) &#8212; at a predefined interest rate of 17%-20% per annum and won&#8217;t require the businesses to provide any collateral or joining fee, the firm told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>At the time of launch, company&#8217;s pilot lending partner is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/indifi-series-c/">CDC Group-backed Gurgaon-headquartered Indifi</a>, which will disburse the loan amount within five working days of the borrower completing all documentation formalities after acceptance of the offer by Indifi. The company expects more partners to join the program.</p>
<p>Facebook said it&#8217;s working in &#8220;arm&#8217;s length&#8221; with its lending partners, but those partners will be handling all the risks of loan payments and determining the eligibility criteria. (On Facebook website, the company says a business must have advertised on the Facebook family of apps for at least 180 days at the time of application as one of the factors for eligibility.)</p>
<p>Facebook, on its part, is making businesses aware of the lending program and has worked to improve the underlying lending framework such as boundaries for interest rate, engagement responsiveness between the lending partner and businesses (there will be an on-call support system within one day of applying) and ticket size of the credit amount.</p>
<p>In a call with reporters on Friday, Facebook India head Ajit Mohan said that small businesses in 200 Indian cities can apply for the loan starting today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Businesses wholly or partially run by women will additionally be able to secure the loan at a special 0.2% reduction rates per annum.</p>
<p>This is the first time Facebook has launched a program of this kind in any market, the company told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted by Facebook in collaboration with OECD and the World Bank last year, almost a third of operational small and medium-sized businesses on Facebook in 2020 said that they expected cash flow to be one of their primary challenges.</p>
<h3>No monetization</h3>
<p>The company is not monetizing this program. &#8220;We believe it is in our self-interest for there to be a massive growth in the small business ecosystem in India because as a company we are playing this for the long term. We will disproportionately benefit because a lot of these small business activity happens on our apps as they grow,&#8221; said Mohan at the briefing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not looking to make money from this program. We don&#8217;t have any revenue sharing agreement. We are not putting any constraint on how this money is spent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Frankly, we are also hoping that on the back of a program like this other companies will also create programs so that there is more access to credit in the market. That will be good for us all. There is no transactional objective here.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Facebook, Friday&#8217;s announcement is the latest in a series of efforts it has made to tap the South Asian nation&#8217;s small and medium-sized businesses. The firm, which identifies India as its largest market by users, last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">invested $5.7 billion in Indian tech giant Jio Platforms</a> to work on, among other things, digitizing small businesses in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;MSMEs will play a significant role in reviving India’s economic growth and achieving its vision of becoming more self-reliant. Digital transformation will act as a catalyst for India’s development story going forward, and access to finances will be crucial to this transformation,&#8221; said Amitabh Kant, chief executive of government-backed highly influential think tank Niti Aayog, at a virtual conference Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this context, Facebook&#8217;s Small Business Loans initiative is a big step in the right direction and I’m happy to note that India is the first country where the company is launching such an initiative.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of digitizing the operations of mom and pop stores in Nigeria is serious business right now. In fact, it might be the second-best thing after fintech at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today&#8217;s news is from <a href="https://www.alerzo.com/">Alerzo</a>, a little-known B2B e-commerce retail startup based in Ibadan, Nigeria. The company is announcing a $10.5 million Series A round led by London-based Nosara Capital. FJ Labs and several family offices from the U.S., Europe and Asia, including Michael Novogratz&#8217;s, participated in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, Alerzo has raised more than $20 million since its launch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early investors include the Baobab Network, an Africa-focused accelerator based in London, and Signal Hill, a Singapore-based fund manager that participated in its $5.5 million seed round last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company also said it closed a $2.5 million working capital facility to serve its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/adewale-opaleye-5a0450ba">Adewale Opaleye</a> founded Alerzo in 2018 as a last-mile distribution platform that helps retailers stock inventory </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from manufacturers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its business, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">officially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched in 2019, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is centered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on helping street-side vendors and shops in Nigeria&#8217;s south-western cities access household supplies quicker and efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with TechCrunch, Opaleye said he started Alerzo to empower the millions of women who are the backbone of consumer commerce in Nigeria&#8217;s $100 billion informal retail sector</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need to solve this problem stemmed from observing firsthand the challenges his mom faced while operating two mom-and-pop stores</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Growing up in Ibadan, I watched my mother operate two informal retail stores </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raise my three siblings and me. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the many challenges she faced running her stores, and I decided to start a business that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniquely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> catered to the needs of retailers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like her,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These retailers are beholden to an inefficient distribution system that results in inconsistent inventory availability, opaque pricing and limited access to formal financial and banking services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founder says Ibadan was the ideal market to establish its headquarters because informal retailers in the region experience these challenges more than those in Lagos</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alerzo&#8217;s core business distributes FMCG goods using a first-party relationship platform which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows suppliers to clear inventory faster and lets Alerzo control the supply chain and delivery</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the lack of trust in the marketplace and the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">requirement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pay on delivery, Opaleye says this was the most inclusive business model where the economics made sense for the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alerzo claims to have built up a network of up to 100,000 small businesses, 90% of which are women-led. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company exclusively serves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the country’s tier-2 to tier-4 cities in Southwest Nigeria &#8212; Ibadan, Ekiti and Abeokuta, to name a few. It connects retailers to local and multinational distributors of consumer brands, like Unilever, Nestlé, Procter &amp; Gamble, Dangote, and PZ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Without Alerzo, these retailers need to take a day off from the store to visit a central market, pay for transportation and haul a large amount of inventory back to the store</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alerzo replaces this stressful experience by not only reducing costs and time spent running a retail shop but also improving the livelihood of these working women,&#8221; said the founder about the company&#8217;s growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About one-third of the total retailers on Alerzo use the platform monthly. According to its website, retailers can order products via SMS, voice and WhatsApp and deliver them to their stores in less than 10 hours. The company claims to have processed over 1 million orders this past year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alerzo owns and operates its full-stack tech-driven supply chain and logistics to process these orders. The company provides warehousing and fulfillment solutions to suppliers and storefront delivery to informal retailers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It currently owns over 200 vehicles and 20 warehouses to serve its thousands of customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last couple of years have seen a rise in last-mile delivery and distribution companies with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a large increase in on-demand services across many sectors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most players in Nigeria tend to focus on Lagos and Nigeria&#8217;s capital city Abuja, Alerzo&#8217;s approach to covering other cities has seemingly paid off so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But though Alerzo has enjoyed almost a first-mover advantage in less crowded markets, stiff competition will play out as other key players look to come in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/omnibiz-gets-3m-to-digitize-nigerias-informal-b2b-supply-chain/">Omnibiz</a>, for instance, has Ibadan in its sights, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/tradedepot-adds-10-million-to-add-financial-services-to-its-supply-chain-services-for-african-smbs/">TradeDepot</a> is setting up a presence in 10 to 15 cities, aiming to cover all major cities in the country by the end of the year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Alerzo&#8217;s investors remain bullish on the company&#8217;s potentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve studied informal retail marketplaces globally over the last couple of years and Alerzo </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stood out to us due to a strong management team led by a founder with a unique understanding of his customer and an attractive business model with exceptional unit economics,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; said Ian Loizeaux, the managing partner at Nosara Capital, in a statement. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is at the beginning of a compelling multi-decade opportunity to streamline and digitize Nigeria&#8217;s retail supply chain.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seed investor Kevin Jung of Signal Hill cites Alerzo&#8217;s focus on the informal retail market outside Lagos as one of the reasons why he backed Alerzo earlier on. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also referred to the company&#8217;s orientation toward Asia (a playbook Opaleye adopted when he went to China for studies in 2016), as the best reference point for the emerging business model of digitizing informal retail markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alerzo has an office in Singapore that the CEO says serves as a regional hub to identify best practices among similar high-growth businesses operating across Southeast Asia and India and adapt them to the Nigerian market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Likewise, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expand its digital footprint, the company recently launched an office in Lagos.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proceeds from this Series A round will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be used</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">geographically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to northern Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alerzo also plans to launch AlerzoPay, the company’s cashless payments and lending platform, as well as a portfolio of new business support services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft has invested $5 million in Indian budget hotel chain Oyo, according to a regulatory filing this week. The investment <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/microsoft-in-talks-to-back-india-oyo/">confirms a TechCrunch scoop</a> from last month.</p>
<p>The new investment values Oyo at $9.6 billion, only slightly below <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/19/indias-oyo-valued-at-10b-after-founder-purchases-2b-in-shares/">the $10 billion implied valuation</a> from the Indian startup&#8217;s previous financing round in 2019. The startup, which lost significant business to the pandemic, was valued at <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/056a1077-8503-4e72-a2f4-33172dd2fb03">just $3 billion in recent quarters</a> by SoftBank, one of its largest investors.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported earlier that this strategic investment may also involve Oyo shifting to use Microsoft&#8217;s cloud services. The company is planning to file for an IPO later this year, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Oyo, which is one of India’s most valuable startups, has aggressively expanded to many markets including Southeast Asia, Europe and the U.S. in recent years.  But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/technology/oyo-softbank-india.html">some of its missteps</a> — “toxic culture,” lapse in governance, and relationship with many hotel owners — have scarred its growth.</p>
<p>Just as the startup was pledging to improve its relationship with hotel owners, the pandemic arrived. In response, Oyo slowed its growth and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/softbank-backed-indian-startup-oyo-to-cut-5000-jobs-globally/">laid off thousands of employees globally</a> earlier this year as nations across the world enforced lockdowns.</p>
<p>The pandemic hit the seven-year-old startup like a “cyclone,” Agarwal told Bloomberg TV last month. “We built something for so many years and it took just 30 days for it drop by over 60%,” he said, adding that the firm had not made any decision on exploring the public markets.</p>
<p>Airbnb-backed Oyo had between $780 million to $800 million in its bank, Agarwal said at a virtual conference recently and had pared its “monthly burn” across all businesses to $4 million to $5 million. (The startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/despite-everything-oyo-still-has-1-billion-in-cash/">had about $1 billion in the bank</a> in December 2020.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month — after Agarwal’s remarks at the aforementioned conference — Oyo said it had raised $660 million in debt. That debt was used to pay off the previous debt, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>If the deal between the two firms materializes, it will be Microsoft’s latest investment in an Indian startup. The firm has backed a handful of startups in the South Asian market, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">news aggregator and short-video platform DailyHunt,</a> e-commerce giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/10/flipkart-1-4-billion/">Flipkart</a>, and logistics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/indian-logistics-saas-startup-fareye-bags-13-million/">SaaS firm FarEye</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk wants Tesla to be seen as “much more than an electric car company.” On Thursday’s Tesla AI Day, the CEO described Tesla as a company with “deep AI activity in hardware on the inference level and on the training level” that can be used down the line for applications beyond self-driving cars, including a humanoid robot that Tesla is apparently building.</p>
<p>Tesla AI Day, <span style="font-weight: 400;">which started after a rousing 45 minutes of industrial music pulled straight from &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; soundtrack</span>, featured a series of Tesla engineers explaining various Tesla tech with the clear goal of recruiting the best and brightest to join Tesla&#8217;s vision and AI team and help the company go to autonomy and beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of work to make it work and that&#8217;s why we need talented people to join and solve the problem,&#8221; said Musk.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like both “Battery Day” and “Autonomy Day,” the event on Thursday was streamed live on Tesla’s YouTube channel. There was a lot of super technical jargon, but here are the top four highlights of the day.</span></p>
<h2>Tesla Bot: A definitely real humanoid robot</h2>
<p>This bit of news was the last update to come out of AI Day before audience questions began, but it&#8217;s certainly the most interesting. After the Tesla engineers and executives talked about computer vision, the Dojo supercomputer and the Tesla chip (all of which we&#8217;ll get to in a moment), there was a brief interlude where what appeared to be an alien go-go dancer appeared on the stage, dressed in a white body suit with a shiny black mask as a face. Turns out, this wasn&#8217;t just a Tesla stunt, but rather an intro to the Tesla Bot, a humanoid robot that Tesla is actually building.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191999" style="width: 2142px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191999" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191999 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.15.17-pm.png" alt="" width="2132" height="1316" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.15.17-pm.png 2132w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.15.17-pm.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.15.17-pm.png?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.15.17-pm.png?resize=768,474 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.15.17-pm.png?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.15.17-pm.png?resize=1536,948 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.15.17-pm.png?resize=2048,1264 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.15.17-pm.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2132px) 100vw, 2132px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191999" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</p></div></p>
<p>When Tesla talks about using its advanced technology in applications outside of cars, we didn&#8217;t think he was talking about robot slaves. That&#8217;s not an exaggeration. CEO Elon Musk envisions a world in which the human drudgery like grocery shopping, &#8220;the work that people least like to do,&#8221; can be taken over by humanoid robots like the Tesla Bot. The bot is 5&#8217;8&#8243;, 125 pounds, can deadlift 150 pounds, walk at 5 miles per hour and has a screen for a head that displays important information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s intended to be friendly, of course, and navigate a world built for humans,&#8221; said Musk. &#8220;We&#8217;re setting it such that at a mechanical and physical level, you can run away from it and most likely overpower it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because everyone is definitely afraid of getting beat up by a robot that&#8217;s truly had enough, right?</p>
<p>The bot, a prototype of which is expected for next year, is being proposed as a non-automotive robotic use case for the company’s work on neural networks and its Dojo advanced supercomputer. Musk did not share whether the Tesla Bot would be able to dance.</p>

<p>Tesla director Ganesh Venkataramanan unveiled Tesla&#8217;s computer chip, designed and built entirely in-house, that the company is using to run its supercomputer, Dojo. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Much of Tesla’s AI architecture is dependent on Dojo, the neural network training computer that Musk says will be able to process vast amounts of camera imaging data four times faster than other computing systems. The idea is that the Dojo-trained AI software will be pushed out to Tesla customers via over-the-air updates. </span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chip that Tesla revealed on Thursday is called “D1,” and it contains a 7 nm technology. Venkataramanan proudly held up the chip that he said has GPU-level compute with CPU connectivity and twice the I/O bandwidth of “the state of the art networking switch chips that are out there today and are supposed to be the gold standards.” He walked through the technicalities of the chip, explaining that Tesla wanted to own as much of its tech stack as possible to avoid any bottlenecks. Tesla introduced a next-gen computer chip last year, produced by Samsung, but it has not quite been able to escape the global chip shortage that has rocked the auto industry for months. To survive the shortage, Musk said during an earnings call this summer that the company had been forced to rewrite some vehicle software after having to substitute in alternate chips. </span></p>
<p>Aside from limited availability, the overall goal of taking the chip production in-house is to increase bandwidth and decrease latencies for better AI performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do compute and data transfers simultaneously, and our custom ISA, which is the instruction set architecture, is fully optimized for machine learning workloads,&#8221; said <span style="font-weight: 400;">Venkataramanan at AI Day</span>. &#8220;This is a pure machine learning machine.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venkataramanan also revealed a “training tile” that integrates multiple chips to get higher bandwidth and an incredible computing power of 9 petaflops per tile and 36 terabytes per second of bandwidth. Together, the training tiles compose the Dojo supercomputer. </span></p>
<h2>To Full Self-Driving and beyond</h2>
<p>Many of the speakers at the AI Day event noted that Dojo will not just be a tech for Tesla&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Full Self-Driving” (FSD) system</span>, it&#8217;s definitely impressive advanced driver assistance system that&#8217;s also definitely not yet fully self-driving or autonomous. The powerful supercomputer is built with multiple aspects, such as the simulation architecture, that the company hopes to expand to be universal and even open up to other automakers and tech companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not intended to be just limited to Tesla cars,&#8221; said Musk. &#8220;Those of you who&#8217;ve seen the full self-driving beta can appreciate the rate at which the Tesla neural net is learning to drive. And this is a particular application of AI, but I think there&#8217;s more applications down the road that will make sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk said Dojo is expected to be operational next year, at which point we can expect talk about how this tech can be applied to many other use cases.</p>
<h2>Solving computer vision problems</h2>
<p>During AI Day, Tesla backed its vision-based approach to autonomy yet again, an approach that uses neural networks to ideally allow the car to function anywhere on earth via its &#8220;Autopilot&#8221; system. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla’s head of AI, Andrej Karpathy, described Tesla’s architecture as “building an animal from the ground up” that moves around, senses its environment and acts intelligently and autonomously based on what it sees.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2192002" style="width: 1646px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2192002" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2192002 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-1.43.25-pm.png" alt="" width="1636" height="1106" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-1.43.25-pm.png 1636w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-1.43.25-pm.png?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-1.43.25-pm.png?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-1.43.25-pm.png?resize=768,519 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-1.43.25-pm.png?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-1.43.25-pm.png?resize=1536,1038 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-1.43.25-pm.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1636px) 100vw, 1636px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2192002" class="wp-caption-text">Andrej Karpathy, head of AI at Tesla, explaining how Tesla manages data to achieve computer vision-based semi-autonomous driving. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;So we are building of course all of the mechanical components of the body, the nervous system, which has all the electrical components, and for our purposes, the brain of the autopilot, and specifically for this section the synthetic visual cortex,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karpathy illustrated how Tesla’s neural networks have developed over time, and how now, the visual cortex of the car, which is essentially the first part of the car&#8217;s &#8220;brain&#8221; that processes visual information, is designed in tandem with the broader neural network architecture so that information flows into the system more intelligently.  </span></p>
<p>The two main problems that Tesla is working on solving with its computer vision architecture are temporary occlusions (like cars at a busy intersection blocking Autopilot&#8217;s view of the road beyond) and signs or markings that appear earlier in the road (like if a sign 100 meters back says the lanes will merge, the computer once upon a time had trouble remembering that by the time it made it to the merge lanes).</p>
<p>To solve for this, Tesla engineers fell back on a spatial recurring network video module, wherein different aspects of the module keep track of different aspects of the road and form a space-based and time-based queue, both of which create a cache of data that the model can refer back to when trying to make predictions about the road.</p>
<p>The company flexed its over 1,000-person manual data labeling team and walked the audience through how Tesla auto-labels certain clips, many of which are pulled from Tesla&#8217;s fleet on the road, in order to be able to label at scale. With all of this real-world info, the AI team then uses incredible simulation, creating &#8220;a video game with Autopilot as the player.&#8221; The simulations help particularly with data that&#8217;s difficult to source or label, or if it&#8217;s in a closed loop.</p>

<h3>Background on Tesla&#8217;s FSD</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At around minute forty in the waiting room, the dubstep music was joined by a video loop showing Tesla’s FSD system with the hand of a seemingly alert driver just grazing the steering wheel, no doubt a legal requirement for the video after investigations into Tesla’s claims about the capabilities of its definitely not autonomous advanced driver assistance system, Autopilot. The National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this week said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they would open a preliminary investigation into Autopilot following 11 incidents in which a Tesla crashed into parked emergency vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days later, two U.S. Democratic senators </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/two-senators-urge-the-ftc-to-investigate-tesla-over-full-self-driving-statements/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called on the Federal Trade Commissio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/two-senators-urge-the-ftc-to-investigate-tesla-over-full-self-driving-statements/">n</a> to investigate Tesla’s marketing and communication claims around Autopilot and the “Full Self-Driving” capabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla released the beta 9 version of Full Self-Driving to much fanfare in July, rolling out the full suite of features to a few thousand drivers. But if Tesla wants to keep this feature in its cars, it&#8217;ll need to get its tech up to a higher standard. That&#8217;s where Tesla AI Day comes in. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We basically want to encourage anyone who is interested in solving real-world AI problems at either the hardware or the software level to join Tesla, or consider joining Tesla,&#8221; said Musk.</p>
<p>And with technical nuggets as in-depth as the ones featured on Thursday plus a bumping <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6JNGfthXWrMNVBCPLaZLmL?si=2LI3fwP2R8ajxtNZyygnOg&amp;dl_branch=1&amp;nd=1">electronic soundtrack</a>, what red-blooded AI engineer wouldn&#8217;t be frothing at the mouth to join the Tesla crew?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember that weird Will Smith movie about robots?</p>
<p>Yeah, neither do we. But Elon Musk does. Tesla is developing a 5’8” Tesla Bot, with a prototype expected sometime next year. The news comes during Tesla’s inaugural AI Day, which was streamed on the company&#8217;s website Thursday night.</p>
<p>The bot is being proposed as a non-automotive robotic use case for the company&#8217;s work on neural networks and its Dojo advanced supercomputer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2191985" style="width: 2152px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2191985" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2191985 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.12.18-pm.png" alt="" width="2142" height="1326" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.12.18-pm.png 2142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.12.18-pm.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.12.18-pm.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.12.18-pm.png?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.12.18-pm.png?resize=680,421 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.12.18-pm.png?resize=1536,951 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.12.18-pm.png?resize=2048,1268 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-20-at-2.12.18-pm.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2142px) 100vw, 2142px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2191985" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tesla</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, if you think about what we’re doing right now with cars, Tesla is arguably the world’s biggest robotics company because our cars are like semi-sentient robots on wheels,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;With the Full Self-Driving computer, [ … ] which will keep evolving, and Dojo and all the neural nets recognizing the world, understanding how to navigate through the world, it kind of makes sense to put that on to a humanoid form.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bot is &#8220;intended to be friendly and navigate through a world built for humans,&#8221; he added. He also said they&#8217;re developing it so that humans can run away from it and overpower it easily. It&#8217;ll weigh 125 pounds and have a walking gait of 5 miles per hour, and its face will be a screen that displays important information.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Musk is imagining this as replacing much of the human drudge work that currently occupies so many people&#8217;s lives – not just labor but things like grocery shopping and other everyday tasks. He waxed about a future in which physical work would be a choice, with all the attendant implications that might mean for the economy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“In the long term I do think there needs to be universal basic income,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;But not right now because the robot doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk finished off by inviting engineers to &#8220;join our team and help us build this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just remember, Tesla is not the only automaker, or even company, to produce a humanoid robot. <a href="https://asimo.honda.com/">Honda’s Asimo robot</a> has been around for decades and it&#8217;s incredibly advanced. <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/30609642.html">Toyota</a> and <a href="https://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/R2/">GM</a> also have their own robots, so why are we so hyped about Tesla&#8217;s? Is it just because it&#8217;s Tesla? Or is it because of this potentially really powerful vision-based supercomputer that will be powering it?</p>
<p>Who knows if anything will ever come of this humanoid robot, but we shall remain entertained by Tesla updates until such time as we can buy one of these things in a store and take it home to buy our eggs for us. Now that&#8217;s an AI utopia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Choosing an insurance policy is one of the most complicated financial decisions a person can make. Jakarta-based <a href="https://lifepal.co.id/">Lifepal</a> wants to simplify the process for Indonesians with a marketplace that lets users compare policies from more than 50 providers, get help from licensed agents and file claims. The startup, which says it is the country’s largest direct-to-consumer insurance marketplace, announced today it has raised a $9 million Series A. The round was led by ProBatus Capital, a venture firm backed by Prudential Financial, with participation from Cathay Innovation and returning investors Insignia Venture Partners, ATM Capital and Hustle Fund.</p>
<p>Lifepal was founded in 2019 by former Lazada executives Giacomo Ficari and Nicolo Robba, along with Benny Fajarai and Reza Muhammed. The new funding brings its total raised to $12 million.</p>
<p>The marketplace’s partners currently offer about 300 policies for life, health, automotive, property and travel coverage. Ficari, who also co-founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/aspires-business-accounts-reach-1b-in-annualized-transaction-volume-one-year-after-launching/">neobank Aspire</a>, told TechCrunch that Lifepal was created to make comparing, buying and claiming insurance as simple as shopping online.</p>
<p>“The same kind of experience a customer has today on a marketplace like Lazada—the convenience, all digital, fast delivery—we saw was lacking in insurance, which is still operating with offline, face-to-face agents like 20 to 30 years ago,” he said.</p>
<p>Indonesia’s insurance penetration rate <a href="https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/overview/vast-potential-efforts-are-under-way-boost-coverage-among-untapped-segments-country%E2%80%99s-large">is only about 3%</a>, but the market is growing along with the country’s gross domestic product thanks to a larger middle-class. “We are really at a tipping point for GDP per capita and a lot of insurance carriers are focusing more on Indonesia,” said Ficari.</p>

<p>Other venture-backed insurtech startups tapping into this demand include <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/fuse-series-b-funding-east-ventures-growth-ggv">Fuse</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indonesian-insurtech-startup-pasarpolis-gets-54-million-series-b-from-investors-including-leapfrog-and-sbi/">PasarPolis</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/qoala-raises-13-5m-to-grow-its-insurance-platform-in-indonesia/">Qoala</a>. Both Qoala and PasarPolis focus on “micro-policies,” or inexpensive coverage for things like damaged devices. PasarPolis also partners with Gojek to offer health and accident insurance to drivers. Fuse, meanwhile, insurance specialists an online platform to run their businesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lifepal takes a different approach because it doesn’t sell micro-policies, and its marketplace is for customers to purchase directly from providers, not through agents.<br />
Based on Lifepal’s data, about 60% of its health and life insurance customers are buying coverage for the first time. On the other hand, many automotive insurance shoppers had policies before, but their coverage expired and they decided to shop online instead of going to an agent to get a new one.</p>

<p>Ficari said Lifepal’s target customers overlap with the investment apps that are gaining traction among Indonesia’s growing middle class (like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/10/indonesian-investment-platform-ajaib-gets-25-million-series-a-led-by-horizons-venture-and-alpha-jwc/">Ajaib,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/indonesian-savings-and-investment-app-pluang-gets-20m-in-pre-series-b-funding/">Pluang</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/indonesian-crypto-exchange-pintu-gets-6m-series-a-led-by-pantera-intudo-and-coinbase-ventures/">Pintu</a>). Many of these apps provide educational content, since their customers are usually millennials investing for the first time, and Lifepal takes a similar approach. Its content side, called<a href="https://lifepal.co.id/media/"> Lifepal Media</a>, focuses on articles for people who are researching insurance policies and related topics like personal financial planning. The company says its site, including its blog, now has about 4 million monthly visitors, creating a funnel for its marketplace.</p>
<p>While one of Lifepal’s benefits is enabling people to compare policies on their own, many also rely on its customer support line, which is staffed by licensed insurance agents. In fact, Ficari said about 90% of its customers use it.</p>
<p>“What we realize is that insurance is complicated and it’s expensive,” said Ficari. “People want to take their time to think and they have a lot of questions, so we introduced good customer support.” He added Lifepal’s combination of enabling self-research while providing support is similar to the approach taken by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/indian-online-insurer-policybazaar-files-for-ipo-seeks-to-raise-over-800-million/">PolicyBazaar in India</a>, one of the country’s largest insurance aggregators.</p>
<p>To keep its business model scalable, Lifepal uses a recommendation engine that matches potential customers with policies and customer support representatives. It considers data points like budget (based on Lifepal’s research, its customers usually spend about 3% to 5% of their yearly income on insurance), age, gender, family composition and if they have purchased insurance before.</p>
<p>Lifepal’s investment from ProBatus will allow it to work with Assurance IQ, the insurance sales automation platform <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-assuranceiq-m-a-prudential-finl-idUSKCN1VQ19J">acquired by Prudential Financial</a> two years ago.</p>
<p>In a statement, ProBatus Capital founder and managing partner Ramneek Gupta said Lifepal’s “three-pronged approach” (its educational content, online marketplace and live agents for customer support) has the “potential to change the way the Indonesian consumer buys insurance.”</p>
<p>Part of Lifepal’s funding will be used to build products to make it easier to claim policies. Upcoming products include Insurance Wallet, which will include an application process with support on how to claim a policy—for example, what car repair shop or hospital a customer should go to—and escalation if a claim is rejected. Another product, called Easy Claim, will automate the claim process.</p>
<p>“The goal is to stay end-to-end with the customer, from reading content, comparing policies, buying and then renewing and using them, so you really see people sticking around,” said Ficari.</p>
<p>Lifepal is Cathay Innovation’s third insurtech investment in the past 12 months. Investment director Rajive Keshup told TechCrunch in an email that it backed Lifepal because “the company grew phenomenally last year (12X) and is poised to beat its aggressive 2021 plan despite the proliferation of the COVID delta variant, accentuating the fact that Lifepal is very much on track to replicate the success of similar global models such as Assurance IQ (US) and PolicyBazaar (India).”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 19, 2021. Today is a good day, with lots of interesting news, and even a hot, fresh newsletter from the TechCrunch team. More on that in a moment. Before we start, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/uipath-ceo-daniel-dines-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-saas-to-talk-rpa-and-automation/">UiPath CEO Daniel Dines is coming to our October SaaS event</a>. It’s going to be, as the kids say, lit. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/onlyfans-bans-explicit-content/">OnlyFans to kick some adult content off its service:</a></strong> In a move that temporarily broke Twitter and melted TechCrunch servers, well-known subscription content service OnlyFans is moving away from its traditional content varietal. “OnlyFans did not respond to TechCrunch’s inquiries as to its definition of sexually explicit content or how it expected this would impact the company’s bottom line,” is a good summary of where this story is. Expect more as it evolves.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/when-vcs-turned-to-zoom-chicago-startups-were-ready-for-their-close-up/">Chicago puts points on the board for the Midwest:</a></strong> When COVID shook up the venture capital market last year, one city in particular saw its fortunes change &#8212; for the better. Since the second half of 2020, Chicago has seen huge sums of money pour into its local startups. We wanted to better understand what happened, and why.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/facebook-finally-made-a-good-virtual-reality-app/">Feedback divided on Facebook’s meeting VR app:</a></strong> Our own Lucas Matney was modestly positive about Facebook&#8217;s new VR service that mimics a conference room. So that we can all enjoy that office vibe from home. Some folks noted that the tech could be great for folks who might have a harder time physically commuting. And lots of people thought it looked like a hot mess on stilts and more of a method for Facebook to change the narrative about its various regulatory issues than really move the VR ball forward.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Do you love robots and want more robotics in your life? Good news! We’ve shared Brian Heater’s robot roundups here on Daily Crunch for months now. But we won’t have to in the future, because he’s rolling out a newsletter just for the subject. Friends, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/actuator/">meet Actuator</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/eaze-to-become-americas-largest-cannabis-delivery-service-after-buying-green-dragon/">The Standard Oil of cannabis delivery:</a> </strong>Eaze is buying Green Dragon, which is actually pretty big news in the cannabis delivery market. If you live in a part of the U.S., or the world, where you cannot get weed delivered to your house, weep. Civilization will reach you soon enough. Perhaps via an Eaze courier.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/shared-micromobility-company-bird-launches-a-consumer-electric-bike-for-2299/">Bird launches electric bike:</a> </strong>Bird is busy going public via a SPAC &#8212; and it recently dropped its Q2 numbers, mind &#8212; but that’s not all the scooter company is up to. It also built an electric bike. Which is frankly cool, as we should rip out a bunch of streets in global cities and replace them with bike paths and green spaces.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/regology-snares-8m-series-a-to-help-navigate-maze-of-global-regulations/"><strong>Global regulations as a service:</strong></a> That’s the gambit behind Regology, a startup that automates the process of understanding local laws the world ‘round. As companies increasingly go remote, and the internet has made global commerce the norm, Regology could be onto something. Also from this story, there actually <em>is</em> a venture capital firm called “Acme Capital.” Perhaps they invest in anvils, dynamite and other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ABEsgRHEY">contra-Road-Runner products</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/launch-house-raises-millions-to-launch-houses-and-the-next-big-startups/">Launch House raises $3M to scale venture community:</a></strong> This one is a little bit complicated, so read the story. But in essence: Launch House is building a class-based startup community in physical and digital spaces. And it just put together seven figures of capital to pursue its vision.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/tiger-global-backs-nacelle-with-50m-for-its-e-commerce-infrastructure/">Today’s Tiger Global round is Nacelle:</a> </strong>What is Nacelle, and why did Tiger just lead a $50 million Series B into the company? Nacelle is a headless commerce solution. And Tiger just backed it because it’s a headless commerce solution. If that makes sense.</li>
<li>Hitting the TechCrunch website just after we capped off the Daily Crunch draft yesterday, Ron Miller and I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/would-the-math-work-if-databricks-were-valued-at-38b/">put together some notes</a> on what Databricks might look like at a $38 billion valuation. Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Let’s make a deal: A crash course on corporate development</h2>
<p>Venrock Vice President Todd Graham has some frank advice for founders at venture-backed startups: &#8220;It would be wise to generate a return at some point.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that in mind, he authored a primer on corporate development that lays out the three most common categories of acquisitions, tips for dealing with bankers and explains why striking a partnership with a big company isn&#8217;t always the best way forward.</p>
<p>Regardless of the path you choose, &#8220;you need to take the meeting,&#8221; advises Graham.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the worst-case scenario, you’ll get a few new LinkedIn connections and you’re now a known quantity. The best-case scenario will be a second meeting.&#8221;</p>

This is not a surprise. Especially because the Chinese Communist Party takes a board seat in ByteDance’s key China-based company.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/general-motors-and-att-will-offer-5g-connectivity-in-certain-vehicles-from-model-year-2024/">GM wants to put 5G in your ride:</a></strong> From an entirely orthogonal corner of the technology universe, GM is working with U.S. telco AT&amp;T to put 5G into cars. I don’t know precisely why we need this, or if there is enough 5G juice really out there to even squeeze out a single glass of lemonade, but here it is all the same.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the first time, Google has published the number of geofence warrants it&#8217;s historically received from U.S. authorities, providing a rare glimpse into how frequently these controversial warrants are issued.</p>
<p>The figures, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21046081-google-geofence-warrants">published Thursday</a>, reveal that Google has received thousands of geofence warrants each quarter since 2018, and at times accounted for about one-quarter of all U.S. warrants that Google receives. The data shows that the vast majority of geofence warrants are obtained by local and state authorities, with federal law enforcement accounting for just 4% of all geofence warrants served on the technology giant.</p>
<p>According to the data, Google received 982 geofence warrants in 2018, 8,396 in 2019 and 11,554 in 2020. But the figures only provide a small glimpse into the volume of warrants received and did not break down how often it pushes back on overly broad requests.</p>
<p>When reached, Google spokesperson Alex Krasov said in a statement: &#8220;We vigorously protect the privacy of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement. We developed a process specifically for these requests that is designed to honor our legal obligations while narrowing the scope of data disclosed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), which led efforts by dozens of civil rights groups to lobby for the release of these numbers, commended Google for releasing the numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geofence warrants are unconstitutionally broad and invasive, and we look forward to the day they are outlawed completely.&#8221; said Cahn.</p>
<p>Geofence warrants are also known as &#8220;reverse-location&#8221; warrants, since they seek to identify people of interest who were in the near vicinity at the time a crime was committed. Police do this by asking a court to order Google, which stores vast amounts of location data to drive its advertising business, to turn over details of who was in a geographic area, such as a radius of a few hundred feet at a certain point in time, to help identify potential suspects.</p>
<p>Google has long shied away from providing these figures, in part because geofence warrants are largely thought to be unique to Google. Law enforcement has long known that Google stores vast troves of location data on its users in a database called Sensorvault, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/technology/google-sensorvault-location-tracking.html">first revealed</a> by The New York Times in 2019.</p>
<p>Sensorvault is said to have the detailed location data on &#8220;at least hundreds of millions of devices worldwide,&#8221; collected from users&#8217; phones when they use an Android device with location data switched on, or Google services like Google Maps and Google Photo, and even Google search results. In 2018, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb">reported</a> that Google could still collect users&#8217; locations even when their <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3118687?hl=en">location history</a> is &#8220;paused.&#8221;</p>
<p>But critics have argued that <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/its-time-google-resist-geofence-warrants-and-stand-its-affected-users">geofence warrants are unconstitutional</a> because the authorities compel Google to turn over data on everyone else who was in the same geographic area.</p>
<p>Worse, these warrants have been known to ensnare entirely innocent people.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported earlier this year that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/minneapolis-protests-geofence-warrant/">Minneapolis police used a geofence warrant</a> to identify individuals accused of sparking violence in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd last year. One person on the ground who was filming and documenting the protests had his location data requested by police for being close to the violence. NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761">reported</a> last year how one Gainesville, Fla. resident whose information was given by Google to police investigating a burglary was able to prove his innocence thanks to an app on his phone that tracked his fitness activity.</p>
<p>Although the courts have yet to deliberate widely on the legality of geofence warrants, some states are drafting laws to push back against them. New York lawmakers <a href="https://www.protocol.com/new-york-lawmakers-want-to-outlaw-geofence-warrants">proposed a bill last year</a> that would ban geofence warrants in the state amid fears that police could use these warrants to target protesters — as what happened in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Cahn, who helped introduce the New York bill last year, said the newly released data will &#8220;help spur lawmakers to outlaw the technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let’s be clear, the number of geofence warrants should be zero,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As one of four general partners at Andreessen Horowitz who are now investing the venture firm&#8217;s third crypto fund, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">$2.2 billion</a> vehicle, Arianna Simpson is highly focused on how to return that capital and much more to the firm&#8217;s limited partners.</p>
<p>Toward that end, she has been following more startups that combine crypto with gaming. Last month, for example, her team <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tcg-and-andreessen-horowitz-invest-in-startup-behind-virtual-horse-racing-platform-11626865200">co-led an investment</a> in <a href="https://www.vhslab.com/">Virtually Human Studio</a>, the startup behind a digital horse racing service Zed Run, wherein users buy, sell and breed virtual horses whose value rises depending on their performance against other virtual horses. (Each is essentially a non-fungible token, or NFT, meaning it is unique.)</p>
<p>Simpson is relatedly intrigued with NFT-based &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; models, wherein gamers can earn cryptocurrency that they can then cash out for their local currency if they so choose. Indeed, a16z is announcing today that it just led a $4.6 million investment in the tokens of <a href="https://yieldguild.io/">Yield Guild Games</a> (YGG), a decentralized gaming outfit based in the Philippines that invites players to share in the company&#8217;s revenue by playing games like &#8220;Axie Infinity,&#8221; a blockchain-based game where players breed and battle digital creatures named Axies in order to earn tokens called &#8220;Small Love Potion.&#8221; YGG lends players the money to buy the Axies and other digital assets to start the game so they can start earning money.</p>
<p>The apparent hope is that they earn more than they have to pay YGG for the use of its assets. But to learn more, we talked<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> yesterday about the intersection of crypto and gaming with Simpson, who joined a16z after first backing some of the same startups as the firm, including the blockchain infrastructure company </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/nba-top-shot-maker-dapper-labs-is-now-worth-2-6-billion-thanks-to-half-of-hollywood-the-nba-and-michael-jordan/">Dapper Labs</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and the global payment platform </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.coindesk.com/celo-a16z-ethereum-funding">Celo</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span>She also shared which platforms a16z tracks most closely to identify up-and-coming crypto startups.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Zed Run is really interesting. How did you first come across this digital horse racing business?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AS: I think it was crypto Twitter, which honestly is where we&#8217;re finding a lot of our gaming investments. The community on there is really incredible and often one of the first places where really exciting new projects are surfaced.</p>
<p>Zed really marks the advent of kind of a new type of more involved gameplay in crypto. If you look at [the collectibles game] CryptoKitties, it was one of the first NFT-based games that really caught the attention of people outside of the crypto sphere. Zed is definitely a derivative extension in the sense that you have a digital animal that you&#8217;re playing with, but the gameplay is much more complex, and the thing that&#8217;s been incredible to watch is just how excited the community is. People are putting together all kinds of very sophisticated guides around how to play the game, to read [race] courses, how to do all kinds of different things in the game, and tens of thousands of people all over the world [are playing].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Maybe these already exist, but are there endless opportunities across verticals here, like, say, a digital car racing equivalent or a UFC-style equivalent, where people can buy and bet on digital fighters and hope they&#8217;ll rise in value?</strong></p>
<p>AS: There&#8217;s an incredibly broad range of possibilities in terms of what&#8217;s happening and what will happen in the universe of crypto games. I think at the core of this movement is really the idea of giving more of the value and ownership in these game assets back to the players. That&#8217;s something that has historically been a problem. You might spend years and years building up your arsenal of skins or in-game assets, and then a game will change the rules, take [some of your winnings] away from you or do any number of things that can leave players feeling very disappointed and kind of ripped off. The idea [with blockchain-based games] is to make them more open and allow players to have actual ownership in the space themselves.</p>

<p><strong>TC: Which leads us to your newest investment, Yield Guild Games, or YGG. Why did this company capture the firm&#8217;s attention?</strong></p>
<p>AS: During the pandemic, a lot of people were put out of work and not able to provide for themselves and for their families. This time kind of coincided with the rise of a game called &#8220;Axie Infinity,&#8221; one of the first games to pioneer a play-to-earn model, which is becoming a very important theme in crypto games.</p>
<p>In order to play &#8220;Axie Infinity,&#8221; you need to have three Axies, and generally speaking, that means you need<br />
to buy them upfront. Obviously if you&#8217;re out of work, you have no money [so buying these digital pets] can become a very challenging proposition. So [YGG founder] Gabby Dizon in the Philippines, who played &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; started lending out his Axies so other people could play the game and earn tokens that could then be converted to local currency. And so basically YGG emerged as sort of the productization of what they were doing here, so YGG either purchases or breeds in-game assets that are yield-earning, then loans them to out &#8220;scholars,&#8221; who are the recipients of these in-game assets, and YGG then takes a small cut of the in-game revenue that the players generate over time.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Does a &#8220;scholar&#8221; have to be a sophisticated player?</strong></p>
<p>AS: There are managers who basically manage teams of scholars; they&#8217;re the ones who effectively decide who to bring into the guild.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So these Axies can be cashed out for currency, but where, and who is buying them?</strong></p>
<p>AS: They can be bought or sold on exchanges and other players are buying them if they need to breed in &#8220;Axie&#8221; and needs some [Axies]; others are buying them for investment purposes. Also, they aren&#8217;t necessarily selling the NFTs but they may be selling the tokens that they earn as part of the gameplay.</p>

<p><strong>TC: There are now 5,000 of these scholars playing the game. Are they mostly in Southeast Asia?</strong></p>
<p>AS: A majority of the players and scholars are in Southeast Asia, but we&#8217;re seeing really strong international growth as well, both for &#8220;Axie Infinity&#8221; and YGG, in particular. At this point, scaling internationally is definitely a core focus for the YGG team.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You mentioned crypto Twitter. What about Discord and Reddit? Where else are you looking around for new crypto projects that are bubbling up and capturing people&#8217;s imagination?</strong></p>
<p>AS: All of the above. Discord in particular is very actively used by the crypto community, and the thing that&#8217;s interesting there is it really allows you to get a pulse for how active a community is, how engaged people are, how frequently they&#8217;re talking, and what they&#8217;re talking about. It gives you a look into the community at large and that&#8217;s a very important thing to consider when looking to make an investment or assess the health of a project.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is a monopoly. Right?</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/cbs_this_morning/video/3SnqwNsl9S5iqU5jQCKlqvO2A4sHTbmJ/facebook-ceo-on-misinformation-versus-vaccine-hesitancy/">appeared on national TV today</a> to make a “special announcement.” The timing could not be more curious: Today is the day Lina Khan’s FTC refiled <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/08/ftc-alleges-facebook-resorted-illegal-buy-or-bury-scheme-crush">its case to dismantle Facebook’s monopoly</a>.</p>
<p>To the average person, Facebook’s monopoly seems obvious. “After all,” as James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia put it in his <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921.73.0.pdf">recent decision</a>, “No one who hears the title of the 2010 film ‘The Social Network’ wonders which company it is about.” But obviousness is not an antitrust standard. Monopoly has a clear legal meaning, and thus far Lina Khan’s FTC has failed to meet it. <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/ecf_75-1_ftc_v_facebook_public_redacted_fac.pdf">Today’s refiling</a> is much more substantive than the FTC’s first foray. But it’s still lacking some critical arguments. Here are some ideas from the front lines.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

	</div>
	</p>
<p>First, the FTC must define the market correctly: personal social networking, which includes messaging. Second, the FTC must establish that Facebook controls over 60% of the market — the correct metric to establish this is revenue.</p>
<p>Though consumer harm is a well-known test of monopoly determination, our courts do not require the FTC to prove that Facebook harms consumers to win the case. As an alternative pleading, though, the government can present a compelling case that Facebook harms consumers by suppressing wages in the creator economy. If the creator economy is real, then the value of ads on Facebook’s services is generated through the fruits of creators’ labor; no one would watch the ads before videos or in between posts if the user-generated content was not there. Facebook has harmed consumers by suppressing creator wages.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A note: This is the first of a series on the Facebook monopoly. I am inspired by Cloudflare’s recent <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aws-egregious-egress/">post</a> explaining the impact of Amazon’s monopoly in their industry. Perhaps it was a competitive tactic, but I genuinely believe it more a patriotic duty: guideposts for legislators and regulators on a complex issue. My generation has watched with a combination of sadness and trepidation as legislators who barely use email question the leading technologists of our time about products that have long pervaded our lives in ways we don’t yet understand. I, personally, and my company both stand to gain little from this — but as a participant in the latest generation of social media upstarts, and as an American concerned for the future of our democracy, I feel a duty to try.</em></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921.73.0.pdf">According to the court</a>, the FTC must meet a two-part test: First, the FTC must define the market in which Facebook has monopoly power, established by the D.C. Circuit in Neumann v. Reinforced Earth Co. (1986). This is the market for personal social networking services, which includes messaging.</p>
<p>Second, the FTC must establish that Facebook controls a dominant share of that market, which courts have defined as 60% or above, established by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in FTC v. AbbVie (2020). The right metric for this market share analysis is unequivocally revenue — daily active users (DAU) x average revenue per user (ARPU). And Facebook controls over 90%.</p>
<p>The answer to the FTC’s problem is hiding in plain sight: Snapchat’s investor <a href="https://investor.snap.com/events-and-presentations/presentations/default.aspx">presentations</a>:</p>

<p>This is a chart of Facebook’s monopoly — 91% of the personal social networking market. The gray blob looks awfully like a vast oil deposit, successfully drilled by Facebook’s Standard Oil operations. Snapchat and Twitter are the small wildcatters, nearly irrelevant compared to Facebook’s scale. It should not be lost on any market observers that Facebook once tried to acquire both companies.</p>
<h2>The market Includes messaging</h2>
<p>The FTC initially claimed that Facebook has a monopoly of the “personal social networking services” market. The complaint excluded “mobile messaging” from Facebook’s market “because [messaging apps] (i) lack a ‘shared social space’ for interaction and (ii) do not employ a social graph to facilitate users’ finding and ‘friending’ other users they may know.”</p>
<p>This is incorrect because messaging is inextricable from Facebook’s power. Facebook demonstrated this with its WhatsApp acquisition, promotion of Messenger and prior attempts to buy Snapchat and Twitter. Any personal social networking service can expand its features — and Facebook’s moat is contingent on its control of messaging.</p>
<p>The more time in an ecosystem the more valuable it becomes. Value in social networks is calculated, depending on whom you ask, algorithmically (Metcalfe’s law) or logarithmically (Zipf’s law). Either way, in social networks, 1+1 is much more than 2.</p>
<p>Social networks become valuable based on the ever-increasing number of nodes, upon which companies can build more features. Zuckerberg coined the “social graph” to describe this relationship. The monopolies of Line, Kakao and WeChat in Japan, Korea and China prove this clearly. They began with messaging and expanded outward to become dominant personal social networking behemoths.</p>
<p>In today’s refiling, the FTC explains that Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat are all personal social networking services built on three key features:</p>
<ol>
<li>“First, personal social networking services are built on a social graph that maps the connections between users and their friends, family, and other personal connections.”</li>
<li>“Second, personal social networking services include features that many users regularly employ to interact with personal connections and share their personal experiences in a shared social space, including in a one-to-many &#8216;broadcast&#8217; format.”</li>
<li>“Third, personal social networking services include features that allow users to find and connect with other users, to make it easier for each user to build and expand their set of personal connections.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, this is only partially right. In social media’s treacherous waters, as the FTC has struggled to articulate, feature sets are routinely copied and cross-promoted. How can we forget Instagram’s copying of Snapchat’s stories? Facebook has ruthlessly copied features from the most successful apps on the market from inception. Its launch of a Clubhouse competitor called Live Audio Rooms is only the most recent example. Twitter and Snapchat are absolutely competitors to Facebook.</p>
<p>Messaging must be included to demonstrate Facebook’s breadth and voracious appetite to copy and destroy. WhatsApp and Messenger have over 2 billion and 1.3 billion users respectively. Given the ease of feature copying, a messaging service of WhatsApp’s scale could become a full-scale social network in a matter of months. This is precisely why Facebook acquired the company. Facebook’s breadth in social media services is remarkable. But the FTC needs to understand that messaging is a part of the market. And this acknowledgement would not hurt their case.</p>
<h2>The metric: Revenue shows Facebook’s monopoly</h2>
<p>Boasberg believes revenue is not an apt metric to calculate personal networking: “The overall revenues earned by PSN services cannot be the right metric for measuring market share here, as those revenues are all earned in a separate market — viz., the market for advertising.” He is confusing business model with market. Not all advertising is cut from the same cloth. In today’s refiling, the FTC correctly identifies “social advertising” as distinct from the “display advertising.”</p>
<p>But it goes off the deep end trying to avoid naming revenue as the distinguishing market share metric. Instead the FTC cites “time spent, daily active users (DAU), and monthly active users (MAU).” In a world where Facebook Blue and Instagram compete only with Snapchat, these metrics might bring Facebook Blue and Instagram combined over the 60% monopoly hurdle. But the FTC does not make a sufficiently convincing market definition argument to justify the choice of these metrics. Facebook <em>should </em>be compared to other personal social networking services such as Discord and Twitter — and their correct inclusion in the market would undermine the FTC’s choice of time spent or DAU/MAU.</p>
<p>Ultimately, cash is king. Revenue is what counts and what the FTC should emphasize. As Snapchat shows above, revenue in the personal social media industry is calculated by ARPU x DAU. The personal social media market is a different market from the entertainment social media market (where Facebook competes with YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest, among others). And this too is a separate market from the display search advertising market (Google). Not all advertising-based consumer technology is built the same. Again, advertising is a business model, not a market.</p>
<p>In the media world, for example, Netflix’s subscription revenue clearly competes in the same market as CBS’ advertising model. News Corp.’s acquisition of Facebook’s early competitor MySpace spoke volumes on the internet’s potential to disrupt and destroy traditional media advertising markets. Snapchat has chosen to pursue advertising, but incipient competitors like Discord are successfully growing using subscriptions. But their market share remains a pittance compared to Facebook.</p>
<h2>An alternative pleading: Facebook’s market power suppresses wages in the creator economy</h2>
<p>The FTC has correctly argued for the smallest possible market for their monopoly definition. Personal social networking, of which Facebook controls at least 80%, should not (in their strongest argument) include entertainment. This is the narrowest argument to make with the highest chance of success.</p>
<p>But they could choose to make a broader argument in the alternative, one that takes a bigger swing. As Lina Khan <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">famously noted</a> about Amazon in her 2017 note that began the New Brandeis movement, the traditional economic consumer harm test does not adequately address the harms posed by Big Tech. The harms are too abstract. As White House advisor Tim Wu argues in &#8220;The Curse of Bigness,&#8221; and Judge Boasberg acknowledges in his opinion, antitrust law does not hinge solely upon price effects. Facebook can be broken up without proving the negative impact of price effects.</p>
<p>However, Facebook <em>has </em>hurt consumers. Consumers are the workers whose labor constitutes Facebook’s value, and they’ve been underpaid. If you define personal networking to include entertainment, then YouTube is an instructive example. On both YouTube and Facebook properties, influencers can capture value by charging brands directly. That’s not what we’re talking about here; what matters is the percent of advertising revenue that is paid out to creators.</p>
<p>YouTube’s traditional percentage is 55%. YouTube <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/06/02/youtube-creator-economy-advertising-revenue-war-for-talent-yt-influencers/">announced</a> it has paid $30 billion to creators and rights holders over the last three years. Let&#8217;s conservatively say that half of the money goes to rights holders; that means creators on average have earned $15 billion, which would mean $5 billion annually, a meaningful slice of YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/">$46 billion in revenue</a> over that time. So in other words, YouTube paid creators a third of its revenue (this admittedly ignores YouTube&#8217;s non-advertising revenue).</p>
<p>Facebook, by comparison, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-payments-creators.html">announced</a> just weeks ago a paltry $1 billion program over a year and change. Sure, creators may make some money from interstitial ads, but Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/helping-content-creators-diversify-revenue-on-facebook/">does not announce</a> the percentage of revenue they hand to creators because it would be insulting. Over the equivalent three-year period of YouTube’s declaration, Facebook has generated <a href="https://investor.fb.com/">$210 billion in revenue</a>. one-third of this revenue paid to creators would represent $70 billion, or $23 billion a year.</p>
<p>Why hasn’t Facebook paid creators before? Because it hasn’t needed to do so. Facebook’s social graph is so large that creators must post there anyway — the scale afforded by success on Facebook Blue and Instagram allows creators to monetize through directly selling to brands. Facebooks ads have value because of creators’ labor; if the users did not generate content, the social graph would not exist. Creators deserve more than the scraps they generate on their own. Facebook suppresses creators&#8217; wages because it can. This is what monopolies do.</p>
<h2>Facebook’s Standard Oil ethos</h2>
<p>Facebook has long been the Standard Oil of social media, using its core monopoly to begin its march upstream and down. Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview">announced</a> in July and renewed his focus today on the metaverse, a market Roblox has pioneered. After achieving a monopoly in personal social media and competing ably in entertainment social media and virtual reality, Facebook’s drilling continues. Yes, Facebook may be free, but its monopoly harms Americans by stifling creator wages. The antitrust laws dictate that consumer harm is not a necessary condition for proving a monopoly under the Sherman Act; monopolies in and of themselves are illegal. By refiling the correct market definition and marketshare, the FTC stands more than a chance. It should win.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Pareto principle, also known as the 80-20 rule, asserts that 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes, rendering the remainder way less impactful.</p>
<p>Those working with data may have heard a different rendition of the 80-20 rule: A data scientist spends 80% of their time at work cleaning up messy data as opposed to doing actual analysis or generating insights. Imagine a 30-minute drive expanded to two-and-a-half hours by traffic jams, and you&#8217;ll get the picture.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			As tempting as it may be to think of a future where there is a machine learning model for every business process, we do not need to tread that far right now.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>While most data scientists spend more than 20% of their time at work on actual analysis, they still have to waste countless hours turning a trove of messy data into a tidy dataset ready for analysis. This process can include removing duplicate data, making sure all entries are formatted correctly and doing other preparatory work.</p>
<p>On average, this workflow stage takes up about 45% of the total time, a recent Anaconda <a href="https://www.datanami.com/2020/07/06/data-prep-still-dominates-data-scientists-time-survey-finds/">survey</a> found. An earlier <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=platform&amp;sh=6a428b126f63">poll</a> by CrowdFlower put the estimate at 60%, and many other <a href="https://businessoverbroadway.com/2019/02/19/how-do-data-professionals-spend-their-time-on-data-science-projects/">surveys</a> cite figures in this range.</p>
<p>None of this is to say data preparation is not important. “Garbage in, garbage out” is a well-known rule in computer science circles, and it applies to data science, too. In the best-case scenario, the script will just return an error, warning that it cannot calculate the average spending per client, because the entry for customer #1527 is formatted as text, not as a numeral. In the worst case, the company will act on insights that have little to do with reality.</p>
<p>The real question to ask here is whether re-formatting the data for customer #1527 is really the best way to use the time of a well-paid expert. The average data scientist is paid between $95,000 and $120,000 per year, according to various estimates. Having the employee on such pay focus on mind-numbing, non-expert tasks is a waste both of their time and the company’s money. Besides, real-world data has a lifespan, and if a dataset for a time-sensitive project takes too long to collect and process, it can be outdated before any analysis is done.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s more, companies’ quests for data often include wasting the time of non-data-focused personnel, with employees asked to help fetch or produce data instead of working on their regular responsibilities. More than half of the data being collected by companies <a href="https://priceonomics.com/companies-collect-a-lot-of-data-but-how-much-do/">is often not used at all</a>, suggesting that the time of everyone involved in the collection has been wasted to produce nothing but operational delay and the associated losses.</p>
<p>The data that has been collected, on the other hand, is often only used by a designated data science team that is too overworked to go through everything that is available.</p>
<h2>All for data, and data for all</h2>
<p>The issues outlined here all play into the fact that save for the data pioneers like Google and Facebook, companies are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/randybean/2020/10/20/the-failure-of-big-data/?sh=6ec999b4a218">still wrapping their heads</a> around how to re-imagine themselves for the data-driven era. Data is pulled into huge databases and data scientists are left with a lot of cleaning to do, while others, whose time was wasted on helping fetch the data, do not benefit from it too often.</p>
<p>The truth is, we are still early when it comes to data transformation. The success of tech giants that put data at the core of their business models set off a spark that is only starting to take off. And even though the results are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/randybean/2021/01/03/decade-of-investment-in-big-data-and-ai-yield-mixed-results/?sh=609070a2409e">mixed for now</a>, this is a sign that companies have yet to master thinking with data.</p>
<p>Data holds much value, and businesses are very much aware of it, as showcased by the appetite for AI experts <a href="https://qz.com/1887438/the-non-tech-companies-hiring-phds-from-elite-ai-programs/">in non-tech companies</a>. Companies just have to do it right, and one of the key tasks in this respect is to start focusing on people as much as we do on AIs.</p>
<p>Data can enhance the operations of virtually any component within the organizational structure of any business. As tempting as it may be to think of a future where there is a machine learning model for every business process, we do not need to tread that far right now. The goal for any company looking to tap data today comes down to getting it from point A to point B. Point A is the part in the workflow where data is being collected, and point B is the person who needs this data for decision-making.</p>
<p>Importantly, point B does not have to be a data scientist. It could be a manager trying to figure out the optimal workflow design, an engineer looking for flaws in a manufacturing process or a UI designer doing A/B testing on a specific feature. All of these people must have the data they need at hand all the time, ready to be processed for insights.</p>
<p>People can thrive with data just as well as models, especially if the company invests in them and makes sure to equip them with basic analysis skills. In this approach, accessibility must be the name of the game.</p>
<p>Skeptics may claim that big data is nothing but an overused corporate buzzword, but advanced analytics capacities can enhance the bottom line for any company as long as it comes with a clear plan and appropriate expectations. The first step is to focus on making data accessible and easy to use and not on hauling in as much data as possible.</p>
<p>In other words, an all-around data culture is just as important for an enterprise as the data infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For smartwatches, it’s Apple against the world. Per recent numbers from <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartwatch-shipments-q1-2021/">CounterPoint</a>, the Apple Watch commanded more than one-third of global shipments in Q1. Samsung/Tizen’s own market share is a distant &#8212; but respectable &#8212; second place, with 8%. With Google’s Wear OS at fifth place at just under 4%, it’s easy to see both companies &#8212; utterly dominant in other categories &#8212; are itching for competitive advantages.</p>
<p>For Google, the answer is two-fold. First, the Fitbit acquisition effectively doubles its existing market. Convincing Samsung to return to Wear OS after a long time in the Tizen woods. For Samsung, a return to the Google operating system made sense from the standpoint of developer access &#8212; and the resulting apps. And hey, if it means Google gets to deal with the underlying support issues, that’s all the better.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>From a pure market share standpoint, Samsung has the clear upper hand here. And while building out its own version of Tizen hasn’t necessarily caught the world on fire, it has helped the electronic giant secure a solid second place. Clearly if the company was going to return to Google, it would need to do so on its own terms.</p>

<p>Following an announcement at Google I/O that the two companies were once again working together in the smartwatch category, Samsung finally unveiled the first fruit of that labor last week, in the form of the Galaxy Watch 4. The new wearable, available in both the standard and Classic form, runs “Wear OS Powered by Samsung.” What that means in practical terms is that Samsung worked closely with Google to build out a customized version of Wear OS &#8212; one that, effectively, looks, swims and quacks like Tizen.</p>
<p>It’s an effort to make a leap to a robust &#8212; if struggling &#8212; wearable OS ecosystem, without losing the familiarity of the experience Samsung spent years building out. And honestly, I’m here for it. The Samsung/Google team-up has done a fine job determining what works about their respective ecosystems and building out an experience that pulls from the best of both. It’s an ideal situation for Google, certainly, and one the company would no doubt benefit from by recruiting other big hardware makers &#8212; though none has anywhere near Samsung’s momentum in the category.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>That’s coupled with several generations of hardware iteration and health improvements that go a long way toward making the Galaxy Watch 4 one of the few smartwatches that can truly go head to head with Apple. And like Apple, the new wearable is explicitly tied to the Samsung ecosystem &#8212; after all, even the other week was nothing if not an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/heres-everything-samsung-announced-this-morning/">ecosystem play</a>.</p>

<p>The new Galaxy Buds are arguably the best earbuds for a Samsung user, and the same can be said for the company’s solid new smartwatch. As much as the company is opening things up to third parties by way of Wear OS (fewer than Apple, but a step in the right direction), this is still decidedly a Samsung smartwatch that works best with first-party Samsung apps on Samsung’s mobile hardware. It’s the sort of gamble you can take when you’re the No. 1 smartphone maker in the world. Let the Huaweis, Garmins and Fitbits fight for the rest of the non-iOS market.</p>
<p>As with its smartphones and earbuds, the Galaxy Watch line hasn’t always been the most straightforward, in terms of how things break down. The company has flirted with different models and SKUs over the years, but I think it’s finally hit on a setup that makes sense. Effectively, the lower-end, haptic bezeled Galaxy Watch Active is now the standard Galaxy Watch, and the standard Galaxy Watch is now the Galaxy Watch Classic.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve typed that, I recognize that it’s not as straightforward as it sounded in my head. Basically it breaks down thusly: Galaxy Watch 4 = thinner, lighter, sportier. Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is a bit classier looking, trading the digital bezel for Samsung’s trademark rotating hardware bezel.</p>

<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say again: The spinning bezel is Samsung’s ace in the hole. It’s the place where the company unequivocally has Apple beat in the smartwatch category. Apple’s crown is fine, but the bezel is currently the best way to navigate a smartwatch interface. I was, frankly, baffled when the company ditched it for the Galaxy Watch 2 in favor of a digital version. The company clearly thought better of it, bringing it back for the 3.</p>
<p>If you read my earlier review, you know my biggest sticking point with earlier Samsung watches was size. The things were giant. I’m not a small man, nor do I possess an abnormally small wrist, but even I had issues walking around with them on. Some people like big, clunky watches, but only making these devices available in the one size is severely limiting your potential audience right out of the gate.</p>

<p>Thankfully, you’ve got a number of choices here. The Galaxy Watch is available in 40mm and 44mm versions ($250 and $300, respectively), while the Classic comes in 42mm and 46mm ($350 and $380, respectively). You’re already talking about a pretty sizable premium for what mostly amounts to design differences. Add LTE onto the classic and you’re talking $379 and $429. Of course, that still compares favorably to the Apple Watch Series 6’s $399 starting price.</p>
<p>I opted to go somewhere in the middle, with the 42mm Galaxy Watch Classic. Having worn the device for several days now, I’m feeling pretty good about the choice. Given the design, I’m fairly certain the 46mm would have been too much watch for my day to day use. And certainly it would have been too large to attempt to sleep in.</p>
<p>I’m still curious how the 44mm version of the standard Watch would have fit, but if you’ve got the choice of rotating bezel, go for rotating bezel. A 40mm version of the Classic would be a nice option for users with smaller wrists looking for that functionality, but Samsung’s heading in the right direction here, with four distinct sizes.</p>

<p>Like much of the competition, Samsung is leading with health offerings here. I’ve been trying to up my exercise game, a year and half into the pandemic, and the watch does a solid job with workout detection. It’s about on par with the Apple Watch, in terms of auto detecting walks and runs. I’ve gotten into the rowing machine at the gym of late, and it does a solid job there, as well. It understandably is considerably more difficult with my morning HIIT routines, and yoga was a wash, so you’re best starting those manually, unless you’re using one of the company’s connected routines.</p>
<p>There’s an ECG on-board to detect heart irregularities. It’s a quickly standardizing tool that many medical professionals have begun to recommend for detecting early heart issues. Body Composition is a standout new feature here that offers key health metrics like skeletal muscle, body water, metabolic rate and body fat percentage by placing two fingers on the device.</p>
<p>Sleep tracking offers solid insight, including blood oxygen, light/deep/rem and total sleep score (hint, mine is low). If you’re able/willing to sleep with your phone near you, the app will also let you know how much time you’ve been snoring during the night. Taken together, the numbers can offer some good, actionable insight into your sleeping patterns.</p>

<p>Of course, wearing a watch to sleep is not only a matter of comfort &#8212; it’s also a matter of battery life. The life on the Watch Classic is okay &#8212; I was able to go a day and a half of standard to light usage. That’s enough to do fitness and sleep tracking, assuming you can find some time in the morning or around lunch to charge it up again. Perfectly acceptable for most usage, but not really anything to write home about.</p>
<p>All of these elements add up to a solid smartwatch experience. The Galaxy Watch 4 is the best smartwatch for Samsung users, and there’s a strong case to be made for it being the best Android-compatible smartwatch, period.</p>
