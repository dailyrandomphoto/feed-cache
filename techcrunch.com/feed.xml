In the <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528">announcement</a>, the company cited &#8220;the risk of further incitement of violence&#8221; and the president&#8217;s past transgressions on the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action,&#8221; Twitter wrote. &#8220;&#8230; We made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules and cannot use Twitter to incite violence.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Wednesday Twitter suspended President Trump&#8217;s account until he deleted three tweets that the platform flagged as violating its rules. Trump&#8217;s account was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">set to reactivate 12 hours after those deletions</a>, and he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/is-trump-back-on-twitter/">returned to the platform</a> on Thursday night with a video in which he appeared to concede his election loss for the first time.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">crossed a line with Twitter</a> when he failed to condemn a group of his supporters who staged a violent riot at the Capitol building while Congress met to certify the election results. In one tweet, Trump shared a video in which he gently encouraged the group to return home, while reassuring his agitated followers that he loved them and that they were &#8220;special.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that time, Twitter said that Trump&#8217;s tweets contained &#8220;repeated and severe violations&#8221; of its policy on civic integrity and threatened that any future violations would result in &#8220;permanent suspension&#8221; of the president&#8217;s account.</p>

<p>While Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">took more drastic action against Trump&#8217;s account</a> in the aftermath of Wednesday&#8217;s chaotic siege on Capitol Hill, Twitter has a longer history of friction with the outgoing president. In early 2020, Twitter&#8217;s decision to add a contextual label to a Trump tweet calling mail-in voting &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; prompted the president to craft a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/trump-twitter-executive-order-social-media/">retaliatory though largely toothless executive order</a> targeting social media companies.</p>
<p>Trump held the same grudge through the end of the year, trying to push a doomed repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act — the law that protects online companies from liability for user-generated content — through Congress in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/trump-section-230-ndaa/">increasingly</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/section-230-stimulus-mcconnell-bill-trump/">unusual</a> ways.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s move Friday to suspend the sitting U.S. president from its platform is a historic and huge decision the company avoided making for the four years of his presidency. In the wake of Wednesday&#8217;s violence, which Trump incited by sending a group of his supporters to march to the Capitol, tech&#8217;s biggest platforms appear to have at last had enough. But as with QAnon and the militia movements that attacked Capitol building this week, it&#8217;s too late to undo the chaos that four years of real-time Trump unleashed on the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/envisics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="envisics">Envisics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> founder <span style="font-weight: 400;">and CEO Dr. Jamieson Christmas </span>launched the startup three years ago to &#8220;revolutionize&#8221; the in-car experience with its holographic technology. Now, it has a partner that could help it achieve that mission.</p>
<p>The U.K.-based holographic technology startup said Friday it reached an agreement with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/panasonic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="panasonic">Panasonic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Automotive Systems to jointly develop and commercialize a new generation of head-up displays for cars, trucks and SUVs. Panasonic Automotive Systems is a Tier 1 automotive supplier and a division of Panasonic Corporation of North America. The head-up displays are units integrated in the dash of a vehicle that project images onto the windshield to aid drivers with navigation and provide other alerts. The Panasonic HUDs, as they&#8217;re often called, will use Envisics holographic technology.</p>
<p>The deal, announced ahead of the virtual 2021 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tech trade show, follows Envisics&#8217; $50 million Series B funding round and news that its tech will be integrated in the upcoming <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cadillac" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cadillac">Cadillac <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Lyriq electric vehicle. The funding round, which brought Envisics a valuation of more than $250 million, included investments from <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyundai Mobis, GM Ventures, SAIC Ventures and Van Tuyl Companies.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Envisics&#8217; technology, the foundation of which came out of Christmas&#8217; PhD studies at Cambridge University more than 15 years ago, electronically manipulates the speed of light. This process enables images to appear three-dimensional, Christmas explained in a recent interview. The company has secured more than 250 patents and has another 160 pending certification.</p>
<p>The company is solely focused upon the automotive application of holography, Christmas said, adding that its first generation is already integrated in more than 150,000 Jaguar Land Rover vehicles.</p>
<p>Christmas said this new agreement aims to combine Panasonic&#8217;s expertise in optical design and its global reach as a Tier 1 supplier with Envisics&#8217; technology to bring holography into the mainstream. Mass production of vehicles using its technology is slated for 2023, according to the companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very much about part of our business plan, you know the Series B funding round we undertook was about scaling the business and enabling us to move forward as we enter the market,&#8221; Christmas said. &#8220;Part of that was a commitment to engage in partnerships with Tier ones that we can then work with to deliver these products to market.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first of those agreements,&#8221; he added, suggesting that Envisics has a much larger aim.</p>
<p>What that means, Christmas said, will be head-up displays with high resolution, wide color gamut and large images that can be overlaid upon reality. The technology can also project information at multiple distances simultaneously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That really unlocks very interesting applications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the short term, it will be kind of relatively simple augmented reality applications like navigation, highlighting the lane you&#8217;re supposed to be in and some safety applications. But as you look forward into things like autonomous driving it unlocks a whole realm of other opportunities like entertainment and video conferencing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that it could even be used for night vision applications such as overlaying enhanced information upon a dark road to make it clear where the road is going and what obstacles might be out there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Among a number of claims on U.K. adtech lobby group <a href="https://marketersforanopenweb.com">MOW&#8217;s website</a> is the canonical biggie that &#8220;Advertising funds the open web.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This coalition of &#8220;marketers,&#8221; whose members are not being made public despite its sweeping claims to love web openness &#8212; lest, MOW says, Google rain down punishment upon its ranks of &#8220;top companies from across the globe&#8221; &#8212; recently complained to the U.K.&#8217;s competition regulator about the tech giant&#8217;s plan to end support for tracking cookies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If you didn&#8217;t already guess it the &#8220;OW&#8221; in MOW&#8217;s acronym stands for &#8220;Open Web.&#8221; Aka (unknown) Marketers for an Open Web.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And today the CMA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">duly announced</a> it is investigating Mountain View&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">&#8220;Privacy Sandbox</a>.&#8221; Though, as yet, no conclusions have been reached on whether Google&#8217;s plan threatens competition.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KtTRgMTwiG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">Google&#8217;s plan to replace tracking cookies goes under UK antitrust probe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google&#8217;s plan to replace tracking cookies goes under UK antitrust probe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/embed/#?secret=KtTRgMTwiG" data-secret="KtTRgMTwiG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In truth, a variety of business models support open access to information on the internet.</p>
<p>Wikipedia, for example &#8212; surely the canonical example of the open web &#8212; relies upon reader donations to keep the lights on as a not-for-profit.</p>
<p>While &#8212; on the &#8220;exclusive access&#8221; side &#8212; crowdfunding sites like Patreon and the subscription platform Substack offer tools for creators to solicit regular monetary subscriptions from fans and backers to unlock gated content.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s instructive to note how many online publishers have shifted, year over year, from free (ad-supported) access to content to selling subscriptions for (paywalled) content, often in addition to running ads.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s the Financial Times, the New York Times, the Telegraph or Business Insider, the list of pay-to-access news sites keeps getting longer. Much like the consent flows that (also) pop up asking to process visitors&#8217; information in order to target them with ads.</p>
<p>TechCrunch joined the ranks of subscription publications almost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/announcing-extra-crunch/">two years ago</a> when we launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extracrunch/">Extra Crunch</a>. The main TC site continues to be free to access supported by ads and our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/announcing-techcrunchs-2021-event-calendar/">events business</a>. (NB: In 2021 our events are going <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/announcing-techcrunchs-2021-event-calendar/">fully virtual</a> &#8212; which means, as a brief, bonus aside, they&#8217;ve never been so open and accessible!)</p>
<p>So how come all these paywalls are being thrown up if advertising funds the open web, as MOW claims?</p>
<p>The concise answer is <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">that digital advertising pays publishers so poorly it can&#8217;t support producing quality content at the required scale on its own &#8212; thanks to myriad adtech intermediaries, click fraud and the big two: Google and Facebook; aka, the adtech duopoly, who take the lion&#8217;s share of revenue generated by digital advertising. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have found that intermediaries (the largest of which is <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google) <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> capture at least 35% of the value of advertising bought from newspapers and other content providers in the U.K.,&#8221; the CMA reported last summer, in a major <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5fa557668fa8f5788db46efc/Final_report_Digital_ALT_TEXT.pdf">market study</a>.</p>
<p>Consumers turning to ad blockers to escape creepy ads and prevent privacy-hostile trackers from keeping real-time tabs on their digital activity and systematically passing this intel to scores of unknowns in an ad auction process that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">U.K.&#8217;s own data protection regulator has said isn&#8217;t very lawful</a>, is another relevant factor here.</p>
<p>Online advertising certainly funds something. But is that something the open web? That looks rather debatable at this point.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FQZ7JzHqv6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/dont-miss-this-epic-twitter-fight-between-the-iabs-ceo-and-actual-publishers/">Don&#8217;t miss this epic Twitter fight between the IAB&#8217;s CEO and actual publishers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Don&#8217;t miss this epic Twitter fight between the IAB&#8217;s CEO and actual publishers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/dont-miss-this-epic-twitter-fight-between-the-iabs-ceo-and-actual-publishers/embed/#?secret=FQZ7JzHqv6" data-secret="FQZ7JzHqv6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I bring all this up merely to provide context for a chance detail in the MOW story that I want to share &#8212; as it illustrates some of the issues in this high stakes tug-of-war between publishers, digital marketing and adtech players and a handful of big (ad)tech versus the poor, frustrated eyeballs of the average internet user.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an important power struggle.</p>
<p>One which threatens to keep steamrollering internet users&#8217; right to protect their personal information from exploitation (and wider security-related risks) by, in the latest twist, co-opting competition regulators to erect barriers to pro-privacy reform. Assuming, that is, the CMA ends up naively swallowing dubious claims about what advertising does for the &#8220;open&#8221; internet &#8212; when evidence of what it <em>actually</em> does is but a click and a paywall/tortuously long consent to &#8220;share&#8221; your private data with hundreds of unknown firms away.</p>
<p>The regulator&#8217;s announcement today suggests it&#8217;s alive to the dysfunction surrounding internet users&#8217; privacy and will take more than a superficial look at that issue &#8212; though if the ICO is the main rep in the room batting for users&#8217; interests here that&#8217;s suboptimal, to say the least, given the latter&#8217;s storied <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">reluctance to enforce the actual law against adtech</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But here&#8217;s the tidbit &#8212; which comes by way of a PR agency working for MOW. Earlier today it CC&#8217;d me into an email thread in which several staf</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">fers had been discussing monitoring the CMA news on behalf of its client. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I&#8217;m not naming the agency or any of the individuals involved to spare their blushes but in the thread &#8212; which begins with &#8220;<em>FYI — The CMA are just about to announce a formal investigation into Google. We&#8217;ve drafted a comment which we will be circulating shortly&#8221;</em> &#8212; staff can be seen asking to share logins to a number of newspaper websites and/or start a free trial in order to access newspaper copy for free, i.e., without having to pay for new subscriptions. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do we have an FT login? If so, could you get hte [sic] story they&#8217;ve just written on MOW off for me?&#8221; asks one staffer.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward there&#8217;s a discussion about starting a free trial on the Telegraph&#8217;s website as they talk about collating relevant coverage into a single document to be able to monitor developments for MOW.</p>
<p>One staffer chips in to warn &#8220;you need to put credit card details in to start a trial&#8221; &#8212; before suggesting the other has a go &#8220;to see if you find a way around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>This person follows up by saying they&#8217;ll &#8220;let you know if I manage to find a way around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, mmm, irony much?</p>

<p>In light of MOW&#8217;s advocacy for a &#8220;vibrant&#8221; ad-supported open web &#8212; which its website implies is aligned with the interests of publishers, marketers and adtech providers alike, i.e., not just with opaque adtech interests &#8212; it seems pretty relevant that an agency working for the industry group is uninterested, to put it politely, in paying for relevant newspaper content while being paid to lobby on adtech&#8217;s behalf.</p>
<p>On its website MOW argues that letting Google switch off third-party tracking cookies will be bad news for publishers because it says it will cut off marketers&#8217; ability to measure ad campaign performance across different sites &#8212; claiming that will result in less effective ads that yield a lower return and thus less cash remitted by marketers to publishers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BL2WIup2gg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google wants to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome within two years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/embed/#?secret=BL2WIup2gg" data-secret="BL2WIup2gg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/online-platforms-and-digital-advertising-market-study">CMA&#8217;s recent deep dive study of the digital marketing sector</a> found an industry so opaque and riddled with black box algorithms that the regulator listed &#8220;lack of transparency&#8221; itself as a competition concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Platforms with market power have the incentive and ability to increase prices, for example, or to overstate the quality and effectiveness of their advertising inventory,&#8221; it warned in the report. &#8220;They can take steps to reduce the degree of transparency in digital advertising markets, reducing other publishers’ ability to demonstrate the effectiveness of their advertising and forcing advertisers to rely on information and metrics provided by those platforms. And the lack of transparency undermines the ability of market participants to make the informed decisions necessary to drive competition. The upshot of all of these issues is that competition is weakened and trust in the market is eroded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that overarching assessment, who would take an opaque coalition of marketers&#8217; word for it that current-gen cookie tracking of the entire internet yields irreplaceably valuable performance metrics?</p>
<p>Or that such privacy-hostile tracking is the only viable way to support a &#8220;vibrant open web&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;The lack of transparency is particularly severe in the open display market where publishers and advertisers rely on intermediaries to manage the process of real-time bidding and ad serving but cannot observe directly what the intermediaries are doing or, in some cases, how much they are being charged,&#8221; the CMA goes on, sharpening its concerns about the extent of the obfuscation that cloaks the practices of adtech middlemen. &#8220;Market participants such as newspapers and advertisers typically do not have visibility of the fees charged along the entire supply chain and this limits their ability to make optimal choices on how to buy or to sell inventory, reducing competition among intermediaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing is clear: The adtech industry needs a whole lot of disinfecting sunlight to be shone in. And that clarification process will surely demand substantial reform.</p>
<p>Refusing to change how things are done by claiming there&#8217;s simply no other way to preserve the web &#8220;as we know it&#8221; is as ridiculous an idea as it is anti-innovation in sentiment.</p>
<p>Returning to the misfired email thread, we contacted MOW&#8217;s PR agency to ask whether or not the account includes expenses for relevant newspaper subscriptions. It told us these would come out of a central agency fund. Additionally &#8212; having checked back on it &#8212; the agency said it did in fact have subscriptions to the newspaper sites in question.</p>
<p>The spokesperson explained that the staffers involved just hadn&#8217;t realized at the time &#8212; in the heat of the &#8220;day-to-day PR&#8221; moment (and whilst wrangling remote-working-impacted comms). And, presumably, as all those subscription login screens threw up barriers to accessing the content they needed in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>This (senior) spokesperson blamed themselves for what they described as a &#8220;cock up&#8221; &#8212; including the soliciting of a &#8220;paywall workaround&#8221; &#8212; going on to take full <em>mea culpa</em> responsibility and emphasizing it had nothing to do with MOW or with the MOW account.</p>
<p>But, well, if an agency working for an adtech lobby group whose key claim is that &#8220;<em>ads support the open internet&#8221;</em> is unable to access the online content they need to do their job without a subscription, what does that tell us about how much of an open internet the advertising industry is <em>actually</em> funding right now?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This has been quite a week.</p>
<p>Instead of walking backward through the last few days of chaos and uncertainty, here are three good things that happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google employee Sara Robinson combined her interest in machine learning and baking to create <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/google-ai-concocts-breakie-and-cakie-hybrid-baked-goods/">AI-generated hybrid treats.</a></li>
<li>A <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/desalination-breakthrough-maximizes-flow-for-cheaper-water-filtration/">breakthrough</a> could make water desalination 30%-40% more effective.</li>

</ul>
<p>Despite many distractions in our first full week of the new year, we published a full slate of stories exploring different aspects of entrepreneurship, fundraising and investing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve already gotten feedback on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/how-to-convert-customers-with-subscription-pricing/">this overview of subscription pricing models</a>, and a look back at 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/2020-was-a-record-year-for-israels-security-startup-ecosystem/">funding rounds and exits among Israel&#8217;s security startups</a> was aimed at our new members who live and work there, along with international investors who are seeking new opportunities.</p>
<p>Plus, don&#8217;t miss our first investor surveys of 2021: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/8-investors-discuss-social-gamings-biggest-opportunities/">one by Lucas Matney on social gaming</a>, and another by Mike Butcher that gathered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/lisbons-startup-scene-rises-as-portugal-gears-up-to-be-a-european-tech-tiger/">responses from Portugal-based investors</a> on a wide variety of topics.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, you could argue that Roblox enjoyed an epic 2020, thanks in part to COVID-19,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm this morning. &#8220;That helped its valuation. But there’s a lot of space between $4 billion and $29.5 billion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alex suggests that Roblox&#8217;s decision to delay its IPO and raise an enormous Series H was a grandmaster move that could influence how other unicorns will take themselves to market. &#8220;A big thanks to the gaming company for running this experiment for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked him what inspired the headline; like most good ideas, it came to him while he was trying to get to sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that I had &#8216;The Queen&#8217;s Gambit&#8217; somewhere in my head, so that formed the root of a little joke with myself. Roblox is making a strategic wager on method of going public. So, &#8216;gambit&#8217; seems to fit!&#8221;</p>

<p>For our first investor survey of the year, Lucas Matney interviewed eight VCs who invest in massively multiplayer online games to discuss 2021 trends and opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hope Cochran, Madrona Venture Group</li>
<li>Daniel Li, Madrona Venture Group</li>
<li>Niko Bonatsos, General Catalyst</li>
<li>Ethan Kurzweil, Bessemer Venture Partners</li>
<li>Sakib Dadi, Bessemer Venture Partners</li>
<li>Jacob Mullins, Shasta Ventures</li>
<li>Alice Lloyd George, Rogue</li>
<li>Gigi Levy-Weiss, NFX</li>
</ul>
<p>Having moved far beyond shooters and sims, platforms like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitch">Twitch, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Discord and Fortnite are &#8220;where culture is created,&#8221; said Daniel Li of Madrona.</p>
<p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez uses Twitch to explain policy positions, major musicians regularly perform in-game concerts on Fortnite and in-game purchases generated tens of billions last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gaming is a unique combination of science and art, left and right brain,&#8221; said Gigi Levy-Weiss of NFX. &#8220;It’s never just science (i.e., software and data), which is why many investors find it hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm followed up his regular Friday column with another story that tries to find a well-grounded rationale for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sky-high valuation of approximately $822 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GM just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/gm-launches-new-logo-to-show-its-serious-about-its-electric-future/">unveiled a new logo and tagline</a>.</p>
<p>As ever, I learned something new while editing: A &#8220;melt up&#8221; occurs when investors start clamoring for a particular company because of acute FOMO (the fear of missing out).</p>
<p>Delivering 500,000 cars in 2020 was &#8220;impressive,&#8221; says Alex, who also acknowledged the company&#8217;s ability to turn GAAP profits, but &#8220;pride cometh before the fall, as does a melt up, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Note: This story has Alex&#8217;s original headline, but I told him I would replace the featured image with a photo of someone who had very &#8220;richest man in the world&#8221; face.</p>

<p>To gain a deeper understanding of the U.S. RBI landscape, we published an industry report on Wednesday that studied data from 134 companies, 57 funds and 32 investment firms before breaking out &#8220;specific verticals and business models … and the typical profile of companies that access this form of capital.&#8221;</p>

<p>How do you scale online tutoring, particularly when demand exceeds the supply of human instructors?</p>
<p>This month, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/chegg" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="chegg">Chegg <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is replacing its seven-year-old marketplace that paired students with tutors with a live chatbot.</p>
<p>A spokesperson said the move will “dramatically differentiate our offerings from our competitors and better service students,&#8221; but Natasha Mascarenhas identified two challenges to edtech automation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A chatbot won’t work for a student with special needs or someone who needs to be handheld a bit more,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Second, speed tutoring can only work for a specific set of subjects.&#8221;</p>

<p>While I watched insurrectionists invade and vandalize the U.S. Capitol on live TV, I noticed that staffers evacuated so quickly, some hadn&#8217;t had time to shut down their computers.</p>
<p>Looters even made off with a laptop from Senator Jeff Merkley&#8217;s office, but according to security reporter Zack Whittaker, the damages to infosec wasn&#8217;t as bad as it looked.</p>
<p>Even so, &#8220;the breach will likely present a major task for Congress’ IT departments, which will have to figure out what’s been stolen and what security risks could still pose a threat to the Capitol’s network.&#8221;</p>

<p>On New Year&#8217;s Eve, I made a list of the 10 &#8220;best&#8221; Extra Crunch stories from the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>My methodology was personal: From hundreds of posts, these were the 10 I found most useful, which is my key metric for business journalism.</p>
<p>Some readers are skeptical about paywalls, but without being boastful, Extra Crunch is a premium product, just like Netflix or Disney+. I know, we’re not as entertaining as a historical drama about the reign of Queen Elizabeth II or a space western about a bounty hunter. But, speaking as someone who’s worked at several startups, Extra Crunch stories contain actionable information you can use to build a company and/or look smart in meetings — and that’s worth something.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> took action against a pair of President Trump&#8217;s close associates Friday, banning them from the platform as part of a broader effort to contain the QAnon conspiracy movement.</p>
<p>Trump&#8217;s first national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell were <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/twitter-bans-michael-flynn-sidney-powell-qanon-account-purge-n1253550">both suspended</a> under Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;coordinated harmful activity&#8221; policy. Ron Watkins, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93wqm7/ron-watkins-meet-the-dangerous-qanon-figure-doing-whatever-it-takes-to-win-trumps-approval">who previously ran 8kun</a> (formerly 8chan) also saw his account removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm, and given the renewed potential for violence surrounding this type of behavior in the coming days, we will permanently suspend accounts that are solely dedicated to sharing QAnon content,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In recent months, each figure has promoted QAnon, an elaborate constellation of conspiracy theories purporting that President Trump is waging a secret battle against a cabal of political enemies who engage in child sex trafficking, among other baseless claims.</p>
<p>As part of Trump&#8217;s post-election legal team, Powell became a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/24/business/sidney-powell-qanon/index.html">heroic figure to the QAnon crowd</a>, which believes that a master plan being orchestrated behind the scenes will give the president a second term. Powell also amplified the Dominion voting machine conspiracy, which claims devices from that company switched votes from Trump to Biden. Dominion Voting Systems is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/954836971/dominion-voting-sues-former-trump-lawyer-seeking-1-3-billion-in-damages">suing Powell for $1.3 billion over the false claims</a>, arguing that her &#8220;viral disinformation campaign&#8221; has damaged its business.</p>
<p>Flynn embraced the QAnon movement last year, reciting an oath and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/politics/michael-flynn-qanon-video/index.html">saying the popular QAnon motto &#8220;where we go one, we go all!&#8221;</a> Flynn has also been actively involved in Trump&#8217;s quest to overturn the results of the November election. In what was then a shocking scandal, Flynn <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/01/politics/michael-flynn-charged/index.html">pleaded guilty for lying to the FBI in 2017</a>. Last year, the Justice Department dropped the federal case against Flynn and Trump eventually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/us/politics/michael-flynn-pardon.html">issued his former adviser a pardon</a>.</p>
<p>Of the three, Watkins is the furthest from Trump and the closest to the heart of QAnon. As the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93wqm7/ron-watkins-meet-the-dangerous-qanon-figure-doing-whatever-it-takes-to-win-trumps-approval">administrator of QAnon&#8217;s central online hub</a>, Watkins played a key role QAnon&#8217;s explosion into the mainstream over the last few years. Beyond the ranks of believers, some QAnon observers believe that Ron Watkins or his father Jim Watkins are the mysterious &#8220;Q&#8221; figure, perpetuating the elaborate scheme by doling out cryptic bread crumbs for QAnon adherents.</p>
<p>Twitter first began<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/21/twitter-qanon-ban/"> restricting QAnon content in mid-2020</a>, citing similar concerns over real-world harm. The new enforcement plan goes much further, and Twitter&#8217;s new commitment to permanently suspending any QAnon stands to have a much bigger impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.venrock.com/">Venrock</a>, the 51-year-old firm that started as the venture arm of the Rockefeller family, has closed its ninth fund with $450 million, the same amount it raised for its last two funds. The outfit, with offices in Palo Alto, New York and Cambridge, clearly feels comfortable with the fund size, but it says change is otherwise a constant, given that trends and tech shift so fast that so-called pattern recognition can prove a liability if an investment team isn&#8217;t careful.</p>
<p>To learn more about what the team is tracking at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/venrock" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="venrock">Venrock <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; whose newest exits include last year&#8217;s IPOs of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/13/cloudflare-cofounder-michelle-zatlyn-on-the-companys-successful-ipo-and-whats-next/">Cloudflare</a> and <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/10x-genomics-ipo-rockets-past-a-390m-raise">10x Genomics</a> IPO, and the recent sales of<a href="https://corvidiatx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NN_to_acquire_Corvidia.pdf"> Corvidia</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2020/06/29/robo-advisor-personal-capital-to-be-acquired-for-up-to-1-billion">Personal Capital</a> &#8212; we were in touch earlier today with longtime partner Bryan Roberts, who has spent his 24-year career in venture with the firm.</p>
<p>Our exchange has been edited lightly for length and clarity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: I talked with your colleague Camille Samuels <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/veteran-healthcare-vc-camille-samuels-explains-why-trying-to-cure-infectious-disease-is-a-lousy-business/">earlier this year</a> about aging biology. How big an area of focus is that for Venrock and why?</strong></p>
<p>BR: It&#8217;s one of many interesting areas of biology on a go-forward basis, along with immunology, CNS (central nervous system) and other areas where there has been little progress and great unmet need.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Speaking of unmet needs, Camille also talked about why infectious disease isn&#8217;t good business for new companies, as are cancers and orphan diseases. As she explained it, with something like the coronavirus, it&#8217;s hard to get funding before it&#8217;s an actual problem; once a treatment is developed, it has to be sold at low cost, and then you hope you won&#8217;t have repeat customers. Do you agree, and do you think this needs to change?</strong></p>
<p>BR: Yes, I think things need to change, but there are several issues. In the case of one company on which I lost a bunch of money &#8212; Achaogen, which made a successful drug for a big unmet need [but faced] <a href="https://endpts.com/once-picked-as-a-500m-winner-bankrupt-achaogen-auctions-off-its-antibiotic-for-a-fraction-of-that/">screwy commercialization dynamics</a> in the infectious disease space &#8212; and for many historical infectious disease companies, the cost of a drug is borne by the hospital, not billed separately.</p>

<p>It has also been hard historically to get anyone to pay attention to much of anything from a preventive perspective &#8212; even more so in communicable diseases. COVID was, on the one hand, not a particularly hard biological problem to solve, but from an investing perspective, the issue was it was a problem tailor-made for an existent or large company to tackle, not a startup. Startups take 12 or more months to find their way out the front door, and the problem is largely solved by then by one of the very large competitors.</p>
<p>You saw this with Moderna. Its tech turned out to be specifically suited to vaccines &#8212; and then a pandemic hit.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Venrock recently helped incubate a new microbiome startup called <a href="https://www.federation.bio/">Federation Bio</a>, which is the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/federation-bio-launches-50m-to-pursue-microbial-treatments">first bet on the space</a>. Why not move faster into this area, and how would you describe the size of the opportunity now? Is this something you want to delve into more aggressively?</strong></p>
<p>BR: We did spend 12 months or so helping get Federation started, including my partner Racquel Bracken acting as the initial CEO. We weren&#8217;t compelled by the prior approaches and teams, and it is really the intersection of those two dynamics that get us involved in new projects.</p>
<p>In this case, a terrific academic, Michael Fischbach, had generated great data, so we ran with it. We recently spent more than 12 months incubating a new gene therapy startup in the same manner &#8212; in the latter case, a couple of great academics generated exquisite cell type specificity &#8212; so we went out and found some leadership and just seeded the business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It&#8217;s one way to avoid crazy valuations. Where have valuations gone up the most?</strong></p>
<p>BR: Everywhere, but especially for companies that appear &#8212; or actually have &#8212; reduced binary risk and become growth-stage businesses [and that&#8217;s] across sectors.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You focus on so much: biotechnology, diagnostics, genomics, healthcare IT, medical devices. What are some of biggest trends you&#8217;re watching in some of these areas, and where do you think you might be spending a little more of your time in 2021?</strong></p>
<p>BR: Personally, I am compelled these days by first, value-based care in healthcare delivery &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s more efficient, there are better outcomes, there&#8217;s better customer experience &#8212; and mostly from full-stack platforms versus point solutions. I&#8217;m also focused on biological insights and applications that new genomics tools &#8212; single cell; gene editing &#8212; can bring. Last, [I&#8217;m tracking what] novel therapeutic modalities can bring to really bad diseases. It feels like we&#8217;re in the first inning of cell and gene therapy.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you think the new administration in Washington could impact your work?</strong></p>
<p>BR: I think there will be lots of talk about material changes to healthcare and other stuff, but I think it will mostly be talk given the slim margin in the Senate, as well as the decreased and small margin [that Democrats have] in the House. I think it will be a positive in that a bunch of the silly stuff around the [Affordable Care Act] will fade to nothing and people can get on with trying to improve implementation and go build.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you make of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-amazon-jpmorgan-berkshire-venture-collapsed-health-care-was-too-big-a-problem-11610039485">recent collapse</a> of Haven, the joint venture of Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to reduce the healthcare costs of their own employees? Would you like to see Amazon focused more &#8212; or less &#8212; on healthcare?</strong></p>
<p>BR: We&#8217;ve long been bears [about its odds] for a bunch of the reasons folks cited over the last few weeks [including lack of transparency into healthcare costs].</p>

<p>I would love to see Amazon use its brand, delivery logistics excellence and ability to compete at super-tight margins in healthcare. I don’t think it extends to real regulatory, privacy or risk appetite, but the company could be an awesome pharmacy/pharmacy benefit manager &#8212; and I hope they do it.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Regarding Venrock&#8217;s new fund, have there been personnel changes? Will check sizes change? </strong></p>
<p>BR: We made Racquel Bracken and Ethan Batraski partners; it&#8217;s always fun when you can promote terrific young talent from within.</p>
<p>As for our high-level strategy, check sizes and stages all remain the same. We&#8217;ve raised $450 million for each of the last several funds because we like that size and our culture and personality is way more focused on performance than on asset accumulation. It also feels really hard to raise increasing amounts of capital without affecting performance excellence.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Healthcare has never been hotter. How much of Venrock&#8217;s capital is focused on healthcare, and will that change with this newest fund?</strong></p>
<p>BR: We&#8217;re pretty bottoms-up allocation driven; we invest based on the projects we find and fall in love with. Life sciences usually ends up being around 30% to 40% [of capital invested]. Healthcare IT, which depending who you talk to in the universe gets lumped into healthcare or tech &#8212; I confess those software-enabled services businesses feel much more tech-like than biotech &#8212; usually ends up being about a quarter of the fund and there are no anticipated changes. The balance will go into tech &#8212; primarily tech and data-enabled software and services businesses.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Has Venrock considered forming a blank-check company to take a company public, as more VCs are doing?</strong></p>
<p>BR: We have not. I feel like most investors that have formed SPACs have done so more because of the compelling sponsor economics than a compelling, durable mechanism to get awesome companies public in a much more efficient manner than they otherwise might. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the economics change as the supply and demand of SPACs versus &#8220;great targets&#8221; changes and the SPACs get closer to the end of their hunting-license period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reports that a laptop from House Speaker <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/nancy-pelosi" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> office was stolen during the pro-Trump rioters&#8217; sack of the Capitol building has some worried that the mob may have access to important, even classified information. Fortunately that&#8217;s not the case — even if this computer and others had any truly sensitive information, which is unlikely, like any corporate asset it can almost certainly be disabled remotely.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity threat in general from the riot is not as high as one might think, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/decrypted-how-bad-was-the-us-capitol-breach-for-cybersecurity/">as we explained yesterday</a>. Specific to stolen or otherwise compromised hardware, there are several facts to keep in mind.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xJwDjkaPe2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/decrypted-how-bad-was-the-us-capitol-breach-for-cybersecurity/">Decrypted: How bad was the US Capitol breach for cybersecurity?</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Decrypted: How bad was the US Capitol breach for cybersecurity?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/decrypted-how-bad-was-the-us-capitol-breach-for-cybersecurity/embed/#?secret=xJwDjkaPe2" data-secret="xJwDjkaPe2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the first place, the offices of elected officials are in many ways already public spaces. These are historic buildings through which tours often go, in which meetings with foreign dignitaries and other politicians are held, and in which thousands of ordinary civil servants without any security clearance would normally be working shoulder-to-shoulder. The important work they do is largely legislative and administrative — largely public work, where the most sensitive information being exchanged is probably unannounced speeches and draft bills.</p>
<p>But recently, you may remember, most of these people were working from home. Of course during the major event of the joint session confirming the electors, there would be more people than normal. But this wasn&#8217;t an ordinary day at the office by a long shot — even before hundreds of radicalized partisans forcibly occupied the building. Chances are there wasn&#8217;t a lot of critical business being conducted on the desktops in these offices. Classified data lives in the access-controlled SCIF, not on random devices sitting in unsecured areas.</p>
<p>In fact, the laptop is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-cyber/laptop-stolen-from-pelosis-office-during-storming-of-us-capitol-says-aide-idUSKBN29D2HA">reported by Reuters</a> as having been part of a conference room&#8217;s dedicated hardware — this is the dusty old Inspiron that lives on the A/V table so you can put your PowerPoint on it, not Pelosi&#8217;s personal computer, let alone a hard line to top secret info.</p>
<p>Even if there was a question of unintended access, it should be noted that the federal government, as any large company might, has a normal IT department with a relatively modern provisioning structure. The Pelosi office laptop, like any other piece of hardware being used for official House and Senate business, is monitored by IT and should be able to be remotely disabled or wiped. The challenge for the department is figuring out which hardware does actually need to be handled that way — as was reported earlier, there was (understandably) no official plan for a violent takeover of the Capitol building.</p>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s highly likely that the most that will result from the theft of government computers on Jan. 6 will be inconvenience or at most some embarrassment should some informal communications become public. Staffers do gossip and grouse, of course, on both back and official channels.</p>
<p>That said, the people who invaded these offices and stole that equipment — some on camera — are already <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/politics/us-capitol-riots-arrest-pelosi-desk/index.html">being arrested and charged</a>. Just because the theft doesn&#8217;t present a serious security threat doesn&#8217;t mean it wasn&#8217;t highly illegal in several different ways.</p>
<p>Any cybersecurity official will tell you that the greater threat by far is the extensive infiltration of government contractors and accounts through the SolarWinds breach. Those systems are packed with information that was never meant to be public and will likely provide fuel for credential-related attacks for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has determined the reports of sudden unintended acceleration (SUA) involving four different <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> models were due to user error.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The NHTSA first began investigating the claims last January, shortly after Brian Sparks requested the agency recall all Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles made during or after 2013. In its review, the NHTSA analyzed the 232 SUA complaints Sparks provided to the agency, as well as 14 other complaints and all available crash data.</p>
<p>The NHTSA&#8217;s Office of Defects Investigation has now determined that all of the crashes involving SUA that Sparks cited were caused by the driver. Therefore, the NHTSA is denying Sparks&#8217; petition to formally review 662,109 vehicles and potentially recall them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There is no evidence of any fault in the accelerator pedal assemblies, motor control systems, or brake systems that has contributed to any of the cited incidents,&#8221; <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INCLA-DP20001-6158.PDF">the report states</a>. &#8220;There is no evidence of a design factor contributing to increased likelihood of pedal misapplication. The theory provided of a potential electronic cause of SUA in the subject vehicles is based upon inaccurate assumptions about system design and log data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla had <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/no-unintended-acceleration-tesla-vehicles">previously denied the claims</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/20/tesla-calls-claims-of-unintended-acceleration-in-nhtsa-petition-completely-false/">calling the petition &#8220;completely false&#8221;</a> and outing Sparks as a Tesla short-seller.</p>
<p>&#8220;We investigate every single incident where the driver alleges to us that their vehicle accelerated contrary to their input, and in every case where we had the vehicle&#8217;s data, we confirmed that the car operated as designed,&#8221; the company said last January. &#8220;In other words, the car accelerates if, and only if, the driver told it to do so, and it slows or stops when the driver applies the brake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NHTSA&#8217;s investigation confirmed Tesla&#8217;s own findings. TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla and will update this story if we hear back.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[2020 was a weird year in the markets. 2021 is not looking any different.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year taught us that the connection between the stock market and the economy is imprecise at best.</p>
<p>Despite some <a href="https://twitter.com/thestalwart/status/1270310761504612352">useful commentary underscoring</a> the two are at least <em>somewhat</em> linked, it&#8217;s clear that many Americans can lose their jobs and financial security at the same time that stocks can keep on rising like the boom times will never end.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It seems that today&#8217;s market is willing to value stocks not on their past performance, current performance or analyst-expected future performance but on the rosiest future that investors have imagined for their favorite companies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the macro picture; 2021 is teaching us its microcorollary — smaller groups of stocks can keep rising regardless of what is going on with their fundamentals.</p>
<p>And in the micro-micro case, that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> value is unlimited, because [fill in your reasons here].</p>
<p>To avoid all useless Twitter whining, yes, Tesla&#8217;s ability to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/tesla-stretches-profit-streak-to-four-quarters-gains-6-in-after-hours-trading/">turn GAAP profits</a> &#8212; albeit at times by selling regulatory credits &#8212; is a win, and joining the S&amp;P 500 is great. Delivering 500,000 cars in 2020, a <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/oct/1001-gmsales.html">full 75% of GM&#8217;s third-quarter deliveries</a>, is impressive as well.</p>
<p>I am certainly not arguing that Tesla is worthless, or that the group of companies like those that comprise the ARK Innovation ETF, are <em>all</em> overpriced. Instead, it seems that today&#8217;s market is willing to value stocks not on their past performance, current performance or analyst-expected future performance but on the rosiest future that investors have imagined for their favorite companies.</p>
<p>You can see elements of this logic at work if you ever talk about stocks on the internet. Don&#8217;t call Tesla a car company, for example &#8212; this despite automotive revenues making up nearly 87% of the company&#8217;s Q3 top line. Tesla is a <em>battery</em> company, its religious fans will tell you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s fine to pay 31x sales for Tesla, while GM is worth 0.5348x sales today. Amazon, for comparison, is worth 4.6x sales. Tesla shares are valued like Twilio&#8217;s own in terms of their price-sales ratio, but the difference is that the car company had gross margins of 23.5% in Q3 2020, while the software company managed twice that. And Twilio is growing more quickly.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise, the autonomous vehicle technology subsidiary of GM, said Friday it has hired Delta Air Lines&#8217; former chief operating officer <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/gil-west" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="gil-west">Gil West <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as it makes the transition toward early commercialization.</p>
<p>West, who had retired from Delta last year, will become Cruise&#8217;s first chief operating officer. The announcement comes more than a month after Cruise launched tests on public roads using autonomous vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel. The testing is still being conducted in a limited geographic area in San Francisco and in one of the city&#8217;s less congested neighborhoods, but it is still viewed as a milestone for the company and a necessary step to secure a permit to launch a shared, commercial service that can charge for rides.</p>
<p>West comes to Cruise with more than 12 years pf experience running a massive global operation that had an annual $16 billion budget. During his tenure, he helped Delta grow its earnings per share by more than 15% year-over-year, and led the company&#8217;s merger integration with Northwest Airlines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cruise CEO Dan Ammann, who was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/cruise-automation-taps-gm-president-dan-ammann-as-its-new-ceo/">president of GM</a> until 2018, said West&#8217;s track record of customer experience, operating performance and safety at a large scale makes him &#8220;a perfect fit for Cruise as we begin the journey to commercialize our self-driving technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cruise had once aimed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/cruise-will-launch-a-commercial-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco-but-not-in-2019/">launch a commercial service using so-called &#8220;driverless&#8221; vehicles by the end of 2019</a>, but backed off of that timeline — a decision that came after several other autonomous vehicle companies delayed their own plans to launch ride-hailing services that use autonomous vehicles. Cruise has yet to publicly provide a new date for launching a commercial service, the first of which will be in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Cruise, which is also backed by SoftBank Vision Fund and T. Rowe Price &amp; Associates, has hundreds of autonomous vehicles in its fleet &#8212; however, most still have a human safety operator behind the wheel. In November, Cruise started driverless testing — nomenclature meaning the human safety operator has been removed from the driver&#8217;s seat — with a fleet of five autonomous vehicles. The rest of Cruise’s fleet is being used to perform its regular testing with a human safety driver, some of which are used to deliver goods to area food banks.</p>
<p>The California DMV, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicle testing in the state, issued Cruise a permit in October that allows the company to test five autonomous vehicles without a driver behind the wheel on specified streets within San Francisco. Cruise has had a permit to test autonomous vehicles with safety drivers behind the wheel since 2015.</p>
<p>In February, Cruise received a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission allowing it to transport passengers in its autonomous vehicles in the state. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/robotaxi-companies-get-the-green-light-to-charge-for-rides-in-california/">CPUC modified its regulations</a> late last year to allow properly permitted companies the ability to charge for shared driverless rides.</p>

<p>Cruise has to show data that it tested driverless rides for a <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=6442457808">30-day period</a> before it can qualify for the CPUC permit, according to information <a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=6442457808">on the CPUC website</a>.</p>
<p>West&#8217;s hiring comes as that 30-day timeline ends. The executive will be responsible for all of Cruise&#8217;s commercial operations, an enterprise that will include managing a fleet of hundreds of vehicles and customer service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cruise is leading the way to change lives and up-end the status quo of transportation,&#8221; West said in a statement. &#8220;There will be no bigger shift in the transportation industry in my lifetime than the move to self-driving. I’ve been training my entire career for an opportunity like this one.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Days after a mob broke into the U.S. Capitol amid protests against Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss, another major social media platform has banned a popular pro-Trump forum. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/reddit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="reddit">Reddit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this morning confirmed that it shut down the r/donaldtrump subreddit due to &#8220;repeated policy violations&#8221; on the forum since Wednesday.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the site tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reddit&#8217;s site-wide policies prohibit content that promotes hate, or encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence against groups of people or individuals. In accordance with this, we have been proactively reaching out to moderators to remind them of our policies and to offer support or resources as needed. We have also taken action to ban the community r/donaldtrump given repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the U.S. Capitol.”</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While r/donaldtrump didn&#8217;t approach the infamy of some other pro-Trump subreddits, the site was a current hub for the Stop the Steal movement. The subreddit also encouraged people to attend the D.C. rally that turned into deadly violence at the Capitol: A side banner on r/donaldtrump showed an image of President Trump as Uncle Sam. &#8220;POTUS wants you in D.C. on 1/06/21&#8221; it read.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2093874" alt="" /></p>

<p>Reddit declined to provide more specifics about why the subreddit was removed, but did note that its actions against r/donaldtrump were isolated and no other subreddits were banned today. The subreddit was not related to President Trump in any official capacity.</p>
<p>Prior to the invasion of the Capitol, many Trump supporters attended Trump&#8217;s own event, a rally near the White House. While that event was stationary around a stage, Trump eventually encouraged its attendees to march toward Congress to continue expressing their outrage at the election results.</p>
<p>Reddit has historically hosted large pro-Trump communities known for their toxic behavior and open violent threats against public figures. Last June, Reddit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/trump-suspended-from-twitch-as-reddit-bans-the-the_donald-and-additional-subreddits/">banned the most prominent of those, controversial subreddit r/The_Donald, </a>amid a larger sweep of pages. A year prior, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/26/reddit-quarantines-its-biggest-headache/">Reddit quarantined r/The_Donald</a>, making it more difficult to discover and requiring an opt-in screen for anyone seeking to visit.</p>
<p>Reddit&#8217;s decision to close the hub for Trump supporters follows several other de-platformings on major services, including Facebook, Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and Shopify.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We last polled our network of investors on the topic of gaming infrastructure startups back in May just as it was becoming clear what pandemic opportunities were in store for gaming startups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Accel&#8217;s Amit Kumar told us at the time that &#8220;social and interactivity layers spanning across these games&#8221; were poised to be the big winners, highlighting his firm&#8217;s investments in startups like Discord and Mayhem. In December, Discord announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/filing-discord-is-raising-up-to-140m-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-7b/">it was raising at a valuation of $7 billion</a> and this month Pokémon Go creator Niantic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/niantic-buys-competitive-gaming-platform-mayhem/">announced it was buying Mayhem</a>.</span></p>
<p>Following my story this week digging into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/8-investors-discuss-social-gamings-biggest-opportunities/">investor sentiment around evolved opportunities in social gaming</a>, I dug into gaming tools and rising platforms and pinged a handful of VCs to hear their thoughts on that market.</p>
<p>The broader market moves of the past several months have defied expectations with startups in the gaming world picking up substantial steam as well. This week, Roblox announced it had raised at a $29.5 billion valuation — up from $4 billion in February of last year. Game makers across the board, including Roblox, have been acquiring gaming infrastructure startups as of late.</p>
<p>I talked to investors about what they wanted to see more of in the space.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’d love to see more innovation around gaming infrastructure, which has the potential to democratize game development and allow clever indies to compete with Riot and Epic,&#8221; Bessemer&#8217;s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/ethan-kurzweil" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="ethan-kurzweil">Ethan Kurzweil <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Sakib Dadi told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>They highlighted numerous areas for new opportunity including specialized engines, next-gen content creation platforms, and tools to port desktop experiences to mobile. The VCs we chatted with were also intrigued by latent opportunities presented by major platforms&#8217; adopting of cloud gaming tech. The overall trend was one promoting accessibility, a desire to provide more casual experiences for platforms that may have typically catered to &#8220;hardcore&#8221; audiences.</p>
<p>It was also apparent from conversations that Roblox is significantly shaping investor attitudes toward the potential growth opportunities and pitfalls in the entire gaming industry, with VCs who didn&#8217;t get in on Roblox eager to dissect its success and bet on an adjacent player or one that could follow a similar recipe for success.</p>
<p>Responses have been edited for length and clarity. We spoke with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hope Cochran, Madrona Venture Group</li>
<li>Daniel Li, Madrona Venture Group</li>
<li>Ethan Kurzweil, Bessemer Venture Partners</li>
<li>Sakib Dadi, Bessemer Venture Partners</li>
<li>Alice Lloyd George, Rogue VC</li>

<h2 class="iw"><strong><span class="qu" tabindex="-1" role="gridcell"><span class="gD" data-hovercard-id="tipatat@thevrfund.com" data-hovercard-owner-id="153">Hope Cochran and Daniel Li, Madrona Venture Group</span></span></strong></h2>
<p class="p1"><b>Cloud game-streaming networks are exciting but don’t seem like a sure bet quite yet, how do you feel about them?</b></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> I think the real story behind cloud gaming is &#8220;play anywhere&#8221; and the cross-platform nature of it. Gaming is just different than Netflix, it&#8217;s not like you want to have an endless library of content. When I&#8217;m playing a game, I want to play Overwatch all the time and I don&#8217;t need to have access to 1,000 other games. I think the approach that the cloud companies have taken has been more around the thinking of, what do we have and what can we build for gamers with it? More so than what do gamers want and what can we give them? It&#8217;s definitely trended toward that direction with things like giving away two free games per month, but really I think the thing that will be exciting in the longer term for cloud gaming is to play your game anywhere and play with your friends anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>If users embrace desktop-class cloud gaming on mobile and there’s a broader cross-platform unification, does that spell trouble for today’s mobile gaming industry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> The audiences between a Candy Crush and a Warzone are probably a little different, though I like to play both. So maybe it gets into eating some people&#8217;s lunch but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s anything where the number one problem for a Candy Crush is people hopping over to play desktop Call of Duty.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Are there any clear infrastructure gaps where you’d like to see new startups rise up and fill the void?</b></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> Honestly just tools for building games, like next-gen Roblox Studio, next-gen Unity and Unreal type stuff &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen a couple interesting companies there. I think we&#8217;ve seen a few smaller companies focused on making sure that a network is safe for children, but I feel like a lot of the infrastructure stuff is really driven by what type of new content is coming out. So as the social games became really popular, securing that and making sure that the chats were safe became really important.</p>
<p><strong>HC:</strong> I would love to see something built for helping games that were created for the triple-A environment to port over better to mobile environments. Every time I work with a gaming company on that, they seem to have to rebuild the game so it&#8217;d be really interesting to see something like that really helps them adopt to the mobile form.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/jumbotail" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="jumbotail">Jumbotail, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> an online wholesale marketplace for grocery and food items, said on Friday it has raised an additional $14.2 million as the Bangalore-based startup chases the opportunity to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indian-b2b-e-commerce-startup-udaan-raises-280-million/">digitize neighborhood stores</a> in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p>The five-year-old startup said the new tranche of its Series B financing round was led by VII Ventures, with participation from Nutresa, Veronorte, Jumbofund, Klinkert Investment Trust, Peter Crosby Trust, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nexus-venture-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nexus-venture-partners">Nexus Venture Partners <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Discovery Ventures.</p>
<p>The startup told TechCrunch that the new tranche concludes its Series B round, which it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/jumbotail-india-seriesb/">kickstarted in 2019 with a tranche of $12.7 million</a>. It ended up raising about $44 million in the Series B round (including Friday&#8217;s tranche), and to date has amassed about $54 million in equity investment, the startup told the publication.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://jumbotail.com/">Jumbotail</a> said it serves more than 30,000 neighborhood stores (popularly known in India as kiranas) in the country. In addition to its business-to-business marketplace, the startup also provides working capital to neighborhood stores through partnerships with financial institutions.</p>

<p>The startup, which has built its own supply chain network to enable last-mile delivery, also supplies these stores with point-of-sale devices so they can easily get access to a much wider selection of catalog and have the new inventory shipped to them within two days. It also integrates these stores with hyperlocal delivery startups such as Dunzo and Swiggy to help mom and pop shops further expand their customer base.</p>
<p>Ashish Jhina, co-founder of Jumbotail, said he believes the startup has reached an inflection point in its growth and is now ready for its next chapter, which includes hiring top talent and expanding to more regions in the country, especially in several cities in South India.</p>
<p>“We are seeing tremendous interest from investors across the globe who are drawn to our highly scalable and operationally profitable business model, built on the industry&#8217;s best technology and customer NPS,” said Jhina, who previously served in the Indian army and then worked at e-commerce firms eBay and Flipkart.</p>
<p>At a recent virtual conference, Jhina said that the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to order a nationwide lockdown and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/amazon-prioritizes-essential-products-in-india-temporarily-discontinues-lower-priority-items/">put restrictions on e-commerce firms</a>, has illustrated just how crucial neighborhood stores are in people&#8217;s lives. And for all the ills that the virus has wrought, it did help accelerate the adoption of technology among these stores.</p>
<p>A number of food brands whose products neighborhood stores sell today are not standardized, which poses a question about their quality. To fill this gap, Jumbotail runs its own private label portfolio and Jhina said the startup will deploy part of the fresh fund to broaden this catalog. Having a private label also allows Jumbotail to ensure that its retail partners can get the supply of items throughout the year &#8212; and of course, it also helps the startup, which has been operationally profitable for nearly three quarters, improve its margin.</p>
<p>There are more than 30 million neighborhood stores in India located across the thousands of cities and towns in the country. These small businesses have been around for decades and survived &#8212; and even thrived &#8212; despite e-commerce giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">pouring billions of dollars in India</a> to change how people shop. In recent years, scores of startups &#8212; and giants &#8212; in India have begun to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/from-indias-richest-man-to-amazon-and-100s-of-startups-the-great-rush-to-win-neighborhood-stores/">explore ways to work with these neighborhood stores</a>.</p>
<p>One of them is India’s largest retail chain <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/reliance-retail" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="reliance-retail">Reliance Retail, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which serves more than 3.5 million customers each week through its nearly 10,000 physical stores in more than 6,500 cities and towns in the country. In late 2019, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/30/reliance-retail-jiomart-launch/">entered the e-commerce space with JioMart</a> through a joint venture with sister subsidiary telecom giant Jio Platforms. By mid last year, JioMart had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/jiomart-the-e-commerce-venture-by-indias-richest-man-launches-in-additional-cities/">expanded to over 200 Indian cities and towns</a> — though currently its reach within those cities and customer service leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Reliance Retail also maintains a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/26/reliance-and-facebook-pilot-jiomart-orders-on-whatsapp/">partnership with Facebook for WhatsApp integration</a>. Facebook, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/facebook-reliance-jio/">invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms last year</a>, has said that it will explore various ways to work with Reliance to digitize the nation’s mom and pop stores, as well as other small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>For JioMart, Reliance Retail is working with neighborhood shops, giving them a digital point-of-sale machine to make it easier for them to accept money electronically. It is also allowing these shops to buy their inventory from Reliance Retail, and then use their physical presence as delivery points. At present, the platform is largely focused on grocery delivery. In a recent report to clients, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated that Reliance could become the largest player in online grocery within three years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/general-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="general-motors">General Motors <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has changed its logo, refreshed its website and kicked off a new &#8220;Everybody In&#8221; marketing campaign as part of a broader effort to illustrate the company&#8217;s transformation to a modern, fast-moving and inclusive organization that is serious about accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The changes were unveiled Friday as part of GM&#8217;s presence at the virtual 2021 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tech trade show that officially begins January 11. The restyled website will go live January 11.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the fifth time GM has changed its logo in its 115-year history and probably the most progressive thing that we&#8217;ve done since 1964,&#8221; GM chief marketing officer Deborah Wahl said in a press call with reporters Friday. The all-cap GM logo has changed to a lowercase &#8220;gm&#8221; with a softer blue gradient evoking clean skies of a zero emissions future and an underline below the &#8220;m,&#8221; a nod to GM&#8217;s underlying Ultium battery architecture. The negative space around the &#8220;m&#8221; even looks like an electrical plug, said Wahl.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s optimistic, it brings energy and vibrancy and reflects our view of the future,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It does build on our strong heritage, with a key element of recognizable consistency and trust. But overall, it really wants to humanize our company and this brand identity project was actually led in-house by a team of our designers who took it on knowing that it represents all 164,000 of our employees.&#8221;</p>

<p>The effort is meant to be more than just a logo change and a slew of new ads that feature everyday folks alongside cameos from author Malcolm Gladwell, surfer Bethany Hamilton, gamer Erin A. Simon and Peloton cycling instructor Cody Rigsby. It&#8217;s meant to show a company that has truly evolved from a slow-moving legacy automaker to one that can be nimble, tech-centric and appealing to the next-generation of car owners.</p>
<p>GM wants to inspire; and these changes are meant to kick off its makeover.</p>
<p>Of course, there is real money and resources behind this evolution. GM said in November it will spend $27 billion over the next five years on the development of electric vehicles and automated technology, a 35% increase that exceeds the automaker’s investment in gas and diesel and is an effort to bring products to market faster.</p>

<p>More than half of GM’s capital spending and product development team will be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs, the company said at the time.</p>
<p>The U.S. automaker is also accelerating its go-to-market timeline and adding more EVs to its portfolio plans. GM plans to bring 30 new electric vehicles to a global market through 2025. The company had previously committed to 20 EVs by 2023. More than two-thirds of those launches will be available in North America and every one of GM’s brands, including Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet and Buick, will be represented, according to the automaker.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla has started taking orders for a cheaper standard-range version of the Model Y in an apparent reversal by CEO Elon Musk who earlier this year seemed to put on hold plans to release the vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electrek was the <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/07/tesla-model-y-standard-range-rwd-third-row-option/">first to report</a> that Tesla had updated its website to include the Model Y standard range, which will start at $41,990. That’s nearly $9,000 cheaper than the long-range version that is currently sold by Tesla. The Model Y standard range is a rear-wheel drive while the long-range and even more expensive performance versions comes in all-wheel drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cheaper price comes with a lower estimated EPA range of 244 miles compared to the 326 miles in the long-range version. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said nearly two years ago that it planned to begin producing the standard-range version of the Model Y in spring 2021. But in July, Musk tweeted that the variant had been removed from the website because the lower-range &#8220;would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA).&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, as range would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA)</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Tesla is now offering a seven-seat option for the Model Y as well, according to updates on its website.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitcoin-llc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bitcoin-llc">Bitcoin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> fans across the country are rallying against a common enemy, the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/">FinCEN</a>).</p>
<p>US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of President Donald Trump’s closest associates, has been working overtime since Thanksgiving to push several crypto regulations through before the Biden administration takes over on January 20, 2021.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fincen" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fincen">FinCEN <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28437.pdf">statements</a> list the usual reasons for financial regulations, an effort to curtail terror financing, sanctions evasion and black market activity related to drugs and weapons, without any mention of new evidence justifying the <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/comments-to-the-financial-crimes-enforcement-network-on-requirements-for-certain-transactions-involving-convertible-virtualcurrency-or-digital-assets/">unusual urgency</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These include a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets">FinCEN proposal</a> that would require exchanges to store records involving transactions over $3,000 sent to any personal wallets, plus report users to FinCEN for cumulative transactions worth more than $10,000 in a single day. For comparison, <a href="https://finance.zacks.com/federal-banking-rules-withdrawing-large-sums-cash-1696.html">banks are required</a> to flag cash withdrawals over $10,000, not transactions within the banking system itself, and banks are not required to keep tabs on where the customer spends the cash taken out of the system.</p>
<p>Plus, a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-foreign-crypto-exchange-disclosure-rule">complementary FinCEN statement</a> proposed requiring Americans to report crypto holdings worth more than $10,000 at any foreign service provider. Although the details of this second initiative are still vague, it’s clear the Treasury wants to make special note of the know-your-customer information for anyone dealing with thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/01/eff-fincen-stop-pushing-more-financial-surveillance">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> called this a “push for more financial surveillance” without any need for warrants or suspicion. (Bitcoin users already need to report their holdings in their taxes, just like any other asset.) As such, over 65,615 crypto advocates submitted <a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/document/FINCEN-2020-0020-0001">critical statements</a> to FinCEN, including companies like <a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalAssets/status/1346822040368644102">Fidelity</a> and Square. Square’s <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/fincen-letter">statement</a> said the company “would be required to collect unreliable data about people [recipients] who have not opted into our service or signed up as our customers.”</p>
<p>The Washington D.C. nonprofit <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/a-midnight-rule-for-cryptocurrency-transaction-reports/">Coin Center</a> issued a statement saying this proposal would also limit American access to decentralized services, where users may not know their counterparty or network operators. Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center’s research director, told TechCrunch the proposal is highly unusual because it only allowed for 15 days of comments, instead of the standard 60-day period, for a rule that would impose more data collection requirements on crypto companies than other financial institutions.</p>

<p>“It requires the exchange to collect, retain and report extra information that they don’t have to for a cash transaction, like the name and physical address of a counterparty,” he said. “It’s on a timeline to complete this process, as far as we know right now, before the new administration. That means the rule would be final. The new administration could issue a new rule, and overturn that past rule, but that’s a much more difficult process.”</p>
<p>Incoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, sworn in the first week of January, <a href="https://twitter.com/CynthiaMLummis/status/1346200913359286272">tweeted</a> it was “ridiculous” for the Treasury to have this unusually short comment period. Likewise, <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/app/uploads/2020/12/Congressional-Letter-to-Treasury-123120-1.pdf">nine members of Congress</a> issued a letter warning this hasty rulemaking over the winter holidays undermined the legitimacy of the process.</p>
<p>These proposals aren’t just sudden, they’re also so vague that they appear poorly researched. Both Square <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crypto-30f5" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crypto-30f5">Crypto <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> developer <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1341084526123102208">Matt Corallo</a> and MIT Media Lab director <a href="https://twitter.com/neha/status/1346273664006823936?s=20">Neha Narula</a> issued public statements saying the FinCEN proposals confused basic technical concepts about how bitcoin addresses work. This would make such regulations difficult to implement, burdening American companies with prohibitively high compliance precautions.</p>
<p>“Political motivations are always hard to discern, but public rumors have consistently indicated this is a personal push by Mnuchin, not further up or down,” Corallo said. “We’ll learn a lot about what the next few years look like based on what [incoming Secretary Janet] Yellen says and what new leadership at FinCEN looks like. There are a lot of things Yellen could decide, but it would be hard for her to do a worse job of building useful and practical regulations than Mnuchin’s last-minute attempts here.”</p>
<p>Van Valkenburgh said his nonprofit, and other crypto industry organizations like it, are prepared to challenge the ruling in court if the Trump administration fails to follow the legislative process. Namely, the Treasury is required to read and consider all of the public comments submitted by January 7, 2021, the arbitrary date set by the rulemakers themselves.</p>
<p>“They technically then have the power to issue the final rule, saying they considered all the comments,” he said. “But if it’s obvious that they didn’t consider all the comments, which I feel like it would be if the final rule came out any time before the new administration comes in, it would be very easy to argue in court that the requirement to read and consider all the comments has not been met.”</p>
<p>As it stands, Van Valkenburgh said it appears the outgoing administration intends to “saddle” the incoming administration with “chaos.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Roblox direct listing will lay down some groundwork for new conventional wisdom when it comes to pricing public listings and which methods are good to use.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So it turns out that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roblox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roblox">Roblox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is worth $29.5 billion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the lesson the market learned this week when the gaming platform company announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">raised $520 million in an epic Series H</a>.</p>
<p>For a company valued at just $4 billion last February when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/roblox-raises-150m-series-g-led-by-andreessen-horowitz-now-valued-at-4b/">it raised $150 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz</a>, that new valuation could be considered a victory. But is it?</p>

<hr />
<p>For all the griping amongst private-market capitalists that public-market capitalists are ripping off their investments as they look to cross the private-public divide through an IPO, it&#8217;s hard to square a company&#8217;s valuation going from $4 billion to nearly $30 billion in just 11 months.</p>
<p>Sure, you could argue that Roblox enjoyed an epic 2020, thanks in part to COVID-19. That helped its valuation. But there&#8217;s a lot of space between $4 billion and $29.5 billion, and recall that its February Series B <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/what-is-roblox-worth/">valued Roblox at around 7.3x its Q4 2019 revenue run rate</a>.</p>
<p>The same company at its new $29.5 billion valuation is now priced at just over 30x its Q3 2020 run rate (the most recent quarter for which we <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm">have data today</a>).</p>

But it&#8217;s hard to fret heavily about private-market complaints concerning startup value when the IPO facilitators are hardly the only folks making trips to the bank with a wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>All that is preamble. This morning, let&#8217;s talk about Roblox&#8217;s flotation strategy. <em>Why </em>is the company raising private market money and then floating instead of raising public market money on its path to trading as a public company? And does its strategy solve the major flaws that the IPO process appears to have? Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>The ol&#8217; raise-and-float</h2>
<p>One way to go public is to file an S-1, prepare a presentation, go on a roadshow, drive interest in your shares and work with bankers to price the shares you want to sell at a dollar amount all parties can agree to. The next morning, your shares begin to trade, and you count the money you raised.</p>
<p>That is a traditional IPO, admittedly simplified.</p>
<p>There are issues in there, namely that the price discovery mechanism has proved to be uncertain, especially when it comes to the public offerings of companies considered attractive investments by the active retail trading market. Why? The hotter the company, the fewer shares that are available for trade at the start of its life as a public firm — the very opposite of that which is happening on the demand side.</p>
<p>Lots of demand, few shares and up goes the price. Then up go the complaints that Wall Street is a bunch of thieves. Hearing this from other capital players is always whimsical to some degree, but let&#8217;s stick to our theme.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus pandemic challenged the status quo and completely changed normal life as we knew it. However, with these challenges have come new opportunities to adapt and participate differently in the world. One of the first trends was that cash is no longer accepted.</p>
<p>The transition to cashless transactions, which at first seemed minor, made my customer experience seamless. Going wallet-free made me wonder why I ever carried cash at all!</p>
<p>Cashless life has been widely adopted in Asian countries for quite some time, but it wasn’t universally adopted across the United States until the coronavirus pandemic. The convenience of cashless transactions just makes sense, but my hope is that this convenience doesn’t come at the cost of other aspects of commerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</div>
	</p>
<p>Inaccessibility, fees and thoughtless spending are some of the potential problems that come to mind with cashless spending. For a truly cashless society, here are five key points for consideration:</p>
<h2>1. Payment processors currently have the upper hand, forcing fees onto customers</h2>
<p>For the sake of a cashless transaction, we have given up our last direct authentic connection with our favorite baristas, small businesses and independent brands. When I take out my credit card or phone to pay, I am not thinking about the fees that both myself and the merchant are paying to facilitate what was once a fee-less transaction. Losing this direct connection with my merchant has given payment processors the upper hand, allowing them to demand an unjustifiable fee of up to 3%.</p>
<p>With virtual payments, my cash is essentially in my phone and the barista is directly in front of me, but the transaction does not work like cash. The merchant will need to pay the fee on my transaction. If the cash revenue for that coffee shop used to be 20% of their revenue pre-COVID, they will now need to pay the fees on 20% of their revenue. Sadly, the merchant response over time is to raise prices. Historically, the adoption of a cashless exchange results in fees being passed through to the customer.</p>
<p>Through price increases across the board, the customer is always bailing the merchant out for the cost of the electronic, seamless, safer-than-ever money exchange. Furthermore, the customers are even &#8220;forced&#8221; to tip digitally from predefined settings, removing all meaning of tips as an emotional social contract. This new normal means that customers will end up paying $4 in a digital transaction for a coffee that used to cost $3 in cash.</p>
<h2>2. Platforms must adapt new models to forgo transaction fees</h2>
<p>Given that software and intelligent platforms have always lowered the cost of services when they are used at scale, why has this reduction of cost not yet applied to digital financial transactions? Customers need to demand that cashless transactions operate in the same way as cash transactions.</p>
<p>Even if we continue with a fee model, why would regular, loyal and verified customers always pay (directly or indirectly) the hefty cost of the exchange on top of the cost of credit? There should be a differentiation between these different types of transactions, regular or new, and appropriate fees that make sense.</p>
<h2>3. Product experiences must promote conscious spending</h2>
<p>Paying with digital or credit cards almost feels like paying with someone else’s money, which can be a dangerous feeling when considering that the user does not see this money spent instantly. Say your regular coffee costs $3. Paying for that coffee with cash is a very different experience than paying with a card or a digital wallet.</p>
<p>When you have a finite amount of cash in your pocket, the physical act (and sometimes mental pain) of spending makes the money feel different and more valuable than the invisible money that you spend via your credit or debit card. In many ways, the silent pain we endure while paying in cash has been subconsciously raising our awareness about our spending.</p>
<h2>4. Accessibility and use must extend to all</h2>
<p>The idea of a cashless society has thus far not been very inclusive to the unbanked and underbanked population. To support a new model, this underserviced sector needs to be able to utilize this software. A user needs to be able to walk into a grocery store and give the cashier $100 for them to upload the money to their virtual wallet.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a friend needs to be able to send $100 to their virtual wallet. For a cashless society to work, virtual payments need to work with ease and certainty that they will be accepted at any and all locations, just like cash.</p>
<h2>5. The path to an open wallet</h2>
<p>Have you ever ordered a $15 meal on a food delivery app, only for the total to end up over $25? Beyond the delivery fee, tips and taxes, delivery apps are pricing in extra fees to offset the fees charged by credit card and payment companies. In an effort to avoid these extra fees, apps like Lyft and Uber have begun deploying their own digital wallets supported by ACH transfers.</p>
<p>Sadly, consumers are unlikely to see the benefit until these wallets reach wide adoption, which is clearly not happening because no one wants yet another app-specific wallet.</p>
<h2>The way forward</h2>
<p>To truly empower the consumer, both Google and Apple should keep developing their digital wallets with an open API payment system to allow all apps to securely interact with it for free. This will transform the Google and Apple wallet and will better service the unbanked and underbanked populations instead of just being a gateway for credit cards.</p>
<p>This would further support the unbanked or underbanked population as they too would be able to utilize an open wallet that can be refilled with cash in person. I should be able to use the cash I have in my virtual wallet with any app, website or physical merchant without paying a fee. I should also be able refill the wallet from my bank account or directly deposit some of my paycheck into my phone wallet. Merchants would also benefit from wallet-to-pay by paying no fees to Google and Apple.</p>
<p>Instead, the mobile wallet creator could introduce a new business model focused on discovery and connecting users and merchants, charging merchants for the connections that they facilitate.</p>
<p>In a not-so-distant future, when I get my new Apple or Google phone, it will have a wallet that can be used without fees for payment across all apps, in physical retail locations, and for peer-to-peer money transfers. The credit cards, or rather lines of credit, on my digital wallet will use an Affirm-like loan service that allows me to buy anything from a pack of gum to a luxury watch or even a car, just using my phone’s wallet.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Mastercard should not be the only players in the credit space. Innovation is necessary in the digital wallet space to pioneer the movement to change the outdated fee models for the simple act of money exchange.</p>
