										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies have turned to self-serve sales, which may encourage people to try freemium or open source versions of a product. Some percentage of these users may turn into paying customers, and in the best case will act as leaders to bring a product into their organization.</p>
<p><a href="https://calixa.io/">Calixa</a>, an early stage startup believes that this type of sale, known as a bottom up sales motion, requires a new kind of tool to manage the process, and today it announced a $4.25 million seed round.</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins led the round with help from Operator Collective, Liquid 2 Ventures and a bunch of individual investors. The round closed in February 2020, but is only being announced today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Calixa co-founder and CEO Thomas Schiavone says the roots of the company began when he was working at Twilio in 2010, and saw how powerful it was for developers to purchase tooling themselves. And an idea began to form that CRM tools like Salesforce weren&#8217;t built to deal with this kind of sales motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I realized [at Twilio] was that developers were just signing up more and more every day, and that if you really wanted to stay on top of what was going on and try to effectively grow and retain those accounts, you weren&#8217;t looking in Salesforce,&#8221; Schiavone told me.</p>
<p>He said that he decided to start Calixa in 2019 to solve this problem once and for all. While this kind of user-driven, bottom up sale has been in place at software companies for years, he still saw a dearth of tools for dealing with its unique qualities in one place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw a great opportunity to build something that democratizes [&#8230;] running a bottom up company by not only giving all customer facing teams the ability to see what&#8217;s going on with customers, but also take action,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This ability to manage the process and maybe extend a trial, issue a credit or even reset a password while letting these teams see and understand the underlying customer data was what set it apart from traditional CRMs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The central thesis here is that Salesforce and other CRMs, don&#8217;t have that data. They&#8217;re too divorced or too much in this rigid world of the typical sales model, and you need something different to be an effective company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To use the product, you simply sign up and then link the various accounts the product needs to compile the data it needs. It uses various API connectors to make this happen, and all it requires is that you enter your user name and password to access the accounts and begins pulling together the data.</p>
<p>Bucky Moore, a partner at lead investor Kleiner Perkins says that the pandemic has accelerated the move to a bottom up approach as in person sales models have been impossible. &#8220;Core to the success of this strategy is a data-driven understanding of each customer and user. By democratizing this capability to companies of all sizes, Calixa&#8217;s opportunity is to become the de-facto customer operations platform for the modern software business,&#8221; Moore said.</p>
<p>Schiavone reports the company has 7 employees spread across the U.S., Canada and Columbia. He says that as he hires, he will have offices in cities close to his clusters of employees, but he sees a hybrid approach where employees can decide just how much they want to be in the office.</p>
<p>The company spent last year building the product and working with 21 beta customers. The product will be generally available starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security vulnerability in a popular iPhone call recording app exposed thousands of users&#8217; recorded conversations.</p>
<p>The flaw was discovered by Anand Prakash, a security researcher and founder of PingSafe AI, who found that the aptly named <a href="http://www.recorderforiphone.com/">Call Recorder</a> app allowed anyone to access the call recordings from other users â by knowing their phone number.</p>
<p>But using a readily available proxy tool like Burp Suite, Prakash could view and modify the network traffic going in and out of the app. That meant he could replace his phone number registered with the app with the phone number of another app user, and access their recordings on his phone.</p>
<p>TechCrunch verified Prakash&#8217;s <a href="https://www.pingsafe.ai/blog/how-we-could-have-listened-to-anyones-call-recordings?=7194ef805fa2d04b0f7e8c9521f97343">findings</a> using a spare phone with a dedicated account.</p>
<p>The app stores its user&#8217;s call recordings on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cloud-storage/">cloud storage</a> bucket hosted on Amazon Web Services. Although the public was open and lists the files inside, the files could not be accessed or downloaded. The bucket was closed by press time.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the cloud storage bucket had more than 130,000 audio recordings, amounting to some 300 gigabytes. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apps">app</a> says it has more than 1 million downloads to date.</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted the app developer and held this story until the flaw was fixed. A new version of the app was submitted to Apple&#8217;s app store on Saturday. The release notes said the app update was to &#8220;patch a security report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite a brief response to our initial email acknowledging the security issue, the app developer Arun Nair has not returned several requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The investment firm <a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/">Flagship Pioneering</a> has incubated a lot of life sciences companies since it was founded in 2000. In fact, while a general partner with Flagship Pioneering over the last 15 years, David Berry has started more than 30 companies, five of which trade publicly right now: Seres Therapeutics, Sensen Bio, Evelo Biosciences, T2 Biosystems, and Axcella Health.</p>
<p>Berry is often a company&#8217;s first CEO, then transitions out of the company within 18 months. But he has no plans to leave his post as CEO of <a href="https://www.valohealth.com/">Valo Health</a>, a three-year-old, Boston-based, 110-person drug discovery company that Berry and Flagship seem to think could become one of the firm&#8217;s most important companies yet. That&#8217;s notable, considering that Flagship incubated 11-year-old Moderna, which currently boasts a $50 billion market cap thanks in large part its coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s no surprise, given Berry&#8217;s and Flagship&#8217;s track record that Valo has attracted believers. Notably, today it is announcing a fresh $110 million in extended Series B financing from Koch Disruptive Industries that brings the round total to $300 million and the overall amount the young company has raised to more than <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/valo-health/company_financials">$450 million</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, given that there are hundreds of drug discovery companies in the world seizing on the latest advancements in AI, machine learning and computation, it&#8217;s easy to wonder what&#8217;s so special about this one. We got Berry&#8217;s take during a chat with him yesterday, parts of which we are featuring below edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Valo is trying to accelerate the creation of drugs, and it has a computational platform called Opal to do it faster and more effectively than many rivals. Is there a way to make it clearer to outsiders why this platform is so unique?Â </strong></p>
<p>DB: First, from day one, we were operating on a different scale [than past Flagship Pioneering companies]. Typically, when you look at Flagship companies, there&#8217;s an [exclusive] initial commitment by Flagship of plus or minus $50 million. But because of the scale of the opportunity that we saw ahead of us with Valo, we actually started out by bringing in external financing partners as part of a Series A that was right around $100 million.</p>
<p>[Also unique is the] breadth of what we&#8217;re trying to achieve through our systematic approach to R&amp;D, as opposed to a targeted approach to thinking about it. There&#8217;s been an historical challenge in life sciences in that companies are primarily viewed based on what their lead therapeutic asset looks like. But if you have the potential to change the scope, the scale, the potential, the speed, the probability of success, [and] the cost of developing drugs, you&#8217;re not going to look like a typical therapeutics company.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So your focus on multiple therapeutic areas at once &#8212; oncology, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases &#8212; is a distinguishing element of the company. How are you tackling so much simultaneously?</strong></p>
<p>DB: The legacy biopharma model is basically this point-to-point system [where up to 15 groups] do some work, and then they basically take the result of it and they throw it over a wall to another group that has its own framework. The model is intrinsically disintegrated. They use mice. They use cell lines. They use extracted organs. And those just don&#8217;t represent what a full, intact living human actually looks like, and they don&#8217;t reflect what the disease looks like in the context of that human.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re doing is what I would call that next transformation . . . enabled by high-quality human-centric data [that we analyze] in an end-to-end, but componentized manner. What I mean by that is we&#8217;ve created a single underlying architecture so that we&#8217;re using the same species, we&#8217;re using the same decision-making criteria. we&#8217;re using the same KPIs throughout the entirety of the R&amp;D cascade, [and] we&#8217;re using the same bases of the core computation. We&#8217;re using the same self-reinforcing model to learn as we go. We have a local expression, because we have to perform a certain set of tasks in order to comply with the regulatory environment. But by doing it in this way as we do those tasks, we&#8217;re learning a lot more and we&#8217;re keeping that human centricity, so when we uncover, for example, a new target in cardiovascular disease or neurodegenerative disease, it&#8217;s based on our human data. It&#8217;s not based on a dog model or mouse model or something along those lines. It&#8217;s not based on cells adapted to plastic in a lab.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Where is that human data coming from? Is the data you&#8217;re feeing intoÂ Opal somehow better or different than what others are using?</strong></p>
<p>DB: We haven&#8217;t we haven&#8217;t yet disclosed where our datasets are coming from, but we have reason to believe that the scale and quality of the data sets are substantially high. We have not seen data sets that compare in scope and size. We have announced one subset of our data lake, but I would call it a small subset through a data partnership we announced earlier. [Editor&#8217;s note: this is with a company called Global Genomics Group, which gives Valo access to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/valo-announces-exclusive-partnership-with-g3-the-worlds-largest-and-detailed-cardio-metabolic-datasets-301197305.html">cardio-metabolic dataset</a>.]</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve been at this for a few years. Have you had any major breakthroughs?</strong></p>
<p>DB: I believe what we&#8217;ve done over the last two years is build an incredibly strong technology basis and foundation [for] transformation. We&#8217;ve announced four therapeutic programs that we&#8217;ve launched thus far, and each represents not only something where we&#8217;ve been able to develop a therapeutic candidate in very short periods of time, but we&#8217;ve also been able to overcome historical barriers that made developing those sorts of candidates much more difficult, and we were able to overcome those barriers in weeks.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you elaborate on one of those therapies to underscore your point?</strong></p>
<p>DB: One of the programs we announced is called NAMPT. What was really interesting about it is it&#8217;s a very powerful cancer target. The downside of it is it&#8217;s known to cause a very particular toxicological effect &#8212; it causes retinal toxicity &#8212; and we wanted to figure out whether we could get the benefit of the molecule by targeting the target but avoid getting that molecule into the retina, which required a very specific design. Long story short, in a couple of weeks, we were able to achieve a molecule that had enough differentiation between the blood in the eye that it shouldn&#8217;t have any substantial effects.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are any of these four candidates heading into the market any time soon?</strong></p>
<p>DB: I would love them to be in the market soon, but they&#8217;re not yet there. We are expecting that with the financing in hand, we should ultimately have molecules in clinical trials, and ultimately, we&#8217;re very excited to be able to transition some of the drugs that we are developing into [viable offerings in the market].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you sell then sell these to a big pharma company, or would Valo be marketing these itself?</strong></p>
<p>DB: Both are viable potential paths. Because we&#8217;re developing a number of different therapeutics, it gives us flexibility in the way we think about our ultimate business model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is facing another privacy complaint in Europe: A startup lobby group, <a href="https://francedigitale.org">France Digitale</a>, has asked the country&#8217;s data protection watchdog to investigate alleged breaches of EU rules.</p>
<p>The complaint, reported earlier by <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/french-startup-lobby-files-privacy-complaint-against-apple">Politico</a>, follows two similar complaints lodged in Germany and Spain by EU privacy campaign group noyb <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/apples-idfa-gets-targeted-in-strategic-eu-privacy-complaints/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>All these complaints are (directly and indirectly) targeting Apple&#8217;s IDFA &#8212; aka its mobile device Identifier for Advisers &#8212; with noyb arguing Apple should be gathering consent from users in the EU prior to assigning this unique device (whose purpose is, as the name suggests, to enable device tracking for ad targeting).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zJ0pW8IcCq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/apples-idfa-gets-targeted-in-strategic-eu-privacy-complaints/">Apple&#8217;s IDFA gets targeted in strategic EU privacy complaints</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s IDFA gets targeted in strategic EU privacy complaints&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/apples-idfa-gets-targeted-in-strategic-eu-privacy-complaints/embed/#?secret=zJ0pW8IcCq" data-secret="zJ0pW8IcCq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>France Digitale&#8217;s complaint also raises competition concerns, pointing to a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-takes-aim-at-adtech-hysteria-over-ios-app-tracking-change/"> looming switch by Apple</a> &#8212; to require opt in for third party apps to track users &#8212; and contrasting that with a &#8216;personalized advertising&#8217; setting in iOS which it says lets Apple track users and is switched on by default.</p>
<p>It suggests that default is contrary to requirements under EU law (citing consent standards in the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR).</p>
<p>The France Digitale complaint also raises questions over the level of data access Apple provides iOS users related to the ad targeting it carries out &#8212; saying users are only provided with &#8220;generic data (year of birth, sex, location)&#8221;, rather than fuller targeting data.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the complaint, an Apple spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>The allegations in the complaint are patently false and will be seen for what they are, a poor attempt by those who track users to distract from their own actions and mislead regulators and policymakers. Transparency and control for the user are fundamental pillars of our privacy philosophy, which is why weâve made App Tracking Transparency equally applicable to all developers including Apple. Privacy is built into the ads we sell on our platform with no tracking. We hold ourselves to a higher standard by allowing users to opt out of Apple&#8217;s limited first-party data use for personalized advertising, a feature that makes us unique.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CNIL has also been contacted for comment on the complaint.</p>
<p>The latest IDFA-related complaint against Apple is a little unusual as it&#8217;s not coming from a privacy group &#8212; but a startup lobby.</p>
<p>Evidently, though, Apple&#8217;s decision to switch to requiring opt-in from iOS users to third party tracking (rather than opt out) is ruffling feathers. (The move also led to a publisher lobby group in France to file a competition complaint last year). The not-so-subtle subtext, here, is Apple is being accused of privacy hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Asked why France Digitale is making a privacy complaint against Apple, a spokesman told TechCrunch: &#8220;Startups play by the rules. We expect the world&#8217;s largest tech company to do so. We believe no scale-up can thrive without a regulatory level-playing field.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are merely asking the CNIL to enforce the law. Privacy watchdogs investigate our startup members all the time. Lets them use their expertise on the bigger cats,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>While the group has attracted some quick publicity with the complaint to the CNIL, under GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism the matter would have to be referred to Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission &#8212; which is Apple&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the EU &#8212; which would then take a decision on whether or not to investigate. So there&#8217;s unlikely to be any quick regulatory action on this issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Most companies claim they want a diverse staff but at the same time, complain they donât know how to go about recruiting more diverse candidates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Enter <a href="https://seekout.com/">SeekOut</a> &#8212; a startup that is out to give companies no excuses with its AI-powered platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A group of former Microsoft executives and engineers &#8212;Â  <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/anoop-gupta-b16d">Anoop Gupta</a>,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aravind-bala-f211"> Aravind Bala</a>,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-tippett-4a54"> John Tippett</a>,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/vikas-manocha-7c7e"> Vikas Manocha</a> &#8212; founded SeekOut in 2016. The team started out building a messaging platform that provided a deep level of information about people that others might be emailing. When they realized that what customers really were after was the information they were uncovering, and not so much the messaging capability, the company pivoted in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Today, SeekOutâs goal is to help talent acquisition teams to recruit âhard-to-find and diverse talent.â The startup wouldnât name names but said it is working with 6 out of the 10 âmost highly valued companiesâ by market cap in the U.S. Overall, it had about 500 customers as of January across a range of industries from technology to pharmaceutical to aerospace and defense to banking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the years, SeekOut has built out a database with hundreds of millions of profiles using its AI-powered talent search engine and âdeep interactive analytics.â It finds talentÂ by scouring public data and using natural-language and machine-learning technologies to understand the expertise of each candidate and build a complete 360-degree view of each potential employee. Specifically, it blends info from public profiles, GitHub, papers and patents, employee referrals, company alumni, candidates in ATS systems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While SeekOut initially focused strictly on technical talent, it has since broadened its base to helping recruiters and sources find more diverse candidates in general as well as people with simply âhard-to-find&#8221; skill sets. And it claims to do it with âunprecedented speed and precision&#8221; via a blind hiring method designed to reduce bias. SeekOut then gives recruiters a way to engage with candidates instantly by getting access to the right contact information in a &#8220;single click.â</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2122834" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image001-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122834" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2122834" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image001-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image001-1.jpg 1430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image001-1.jpg?resize=150,55 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image001-1.jpg?resize=300,111 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image001-1.jpg?resize=768,283 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image001-1.jpg?resize=680,251 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image001-1.jpg?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2122834" class="wp-caption-text">SeekOut co-founders (left to right) Anoop Gupta, Aravind Bala, Vikas Manocha and John Tippett. Image courtesy of SeekOut</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup is hitting such a sweet spot that it attracted the attention of Tiger Global Management, the global investment firm that just led a $65 million Series B that values SeekOut at around $500 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Existing backers Madrona Venture Group and Mayfield also participated in the financing, which brings SeekOutâs total funding since inception to $73 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a world where so many startups have yet to turn a profit, SeekOut is a refreshing exception. Since its $6 million Series A raise in May 2019, the SaaS company says it has grown its subscription revenue (ARR) by âmore than 10-foldâ (although it declined to reveal hard revenue figures). And itâs been profitable, or cash-flow positive, each of the last two years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gupta, who serves as the companyâs CEO, said its platform (dubbed Talent-360) helps companies not only find diverse talent, but helps them improve retention by finding the ârightâ candidate to begin with.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While there was a pause almost across the board in hiring when the COVID-19 pandemic began, the emergence of remote work as a new normal has forced companies to think more creatively about hiring &#8212; especially since they are not constricted by geography as in the past &#8212; according to Gupta.</p>
<p dir="ltr">âThis freedom also means their need for tools like SeekOut increased and we have seen our business take off as a result,â he told TechCrunch. âThe focus on diversity hiring and our unique approach to finding the talent and offering blind hiring features has super charged the adoption.â</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mario Linares, head of talent acquisition at <a href="https://aviatrix.com/">Aviatrix</a>, acknowledges that competition for talent among software companies is fiercer than ever</p>
<p dir="ltr">âSeekOutâs innovative AI-powered search, global power filters, diversity filters, and talent pool insight have been critical components of Aviatrixâs global growth plan,â he said in a written statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Tiger Global Partner John Curtius, SeekOutâs platform has the potential âto transform the world of HR.â</p>
<p dir="ltr">âWe are impressed by the customer love and traction SeekOut is experiencing,â he said in a written statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, SeekOut plans to use its new capital to speed up the development and expansion of its platform and build customer success, engineering, sales and marketing teams in Seattle. And it plans to use its own platform to do it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company also plans to double its headcount of 50 over the next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.daily.co/">Daily</a>, the makers of a developer platform for real-time audio and video, has been booming in recent months &#8212; in part, due to the pandemic&#8217;s impact on remote work, virtual events, telehealth and more. Over the past year, Daily saw around a 20x increase in the number of paying customers and a 30x increase in revenue, it says. Though the team was initially hesitant to raise funds in light of this growth, they have now closed on $15 million Series A funding.</p>
<p>The new round was led by early Stripe employee-turned-investor <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/lachy-groom">Lachy Groom</a>, who became connected with the startup via his portfolio company Interval.com, a Daily customer. Tiger Global, other angels and most of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/">Daily&#8217;s seed investors</a> also participated, bringing Daily&#8217;s total raise to date to $22 million.</p>
<p>Daily itself was founded in 2016 as a big bet on video, and WebRTC in particular, but has been boosted by the pandemic and the market shifts that resulted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believed back then and have believed for a while that video would be everywhere. It would be a crucial part of how we live and work and engage with all sorts of products,&#8221; explains Daily co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nina-kuruvilla/">Nina Kuruvilla</a>. &#8220;We thought that this shift would require new platforms and tools to make working with video as easy as possible,&#8221; she says.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="82Vt8dOYF5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/">Teamflow lands $3.9 million for a productive virtual HQ platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teamflow lands $3.9 million for a productive virtual HQ platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/embed/#?secret=82Vt8dOYF5" data-secret="82Vt8dOYF5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As it turns out, Daily&#8217;s bet was a good one &#8212; though it took a few years and a global pandemic to see the hockey stick growth that startups aspire to.</p>
<p>Today, Daily is used by a number of companies focused on the future of work, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/tandem/">virtual office startup Tandem</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/">virtual HQ platform Teamflow,</a>Â <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/pitch-a-presentation-startup-from-wunderlists-founders-raises-30m-more-to-take-on-powerpoint/">presentation startup Pitch</a>, pair programming tool <a href="https://gitduck.com/">GitDuck</a>, virtual recruiting startup <a href="https://start.florecruit.com/">Flo Recruit</a> and others. It&#8217;s also been adopted by enterprises in spaces like healthcare and customer support.</p>
<p>With Daily&#8217;s platform, developers can either use a prebuilt UI to integrate video calls with just two lines of code, or they can opt to build out their own custom video <a href="https://uxplanet.org/what-is-ui-vs-ux-design-and-the-difference-d9113f6612de">UI and UX</a>. With the former, developers can embed a video call widget that features video chat, screen sharing and recording capabilities. Meanwhile, the latter gives developers more control over the layout, workflow and video and audio tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Video is a big challenging problem &#8212; real-time video and real-time audio. You need some set of tools to help you do it &#8212; especially if you&#8217;re going to roll it out quickly and you&#8217;re going to then scale it,&#8221; explains Daily co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwkramer/">Kwindla Kramer</a>. &#8220;We give you the APIs that let you develop really quickly, [that are] flexible enough for you to keep improving the product over time. And then we also have this global infrastructure that makes it possible for our customers to scale without having to, you know, build a whole equivalent of AWS themselves,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>With Daily, developers gain access to servers spread out in different regions all over the world, to protect against latency issues. Daily also does the heavy lifting in terms of making sure the product works well across all platforms and devices.</p>
<p>From a security and privacy standpoint, it&#8217;s HIPAA compliant and doesn&#8217;t capture customer data. It&#8217;s also transparent about when and how encryption is applied. For example, Daily&#8217;s peer-to-peer calls are end-to-end encrypted, while calls routed through media servers are encrypted to and from the servers, but are decrypted on the servers in order to do things like forwarding and recording.</p>
<p>The technology itself is flexible, too. Daily lets customers specify if they don&#8217;t want audio and video packets to move outside the EU, for regulatory reasons. Customers can choose to integrate with their preferred transcription engine or other major recording and live streaming APIs.</p>
<p>Through Daily&#8217;s developer dashboard, customers can view call quality insights and visualizations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122567" style="width: 1250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122567" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2122567 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg" alt="" width="1240" height="1698" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg 1240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=110,150 110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=219,300 219w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=768,1052 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=497,680 497w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=1122,1536 1122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122567" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Daily</p></div></p>
<p>To attract customers, Daily kept its pricing model simple. It has introductory plans for smaller customers that grow to the larger &#8220;Scale&#8221; plan at $199 per month for 10,000 minutes. From there, customers just pay an additional rate per minute as they grow.</p>
<p>The company was already seeing steady demand for video ahead of COVID, particularly in areas like remote work and healthcare. But COVID accelerated those use cases and impacted others, as well. After March 2020, the world quickly woke up to the need to prioritize video.</p>
<p>&#8220;Productivity and the future of work is rapidly changing. Online events, healthcare, customer support, interactive live streaming. IoT and robotics use cases. Social and gaming,&#8221; Kuruvilla says, rattling off the various Daily use cases.</p>
<p>During the first six months of the pandemic, Daily&#8217;s adoption grew as customers looked to get up-and-running with video quickly. Later, they began to shift toward innovating around what it means to build a digitally native service with video.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;An unsurprising wave of video-focused startups is trying to make video calls better&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/an-unsurprising-wave-of-video-focused-startups-is-trying-to-make-video-calls-better/embed/#?secret=Vncb9s35YY" data-secret="Vncb9s35YY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That&#8217;s helped to advance new models for how video can be used &#8212; like virtual fitness classes where people not only see the instructor, but also their friends who signed up with them. Or hybrid video and audio experiences for live events; real-time video conversations during livestreams; live e-commerce events; and more.</p>
<p>The company believes that this leap forward means Daily has a future even when, post-pandemic, things &#8220;go back to normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think some traditional video call usage is probably going to stagnate or go down, but all of these new use cases just feel like they&#8217;re ramping up &#8212; because it&#8217;s early innings and they&#8217;re really genuinely useful,&#8221; notes Kramer.</p>
<p>The team says they chose to work with Lachy Groom because &#8212; unlike the dozens of investors they pitched during their seed stage who thought video was a niche market &#8212; Lachy understood what Daily was doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only after we got to know Lachy that we really felt like there was another investor, like [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/">seed investor</a>] Jenny [Lefcourt from Freestyle], who really understood what we needed to do as a company to be the best possible company we could be. And that was worth raising a round with,&#8221; says Kramer.</p>
<p>With the additional funds, Daily will hire more engineers and focus on various product initiatives around call quality and reliability, expanding its global infrastructure and supporting larger calls and more hybrid use cases.</p>
<p>In addition to Lachy Groom and Tiger, Daily is backed by Freestyle Capital, Root Ventures, Y Combinator, Slack Fund, Moxxie Ventures, Haystack Ventures, TenOneTen Ventures, Ground Up Ventures, Offline Ventures, Work Life Ventures, Basement Fund, Compound, and numerous angel investors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[While Global-e is not a U.S.-based company, its recent growth underscores that the e-commerce boom we've seen domestically is hardly unique.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.global-e.com/en/">Global-e</a>, an e-commerce platform that helps online sellers reach global consumers, filed to go public this morning. The company&#8217;s F-1 filing is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1835963/000119312521073395/d77487df1.htm#rom77487_19">here</a>, if you&#8217;d like to read along.</p>
<p>While Global-e is not a United States-based company &#8212; it also has offices in the UK and Israel, among other countries &#8212; its recent growth underscores that the e-commerce boom we&#8217;ve seen domestically is hardly unique. Indeed, Global-e&#8217;s growth has been rapid and impressive.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Hell, the company is profitable while scaling, a rare sight among recent technology IPOs.</p>
<p>We care about the Global-e IPO because it&#8217;s a venture-backed former startup. Reading its filing, we can see that <a href="https://red-dot.capital/">Red Dot Capital Partners</a> has a material stake. Logistics giant DHL also put money into the company, along with money managed by Apax Partners and Vitruvian Partners, both private equity players.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Regardless, here&#8217;s a company that represents a bucket of private cash going public during a period of intensive flotation activity. Let&#8217;s get acquainted with what it does, dig into its numbers and add it to our IPO list.</p>
<p>Recall that Roblox is expected to begin trading tomorrow and Coupan on Thursday, after pricing Wednesday. Olo will price and trade next week. Coinbase is somewhere in the wings ahead of its own direct listing. And there are others: It&#8217;s going to be a regular IPO run for the next few weeks, not counting the other filings that will surely drop.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get our heads around Global-e. Into the tables!</p>
<h2>What is Global-e?</h2>
<p>Selling and shipping across borders can prove difficult and is probably hardest for smaller online sellers. And the global market is just that, so if you want to reach it, you have to do extra work. Global-e provides services to sellers to make selling around the world a bit easier. Things like, per its F-1 filing, localized browsing, pricing and checkout, shipping options, locally friendly payment solutions and returns support.</p>
<p>Given the e-commerce boom of the COVID-19 era, the company&#8217;s business exploded in 2020.</p>
<p>A few metrics make that plain. From 2018 to 2020, the company&#8217;s processed gross merchandise volume, or GMV, rose from $211 million to $382 million to $774 million. As you can imagine, its revenues grew as well, scaling from $38.6 million to $65.9 million to $136.4 million across the same time frame.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At TechCrunch Sessions: Justice, we examined the importance of ensuring products are designed to be accessible from the beginning. And how building the expertise of disabled technologists and advocates and into the DNA of your company from the start is vital not only to produce better products but also in the pursuit of a functioning and more equitable society.</p>
<p>On the panel were Cynthia Bennett of Carnegie Mellon Universityâs Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Srin Madipalli who founded accessible travel marketplace Accomable (which exited to Airbnb), and Mara Mills, Associate Professor of Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University and a co-founder and co-director of the NYU Center for Disability Studies.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On a defining accessibility</h3>
<p>Any nuanced discussion on designing for accessibility first requires a definition of accessibility. What do we mean by accessible products and how should founding teams and those involved in designing product frame internal thinking about accessibility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We learned that on one level the notion of accessibility is very simple: making products that everybody can use. However, from a company building point of view, it&#8217;s also important to think about accessibility from an internal tooling and processes perspective. It&#8217;s not enough to have accessible products for your users. If the software tools or ways of working at your startup exclude people with various disabilities, it&#8217;s infinitely harder to design accessible products anyway as prospective or existing employees with disabilities will be prohibited from doing their best work.</p>
<p>There was one other caveat, too: Disability is not an umbrella category and what works for one group may not work for another. And in fact, some accessibility features or culture and process changes might even be inaccessible to a specific group and this sense there isn&#8217;t a quick technological fix and you&#8217;re done.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Madipalli:</strong> It&#8217;s just simply a way of designing products and services to make sure that anybody could use them regardless of disability. And it&#8217;s very simple level. And, of course, there are nuances to that, and to what specific things one needs to do in order to achieve that. But at its most basic, it&#8217;s just making sure that we design things that everybody can use. <strong>(Timestamp: 1:24)</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bennett:</strong> Accessibility is not just about making sure that the products that leave the door are accessible, but also the tools and the processes, and the cultures are accessible. So if the products are accessible, are the tools used to create those products able to be used by everyone.<strong><em> (Timestamp: 2:18)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mills:</strong> It&#8217;s important to remember that access technologies are not inherently accessible themselves, whether we&#8217;re talking about software or a physical ramp, they have to be affordable, they have to be discoverable, people need to know that they exist, they often require training to useâ¦ they have to be employed in welcoming settings, the culture has to be there too. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 3:04)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mills:</strong> Disability is an umbrella category, and it&#8217;s really internally diverse. And we sometimes see access efforts that work for one group, creating new forms of inaccessibility for other groups. And I think that&#8217;s been really true in this moment of video conferencing where certain tools like Zoom work for certain groups and then they don&#8217;t really work that well for deaf and hard of hearing people or they haven&#8217;t before automated captioning became available. So just keeping in mind the diversity of disability and the diversity of access needs. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 3:51)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Medical and social models</h3>
<p>Entrepreneurs like to fix problems, theyâre wired that way. But what is the &#8220;problem&#8221; you&#8217;re trying to solve. This is where it&#8217;s useful to take the time to understand different models of disability, namely the medical versus social models.</p>
<p>The social model, which has overwhelmingly been adopted by disabled people themselves, says that a person isn&#8217;t made disabled by their medical impairment alone but by the way society is often arranged, including how the world is designed but also the societal attitudes towards people with disabilities and the barriers to inclusion this creates.</p>
<p>This means that disability is everybodyâs problem and that the solution is to fix society not the individual.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mills:</strong> Disability activists in the 70s, were pushing back against what you just said, they&#8217;re pushing back against this dominant medicalised perception of disability, that they called the medical model, which imagines disability only as a so called defect or a disorder, something that requires a cure <em><strong>(Timestamp: 6:19)</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Mills:</strong> According to the social model of disability, the intervention required is not medical, and it&#8217;s not individual, it&#8217;s a matter of social justice. So things like new architecture, new designs, new laws, new software. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 7:27)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>What&#8217;s the right time to begin thinking about accessibility?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re a founder or product team aiming to bring a new product or service into the world, hopefully by now you&#8217;re already wondering when the right time is to start thinking about accessibility. The answer, of course, is now. If there&#8217;s pushback within your organisation, you&#8217;re missing the opportunity to build a best in class product and remain competitive in just the same way that you wouldn&#8217;t neglect things like being mobile-friendly, security or designing for privacy etc. And, of course, leaving money on the table.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bennett: </strong>It&#8217;s never too earlyâ¦ If we say no to accessibility, which sometimes might be said explicitly, and other times it might be said implicitly through the technologies we design not being accessible, you are kind of deciding that a swath of humanity is not going to be able to use whatever you&#8217;ve developed. And that to me should never be okay <strong><em>(Timestamp: 9:38)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Madipalli: </strong>It&#8217;s an opportunity rather than a problem, it is something that actually, if it&#8217;s baked into the very beginning, and it&#8217;s seen as part of the workflow of building a product, doesn&#8217;t have to be of a different challenge. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 12:32)</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Madipalli: </strong>It&#8217;s really important for founders to not see this as a problem to be solved, that this can be something that is just part of making our product or service kind of usable by our customers and delivering a great customer experience. And, and again, at a fundamental level, a startup can only survive by building a product that customers like, and I would see making sure the product is accessible is central to that in the first place. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 13:26)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>Nothing about us without us</h3>
<p>The need to involve disabled people in the design process, both as internal employees but also externally, was a recurrent theme of our discussion. âNothing about us without usâ is a political slogan used historically by the disability rights movement and its simplicity acts as a useful reminder of the importance of co-design. And while the aim of accessibility is simple, in practice designing for accessibility is nuanced and can often be imperfect. Luckily, our panelists shared a number of practical tips, such as using flexible language or feature or disability aid specific when recruiting for user testing.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mills:</strong> Nothing about us without us is like this century old political slogan that was taken up by disability activists in the 80s, and the 90s. And if you think about that phrase, initially, the goal behind it was inclusion, and self representation. So like wrenching discourse about disability away from rehabilitation specialists who weren&#8217;t disabled and centering disabled people in discussions of disability. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 14:57)</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Bennett: </strong>Part of bringing everyone to the table is recognizing that we all come to the table with histories. And it&#8217;s likely that when we work with people, they&#8217;ve probably tried to solve the problem that we think they have, in many different ways. And so sometimes, that is amplifying a solution. Or sometimes it&#8217;s recognizing there might not be a solution. But we&#8217;re here to listen, and design can be kind of an amplifier of this tension or conflict that is probably unsolvable. But that we can kind of chip away. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 17:53)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bennett: </strong>People with disabilities need to be in all positions of power in these processes. They&#8217;re both people on the inside, but you know, also people who can give that fresh perspective from those of us who might be on the inside and remember, kind of outsider or more diverse perspectives<br />
<strong><em>(Timestamp: 18:37)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bennett: </strong>I am a disabled person, and I&#8217;m very proud of that identity. But not everyone who experiences discrimination based on the way their body or their mind works, uses that language. So often, when I&#8217;m trying to talk to folks, I&#8217;ll use terms like chronic illness or impairment or mental health condition or the deaf community. And so I try to have educated myself and I&#8217;m still learning about the different words that people use. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 19:00)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bennett: </strong>When you&#8217;re looking to reach out to folks I also sometimes specify the type of interaction I&#8217;m looking for. So for example, you might recruit blind people to kind of take part in a design process with you, when really maybe what you&#8217;re looking for is people who use screen readers or people who use Braille or people who use magnification. Being specific about the interaction technique or accessibility feature can help you make sure you get the more specific group that you&#8217;re looking for. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 19:36)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Madipalli: </strong>It&#8217;s really important to make sure disabled people are at the table in that decision making process, from the more kind of entrepreneurial or the industry perspective, it also just makes really good sense to make sure that the people that you are building solutions for help you co-create those solutions in the first place, just as a fundamental efficiency. If you&#8217;re trying to make your product better for disabled people, you can do that so much better if disabled people are helping you build that in the first place. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 20:17)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>How do companies avoid paying lip service to accessibility?</h3>
<p>Talk is cheap, so how do we avoid just paying lip service to accessibility? The answer is deceptively simple, have accessibility be ânon-negotiable from the top downâ. That includes resourcing accessibility efforts properly and incorporating it into performance reviews. And by doing this from the get-go, you have the opportunity to build an inclusive design and company culture that can scale and will last.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bennett: </strong>[By] putting material commitments and money toward this, having accessibility be non negotiable from the top down, I&#8217;ve talked about kind of incorporating it into performance reviews, like when people are being great allies, and are incorporating accessibility, that should count and there should be consequences when that&#8217;s not happening. So I&#8217;m really into like, putting the power and the money and having consequences when it&#8217;s not happening. <strong>(Timestamp: 27:36)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Madipalli: </strong>There are decisions that can be implemented from the get go, that does create a more inclusive culture from the beginning. And when you do have that buy in from the very top from the beginning, this doesn&#8217;t have to be the afterthought. And if it is there from the beginning, hopefully that is embedded. And as the company and organization scales, this is just something that is ingrained into into the organization. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 28:42)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toxic culture, deadly conspiracies and organized hate have exploded online in recent years. At TechCrunch Sessions: Justice we talked about how much responsibility social networks have in the rise of these phenomena and how to build healthy online communities that make society better, not worse with <a href="https://colorofchange.org/">Color of Change&#8217;s</a>Â Rashad Robinson, <a href="https://accountabletech.org/">Accountable Tech&#8217;s</a> Jesse Lehrich and Naj Austin, of <a href="https://www.somewheregood.com/">Somewhere Good</a> and <a href="https://www.ethelsclub.com/">Ethel&#8217;s Club</a>.</p>

<h3>On building intentional social spaces that cultivate positive behavior</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">When we think of social networks, we think of the huge platforms that dominate that conversation today. But those aren&#8217;t the only models for how digital communities can grow. Alternative social networks designed with specific communities in mind could cultivate healthier, more positive experiences for the people who need those spaces most.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Austin:</strong> One of the aspects that was really important to us when we got started was size. And so one of the factors of somewhere good is kind of connecting people with smaller, more intimate communities, because people tend to behave better in smaller networks. One of the things that we use in our product meetings to kind of base a lot of our decisions off of is mimicking a real life dinner party. Who would you invite to that party? How do people interact when they&#8217;re in those kinds of smaller intimate spaces, it tends to, again, be a lot more aligned with better behavior. And then that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s our perspective in terms of the many ways in which social networks can sort of be more user friendly and a multitude of ways. (1:26)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Even with Ethel&#8217;s Club, the physical location in Brooklyn, we built it out, so that it necessitated smaller, more intimate interactions with our members. And so we took that same little nugget of knowledge and used it digitally and Somewhere Good is now our technology platform that allows us to build that out on a much larger, faster scale, but still at that level of intention that people want to be connected in a more intimate manner with one another.&#8221; (2:49)</p></blockquote>

<h3>On tech industry exceptionalism</h3>
<p>Tech, in spite of its historic wealth and power, lobbying efforts, addictive products and global effects would never liken itself to something like the oil and gas or tobacco industries. But now that we&#8217;re seeing some of the society-wide ills Silicon Valley has sown, tech&#8217;s exceptionalism is looking more misguided than ever.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Robinson:</strong> I do think that in Silicon Valley, there&#8217;s&#8230; a tendency for people to be maybe a lot more impressed with themselves and impressed with their politics and impressed with their sort of like, ability to believe in something bigger&#8230;</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s a lot easier to deal with a Coca Cola where like I go in, and I know that these people think that they&#8217;re making soda, not making like a new society for all of us. And I can like, deal with the impacts of something that they&#8217;re doing. And we can all be on the same page, because they don&#8217;t think that they should get a Nobel Peace Prize. But in tech world, they people think that they can code, we can code our way out of structural racism, when in fact, the code is just amplifying structural racism. (8:15)</p></blockquote>

<h3>On lessons about online hate and disinformation from the Clinton campaign</h3>
<p>In 2021&#8217;s pandemic-ravaged world, 2016 feels like a world away but Donald Trump&#8217;s successful campaign for president, the Russian disinformation scandal and an open embrace of white supremacy in mainstream politics gave a telling glimpse of what was to come in the next four years â and beyond.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lehrich:</strong> Did I see QAnon coming? Probably not. But did I see this, like, horrifying crawl toward more and more explicit, you know, racism that&#8217;s always been there, obviously, but had been sort of at least relegated to the corner&#8230; You know, like, out and out racists like proud to be part open out in the open being part of these kinds of communities? That was that we definitely saw that on the horizon.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t think we necessarily grappled with it the right way. I don&#8217;t know, it was a really challenging thing to try to navigate at the time, but I very much felt like something really ugly is coming. And I definitely poured every hour of my waking time during the year and a half into that campaign, in part because I was like, terrified of where the country was headed if we didn&#8217;t win the election, and everything and more that I shared has definitely come to fruition.

<h3>On how social platforms mirrored entrenched racism in society</h3>
<p>Like more traditional sectors, the tech industry is dominated by white men who have created wealth by building what they know. The industry may be ahistorical by definition, but without looking back and grappling with the ugly side of societal power structures like misogyny and white supremacy, tech is doomed to perpetuate those same inequities at scale.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Austin:</strong> I don&#8217;t think the issues we&#8217;re seeing come from the internet and social platforms being free. I think it&#8217;s deep embedded systemic problems, as Rashad mentioned, that have haunted this country since day zero, think the people that are creating these platforms are creating what they know, which is to create, patriarchal, you know, systems that live within platforms that look glossy, and have illustrations and use fun, human centric language, but at the heart of it don&#8217;t make space for what marginalized communities feel on those platforms. And so I think that&#8217;s just embedded in almost every platform we use. As Rashad mentioned, we&#8217;ve got&#8230; the fact that [Zoom] didn&#8217;t recognize that there are people who want to purely cause terror to black people and people of color, for fun â it is a big issue.

<hr />
<h3>On how lived experience influences design</h3>
<p>One way to build social networks that allow a diverse range of communities flourish is to have those people in the room to begin with, building together on day one. Imagining online social spaces that feel safe and enriching is a natural process when your community has had to deal with online hate and harassment everywhere else for years.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Austin:</strong> How do you get in front of these issues that my team which is composed of black people, Latino people, Asian American people, queer people, non binary people, the things that we experience every single moment of being online and sort of a larger explanation of that, right? That can be Tumblr, it can be Twitter, it can almost be can every platform. All the things that we&#8217;ve lived through, we are saying, What if we didn&#8217;t have to? (16:35)</p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On how the government should hold social platforms accountable</h3>
<p>Federal and state governments are interested in cracking down on tech&#8217;s outsized power for the first time. A good place to start might be looking at tech like we already look at regulation on issues like food safety.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Robinson:</strong> We need some sort of CFPB, FDA version of infrastructure at the government level. Because anyone who has watched some of the hearings, knows that the hearings on nuclear power, or even keeping our milk safe, would look the same if we didn&#8217;t actually have government infrastructure, people who we elect to be in Congress or Senate can&#8217;t be experts on all these issues.</p>
<p>And so part of having that infrastructure is the same way I talked about having buildings that meet code. It&#8217;s not because of our elected officials or experts. It&#8217;s because we build the infrastructure at the government level, and that we actually have fines and accountability that&#8217;s at scale to make sure that they&#8217;re that they&#8217;re that there&#8217;s consequences. (22:19)</p></blockquote>
<p>The big challenge in regulating big tech companies is that they&#8217;ve become so large and so powerful that financial punishments can&#8217;t even make a dent at this point. Meaningful change needs to realign the industry&#8217;s incentives by examining the structures that allowed these companies to grow so powerful with no oversight to begin with.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lehrich:</strong> The fundamental incentive structure around large social media platforms right now is so perverse, they are incentivized to amplify the most toxic content, disinformation, hate speech â like that stuff drives engagement. And so long as they have platforms that where they have no accountability&#8230; talking about Section 230 reform, there&#8217;s no way to hold them liable from a legal standpoint, the FTC is not hitting them with fines that really hurt them. They don&#8217;t have ends and, and there&#8217;s just no friction anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8230; Until we fundamentally, fundamentally upend that incentive structure, they&#8217;re gonna continue profiting off hate and distortion and deceit and delusion and discrimination. And that&#8217;s just the reality.&#8221; (24:39)</p></blockquote>

<p>Beginning this week, Google will make it free for hotels and travel companies around the world to appear in hotel booking links on Google.com/travel &#8212; a change that will give users a more comprehensive look into hotel room availability as they research and plan their trips.</p>
<p>The company is positioning this change as a way it can better help meet consumers&#8217; needs, ahead of the expected return of travel as the pandemic comes to an end.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When travel does resume in earnest, itâs crucial that people can find the information theyâre looking for and easily connect with travel companies online,&#8221; <a href="https://blog.google/products/flights-hotels/more-choice-travelers-free-hotel-booking-links">writes</a> Richard Holden, VP of Product Management for Google&#8217;s Travel efforts, in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>In reality, the adoption of free listings is part of a larger effort underway at Google to shift many of its destinations that were previously powered by paid ads to become free listings. On the e-commerce front, this shift was meant to strategically counteract the growing threat from Amazon in e-commerce, which has steadily grown its ad business over the years. Amazon is also now often the first place users go to search for products, bypassing Google entirely &#8212; a worrying threat to Google&#8217;s core ad business.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122863" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122863" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122863" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg 2106w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=1536,904 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=2048,1206 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-09-at-10.16.50-AM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122863" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Shortly after the launch of free e-commerce listings, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/free-google-product-listings-expand-to-knowledge-panels-336797">Google said it saw increases</a> in clicks to its Shopping tab (70% lift as of last June) and an increase of impressions on the Shopping tab (130% lift). The idea is that, over time, Google will be able to pull in more brands to its e-commerce platform, increasing competition. As the market becomes more crowded, some brands that were previously benefitting from the free listings will turn to ads in order to increase their visibility.</p>
<p>Travel, including flights and hotels, are other areas where Google is positioned to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/cramer-to-investors-post-covid-travel-boom-could-be-skys-the-limit.html">grow in terms of post-COVID web traffic</a>. For the past several years, however, hotel booking links were offered on Google through paid Hotel Ads, which would display the real-time pricing and availability for specific travel dates.</p>
<p>With these listings now becoming free, consumers will have an expanded set of options. And that will make Google a more reliable place to search for bookings. It could help Google compete with an array of travel booking apps and services, which are also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/cramer-to-investors-post-covid-travel-boom-could-be-skys-the-limit.html">expected to boom</a> in the post-COVID months to come. And though the pandemic is not over yet, there are already signals that some are treating it as such in the U.S., with states <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mask-mandates-workers-health-safety-concerns/">lifting</a> mask mandates and Spring Breakers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/travelers-are-flocking-to-miami-for-spring-break-despite-covid-2021-3">planning their annual trips</a> to Florida beaches, for example. The full effect of the pandemic&#8217;s end hasn&#8217;t yet to be seen in travel, but consumer appetite is surely there after a year of locking down and staying at home.</p>
<p>Google today argues that the addition of the free listings will generate increased booking traffic and user engagement on its platform. And this will, in turn, expand the reach of advertisers&#8217; Hotel Ads campaigns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the shift to free listing will help bring potential new advertisers into the pipeline, too, as hotel and travel companies will be able to list for free by establishing a Hotel Center account. Over time, Google says the onboarding process will be made even easier and it will reduce the complexity of its tools to provide the hotel listings. It notes that its existing hotel partners who already participate in the Hotel Prices API and Hotel Ads don&#8217;t have to take any action to appear in free booking links.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.wrapbook.com/">Wrapbook</a>, a startup that simplifies the payroll process for TV, film and commercial productions, has raised $27 million in Series A funding from noteworthy names in both the tech and entertainment worlds.</p>
<p>The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Equal Ventures and Uncork Capital, as well as from WndrCo (the investment and holding company led by DreamWorks and Quibi founder/co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg) and from CAA co-founder Michael Ovitz.</p>
<p>âItâs time we bring production financial services into the 21st century,â Katzenberg said in a statement. âWe need a technology solution that will address the increasing complexities of production onboarding, pay and insuring cast and crew, only exacerbated by COVID-19, and I believe that Wrapbook delivers.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wrapbook co-founder and CEO Ali Javid explained that entertainment payroll has remained a largely old-fashioned, paper-based process, which can be particularly difficult to track as cast and crew move from project to project, up to 30 times in single year. Wrapbook digitizes and simplifies the process â electronically collecting all the forms and signatures needed at the beginning of production, handling payroll itself, creating a dashboard to track payments and also making it easy to obtain the necessary insurance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122853" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122853" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122853" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wide-with-Logo-BR.jpg?w=680" alt="Wrapbook founders" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wide-with-Logo-BR.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wide-with-Logo-BR.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wide-with-Logo-BR.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wide-with-Logo-BR.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wide-with-Logo-BR.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wide-with-Logo-BR.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wide-with-Logo-BR.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122853" class="wp-caption-text">Wrapbook founders Cameron Woodward, Ali Javid, Hesham El-Nahhas and Naysawn Naji</p></div></p>
<p>Although the startup was founded in 2018, Javid told me that demand has increased dramatically as production resumed during the pandemic, with COVID-19 &#8220;totally&#8221; changing the industry&#8217;s culture and prompting production companies to say, &#8220;Hey, if thereâs an easier, faster way to do this from my house, then yeah letâs look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Javid also described the Wrapbook platform as a &#8220;a vertical fintech solution that&#8217;s growing really fast in an industry that we understand really well and not many others have thought about.&#8221; In fact, he said the company&#8217;s revenue grew 7x in 2020.</p>
<p>And while Wrapbook&#8217;s direct customers are the production companies, co-founder and CMO Cameron Woodward (who previously worked in filmmaking insurance and commercial production) said that the team has also focused on creating a good experience for the cast and crew who get paid through the platform â a growing number of them (12% thus far) have used their Wrapbook profiles to get paid on multiple productions.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122856" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122856" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2122856" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chart-Alt2.png?w=680" alt="Wrapbook growth chart" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chart-Alt2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chart-Alt2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chart-Alt2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chart-Alt2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chart-Alt2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chart-Alt2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Growth-Chart-Alt2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122856" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wrapbook</p></div></p>
<p>The startup <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2020/08/wrapbook-raises-3-6m-in-seed-funding.html">previously raised $3.6 million in seed funding</a>. Looking ahead, Javid and Woodward said that Wrapbook&#8217;s solution could eventually be adopted in other project-based industries. But for now, they see plenty of opportunity to continue growing within entertainment alone â they estimated that the industry currently sees $200 billion in annual payments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to double down on whatâs working and build things out based on what customers have asked for within entertainment,&#8221; Javid said. &#8220;To that end, we&#8217;re working towards hiring 100 people in the next 12 months.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.pegasustechventures.com/">Pegasus Tech Ventures</a>, a firm that helps corporations launch startup investment funds, announced a new partnership with <a href="https://www.japanet.co.jp/shopping/">Japanet</a> today. Japanet, one of Japan&#8217;s largest television shopping companies, and Pegasus have established a $50 million venture fund to invest in startups from around the world, including for a major new development in Nagasaki.</p>
<p>Japanet is looking for startups to support its expansion into new sectors. These include a building project called Stadium City in Nagasaki that will open in 2024. It will center around a sports stadium, and include mixed-use facilities like offices, retail stores, hotels and event venues. Japanet also plans to focus on new services for elderly people, and childrenâs education.</p>
<p>Anis Uzzaman, general partner and chief executive officer of Pegasus Tech Ventures, told TechCrunch that Stadium City was created to help revitalize Nagasakiâs economy and bring new products and services, including tech, from around the world to the city. Japanetâs plan is to &#8220;both co-develop solutions with earlier-stage startups over time, as well as help later-stage startups localize and deploy in the Stadium City,&#8221; said Uzzaman.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Pegasus Tech Venturesâ team will help Japanet scout startups from around the world, including North America, Israel, Europe and Asia. The firm currently has $1.5 billion assets under management and other corporations it has worked with through its âventure capital-as-a-serviceâ program include Asus, Sega Sammy Holdings, Sunny Health, Infocom Corporation and Aisin Seiki. Pegasus Tech Ventures&#8217; portfolio includes startups like SpaceX, 23andMe, SoFi, Bird, Color and App Annie.</p>
<p>The Japanet fundâs typical check size for early-stage startups will range from $100,000 to $1 million USD. Later-stage startups will receive investments between $1 million to $5 million. Startups will work closely with Japanet and its corporate partners, including Mitsubishi Jisho Sekkei, JLL Mall Management, and MSC Cruises Japan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://preply.com/">Preply</a>, a tutoring marketplace for language learning, has raised a $35 million Series B co-led by Full In Partners and Owl Ventures, an edtech fund that has backed Byjuâs and Newsela. The raise comes nearly a year after the company landed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/online-tutoring-marketplace-preply-banks-10m-to-fuel-growth-in-north-america-europe/">$10 million Series A</a>. Investors in Preply include Point Nine Capital, Hoxton Ventures, EduCapital, All Iron, Diligent Capital and Evli Growth Partners.</p>
<p>Preplyâs recent growth, as well as a global boom in language learning, explains the current investor interest.</p>
<p>When it closed its Series A, Preply had 2 million booked lessons and 10,000 vetted tutors. One year later, there have been over 10 million lessons booked on the platform, and the tutor network has grown to 40,000 people across 190 countries. The startup was eyeing United States expansion in 2020, and today, â of its revenue comes from the country, making it the single largest market that the company has customers in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The growth signals that Preply is finding traction despite heavyweight competitors such as Duolingo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/duolingo-ceo-explains-language-apps-surge-in-bookings/">which plans to IPO this year</a>, and Babbel, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/language-learning-service-babbel-adds-live-classes-games-and-more/">which crossed $150 million in recognized revenue in 2019</a>. Biglai says itâs been able to differentiate itself from others because of its technology, which uses artificial intelligence to connect students with tutors.</p>
<p>Preplyâs sell is that it can connect students to the tutors that are best for their specific learning needs, weighing over 400 parameters before connecting two within a marketplace. For example, Biglai said that Preply can connect a student in San Francisco who likes studying in evenings with a tutor in a conducive timezone. It can also help students find tutors who have similar backgrounds than them, such as a bi-lingual base to help go in between languages for learning.</p>
<p>Preplyâs largest difference from competitors is in its philosophy of how learning should be done. Preply believes that learning should be live and with a native speaker, while a company like Duolingo thinks it can be gamified and self-led.</p>

<p>âOur customers think that our way of learning a foreign language is much more effective than language learning apps,â CEO Kirill Biglai said. Preply supports 50 different languages, including Spanish, English, French, as well as niche languages such as Icelandic, Tibetan and Catalan.</p>
<p>Other language learning apps have similarly been able to grow amid the pandemic even despite historical disinterest in the edtech subsector and existing players. Fluent Forever raised $4.9 million for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/fluent-forever-raises-4-9m-for-its-language-learning-system/">language learning system</a>, and Fluent City, which is a different company, launched subscription service.</p>
<p>Biglai sees a big opportunity for Preply in the enterprise. The company began selling to globally distributed businesses, as a solution to help employees learn languages of their colleagues and clients, in 2019. This year, Preply should have âhundreds and hundredsâ of enterprise customers, Biglai said.</p>
<p>The company makes money by revenue-share agreements with its tutors. It takes 20% of each lesson fee, which ranges from $15 to $20 per hour, as well as the entire cost of the first lesson, as a lieu of a lead generation. With the enterprise offering, Preply has the same business model but the hours per employee are capped with the employer taking the cost.</p>
<p>Preply wouldnât share teacher retention metrics, which would indicate how long teachers stay on the platform (which is key for student comprehension and continuity in learning experiences). Biglai did say that 30% of its top teachers stay on for numerous years.</p>
<p>The company refused to share revenue, but said that it could be profitable if it wanted to be. For now, itâs prioritizing growth in its B2B offering and business development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.mainspringenergy.com/">Mainspring Energy</a>, the developer of a new generator technology that use fuels like biogas and hydrogen, has unveiled its Mainspring Linear Generator, with a $150 million contract with NextEra Energy Resources.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s technology represents a significant step in the transition to a zero-carbon power grid given its ability to shift between traditional natural gas sources and alternative fuel sources like biogas and hydrogen.</p>
<p>So far, the company&#8217;s generators are under contract with a national supermarket chain that&#8217;s using the company&#8217;s tech at 30 of its grocery stores. The company began shipping pilot units in June and will begin commerical statements in mid-2021 according to a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s tech was initially developed at a thermodynamics lab in Stanford University where co-founders Shannon Miller, Matt Svrcek and Adam Simpson were working. Its design enables the rollout of generators that can replace traditional diesel and be used to improve the resilience of industrial sites against natural disasters.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Their linear generator, which the company said differs from engines, microturbines, and fuel cells, is a device that converts motion along a straight line into electricity using heat or chemical energy. In Mainspring&#8217;s case, a low temperature reaction of air and fuel drives magnets through copper coils to produce electricity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the combination of the design and control software developed by the company that allows its equipment to produce high-efficiency, dispatchable power, without the nitrogen oxide emissions associated with other generators, the company said.</p>
<p>The technology caught the eye of investors like Bill Gates and Vinod Khosla&#8217;s eponymous investment firm Khosla Ventures, along with some oil and gas companies like Equinor and utilities like American Electric Power. To date, Mainspring, which used to go by the name Etagen, has raised well over $80 million in financing.</p>
<p>In its approach to energy generation without the need for more complex mechanical systems or catalysts, Mainspring is akin to other startups like the Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Gates-backed Turntide Technologies that are trying to provide more elegant, software enabled solutions to motors and generator technologies.</p>
<p>Mainspring&#8217;s generators achieve their low capital and maintenance costs through use of standard materials, only two moving parts, and an innovative air bearing system that eliminates the need for oil, the company said. It operates without the use of complex mechanical systems or expensive catalysts.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Firms backed by Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Gates have funded an electric motor company that slashes energy consumption&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/firms-backed-by-robert-downey-jr-and-bill-gates-have-funded-an-electric-motor-company-that-can-slas/embed/#?secret=ktguf9xmMC" data-secret="ktguf9xmMC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company also touted its ability to spin up and spin down in response to conditions on the energy grid, which means that it can pair well with solar power or battery storage.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our customers&#8217; key drivers, in addition to carbon savings, is to save cost from their current grid prices,&#8221; said Miller, in a statement. &#8220;Our products can provide substantial savings to commercial customers on their electricity costs with a typical Energy Services Agreement. In this energy-as-a-service scenario, customers pay nothing up front and realize annual savings starting in the first year.â</p>
<p>Mainspring&#8217;s first commercial product is designed for a rated output of 250 kW and packaged in a standard 8&#8242; x 20&#8242; container, according to a statement. Those packages integrate two of the company&#8217;s125 kW linear generator cores, working in tandem, and combines UL-listed grid-tie inverters and auxiliaries into a turn-key package, the company said. Future configurations will provide higher power output to serve industrial businesses, data centers, hospitals, smart cities, and utility grid-level applications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many commercial and industrial customers as well as utilities want clean, reliable power generation, with the capability to switch to 100% renewable fuels like biogas and hydrogen as they become available,&#8221; said NextEra Energy Resources President and CEO John Ketchum, in a statement. &#8220;Mainspring is able to integrate clean onsite generation with both renewables and the grid and we&#8217;re pleased to support bringing this innovative product to market.&#8221;Â <u></u></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rep. Barbara Lee (D-13 California) took time out of her busy schedule to join us for TechCrunch Sessions: Justice. During our wide-ranging discussion, she talked about the issues in tech that unfortunately do not get enough attention: a lack of diversity in tech, the so-called pipeline problem, the digital divide and access for all to the legal cannabis marketplace.</p>
<p>Rep. Lee has represented the 13<sup>th</sup> District of California &#8212; Oakland and the surrounding East Bay cities &#8212; since 1998. Since then she has been an active member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which formed 50 years ago this month with 13 members and continues to have an enduring impact on the nation.</p>
<p>âThey were truly the conscience of the Congress,â Lee says, âbecause these 13 members of Congress on each and every issue, they pushed the envelope for justice &#8212; for racial justice. Yes, for the African American community, but in their initial founding statement, they said for all marginalized communities in this country. And so if you fight for justice for African Americans, you&#8217;re fighting for justice and equality for everyone who has been left out of this country&#8217;s promise of the American dream.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<hr />
<h3>On a lack of diversity in tech</h3>
<p>Rep. Lee, along with Rep. Maxine Waters and other Congressional Black Caucus members have visited companies in Silicon Valley and New York to address the issue of diversity in tech. In 2015, as a part of <a href="https://cbc.house.gov/uploadedfiles/cbc_tech_2020___updated.pdf">TECH2020</a> [PDF], the members met with CEOs of some of the biggest companies in the world to get their take on diversity in tech and the struggles the wider industry seems to have when it comes to increasing representation on their teams.</p>
<blockquote><p>Weâve made many trips to Silicon Valley and to New York and have met with the tech sector over and over and over again. We see a glimmer of hope, but not much. When you look at the numbers of the workforce in terms of employees, I think we&#8217;re looking from maybe &#8212; as it relates to African Americans &#8212; but maybe from 2 to about 7%. If that. When you look at the retention numbers, cultural hostility in many respects that tech sector employees tell me they were faced once they&#8217;re in, they don&#8217;t stay a long time, because the culture has not been a culture friendly for African Americans and Latinx individuals. And it&#8217;s a problem. And we&#8217;re gonna keep pushing. I co-chair TECH2020, which we started five years ago. And we&#8217;ve heard so many excuses from tech sector.â¦ Weâve got to crack that culture. And I&#8217;m telling you, we&#8217;ve got to do before we exercise our regulatory reform, and I&#8217;ll stick because there&#8217;s no way in America, any tech sector, any company should have only &#8212; and especially in California, only 2 to 7% of African Americans in the in the workforce. <strong>(</strong><em><strong>Timestamp: 2:48)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The conversation around diversity in tech is one that began years ago. Public diversity reports illustrate the struggle that companies still find themselves engaged in. And potential unwillingness to address the issue. Rep. Lee says she and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus have their eyes on the industry as a whole. And she talked a bit more about what tools the federal government has in its arsenal to help encourage companies to engage in equitable hiring.</p>
<blockquote><p>We have Black members everywhere on key committees that are conducting oversight and making sure that the tech sector, especially those &#8212; many received federal contracts, and they&#8217;re required to comply with executive order 11924. And they just don&#8217;t. They get away with it. And so no, I&#8217;m not satisfied. I think we made some progress, we see more diversity officers and more human resources officers who are African American, and I work closely with them. And I know the challenges that they&#8217;re faced with it. So I try to help them from the outside to make those companies respond in a more adequate and in a fair and equitable manner. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 5:26)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On the so-called âpipeline problemâ</h3>
<p>The âpipeline.â Itâs what company heads point to when theyâre asked why their rosters lack diversity. The thing is, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">itâs not real</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a total myth. First of all, we have &#8212; I know African American engineers, African American professionals who, quote qualify for these jobs. But I do know there&#8217;s unconscious bias, i.e. racism in the companies. And so a lot of the companies have developed these anti-racist policies and programs where they tried to do the deep dive and try to help people understand unconscious bias and what have you, but they don&#8217;t take the results and implement them. And so it&#8217;s just really, you know, it&#8217;s not good. When you look at the tech sector jobs, I believe it&#8217;s about 40% are non-tech-related. And so you can&#8217;t tell me that we don&#8217;t have African American accountants, and, you know, auditors, African American communications firms, all of the services that they buy, they don&#8217;t contract with, and the non-tech jobs they don&#8217;t hire black people for. And so it&#8217;s a shame and disgrace, but we&#8217;re gonna keep pushing. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 6:08)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On investing in diversity</h3>
<p>Oakland, Calif.-based Kapor Capital, the investment arm of the Kapor Center for Social Impact, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/kapor-capital-is-raising-a-125-million-fund/">raised $125 million</a> for its third fund. The firmâs investing thesis promotes startups that are committed to building diverse teams and a culture of inclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank god for Kaporâ¦ Theyâre committed to racial equity and racial justice. And in terms of their venture capital strategies in terms of how they seed firms to begin to enter into this space. What they do all over the state and in the country is remarkable. And I&#8217;m so proud that they are in Oakland, because Oakland, I think, is a microcosm of all of the possibilities, but all the challenges that we as African Americans and people of color have in America. <strong>(</strong><em><strong>Timestamp: 10:55)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On cannabis</h3>
<p>There remains a disproportionate number of Blacks incarcerated due to drug offenses. And as states continue to legalize marijuana, most recently in New Jersey just last week, the industry is seeing incredible growth. But Black Americans are being excluded from the economic benefits of that. As the co-chair of the Cannabis Caucus, Rep. Lee has plans to ensure the capital in the burgeoning legal cannabis market is available to all.</p>
<blockquote><p>I also have legislation is called the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/163/text">RESPECT Act</a>, which is about equity in the industry. The licenses &#8212; as of last year only maybe 1% or less were granted to African Americans. This is a trillion-dollar industry. And I don&#8217;t want to see what&#8217;s happening in the tech sector happening in the cannabis sector now, so we&#8217;re at the beginning of this. So we have in the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884/text">MORE Act</a> and in my bills, requirements to set up offices of equity and how you bring companies and help companies &#8212; I know in my own district we have an Office of Equity &#8212; to help them weed through the bureaucracy to get their licenses. But also access to capital. Sometimes it&#8217;s [$300K] to $500K just for a licenseâ¦ But I am determined &#8212; I am determined that we&#8217;re going to see those who have been most affected by these, this horrific draconian war on drugs get access to the industry and to the benefits. This industry creates jobs â good-paying jobs. They create economic opportunities, and they create community reinvestment opportunities, and so why not? And we&#8217;ve got to move forward. And we&#8217;re making a lot of progress. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 13:03)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new alliance between Swedish electric performance automaker Polestar and EV infrastructure startup ChargePoint takes aim at the charging experience with the debut of an in-car app that will let customers seamlessly charge their Polestar 2 model vehicles.</p>
<p>Seamless chargingâbeing able to pull up to a charging station, plug in and let the vehicle handle billing and paymentâhas been dominated by Tesla through its branded Supercharger network. Most other EV drivers have to pay for charging using an RFID card or smartphone, and the convenience level is on-par with a traditional gas station. The partnership eliminates the need for these extra items at ChargePointâs more than 130,000 stations. The app will embed directly into Polestar 2âs in-car âinfotainment system,â which runs on Googleâs Android Automotive OS.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>There have been some inroads into seamless charging elsewhere, most notably by Electrify America, the entity established by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel-emissions scandal. It introduced an in-car payment technology dubbed Plug&amp;Charge last November that will allow 2021 models of the Porsche Taycan, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Lucid Air to seamlessly charge at its stations.</p>
<p>The partnership also takes aim at the buying experience, another area that Teslaâs cornered with its branded Wall Connector home charger. Polestar 2 drivers will now be able to order the $699 ChargePoint Home Flex home charger alongside the purchase of a Polestar 2 and arrange for home installation prior to vehicle delivery.</p>
<p>Itâs a blueprint for future collaboration between the two companies, ChargePoint senior VP Bill Loewenthal said in a statement. The partnerships may be the start of many more alliances between automakers and EV infrastructure companies who see user experience as a key part of their value proposition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Arlan Hamilton, the Backstage Capital founder and managing partner, joined us at TC: Sessions Justice to chat about how she vets founders beyond Stanford signal, the changing role of venture capital, how raising money from the community, versus institutional LPs, can impact Backstage strategy.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>On what makes a founder make sense for Backstage Capital</strong></h3>
<p>In a world of $1 billion valuations for beta-stage startups and deals closed over the Twitter DMs within hours, it feels like the noisiest time in venture in the recent past. Hamilton talked a bit about how her firm, which has backed over 170 companies founded by underestimated founders, keeps focus. She got into if she follows trends, the dynamic of invite-only apps, and, of course, Twitter.</p>
<blockquote><p>I just don&#8217;t engage and follow and I just don&#8217;t have the that same need to be on everything early in first and be everywhere. Really. So, I like to watch people kind of run around and ask for invites and things like that. It&#8217;s just not as important to me. It&#8217;s just a strategy of like keeping myself calm, because there&#8217;s always a VIP to the VIP section, there&#8217;s always a further, further, further, and I find some of it quite distracting. I think it helps just to know where I was just a few years ago, and to know, kind of what&#8217;s important&#8230;and not get caught up in any hype anytime. And I think that serves me well when I&#8217;m making investment decisions, too. Because people who interview me or are, you know, want insights from me, they are always asking me about &#8220;trends.&#8221;Â  And I just don&#8217;t know the trends. We&#8217;re kind of counter-intuitive and and dancing to the sound of a different beat anyways. So I think that&#8217;s all helpful when we&#8217;re looking at companies and finding things in different places.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 1:32)</strong></em></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Backstage Capital was in the fortuitous spot of being built on remote work before the pandemic made it necessary. Still, Hamilton said that vetting early-stage founders is a difficult thing to do, and Backstage Capital only backs about 2% of the founders it sees.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you talk about founder product fit, we have that in spades. I am gay, and if I wanted to my wife and I wanted to have a child, there would be a lot that goes into that. There&#8217;s no accidental pregnancy with us. And so many people, you know, in the same boat, it&#8217;s almost like that with underrepresented, underestimated founders. They have so much to lose [and] I think they don&#8217;t have a second and a third and a fourth chances are that afforded to them. And so a lot of times, you&#8217;ll see companies that are built from such authenticity, and such genuine concern about a problem that they&#8217;re trying to solve, rather than so many companies I see elsewhere, that are how do we get rich the fastest way we possibly can. And that doesn&#8217;t always set you up with the right with the right recipe for success.<strong><em> (Timestamp 8:04)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<h3><strong>On the future of venture capital as an asset class </strong></h3>
<p>One thing that came up during the conversation was that Hamilton doesn&#8217;t see Backstage Capital staying within the definition of a traditional venture capital firm. At first thought, this shouldn&#8217;t come as a total surprise, considering the rise in popularity of alternative financing among startups, from debt raises, to rolling funds, to revenue-based financing loans.</p>
<p>But in reality, Hamilton says that she has always known that Backstage Capital was a vector into the exclusive world of investment, which despite modest progress has still been reserved for wealthy, white men. Here&#8217;s what she said when I asked where she sees herself in five years:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve always said this, I don&#8217;t know if people pay too much attention to it, but I&#8217;ve always said that venture capital was the tool. It was the mechanism for which I could get in. I couldn&#8217;t be an angel investor, couldn&#8217;t do all these things. But, I could earn and learn my way in to venture capital. I&#8217;ve never been beholden to it. I&#8217;ve always said to that, I don&#8217;t know what the future holds. But I think maybe there&#8217;s another asset class that gets born. And we would certainly be part of that. And if that&#8217;s the case, I just think it&#8217;s a broken system. It&#8217;s an old system. There is a lot that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>And, again, it&#8217;s the people are kind of living in a fantasy world&#8230;So I think, just the way that I came in, I&#8217;ll probably pivot or or backstage, we&#8217;ll find ways we&#8217;ve already started. I mean, if you look at the rays that we did on Republic recently, that were that were, you know, still you could still be part of it, it&#8217;s just it&#8217;s an interesting thing. It didn&#8217;t exist, the way that we wanted it to exist this ability to to go to the crowd as a fund. And we trailblazing made a way we made a path. And I think that&#8217;s what founders are doing. We were just inspired by founders who are making a way for themselves left and right.<em> <strong>(Timestamp: 15:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">Examining the pipeline problem</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Her confidence in a potential pivot of Backstage Capital also stems from the fact that venture capital has stagnated, as an industry, to invest in underrepresented founders. The investor explained how the industry might lag behind from big deals if they continue to skip over diverse founders. Venture capital, as she sees it, might become less relevant in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>And eventually what&#8217;s going to happen is what I&#8217;ve seen so much of the same way people are leaving San Francisco in droves, they&#8217;re going to leave the arena of venture capital in droves. because so many people have just said I&#8217;m done trying to play that game. I&#8217;m going to bypass this altogether. I&#8217;m going to bootstrap I&#8217;m going to crowdfund I&#8217;m going to go with family offices. And venture capitalists don&#8217;t have that same sway and that same importance that they once did. And you may not feel that today, but you feel it soon. And you&#8217;re going to be the person who did not invest in Bumble, you&#8217;re going to be the person who did not invest in XYZ. So it&#8217;s at your own peril that you keep being blind to this in my opinion.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 14:38)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On raising from a community</h3>
<p>Since founding Backstage Capital, Hamilton has been clear that she believes the biggest opportunity for investment is underrepresented founders. Toddy, she talked about her decision to bring let others into the process through Republic.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s be clear: equity crowdfunding isnât a new concept, but this year will likely bring some healthy energy to the fundraising technique. Itâs because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/04/will-new-sec-equity-crowdfunding-rules-encourage-more-founders-to-pass-the-hat/">new SEC rules</a> allow companies to now raise $5 million a year through the fundraising channel. Republic is enabling startups and firms to take advantage of these new rules: the platform had more than $150 million in capital deployed across 150 deals in 2020.</p>
<p>In the chat, Hamilton explained why raising from supporters one by one instead of an institutional fund is important toher.</p>
<blockquote><p>For so many years, we had been beholden to &#8216;you need to raise a large fund, and then you need the management fee to pay for your operations, to keep you in business.&#8217; And every single year, we found a different way to do that, by necessity. It has been so difficult to raise. And this time, the crowd comes into play. That&#8217;s a grand and a great responsibility to have 1000s of people who are looking to you, looking for updates, and wanting you to win. I wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way. I&#8217;d much rather have 5000 people get a few extra bucks every year and be part of this, then to watch one or two institutional just get fatter. It&#8217;s just not as exciting. So the institutions are going to have to compete with the crowd now. And that is where things get really, really interesting.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 18:09)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> announced today that it plans to acquire <a href="https://www.docsend.com/">DocSend</a> for $165 million The company helps customers share and track documents by sending a secure link instead of an attachment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re announcing that we&#8217;re acquiring DocSend to help us deliver an even broader set of tools for remote work, and DocSend helps customers securely manage and share their business critical documents, backed by powerful engagement analytics,&#8221; Houston told me.</p>
<p>When combined with the electronic signature capability of HelloSign, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/dropbox-snares-hellosign-for-230m-gets-workflow-and-esignature/">Dropbox acquired in 2019</a>, the acquisition gives the company an end-to-end document sharing workflow it had been missing. &#8220;Dropbox, DocSend and HelloSign will be able to offer a full suite of self-serve products to help our millions of customers manage the entire critical document workflows and give more control over all aspects of that,&#8221; Houston explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Houston and DocSend co-founder and CEO Russ Heddleston have known each for other years, and have an established relationship. In fact, Heddleston worked for Dropbox as a summer in intern in 2010. He even ran the idea for the company by Houston prior to launching in 2013, who gave it his seal of approval, and the two companies have been partners for some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just been following the thread of external sending, which has just kind of evolved and opened up into all these different workflows. And it&#8217;s just really interesting that by just being laser focused on that we&#8217;ve been able to create a really differentiated product that users love a ton,&#8221; Heddleston said.</p>
<p>Those workflows include creative, sales, client services or startups using DocSend to deliver proposals or pitch decks and track engagement. In fact, among the earliest use cases for the company was helping startups track engagement with their pitch decks at VC firms.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jNxt2NVT6e"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/11/docsend-funding/">DocSend raises $8M for smarter document sharing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DocSend raises $8M for smarter document sharing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/11/docsend-funding/embed/#?secret=jNxt2NVT6e" data-secret="jNxt2NVT6e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company raised a modest amount of the money along the way, just $15.3 million, according to Crunchbase, but Heddleston says that he wanted to build a company that was self-sufficient and raising more VC dollars was never a priority or necessity. &#8220;We had [VCs] chase us to give us more money all the time, and what we would tell our employees is that we don&#8217;t keep count based on money raised or headcount. It&#8217;s just about building a great company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That builder&#8217;s attitude was one of the things that attracted Houston to the company. &#8220;We&#8217;re big believers in the model of product growth and capital efficiency, and building really intuitive products that are viral, and that&#8217;s a lot of what what attracted us to DocSend,&#8221; Houston said. While DocSend has 17,000 customers, Houston says the acquisition gives the company the opportunity to get in front of a much larger customer base as part of Dropbox.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Box offers a similar secure document sharing capability enabling users to share a link instead of using an attachment. It recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">bought e-signature startup SignRequest for $55 million</a> with an eye toward building more complex document workflows similar to what Dropbox now has with HelloSign and DocSend. <a href="http://www.pandadoc.com/">PandaDoc</a> is another competitor in this space.</p>
<p>Both Dropbox and DocSend participated in the TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield with Houston <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frsVoYyKpTk">debuting Dropbox in 2008</a> at the TechCrunch 50, the original name of the event. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/docsend-gives-you-analytics-for-documents/">DocSend participated in 2014</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt in New York City.</p>
<p>DocSend&#8217;s approximately 50 employees will be joining Dropbox when the deal closes, which should happen soon, subject to standard regulatory oversight.</p>
