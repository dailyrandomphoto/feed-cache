		Garrett Winther is a partner and program director at HAX, SOSV’s venture program for hard tech. An engineer by training, venture builder by trade, he is bringing hard-tech ventures to life at SOSV, IDEO and MIT.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I joined the team at SOSV’s HAX, a venture program designed to help early-stage hardware founders, my friends in tech shook their heads. Hadn’t I learned yet that hardware is too hard? What they didn’t see was a hardware scene evolving rapidly in contrast to its glacial reputation. The old hard-knocks hardware playbook has given way to a new, vastly more exciting one; emerging to meet civilization-level opportunities, like climate, that software can resolve alone.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today when I work with with founders in the HAX program, it is normal to build incredible (but feasible) plans to “reduce the world’s energy consumption by 10%” from </span><a href="https://www.seppure.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seppure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “eliminate all waste in the apparel supply chain” at </span><a href="https://unspun.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unspun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or “make global battery recycling 5x more profitable” with </span><a href="https://www.greenli-ion.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Li-ion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambitions like those reflect emerging mega-trends in the global economy centered around demands to decarbonize, modernize infrastructure, secure supply chains and fully digitize traditional industries.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tools and technology to move forward &#8212; from machine learning to sensors to nano materials &#8212; are more powerful and affordable than ever, which allows for higher ambition and far faster time to market. Visionaries like Bill Gates and Elon Musk have taken note, institutional giants like Blackrock are piling pressure on climate negligence and we witnessed the rise of HAX’s like-minded communities The Engine, New Lab and Greentown Labs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scope of this new world is so broad, in fact, that we no longer define HAX’s thesis around “hardware”; we call it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard Tech</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both because it’s hard, as in difficult, as well as moving far beyond the initial scope of early 2010s personal hardware devices and around-the-home IoT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s emerging all around us is a new generation of hard-tech founders, investors and technology</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with a few early signals for the hard-tech tidal wave coming. </span></p>
<h2>If “software eats the world,” hard tech gives it teeth</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last three decades have been defined by “software eating the world,” and it’s been feasting on the lowest hanging fruit. But our screen-based, server-based digital world is increasingly limited to marginal gains in niche markets. As our friends at Ubiquity Ventures say, it’s time for “Software Beyond the Screen”.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordable robotics, AI-driven sensor fusion, uninterrupted connectivity and super materials are merging into the technology stack to unlock massive new tranches of value for customers. Many HAX companies are operating 80%+ gross margin businesses that not long ago industry experts said only SaaS companies could achieve. Even more, the hardware + software combination can tackle more significant problems across industries than software alone ever could.</span></p>
<h2>Learn from Tesla: Take big shots at big industries</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When industry experts look to explain the unexpected rise of Tesla in the past 10 years to become a mass production automaker, they point to Tesla’s “software-led” approach. The truth is Tesla’s ascent centered on intense hardware innovation in batteries, motors, manufacturing and distribution models.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This same equation is playing out in dominant, multitrillion-dollar industries such as energy, construction and agriculture. Investors on the hunt for opportunities in these categories will need to be bold, but will find disproportionate returns if they include hard tech. To move the world forward, we will need to take big shots like Commonwealth&#8217;s Fusion Energy </span><a href="https://cfs.energy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear fusion reactors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Boston Metal’s </span><a href="https://www.bostonmetal.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emissions free steel </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">or Deepspin’s </span><a href="https://www.deepspin.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> low-cost MRIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Just as with Tesla and transportation, software may kick off opportunities, but industrial revolutions come from innovation in the physical world.</span></p>
<h2>New doors open for B2B sales</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing these massive opportunities requires partners and customers at industrial scale. Startups can’t afford to go it alone. The traditional advice for startups is to avoid corporate partners because they are scary, slow moving beasts that can’t work at startup pace. The reality is that large corporations have noticeably increased their appetite for emerging hard-tech startups and many have set up pipelines to engage with higher risk, more complex technology. In the last few years the number of corporations doing venture </span><a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/cvc-sea-change-corporate-venture-on-the-rise-Hbo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deals has more than doubled </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and many more are priming for the industry-wide upheavals already in motion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This enables startups to get inside corporate, B2B markets more quickly, which accounts for many B2B hard-tech startups scaling to millions in revenue at a pace once formerly limited to their software-only peers. It also accounts for the surge in VC capital to those same firms as well as the shift in HAX’s own make-up. Since our start in 2012, the HAX B2B portfolio has grown from 10% to 70% of our total investments, and that includes a majority of fastest growing early-stage companies. </span></p>
<h2>Tooling hard-tech companies is easier and cheaper</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The technologies and strategies for spinning up early-stage, hard-tech startups have advanced by orders of magnitude in less than a decade. The price of 3D printers had dropped from $20,000 to $200. Printed circuit boards ship around the world in just days (even amongst wild supply chains shortages). Hundreds of thousands of suppliers exist online ready to make and ship components overnight. It’s reasonable for an early-stage founder on a slim budget to build an impressive and revenue-generating prototype. As a result, hard-tech founders can zero in on their core technology development and take for granted many things formerly considered really “hard.” Similar to the rise of APIs, AWS and &#8220;no-code&#8221; that unleashed new applications for software, similar revolutions are the backbone of the new hard tech world. </span></p>
<h2>PhDs are the future icons</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because hard-tech commercialization is no longer a Quixotic quest, more PhDs and post-docs are signing up to start companies. It’s routine for a HAX startup to have a PhD founder, or one that spent years working on a doctoral thesis (</span><a href="https://medium.com/sosv-accelerator-vc/behind-the-numbers-at-sosvs-climate-tech-100-2ab258caef8f#:~:text=Scientists,particularly%20biomanufacturing)%20and%20energy%20categories."><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 40% SOSV Climate 100 companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have at least one PhD founder). They are responding to more entrepreneurial nudges directly from universities, but also are inspired by the call for big, civilization-level technology challenges, like climate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not an easy road for investors because, almost by definition, the work that comes off a university lab bench is going to be very advanced, somewhat speculative and lacking a proven market. In other words, hard-tech startups are usually in very deep waters, and expert leadership and insight are at a premium. As a result, many VCs are picking up scientists and engineers for their investment teams lest they risk missing out on the next generation of great founders and industry-shifting startups. We are at the start of a golden era of opportunity for our best minds in science and technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These highlights from HAX’s emerging Hard Tech rise are not a prediction of years to come, but a reflection of what the HAX team sees happening in our portfolio every day. We are stunned by the quality of ideas, ambition of the founders and the speed of execution against projects that not many years ago were written off as impossible. Sure, it’s still hard, but more entrepreneurs and investors are moving into hard tech as it becomes an inevitable force for the coming decades. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Edtech giant Byju&#8217;s has become the most valuable startup in India after raising about $350 million in a new tranche of investment from UBS Group and Zoom founder Eric Yuan, Blackstone and others that valued the Bangalore-based firm at $16.5 billion (post-money).</p>
<p>In a new filing, Byju&#8217;s revealed that scores of investors including Abu Dhabi government fund ADQ and Phoenix Rising had together invested about $350 million in the startup. The new valuation helps Byju&#8217;s surpass Paytm, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/">last valued at $16 billion</a>, for the crown position in the Indian startup ecosystem. (Paytm is currently working on exploring the public markets and eyeing to raise as much as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/paytm-ipo-shareholders/">$3 billion and eyeing a valuation of up to $30 billion</a>.)</p>
<p>The new tranche of investment is part of a larger round that Byju&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-in-talks-to-raise-over-600-million-at-15-billion-valuation/">kickstarted earlier this year</a> and is looking to secure over $1.5 billion. Some of its recent investors also include B Capital Group and hedge fund XN. The startup was valued at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/silver-lake-leads-500-million-round-in-indias-byjus/">$11 billion late last year</a>, and $5.75 billion in July 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup plans to use the fresh capital, in part, to acquire more startups. Byju&#8217;s, which acquired Indian physical coaching institute <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/byjus-acquires-indian-tutor-aakash-for-nearly-1-billion/">Aakash for nearly $1 billion</a> earlier this year, is conducting due diligence to buy and online learning startup Toppr and has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/byjus-in-talks-to-acquire-us-based-reading-platform-epic/">engaged with U.S.-based Epic</a>, TechCrunch reported earlier this year.</p>
<p>Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.</p>
<p>The pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools, accelerated its growth, and those of several other online learning startups including Unacademy and Vedantu.</p>
<p>As of early this year, Byju&#8217;s said it had amassed over 80 million users, 5.5 million of whom are paying subscribers. Byju’s, which is profitable, generated revenue of over $100 million in the U.S. last year, Deborah Quazzo, managing partner of GSV Ventures (which has backed the Indian startup), said at a session in March held by Indian venture fund Blume Ventures.</p>
<p>The startup executives said at a UBS event earlier this year that Byju’s current revenue run rate is $800 million, a figure they expect will reach $1 billion in the next 12-15 months. It has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-to-expand-to-international-markets/">accelerated its international expansion plans</a> in recent months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sean O’Sullivan, the founder of the global venture outfit <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a>, has slowly but steadily built up a sizable operation over the years.</p>
<p>SOSV started off as a family office, investing the capital of O’Sullivan after he cofounded two companies, including MapInfo, an outfit that went public in 1994 before Pitney Bowes acquired it years later, in 2007. The seed-stage investing outfit has since raised three more funds, including a <a href="https://medium.com/sosv-accelerator-vc/sosv-raises-277-million-in-oversubscribed-fourth-fund-to-invest-in-early-stage-deep-tech-startups-264bfffa7dc3">$277 million</a> early-stage fund that it closed in 2019 and is actively investing from right now.</p>
<p>Now, to complement those funds, the organization has raised $100 million for what it’s calling a &#8220;select fund&#8221; that&#8217;s meant to help SOSV maintain its pro rata stake in some of its breakaway portfolio companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Because of other tools in the market, SOSV wasn’t completely hamstrung until now. Instead, SOSV has, on occasion, assembled a special purpose vehicle to re-invest in certain of the startups it has backed. But O’Sullivan says these were relatively small SPVs &#8212; think $2 million in size or less. The new fund, he says, is expected to write checks of between $2 million and $5 million and even up to $10 million &#8212; or 10% of the fund, per SOSV’s agreement with its investors.</p>
<p>Certainly, the new fund also gives startups even more reason to work with SOSV, which tends to write its seed checks to first-time founders, who O’Sullivan observes are often overlooked &#8212; wrongly &#8212;  by investors in favor of repeat founders.</p>
<p>He points to Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and Alibaba, noting that landscape would look rather different without them. He says experienced the phenomenon himself when he cofounded a company (NetCentric) after MapInfo. &#8220;People were just lining up to invest,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It was so easy to raise the funds without anything other than a business plan, and these days, you don&#8217;t even need one of those.&#8221;</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean SOSV will get as big a bite as it might like in every deal. Though SOSV has enjoyed success by betting on new entrepreneurs &#8212; it was among the first investors in FormLabs, for example, a company now valued at $2 billion; it also backed JUMP, the bike-share startup that Uber acquired in 2018 &#8212; a $100 million fund is small by current standards. SOSV could well find itself competing against players that have billions of dollars to deploy and which are writing bigger checks to younger companies at a velocity never before seen in the world of venture capital.</p>
<p>It’s not an absurd concern, agrees O’Sullivan. He says he saw some sharp elbows just this week, in fact. Part of a $100 million-plus round was coming together, and a firm that O&#8217;Sullivan declined to mention didn&#8217;t want to make room for the startup&#8217;s Series B or A investors because it wanted to meet a certain equity threshold.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Sullivan suggests the earlier investors acquiesced. (&#8220;They&#8217;re giving us a multi-billion valuation&#8221; and are also &#8220;trying to buy secondaries from existing investors,&#8221; he explains, while adding that SOSV would generally prefer to hold its shares through an IPO.)</p>
<p>Still, he suggests there&#8217;s no need to worry about SOSV. While it&#8217;s willing to go with the flow, O&#8217;Sullivan says that in &#8220;most cases, there&#8217;s enough to go around for the previous investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simply &#8220;good protocol for the late-stage investors [to make room] if they want to continue to have us introducing deals to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Put another way, SOSV doesn&#8217;t need to manage a megafund; it has leverage all the same.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Electric air mobility is gaining elevation. But there's going to be some turbulence ahead.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twelve years ago, Joby Aviation consisted of a team of seven engineers working out of founder JoeBen Bevirt&#8217;s ranch in the Santa Cruz mountains. Today, the startup has swelled to 800 people and a $6.6 billion valuation, ranking itself as the highest-valued electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) company in the industry.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As in any disruptive industry, the forecast may be cloudier than the rosy picture painted by passionate founders and investors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only air taxi company to reach unicorn status. The field is now dotted with new or soon-to-be publicly traded companies courtesy of mergers and special purpose acquisition companies. Partnerships with major automakers and airlines are on the rise, and CEOs have promised commercialization as early as 2024.</p>
<p>As in any disruptive industry, the forecast may be cloudier than the rosy picture painted by passionate founders and investors. A quick peek at comments and posts on LinkedIn reveals squabbles among industry insiders and analysts about when this emerging technology will truly take off and which companies will come out ahead.</p>
<p>Other disagreements have higher stakes. Wisk Aero <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/wisk-aero-files-injunction-in-trade-secret-lawsuit-against-archer-aviation/">filed a lawsuit</a> against Archer Aviation alleging trade secret misappropriation. Meanwhile, valuations for companies that have no revenue yet to speak of &#8212; and may not for the foreseeable future &#8212; are skyrocketing.</p>
<p>Electric air mobility is gaining elevation. But there&#8217;s going to be some turbulence ahead.</p>
<h2>Big goals and bigger expenses</h2>
<p>Taking an eVTOL from design through to manufacturing and certification will likely cost about $1 billion, Mark Moore, then-head of Uber Elevate, estimated in April 2020 during a conference held by the Air Force&#8217;s Agility Prime program.</p>
<p>That means in some sense, the companies that will come out on top will likely be the ones that have managed to raise enough money to pay for all the expenses associated with engineering, certification, manufacturing and infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The startups that have successfully raised or that will be able to raise significant amounts of capital to get them through the certification process … that&#8217;s the number one thing that&#8217;s going to separate the strong from the weak,&#8221; Asad Hussain, a senior analyst in mobility technology at PitchBook, told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s over 100 startups in the space. Not all of them are going to be able to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just consider some of the expenses accrued by the biggest eVTOLs last year: Joby Aviation spent a whopping $108 million on research and development, a $30 million increase from 2019. Archer spent $21 million in R&amp;D in 2020, according to regulatory filings. Meanwhile, Joby&#8217;s net loss last year was $114.2 million and Archer&#8217;s was $24.8 million, though, of course, neither company has brought a product to market yet. Operating expenses will likely only continue to grow into the future as companies enter into manufacturing and deployment phases.</p>
<p>What that means for the future of the industry is likely two things: more SPAC deals and more acquisitions.</p>
<p>Mobility companies, including those working on electrified transport, are often pre-revenue and have capitally intensive business models — a combination that can make it difficult to find buyers in a traditional IPO. SPACs have become increasingly popular as a shorter, less expensive path to becoming a public company. SPACs have also historically received less scrutiny than IPOs. Should the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission start to take a closer look at SPAC mergers in the future, it may impair the ability of other air taxi companies to go public this way, Hussain said.</p>
<p>That means market consolidation is nearly guaranteed, as smaller companies may find it more advantageous to sell than continue to raise more capital. It&#8217;s already begun: At the end of April, eVTOL developer Astro Aerospace announced the acquisition of Horizon Aircraft.</p>
<p>Horizon cited &#8220;greater access to capital&#8221; as one of the many benefits of the transaction, and other companies will likely find the buy or sell route to be the most beneficial on the road to commercialization. And just last week, British eVTOL Vertical Aerospace, which has an order for 150 aircraft from Virgin Atlantic, said it would go public via a merger with Broadstone Acquisition Corp. at an equity value of around $2.2 billion.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Michael Brown, a longtime general partner with <a href="https://www.battery.com/">Battery Ventures</a>, was just elected to the role of chairman of the National Venture Capital Association three years after joining its board of directors. Earlier this week, we caught up with Brown to ask about his new, year-long role with the 48-year-old trade group &#8212; and what issues he sees as top of mind right now for the many American VCs he is now representing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: VCs are always concerned about tax treatments, but these are obviously even more top of mind, given Joe Biden&#8217;s proposal last month to raise the top rate on long-term capital gains to 39.6% from 20%. What do you think of that proposal?</strong></p>
<p>MB: So you&#8217;re gonna hit me right in the face with a two-by-four on taxes in the first question, I love it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is the NVCA&#8217;s position, this is my personal position and if you ask most venture capitalists, this position is pretty widely held: what Biden is trying to do with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_Back_Better_Plan">Build Back Better Plan</a> . . . we are fully supportive of that and we are actively working with both the administration and policymakers in Congress to get done a lot of what he wants to get done. A lot of what he&#8217;s talking about &#8212; whether it&#8217;s the physical infrastructure, like bridges, roads, planes; or the digital infrastructure, meaning internet broadband access more broadly and cybersecurity; or climate infrastructure, [around] how we transition the economy and the country to a greener carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative world &#8212; venture capital is required to fund the entrepreneurs to do all of those things . . . It&#8217;s really almost hand in glove. He wants this to happen, we want it to happen, and we can help facilitate that [because] it&#8217;s not going to come from corporate America, we know that.</p>
<p><strong>TC: To your point, the money does have to come from somewhere. Is there a number at which you would feel more comfortable?</strong></p>
<p>MB: I don&#8217;t want to speak on behalf of the NVCA around what is our target rate. I will say that people in Congress and other talking heads talk about the revenue-maximizing rate in and around 25% to 28% . . . and I think that&#8217;s kind of where people feel it is reasonable to go to. What we do believe is that long-term investment should be rewarded and not disincentivized through tax structure.</p>
<p>What happened under the Trump administration, where they extended the time frame to <a href="https://www.proskauertaxtalks.com/2021/01/section-1061-final-regulations-on-the-taxation-of-carried-interest/">three years</a> [from one year] before you could receive long-term capital gains treatment, we were fine with that because we&#8217;re investing for longer than three years and I think having some time component to decide what is long term and what is not worked very well.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Another topic that comes up time and again is the IPO market. It sure seems healthy right now. Will you have any suggestions for the current administration relating to taking companies public?</strong></p>
<p>MB: We are obviously very supportive of the capital markets. That being said, if you look at the number of public companies today versus the number of public companies 20 years ago &#8212; and this is not just true of technology companies &#8212;  it&#8217;s roughly half the number. We think that&#8217;s a function of a few things. One is just how the capital markets function today &#8212; the ability to get research, etcetera, caused by [specific] legislation; regulatory issues; and just the burdens that a public company have versus a private company. You&#8217;ve also got other [rules] that have been passed over the last few years that impact the accessibility of the capital markets for private companies, and that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re seeing companies raise more money and stay private longer, which is not to the benefit of everyone.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What reform here would you press for most immediately?</strong></p>
<p>MB: Going back a ways now, in 2012, there was a piece of legislation called the Jobs Act that helped open up the public markets by addressing some of the risks and costs associated with going public and the regulatory burden. That needs to be updated. That&#8217;s something in particular that if we can modify it and make it current, it will help create that on ramp for smaller companies to access the public markets sooner and earlier.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you think of SPACs, these special purpose acquisition companies that are being raised to take companies public, including, oftentimes by those companies&#8217; own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/um-where-is-the-sec-when-it-comes-to-spacs-and-conflicts-of-interest/">earlier investors</a>?</strong></p>
<p>MB: It&#8217;s good to have more alternatives and more ways for companies to access capital markets. That being said, those vehicles need to be appropriately regulated, and SPACs is one area where regulation has not kept up with kind of the realities on the ground. I think Chairman Gensler and even before him in the previous administration, [the agency] also felt like there needs to be better controls on the stock market.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of a SPAC is the ability to offer forward guidance. You can&#8217;t have that in an IPO or even a direct listing and I would not be surprised if the SEC comes out with either revised guidance and or a complete restriction on the ability to provide forward guidance. There&#8217;s probably something that should be done there, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>As for conflicts of interest related to the economics centered on investors buying companies within their own portfolio, I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;ll be regulatory remedies for the conflicts. The SEC has the ability to review any of these [deals] if they want, but in the meantime, we&#8217;re seeing the market actually changing the economic terms. You&#8217;re seeing reduced promotes by the SPAC sponsors. You&#8217;re seeing reduced warrant coverage or even the elimination of warrant coverage. You have some SPACs that look like venture funds, where there&#8217;s really no promote but instead a success fee if the SPAC completes the merger and does well. You&#8217;re also seeing the vesting of the sponsor interest over a period of time, so they&#8217;re locked in over a longer-term horizon. The market is figuring out a lot on its own.</p>

<p><strong>TC: The NVCA has long been pro-immigration. What are some of your proposals on this front? What would you like to see change or instituted?</strong></p>
<p>MB: We took a very aggressive stance in the previous administration around the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/international-entrepreneur-parole">International Entrepreneur Rule</a> and even [successfully] <a href="https://nvca.org/the-international-entrepreneur-rule-at-long-last/">sued</a> the Trump administration to have them enforce or at least roll out the rule, which enables the entrepreneur to come to the U.S. as long as they have a minimum number of dollars in financing to build their business here.</p>
<p>Look, we&#8217;re in a competitive market. If you look at venture capital 15 or 20 years ago, 85% of the dollars that were invested went to companies in the United States, and a lot of those went to companies founded by immigrant entrepreneurs. Today, that number stands at just over 50% [including because] founders who are coming here and getting educated and going back home and founding a company.</p>
<p>We want founders to start their companies here and grow their companies here to create jobs and spread the wealth. The International Entrepreneur Rule was a stopgap to ultimately what is called the Startup Visa, an official visa status that would enable entrepreneurs to come in and give them certainty that they can stay in the United States and start a company and build it. This is something that&#8217;s been in the works for a long time, and we&#8217;re hoping that Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren out of the 19th District of California will <a href="https://today.westlaw.com/Document/I5c716b2f6d7511ebbea4f0dc9fb69570/View/FullText.html">reintroduce this visa bill soon</a>, so that we can put this as part of the Build Back Better Plan, because we need immigrant entrepreneurs to come here and start companies and employ the broader U.S. population.</p>
<p>If you think about the technologies that we used to get through COVID it was Zoom, it was Moderna, it was even Pfizer, dating back 100 years. All three were founded by immigrant entrepreneurs who came to the United States to start their business.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Is this a role you volunteered to do? Is there a game of hot potato that happens amid the NVCA&#8217;s board of directors every year?</strong></p>
<p>MB: [Laughs.] It is not just a hot potato that got passed. [NVCA president and CEO] Bobby Franklin and the outgoing chair discuss who they think would be good based on participation in board meetings and how engaged someone is with the things the NVCA is doing in Washington and who can be a good advocate for the industry and for the entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a pretty cool time to have this job; intellectually, this is going to be super interesting, and it&#8217;s super important to the industry [because] these are big policy initiatives and we&#8217;re a very important part of the solution here, and that needs to be well-known and well-understood by the administration and Congress. That&#8217;s our mission.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/"><strong>Technology companies are trying to figure out post-pandemic work</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Minor tech CEOs look to major tech companies for signals about what to do. Google, for example, is a famous cultural bellwether for other tech firms. But when it comes to post-pandemic work <em>every</em> tech company &#8212; big and small &#8212; is scrambling to come up with a plan that will keep control-oriented managers happy and staff from quitting en masse. TechCrunch has the rundown you need on what the majors are deciding.</li>
<li><strong>Didi’s going public! </strong>If you thought that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/uber-ipo-trading-debut/">the Uber and Lyft IPOs were fun</a>, oh boy is this good news for you. TechCrunch has notes on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/softbank-uber-tencent-set-to-reap-rewards-from-didi-ipo/">the venture capital winners’ list</a> and more on the company’s economics for your reading pleasure.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/freelancer-marketplace-toptal-sues-andela-and-ex-employees-alleging-theft-of-trade-secrets/"><strong>The tech labor market is brutal</strong></a><strong>:</strong> So brutal, in fact, two companies that help their customers find remote, freelance technology talent are now in a legal fight. Toptal is taking Andela to court over “the theft of trade secrets in pursuit of a perfect clone of its business,’” TechCrunch reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups and VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/fresha-raises-100m-for-its-beauty-and-wellness-booking-platform-and-marketplace/"><strong>Vertical SaaS is still hot</strong></a><strong>: </strong>How do we know? Fresha just raised $100 million. The company provides software for hair and nail salons, yoga instructors, and other health, beauty, and wellness SMBs. Vertical SaaS companies can often have both attractive software incomes and strong payments revenues.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/temasek-and-general-atlantic-in-talks-to-back-indian-neobank-open/"><strong>More money for neobanks</strong></a><strong>: </strong>My general philosophy that there is infinite money available for neobanking startups around the world is holding up as TechCrunch broke news that “Bangalore-based neobank Open is in advanced stages of talks to raise about $100 million” from possibly Temasek and General Atlantic. The neobank could be worth $600 million after the deal, TechCrunch reported.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/tiger-global-in-talks-to-invest-in-classplus-at-over-250-million-valuation/"><strong>The edtech boom is not over</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Sure, COVID-19 is receding in some countries, and economic activity is rebounding globally, but that’s not stopping edtech companies that got a pandemic bump from raising more cash. This week it’s Indian edtech company Classplus, which could raise $30 million from Tiger Global we reported, at a valuation of up to $250 million. That’s real money.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/"><strong>Neither is global interest in funding more insurtech startups</strong></a><strong>: </strong>That’s what TechCrunch learned chatting up a bunch of EU-based VCs, who said that the European insurtech market is super busy, if perhaps not quite as frenetic as the market for insurance technology startups in America.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Insurtech is hot on both sides of the Atlantic</h2>
<p>This morning, The Exchange dug into the EU insurtech market, interviewing European VCs and collating the biggest recent rounds to get a temperature of the waters across the pond:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Timm, CEO, Root</li>
<li>Dan Preston, CEO, Metromile</li>
<li>Luca Bocchio, partner, Accel</li>
<li>Florian Graillot, investor, Astorya.vc</li>
<li>Stephen Brittain, director and founder, Insurtech Gateway</li>
</ul>
<p>Several European-based insurtech startups entered unicorn territory this year, such as Bought By Many, which offers pet insurance, London-based Zego and Alan, a French startup that raised a $220 million round.</p>
<p>According to Brittain, EU startups in this sector are “still at the very early stages of innovation,” having only shown “a fraction of what’s possible” in a market that is “as large as banking.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AutoX, Momenta and WeRide took the stage at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2022&amp;utm_content=chinacarpanel&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=chinacarpanel&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> to discuss the state of robotaxi startups in China and their relationships with local governments in the country.</p>
<p>They also talked about overseas expansion &#8212; a common trajectory for China&#8217;s top autonomous vehicle startups &#8212; and shed light on the challenges and opportunities for foreign AV companies eyeing the massive Chinese market.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Enterprising governments</h2>
<p>Worldwide, regulations play a great role in the development of autonomous vehicles. In China, policymaking for autonomous driving is driven from the bottom up rather than a top-down effort by the central government, observed executives from the three Chinese robotaxi startups.</p>
<p>Huan Sun, Europe general manager at Momenta, which is backed by the government of Suzhou, a city near Shanghai, said her company had a &#8220;very good experience&#8221; working with the municipal governments across multiple cities.</p>
<blockquote><p>In China, each local government is incentivized to really act like entrepreneurs like us. They are very progressive in developing the local economy&#8230; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">What we feel is that autonomous driving technology can greatly improve and upgrade the [local governments&#8217;] economic structure. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 02:56)</strong></em><br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Shenzhen, a special economic zone with considerable lawmaking autonomy, is just as progressive in propelling autonomous driving forward, said Jewel Li, chief operation officer at AutoX, which is based in the southern city.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has bought several virtual reality game studios over the past couple of years, and they added one more to their portfolio Friday with the acquisition of Seattle-based <a href="https://www.bigboxvr.com/">BigBox VR</a>.</p>
<p>The studio&#8217;s major title, &#8220;Population: One,&#8221; was one of the big post-launch releases for Facebook&#8217;s Oculus Quest 2 headset and is a pretty direct Fortnite clone, copying a number of key gameplay techniques while adapting them for the movements unique to virtual reality and bringing in their own lore and art style.</p>
<p>As has been the case for most of these studio acquisitions, terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. BigBox raised $6.5 million according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bigbox-vr/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, with funding from Shasta Ventures, Outpost Capital, Pioneer Square Labs and GSR Ventures.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;POP: ONE stormed onto the VR scene just nine months ago and has consistently ranked as one the top-performing titles on the Oculus platform, bringing together up to 24 people at a time to connect, play, and compete in a virtual world,&#8221; Facebook&#8217;s Mike Verdu wrote in a <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/welcoming-bigbox-vr-to-facebook/">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for a gaming hardware platform owner to build up their own web of studios building platform exclusives, but in the VR world things are a little different, given that Facebook has few real competitors.</p>
<p>While many of the developers inside Oculus Studios continue to build titles for Valve&#8217;s Steam store, which are accessible with third-party headsets, most non-Facebook VR platforms seem to be a shrinking piece of the overall VR pie, having been priced out of the market by Facebook&#8217;s aggressive pursuit of a mass market audience. Facebook&#8217;s Oculus Quest 2 retails for $299 and the company has said that it outsold all of its previous devices combined in its first few months.</p>
<p>In April, Facebook acquired Downpour Interactive, maker of the VR shooter &#8220;Onward.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">dug into the EU insurtech market</a>, interviewing European VCs and collating the biggest recent rounds to take the temperature of the waters across the pond:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Timm, CEO, Root</li>
<li>Dan Preston, CEO, MetroMile</li>
<li>Luca Bocchio, partner, Accel</li>
<li>Florian Graillot, investor, Astorya.vc</li>
<li>Stephen Brittain, director and founder, Insurtech Gateway</li>
</ul>
<p>Several European-based insurtech startups entered unicorn territory this year, such as Bought By Many, which offers pet insurance; London-based Zego; and Alan, a French startup that raised a $220 million round.</p>
<p>According to Brittain, EU startups in this sector are “still at the very early stages of innovation,” having only shown “a fraction of what’s possible” in a market that is “as large as banking.” Interestingly, he predicted that AI will play a larger role in the future as companies deploy it for fraud detection, improved customer experiences and processing claims more quickly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are fully expecting the next generation of AI-driven business to unlock real-time risk analysis, pricing and claims resolution in the next few years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thanks very much for reading Extra Crunch; I hope you have a safe, relaxing weekend.</p>

<p>So what do the Marqeta, Monday.com, Zeta Global and 1stDibs debuts tell us? We may have been too conservative.</p>

<p>On a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live, we spoke to Toast founder Aman Narang and Kent Bennett of Bessemer Venture Partners about how they came together for a deal, what makes the difference for both founders and investors when fundraising, and the biggest lessons they’ve learned so far.</p>
<p>The episode also featured the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-Off, where audience members pitched their products to Bennett and Narang and received live feedback.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is open to everyone each Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT, but only Extra Crunch members are able to stream these sessions afterward and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/extra-crunch-live/">watch previous shows on-demand</a> in our episode library.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhelm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim</a> solicited feedback from investors to get a temperature on the market for AI startup investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;The startup investing market is crowded, expensive and rapid-fire today as venture capitalists work to preempt one another, hoping to deploy funds into hot companies before their competitors,&#8221; they write. &#8220;The AI startup market may be even hotter than the average technology niche.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not surprising. The Exchange was on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">the Microsoft-Nuance deal</a>, The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/expect-an-even-hotter-ai-venture-capital-market-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-nuance-deal/">reported that it would be reasonable</a> to anticipate an even more active and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/17/why-its-not-surprising-to-see-nine-figure-ai-rounds/">competitive market</a> for AI-powered startups,&#8221; Alex and Anna note. &#8220;Our thesis was that after Redmond dropped nearly $20 billion for the AI company, investors would have a fresh incentive to invest in upstarts with an AI focus or strong AI component; exits, especially large transactions, have a way of spurring investor interest in related companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their expectation is coming true: Investors reported a fierce market for AI startups.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I started a tech company about two years ago, and ever since I’ve dreamed of expanding my company in the United States.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I would love to have a green card. Someone mentioned that I should apply for a diversity green card. Would you please provide me with more details about it and how to apply?</strong></p>

<p>Innovaccer founder and CEO Abhinav Shashank and CTO Mike Sutten write in a guest column that the U.S. healthcare industry is in the middle of a massive transformation.</p>
<p>This shift, they write, &#8220;is being stimulated by federal mandates, technological innovation, and the need to improve clinical outcomes and communication between providers, patients and payers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Improving healthcare now means we need to process tremendous amounts of healthcare data. How do we do it? The cloud, which &#8220;plays a pivotal role in meeting the current needs of healthcare organizations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Geoffrey Moore&#8217;s &#8220;Chasm,&#8221; a framework for marketing technology products that has been one of the canonical foundational concepts to product-market fit for three decades, needs a bit of an upgrade, Flybridge Capital&#8217;s Jeff Bussgang writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been reflecting on why it is that we venture capitalists and founders keep making the same mistake over and over again — a mistake that has become even more glaring in recent years,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>Bussgang goes on to consider the Chasm &#8212; and propose tweaks for thinking about market size in the modern era.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Who should my first marketing hire be?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is (by far) the most common question I’ve received since starting as Fuel&#8217;s CMO, and for good reason. Your first marketer will have an outsized impact on team dynamics as well as the overall strategic direction of the brand, product and company.</p>
<p>The nature of the marketing function has expanded significantly over the past two decades. So much so that when founders ask this question, it immediately prompts multiple new ones: Should I hire a brand or growth marketer? An offline or an online marketer? A scientific or a creative marketer?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once upon a time, the number of marketing channels was fairly limited, which meant the function itself fit into a neater, tighter box. The number of ways to reach customers has since grown exponentially, as has the scope of the marketing role. Today’s startups require at least four broad functions under the umbrella of &#8220;marketing,&#8221; each with its own array of subfunctions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The reality is that anyone who excels across all marketing functions is a unicorn and nearly impossible to find.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Here’s a sample of the marketing functions at a typical early-stage startup:</p>
<p><strong>Brand marketing:</strong> Brand strategy, positioning, naming, messaging, visual identity, experiential, events, community.</p>
<p><strong>Product marketing:</strong> UX copy, website, email marketing, customer research and segmentation, pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Communications:</strong> PR and media relations, content marketing, social media, thought leadership, influencer.</p>

<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">Respond to our survey</a> and help us find the best startup growth marketers!</p>
<hr />
<p>As you can imagine, that’s a lot for one person to manage, let alone be an expert in. What’s more, the skill set and experience required to excel in growth marketing is quite different from the skill set required to succeed in brand marketing. The reality is that anyone who excels across all marketing functions is a unicorn and nearly impossible to find.</p>
<h2>So who do you hire first?</h2>
<p>Unless you’re lucky enough to nab that unicorn, your first hire should be a generalist who can tend to the full stack of the marketing function, learn what they don’t know, and roll up their sleeves to get things done. Someone smart, savvy and super scrappy who understands how to experiment across marketing channels until they find the right mix.</p>
<p>But this utility player should also bring deeper expertise in one of the big marketing functions: brand, product, communications or growth. Before making this key hire, you need to figure out which marketing priorities are most urgent and, consequently, which marketing &#8220;persona&#8221; is most appropriate for your business at the earliest stages.</p>
<p>To figure out which skill set you need most in-house, consider these five questions:</p>
<h2>Which marketing channels have proven successful to date?</h2>
<p>If you’ve done some marketing experimentation previously, have there been any bright spots? Which channels are proving the most efficient from a customer acquisition, conversion, retention, engagement, whatever your key KPI is, perspective? If you find a promising area, find a candidate that has expertise in it. For example, if you are seeing good results with Instagram ads, hiring a candidate who has expertise in growth marketing makes sense.</p>
<h2>Where are the target customers?</h2>
<p>If you don’t have much data from channel testing, consider how your target customers are currently finding competitive products or services. At TaskRabbit, we knew from early customer research that clients were finding help with home services either through recommendations from friends or by asking Google (i.e., SEO and SEM).</p>
<p>So, that was a natural place for us to start. Our focus from a resource and staffing perspective in the early days was on growth marketing — driving more word of mouth, plus optimizing our SEO and SEM.</p>
<h2>How competitive is the market?</h2>
<p>How competitive is the category you’re playing in? Are there dominant players with strong brands? Do these brands have endless marketing budgets? Are CACs exorbitant because well-capitalized competitors are outbidding each other? If so, you might want to focus on building an exceptional brand and product/customer experience.</p>
<p>That means disseminating a unique story through organic channels (word of mouth, PR, influencers and organic social media). A brand marketer or someone with deep PR and communications experience makes sense in this scenario.</p>

<h2>Where do the founder&#8217;s skills lie?</h2>
<p>Another aspect to consider is the skills the founder(s) — or other members of the founding/early team — bring to the table. If a founder has a strong vision for the brand and extensive experience building brands, then focus less on a brand marketing hire and rather supplement the branding skill set with another marketing priority (i.e., product marketing). Likewise, if a founder has a strong vision for the brand but no one on the team knows how to build one, that’s a skill gap that your first marketing hire should fill.</p>
<h2>How important is trust building?</h2>
<p>Trust building has become an increasingly important aspect for brands as customers become more and more discerning. But trust building tends to be more critical in certain areas than others: New, nascent industries or markets, sectors with a lot of human interaction (services businesses, dating platforms, etc.), industries that are fundamentally changing consumer behavior (ride-sharing in its earliest days), or industries where the stakes or cost is relatively high (luxury goods).</p>
<p>If trust building is critical, consider a branding expert who understands how to build trust and credibility, and build an experience that consumers are passionate about. This person will likely have deep expertise in PR and brand building, as these channels tend to inspire the most trust among consumers.</p>
<h2>What level of experience is necessary?</h2>
<p>Once you’ve answered these five questions, you should have a pretty good idea of the type of marketing experience you want. But just how much experience should that person have? I typically recommend that seed-stage founders look for senior manager or director-level candidates at midsized companies.</p>
<p>At this experience level (six to 10 years), these candidates’ salaries tend to be more in line with a young company’s budget. Moreover, at this stage of their career, they tend to be both strategic and tactical. This means they can level up and think strategically about the business and the marketing function, but they are also happy to get their hands dirty and execute — actually dive into the Facebook platform and create ads, plan and host an event, or pitch a journalist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mate Rimac, the founder and CEO of Croatian electric hypercar and components developer Rimac Automobili, started a separate company nearly three years ago to work on electric robotaxis.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Little is known about the company, which still operates in stealth. Rimac told TechCrunch this week at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> he hopes to keep this separate company under wraps until the team is ready to showcase what it has been working on.</p>
<p>Rimac did provide some details on what he described as an electric robotaxi company. He said the company has offices in Croatia and the U.K. and could expand to other locations. Rimac also said the company intends to be a global operator and he expects to reveal what the team has been working on early next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Why stealth mode?,&#8221; Rimac asked during the interview. &#8220;Because there&#8217;s so much hot air in this industry, and so many PowerPoint companies, you know, announcing big things and not delivering and so on. We didn&#8217;t want to be that company, we wanted to do a lot of stuff — and like under-promise, over-deliver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Few even knew of the company&#8217;s existence until last month when local media discovered a <a href="https://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/hrvatski-prijedlog-fondu-eu-za-oporavak-rimcu-1-5-milijardi-kuna-za-razvoj-auta-bez-vozaca-15060549">Croatia Ministry of Transport filing</a> that described a proposed project involving an urban mobility ecosystem that used electric autonomous vehicles. While Rimac noted that was an unfortunate discovery, he wants to reveal their work properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;People see us as the hypercar company,&#8221; Rimac said, noting the company is viewed as one focused on ultra-high net worth individuals. (Indeed, Rimac Automobili unveiled a production version of its Concept 2 vehicle. The renamed Nevera has a $2.44 million price tag.) &#8220;We have many other things cooking and have a longer-term outlook. I think that the new mobility will be really a shift in society. Just like phones didn&#8217;t just change the phone industry. Apple didn&#8217;t just disrupt Nokia, but changed our lives. I think the next big change that we&#8217;ll have is mobility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rimac didn&#8217;t get into details about the autonomous driving system, sensors or design of the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that a lot of people are missing the bigger picture and focusing on some of the building blocks, like the autonomous driving system itself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We believe maybe that&#8217;s not the differentiator itself, that there are some other differentiating factors within the ecosystem of autonomous mobility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rimac later added that the user experience of the robotaxi is one area that he is focused on and believes it can be different than what others are developing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA said Friday it was <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/leo-economy/NASA-seeks-proposals-next2-private-astronaut-missions-ISS">seeking proposals</a> from commercial companies for two new private crewed missions to the International Space Station. The first mission would likely take place between fall of 2022 and mid-2023. The second one would follow sometime between mid-2023 and the end of 2023.</p>
<p>Private astronaut missions are a relatively recent initiative from NASA, part of its Commercial low Earth Orbit (LEO) Development program. For most of humanity’s history in space, trips to the ISS were reserved for astronauts from countries’ respective space agencies.</p>
<p>Houston-based startup Axiom Space was awarded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/axiom-space-and-nasa-detail-first-fully-private-human-launch-to-the-space-station-set-for-january-2022/">the first private astronaut mission</a>, to take place in January 2022. That mission will carry four private astronauts for an eight-day mission from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA will pay Axiom $1.69 million for services associated with the mission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Each of the new missions can be up to 14 days and proposals are due by July 9. The agency specified that the missions must be brokered by a U.S. company and use approved U.S. transportation spacecraft. (Axiom&#8217;s private mission will use a SpaceX Crew Dragon.)</p>
<p>NASA said that enabling private manned missions such as this one may help “develop a robust low-Earth orbit economy where NASA is one of many customers, and the private sector leads the way.” Thanks to the significantly decreased launch costs &#8212; due in large part to innovations in rocket reusability, led by SpaceX &#8212; as well as a whole new ecosystem of &#8220;new space&#8221; companies that have sprung up over the last five years, space has become busier than ever.</p>
<p>The agency also said LEO could eventually be used as a “training and proving ground” for the planned Artemis program &#8212; humanity’s long-awaited return to the moon &#8212; and missions even deeper into the solar system.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Didi filed to go public in the United States last night, providing a look into how the Chinese ride-hailing company's business weathered the pandemic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Didi <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764757/000104746921001194/a2243272zf-1.htm">filed to go public</a> in the United States last night, providing a look into the Chinese ride-hailing company&#8217;s business. This morning, we&#8217;re extending <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/softbank-uber-tencent-set-to-reap-rewards-from-didi-ipo/">our earlier reporting</a> on the company to dive into its numerical performance, economic health and possible valuation.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Recall that Didi has raised tens of billions worth of private capital from venture capitalists, private equity firms, corporations and other sources. The size of the bet riding on Didi is simply massive.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Didi is approaching the American public markets at a fortuitous moment. While the late-2020 IPO fervor, which sent offerings from DoorDash and others skyrocketing after their debuts, has cooled, valuations for public companies remain high compared to historical norms. And Uber and Lyft, two American ride-hailing companies, have been posting numbers that point to at least a modest recovery in the ride-hailing industry as COVID-19 abates in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>As further grounding, recall that Didi has raised<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/didi-dache/company_financials"> <em>tens</em> of billions</a> worth of private capital from venture capitalists, private equity firms, corporations and other sources. The size of the bet riding on Didi is simply massive. As we explore the company&#8217;s finances, then, we&#8217;re more than vetting a single company&#8217;s performance; we&#8217;re examining what sort of returns an ocean of capital may be able to derive from its exit.</p>
<p>In that vein, we&#8217;ll consider GMV results, revenue growth, historical profitability, present-day profitability and what Didi may be worth on the American markets, given current comps. Sound good? Into the breach!</p>
<h2>Inside Didi&#8217;s IPO filing</h2>
<p>Starting at the highest level, how quickly has gross transaction volume (GTV) scaled at the company?</p>
<h3>GTV</h3>
<p>Didi is historically a business that operates in China but has operations today in more than a dozen countries. The impact and recovery of China&#8217;s bout with COVID-19 is therefore not the whole picture of the company&#8217;s GTV results.</p>
<p>COVID-19 began to affect the company starting in the first quarter of 2020. From the Didi F-1 filing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Core Platform GTV fell by 32.8% in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2019, and then by 16.0% in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter of 2019.</p></blockquote>
<p>The dips were short-lived, however, with Didi quickly returning to growth in the second half of the year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our businesses resumed growth in the second half of 2020, which moderated the impact on a year-on-year basis. Our Core Platform GTV for the full year 2020 decreased by 4.8% as compared to the full year 2019. Both our China Mobility and International segments were impacted, but whereas the GTV for our China Mobility segment decreased by 6.6% from 2019 to 2020, the GTV for our International segment increased by 11.4% from 2019 to 2020.</p></blockquote>
<p>Holding to just the Chinese market, we can see how rapidly Didi managed to pick itself up over the last year. Chinese GTV at Didi grew from 25.7 billion RMB to 54.6 billion RMB from the first quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021; naturally, we&#8217;re comparing a more pandemic-impacted quarter at the company to a less-affected period, but the comparison is still useful for showing how the company recovered from early-2020 lows.</p>
<p>The number of transactions that Didi recorded in China during the first quarter of this year was also up more than 2x year over year.</p>
<p>On a whole-company basis, Didi&#8217;s &#8220;core platform GTV,&#8221; or the &#8220;sum of GTV for our China Mobility and International segments,&#8221; posted numbers that are less impressive in growth terms:</p>

<p>You can see how quickly and painfully COVID-19 blunted Didi&#8217;s global operations. But seeing the company settle back to late-2019 GTV numbers in 2021 is not super bullish.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway: </strong><strong>While Didi managed an impressive GTV recovery in China, its aggregate numbers are flatter, and recent quarterly trends are not incredibly attractive.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> is better known as the dominant app for peer-to-peer payments. But the company has been adding more features, such as a debit card, account aggregation, donations, money pots and more. This week, the company is adding <a href="https://lydia-app.com/fr/products/remunerated-account">savings accounts</a> thanks to a partnership with French fintech startup <a href="https://www.cashbee.fr">Cashbee</a>.</p>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with Cashbee, the company lets you open savings accounts through a mobile app. After connecting your bank account with Cashbee, you can transfer money back and forth between your bank account and a savings account.</p>
<p>Right now, Cashbee partners with <a href="https://www.mymoneybank.fr">My Money Bank</a> for the savings accounts. Cashbee doesn’t keep your money, it just acts as a middle person between your bank account and My Money Bank. With those savings accounts, users can expect an interest rate of 0.6% after an introductory rate of 2% for a few months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lydia basically offers the same terms and conditions with a few differences. Instead of earning 2% interest for the first three months, Lydia users only earn more interest during the first two months.</p>
<p>The other big difference is that Lydia asks you to put at least €1,000 on your savings account when you open it. If you go through Cashbee’s app, you only have to put €10 or more. But users can do whatever they want after that when it comes to putting some money aside and withdrawing money from the savings account.</p>
<p>But the fact that Cashbee is seamlessly integrated in Lydia is interesting. It’s going to expose Cashbee to a lot more users as Lydia has more than 5 million users. It’s also an important feature if Lydia wants to become a financial super app.</p>
<p>This savings feature competes with Livret A, the most prevailing savings account in France. Everybody can open a Livret A in a retail bank. You get an interest rate of 0.5% net of taxes. On paper, 0.6% is better than 0.5%. But Cashbee’s savings accounts aren’t net of taxes.</p>
<p>If you’re a student and don’t pay any taxes, that’s a better deal. But many people pay 30% in taxes on accrued interests, which means that you end up earning 0.42% in interests net of taxes with a Cashbee account.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to beat the simplicity of Lydia’s solution here. For instance, you can save up to €1,000,000 on your savings account while the Livret A is limited to €22,950. In other words, if you’re already using Lydia to send, receive and spend money, you might want to check out those savings accounts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now that we have your attention, know this: Prices go up tonight on passes to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=5reasonspost&amp;display=true">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a>. If you’re an early-stage founder (pre-seed through Series A), don’t miss this chance to save $100 on our two-day virtual event dedicated to helping you build a stronger startup. It’s one of the best investments you’ll ever make.</p>
<p><strong>It’s Now O’clock:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy your pass here</a> before <strong>the sale expires tonight at</strong> <strong>11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong>.</p>
<p>Why should you attend TC Early Stage 2021? Chloe Leaaetoa, the founder of Socicraft and an Early Stage 2020 attendee, explains:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>What you learn at Early Stage is so much better than the random information you find on YouTube. You get to interact with industry experts and ask them specific questions. It’s like a mini bootcamp, and you&#8217;re going to walk away with a lot of knowledge.</p></blockquote>
<p>What can you expect at Early Stage 2021? The first day is packed with presentations designed to help you learn (or deepen your knowledge of) essential startup skills — product fit, growth marketing, fundraising and a whole bunch more. We’ve tapped some of the best startup ecosystem experts who will not only impart their wisdom, but they’ll also take and answer your questions.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">the event agenda</a> and our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#3e01330b-4bf1-4206-b038-769db50898a0">roster of speakers</a>.</p>
<p>We’re talking an interactive experience — from which you’ll take away tips and advice that you can implement in your business now when you need it most. Case in point, again from Chloe Leaaetoa:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sequoia Capital’s session, <em>Start with Your Customer</em>, looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. I took the idea to my team, and we identified seven different user types for our product, and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.</p></blockquote>
<p>Day two is all about the TC Early-Stage Pitch-Off. Tune in and watch as 10 early-stage founders bring the heat. Each team will deliver a five-minute pitch in front of TC editors, global investors, press and hundreds of attendees. After each team pitches, they’ll engage in a five-minute Q&amp;A with our panel of top VC judges.</p>
<p>You’ll learn so much by watching those pitches and hearing the VC’s questions. It’s a great way to improve your own pitch deck. And if notetaking is not your forte, don’t stress. All sessions, including the pitch-off, will be available courtesy of video-on-demand.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=5reasonspost&amp;display=true">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a> takes place July 8-9, but you have just hours left before the early bird flies south and the prices head north. It’s now o’clock — beat the deadline and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">register here</a><strong> before 11:59 p.m. (PT) tonight</strong>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We spoke with a number of VCs from Europe to hear their perspectives on what’s happening on the ground, including folks from Accel, Astorya.vc and Insurtech Gateway.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. insurance technology market is hot and has been for years now. Back in early 2020, to pick an example, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/02/why-vcs-are-dumping-money-into-insurance-marketplaces/">reported on a wave of funding events</a> among domestic insurtech marketplaces. Those companies have since gone on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money/">raise hundreds of millions of dollars more</a>.</p>
<p>And after a long period of incubation, we’ve seen neoinsurance players from the U.S. like Root and Metromile go public. Hippo is working to join the cohort.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>So from the perspective of venture capital activity, startup growth and exits, insurtech is proving itself in the States. Even if growth remains the name of the game in insurance tech and profits are often scarce.</p>
<p>What about other markets? The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/31/european-insurtech-startup-wefox-grabs-650-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">recent Wefox round</a> caught The Exchange’s eye. A $650 million insurtech round would have commanded our attention regardless of its location. But to see a European insurance technology startup raise that amount of cash made us wonder if there’s as much money present for the EU market’s insurtech startups as we’ve seen here in the U.S.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>After all, with business-focused neoinsurance provider <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244313/0/en/Embroker-Raises-100-Million-to-Expand-Business-Insurance-Platform.html">Embroker raising a big round this week</a> in the United States, to pick an example, it seems that attacking the massive and antiquated insurance market is good startup sport. Why wouldn’t that concept apply to Europe?</p>
<p>To find out more, we got in touch with a number of VCs from Europe to hear their perspectives on what’s happening on the ground, including folks from <a href="https://www.accel.com/">Accel</a>, <a href="http://astorya.vc">Astorya.vc</a> and <a href="https://insurtechgateway.com/">Insurtech Gateway</a>. To ground us, we collated the biggest recent rounds from the EU insurance technology market. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>A quick note on insurtech exits</h2>
<p>Venture capitalists and startup founders get paid when they generate an exit. Lately, exits in the space have featured a number of IPOs.</p>
<p>The older a startup gets, the more it has to deal with public-market investors. Crossover funds and the like make their appearance before unicorns go public. And then former startups have to pitch not the venture capital market, but the public markets. It’s a different game.</p>
<p>That’s the impression that The Exchange got chatting with the CEO of Root, <a href="https://twitter.com/timm_alex?lang=en">Alex Timm,</a> this earnings cycle. He noted that public tech-focused investors don’t always grok the insurance elements of his business, while insurance investors don’t always grok the tech side of Root.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been just under two years since I reviewed the WF-1000XM3, and in that time, Sony’s earbuds never stopped being the reference point for high-end earbuds. Seriously, I reviewed a new pair like a month ago and still made the customary reference.</p>
<p>That’s a rarity in these days of the yearly upgrade cycle. And that goes double for the wireless earbud space. It already felt crowded when Sony entered it in earnest in mid-2019, and things have only gotten worse on that front. But the M3s were a breath of fresh air. With so many companies competing for the middle and low end of the spectrum, Sony dropped something truly premium.</p>

<p>Six months before the AirPods Pro arrived, the M3 hit the market with excellent sound and noise canceling. The latter has, of course, become standardized across the category, but when Sony brought it, it was nearly unheard of. In spite of the headphones’ warm reception, however, the company’s waited two years to deliver a proper follow-up. Understandable, I suppose. Improving on very good is difficult.</p>

<p>I’m happy to report that the WF-1000XM4 is worth the wait. Sony’s great at high-end headphones, and these are no exception. The new buds represent an improvement over their predecessors in a number of ways. Unfortunately, they’re priced to match. If you thought the M3’s were steep at $230, I’ve got some bad news for you, friend. The new ones run an additional $50.</p>
<p>The upshot is that new headphones means a price drop on the older units. A quick search shows them for around $178 from a number of places, putting them more in line with standard earbud pricing. At $30 more than the AirPods Pro, Sony’s really leaning into the premium end of the spectrum. If anyone has the resources and scale to keeping pricing down, it’s Sony.</p>

<p>Are the WF-1000XM4s worth the price? It’s a fairly subjective question, of course. What I can definitely say is that they’re among the best-sounding pairs of earbuds you can buy. I’m still not convinced that anyone can truly duplicate the over-ear headphone experience in a pair of buds &#8212; the form factor is just too limited for now. But there are definitely advantages to going with buds &#8212; namely portability and on these unspeakably hot summer days, a chance to let your ears breathe.</p>

<p>Buds are, of course, better suited to fitness, as well. Though if you’re specifically looking for a pair to work out in, these probably shouldn’t be your first choice. I mean, they’re IPX4 water resistant, which is plenty good for sweat, but these are more of a long plane ride or sitting at your desk and really enjoying the hell out of a jazz record kind of earbuds.</p>
<p>In part, because they’re big. Granted, they’re a fair bit smaller than their predecessors, and moving from a paddle design to placing the components above the ear canal is a net benefit, but they’re still a bit too large for a long run. And while this is one of those things that vary dramatically from person to person, I found that the buds tended to cause ear pain after wearing them for extended stretches. I found the pressure relieved a bit when I swapped the medium foam tips for a small (I’m a medium in virtually all variety of earbud tips), though the small were much worse at forming a seal in my ears &#8212; a necessity to really take advantage of the active noise canceling. And even still, the eventual dull pain was not non-existent.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165113" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165113" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9526.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It is also worth noting that I’ve had less than spectacular experiences with foam tips. They tend to be more prone to wear and tear than silicone and have a habit of getting a bit gnarly in the earwax department (look, this job isn’t always pretty). Though I understand why high-end manufacturers go this route, from a comfort perspective.</p>
<p>Also, hey, kudos to Sony for going with sustainable paper packaging. It’s not much to look at, but how often do you really look at the package your electronics came in? Anything that’s even slightly better for the planet is a net positive in my book. And besides, the charging case looks great.</p>
<p>It’s significantly smaller than the W3’s. These are a helluva lot more pocketable. It’s an understated matte black, albeit with a pretty loud white Sony logo on top. The magnets are strong and the buds snap into the case with authority &#8212; they’ll also attach to each other. A thin LED strip directly below the lid glows green or red, depending on charge. The case is wide enough to sit upright, so the USB-C port is located around the back &#8212; or you can charge it up wirelessly with a Qi pad.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165110" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165110" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165110" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9533.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165110" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Interestingly, the stated charging time is the same as the M3s, though the numbers have been shifted around. With the originals, you got six hours on the buds and another 18 from the case. Here it’s eight hours on the buds and 16 on the case. So, a full day, either way, but I certainly prefer the two added hours on the actual earbuds.</p>
<p>The buds themselves are a bit flashier than the case. The design features two intersecting circles, the upper most of which is designed to lie flush with the ear. The outside is accented with a metal microphone, with a second, flush microphone up top.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165118" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165118" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165118" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9514.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9514.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9514.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9514.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9514.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9514.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9514.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9514.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9514.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165118" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The sound of the buds is really excellent. It’s got the kind of instrument separation that opens up new details on familiar songs you missed with inferior buds. The default balance is terrific, as well. Sony doesn’t lean to heavily into the bass because it doesn’t have to. The headphones sound terrific across a wide range of music varieties, as well as podcasts.</p>
<p>The noise-canceling is, once again, industry leading. A simple tap on the left earbud cycles between ANC and ambient noise, and the difference is like night and day. I was really impressed by the sounds it was capable of blocking, including my extremely loud vegetable juicer. I was also impressed by the buds’ Bluetooth range.</p>
<p>With earbuds, it’s true that you often get what you pay for. That’s certainly the case here. Sony’s once again managed to set the bar for high-end buds with the WF-1000XM4.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Apple announced it wanted employees to return to the Cupertino campus for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/03/apple-employees-to-return-to-office-three-days-a-week-in-september.html#:~:text=News%20%7C%20Getty%20Images-,Apple%20employees%20will%20return%20to%20the%20office%20three%20days%20a,the%20company%20confirmed%20to%20CNBC.&amp;text=Apple%20will%20ask%20most%20employees,to%20five%20days%20a%20week.">three days a week</a> starting in September. Some employees who have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook">grown used to the flexibility of working at home</a> pushed back.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, with few exceptions, most employees went into an office most days. But when COVID hit in March 2020 and workers were forced home, employers quickly learned that their staff could be productive even when they weren&#8217;t sitting in the same building. Now it seems it will be difficult to put the genie back in the bottle.</p>
<p>Finding that right balance between fully remote and however a given company defines hybrid &#8212; like Apple, some days in the office and some days at home &#8212; is never going to be easy, and there will never be a one size fits all answer. In fact, it&#8217;s probably going to be fluid moving forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just to show how different companies are approaching this, we asked five other large technology companies besides Apple to see how they are treating the return to the office, and each was looking at some form of hybrid work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google is taking a similar approach to Apple, with three days in the office and two days at home. &#8220;We’ll move to a hybrid work week where most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best. Since in-office time will be focused on collaboration, your product areas and functions will help decide which days teams will come together in the office. There will also be roles that may need to be on site more than three days a week due to the nature of the work,&#8221; Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet wrote in <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work/">a recent blog post</a>.</li>
<li>Salesforce is giving employees <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/creating-a-best-workplace-from-anywhere/">a broad set of choices</a> depending on their role. Most employees can work at home most of the time, and can come into the office 1-3 days a week to collaborate with colleagues, meet with customers or for presentations. Others who don&#8217;t live near an office can be fully remote and those who choose, or whose job requires them to be office-based, may come in 4-5 days a week.</li>
<li>Facebook is expanding remote work, telling employees, &#8220;As of June 15, Facebook will open up remote work to all levels across the company, and anyone whose role can be done remotely can request remote work,&#8221; the company wrote to employees.</li>
<li>Microsoft is leaving it up to managers, but <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/10/09/embracing-a-flexible-workplace/">most roles are going to be remote</a> at least part of the time. As they told employees in an announcement recently, &#8220;We recognize that some employees are required to be onsite and some roles and businesses are better suited for working away from the worksite than others. However, for most roles, we view working from home part of the time (less than 50%) as now standard – assuming manager and team alignment.&#8221;</li>
<li>Amazon originally was looking at a policy of mostly in-office, but it announced this week that it had decided to offer employees a more flexible work schedule. &#8220;Our new baseline will be three days a week in the office (with the specific days being determined by your leadership team), leaving you flexibility to work remotely up to two days a week,&#8221; the company wrote in <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-updates-return-to-office-guidance">a message to employees</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The larger tech companies are offering most employees some level of flexibility to decide when to come into the office, but how do startups look at work as we move toward post-pandemic? Most startups I speak to don&#8217;t foresee an office-centric approach, with many taking a remote-first approach. Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/06/08/are-we-returning-to-the-office-or-is-the-future-remote/">recently surveyed 226 startups</a> in its portfolio and found that two-thirds of portfolio companies are looking at a similar hybrid approach as their larger counterparts. In fact, 87 were thinking about 1-2 days a week, with 64 looking at no office at all, only gathering for company off-sites. By contrast, just 18 said that they wouldn&#8217;t allow any work from home.</p>
<p>Dion Hinchcliffe, an analyst at Constellation Research who has been studying distributed work for many years, says that tech companies will be more likely to embrace flexible work models now that they have seen how it works during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most tech companies will maintain some degree of flexibility when returning to the office, especially since it is popular with many of their workers. Plus the worries about productivity loss have turned out to be largely unfounded,&#8221; he said. But he emphasized that this would not be true for every company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain companies, especially ones that believe they have a lot of IP to protect or operate in other sensitive types of work will be more reluctant to allow work to continue from home,&#8221; he said. This in spite of the fact that many of these companies have been doing just that for the last 15 months. Going hybrid as Apple has only muddles that argument further.</p>
<p>&#8220;It definitely includes Apple, which has long been well known for discouraging work from home. Their new policy of three days a week in-office probably makes them feel a bit more secure, but does not really accomplish it,&#8221; Hinchcliffe said.</p>
<p>Of course companies can set policies, but it doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t run into employee objections. Apple certainly learned that. Workers appear to want to be the ones choosing where to work, not their employers, and it could very well be a competitive advantage to offer work from home options, especially in a tight labor market where the power appears to be shifting to employees.</p>
<p>It should be interesting to see where this all goes, and how much power employees have to push their companies to their more flexible working ideal. For now, most companies will have a far larger degree of flexibility than existed pre-pandemic, but certainly not everyone wants people working from home all the time forever, and companies will need to decide what works best for them and their employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The war for talent in the tech world can be brutal &#8212; and so, it turns out, can the war between platforms that help companies source it. In the latest developement, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toptal</a> &#8212; a marketplace for filling engineering and other tech roles with freelance, remote workers &#8212; has filed a lawsuit against direct competitor <a href="https://andela.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andela</a> and several of its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employees, alleging the theft of trade secrets in pursuit of &#8220;a perfect clone of its business&#8221;, according to the complaint. All of the Andela employees previously worked at Toptal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toptal&#8217;s lawsuit, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York and embedded below, alleges that the employees reneged on confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-compete agreements with Toptal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Toptal also alleges interference with contract, unfair competition and misappropriation of trade secrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both Toptal and Andela have built businesses around the idea of remote freelancers filling tech jobs &#8212; a concept that has increased in profile and acceptance as people shifted to remote work during the pandemic &#8212; the pair only emerged as very direct competitors in the last year or so. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toptal was co-founded by CEO Taso Du Val in 2010, and since then it has grown to become one of the world&#8217;s most popular on-demand talent networks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company matches skilled tech personnel like engineers, software developers, designers, finance experts and product managers to clients across the globe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. According to company data, it currently serves over 1,000 clients in more than 10 countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andela, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only recently turned to using a similar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approach. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2014 in Lagos, Andela&#8217;s original business model </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on building physical hubs to source, vet, train and house talent across the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It did this in Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda and Uganda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Andela struggled with scaling and operating that business model, and in 2019 it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/africa-focused-andela-cuts-400-staff-as-it-confirms-50m-in-revenue/">laid off 400 developers</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. E</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arly last year as the pandemic took hold, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/andela-ceo-confirms-staff-cuts-as-layoffs-hit-african-tech/">laid off a further 135 employees</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However this time around it did so with a strategy pivot in mind: after testing satellite models in Egypt and Ghana, the talent company decided to go forego physical hubs completely and go remote, f</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">irst <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/andela-which-builds-remote-engineering-teams-tapping-african-talent-goes-fully-remote-and-opens-to-the-wider-continent/">across Africa in 2020</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/andela-begins-global-expansion-in-37-countries-months-after-going-remote-across-africa/">globally this year</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We thought, ‘What if we accelerated [the African remote network] and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enabled applicants from anywhere?’ Because it was always the plan to become a global company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That was clear, but the timing was the question,” Andela CEO Jeremy Johnson told TechCrunch in April.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Toptal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">believes Andela&#8217;s choice to scrap its hubs and source remote talent from everywhere was specifically to replicate Toptal&#8217;s business model &#8212; and success</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Until recently, Andela operated an outsourcing operation focused on in-person, on-site hubs in Africa,&#8221; Toptal notes in the complaint.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of the past year, Andela has moved away from its prior focus on in-person hubs situated in Africa and is engaging in a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disguised attempt to become a clone of Toptal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toptal claims that for Andela to pull off a &#8220;perfect clone of its business,&#8221; it poached key Toptal employees to exploit their knowledge, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the ex-employees knowingly breached their confidentiality and non-solicitation obligations to Toptal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies often try to uncover each other&#8217;s trade secrets by poaching, and many </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">blatantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> copy a competitor and do so without repercussions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On top of this, these two are hardly the only two places to for tech talent to connect with remote freelance job opportunities. Others include Fiverr, Malt, Freelancer.com, LinkedIn, Turing, Upwork and many more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a global economy with an estimated 1 billion so-called knowledge workers, and with freelancers accounting for <a href="https://www.thimble.com/blog/freelance-statistics-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some 35% of the world&#8217;s workforce</a>, it&#8217;s a pretty gigantic market, which you could alternately look at as a major opportunity, but also a ripe field for many players with multiple permutations of the marketplace concept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why is Toptal crying foul play? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its ex-employees have not only revealed Toptal’s trade secrets and confidential information to compete </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unfairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but are also poaching </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Toptal personnel, clients and the talent that Toptal matches and sources to clients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ex-employees cited by Toptal include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sachin Bhagwata, vice president of enterprise; Martin Chikilian, head of talent operations; Courtney Machi, vice president of product; and Alvaro Oliveira, executive vice president of talent operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Toptal says</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional former employees in non-executive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> roles breached express covenants not to compete in their agreements with Toptal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of the allegations focus on the expertise of the employees, one of the trade secret allegations more directly references Toptal&#8217;s technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toptal claims Machi tapped into her extensive knowledge of Toptal’s &#8220;proprietary software platform&#8221; and used that to help transform Andela &#8220;from a group of outsourcing hubs situated in various African locations into a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remote, global company like Toptal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked to comment on the suit, Johnson at Andela said he believes Toptal is suing Andela for being competitive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With regards to the situation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I can say that frivolous lawsuits are the price of doing anything that matters,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;And this is the kind of baseless bullying and fear tactics that make employees want to leave in the first place</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will defend ourselves and our colleagues </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vigorously.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toptal has an unconventional story for a company that started only a decade ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is one of the few companies in the Valley that doesn&#8217;t issue stock options to its investors or employees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Du Val&#8217;s co-founder, Breanden Beneschott, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was ousted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the company without any shares, according to an article from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/at-booming-toptal-no-stock-for-employees-or-investors">The Information.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did it pull this off? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, Toptal raised a $1.4 million seed via convertible notes and investors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were entitled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 15% of the company, according to The Information article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there was one condition: Toptal had to raise more money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company hasn&#8217;t needed to secure </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capital because of its profitability and growing revenue ($200 million annually as of 2018, per The Information). So investors are stuck in limbo &#8212; as are employees who joined hoping that the company would raise money down the line so their stock options would convert</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>The Information story strikes a distinct note of resentment, noting that some employees felt &#8220;tricked out of stock in a company that Du Val has said publicly is worth more than $1 billion.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that situation, TechCrunch asked Du Val if he thought it played any role in employee departures, and ex-employee relations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The issuance of stock options does not excuse theft of trade secrets,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, there are more than 800 full-time people at Toptal [but] the complaint names seven individual defendants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The full complaint is embedded below.</p>
