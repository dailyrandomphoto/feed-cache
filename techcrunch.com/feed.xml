					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">A recent Corporate Counsel <a href="https://www.law.com/corpcounsel/2021/09/02/fintech-startups-are-luring-in-fortune-500-finance-lawyers/">article</a> highlighted a growing trend: More senior legal leaders are migrating to startups to take on general counsel roles. For some, it’s an attempt to find a better work-life balance (whoops!), while others are eager to build and manage their own team or see it as an opportunity to work for a mission-driven company.</p>
<p>This is great news for startups, especially those in regulated industries, where building strong in-house legal teams has been a challenge and fees can really add up if they choose a law firm. Founders can find top-tier talent out there, and discovering the right resource for your early to mid-sized company has never been more likely.</p>
<p>The abundance of available legal talent brings challenges as well as opportunities. Whether you’re the CEO of a high-growth startup or even a mid-sized technology company, finding the right legal leader will have implications for your business down the line. It’s a move you want to get right from the very beginning.</p>
<h2>Know what a GC can bring to the business</h2>
<p>The primary benefit of bringing on an in-house attorney is that they will become an expert in every aspect of your business, which will let them provide more actionable legal advice as well as a (sometimes) unique input on various business decisions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			You don’t want a lawyer who will panic and create more chaos in an already chaotic environment, and you definitely don’t want the lawyer who presents you and the rest of the management team “the facts” and leaves the decision to you (it’s a &#8220;business decision”).					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Another big aspect is that law firms are, by nature, highly risk-averse. This can often be at odds with the business&#8217; ability to accomplish its objectives. However, CEOs are going to take risks to move the business forward, and having an excellent lawyer in-house who can manage the potential downside of those risks is critical.</p>
<p>CEOs need a lawyer who they can trust to manage a situation after it becomes an issue, as well as one who is thoughtful and clear on communicating potential risks up front. Leaders don’t need someone telling them not to take risks, or saying, “I told you so” when things go wrong; they need someone who can manage the consequences (good and bad) of business decisions in a calm, organized and professional manner.</p>
<p>Finally, cost is a factor. Law firms traditionally charge an hourly rate, which can become frustrating to manage and fiscally untenable for a startup trying to stretch funding. While alternative fee arrangements are becoming more commonplace, most firms limit those arrangements to a relatively “plain vanilla” representation and will charge hourly for more complex matters.</p>
<p>Hiring a full-time lawyer and paying that lawyer a decent wage will allow you to better manage costs and they, over time, should provide you with better advice.</p>
<h2>Experience and attitude matter</h2>
<p>An important aspect to evaluate is the risk appetite of a legal chief candidate. Many in-house attorneys claim to be &#8220;commercial,&#8221; but that’s rarely the case. Relatively few in-house leaders are willing to actually make the call to take on almost certain risk to accomplish a business objective.</p>
<p>There’s something about how lawyers are trained that makes us jump to the worst-case scenario, but in reality, there’s a lot of room between taking the risk and the catastrophic scenario. Great GCs make the business decision, shoulder the risk, and do so with the confidence that they can manage the results to preserve the commercial value of the decision while managing the matter to prevent the worst-case scenario.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06636.pdf">research paper</a> written by a team of academics and computer scientists from Spain and Austria has demonstrated that it&#8217;s possible to use Facebook&#8217;s targeting tools to deliver an ad <em>exclusively</em> to a single individual if you know enough about the interests Facebook&#8217;s platform assigns them.</p>
<p>The paper &#8212; entitled &#8220;Unique on Facebook: Formulation and Evidence of (Nano)targeting Individual Users with non-PII Data&#8221; &#8212; describes a &#8220;data-driven model&#8221; that defines a metric showing the probability a Facebook user can be uniquely identified based on interests attached to them by the ad platform.</p>
<p>The researchers demonstrate that they were able to use Facebook&#8217;s Custom Audience tool to target a number of ads in such a way that each ad only reached a single, intended Facebook user.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218214" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The research raises fresh questions about potentially harmful uses of Facebook&#8217;s ad targeting tools, and &#8212; more broadly &#8212; questions about the legality of the tech giant&#8217;s personal data processing empire given that the information it collects on people can be used to uniquely identify individuals, picking them out of the crowd of others on its platform even purely based on their interests.</p>
<p>The findings could increase pressure on lawmakers to ban or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">phase out</a> behavioral advertising &#8212; which has been under attack for years, over concerns it poses a smorgasbord of individual and societal harms. And, at the least, the paper seems likely to drive calls for robust checks and balances on how such invasive tools can be used.</p>
<p>The findings also underscore the importance of independent research being able to interrogate algorithmic adtech &#8212; and should increase pressure on platforms not to close down researchers&#8217; access.</p>
<h2>Interests on Facebook are personal data</h2>
<p>&#8220;The results from our model reveal that the 4 rarest interests or 22 random interests from the interests set FB [Facebook] assigns to a user make them unique on FB with a 90% probability,&#8221; write the researchers from Madrid&#8217;s University Carlos III, the Graz University of Technology in Austria and the Spanish IT company, GTD System &amp; Software Engineering, detailing one key finding &#8212; that having a rare interest or lots of interests that Facebook knows about can make you easily identifiable on its platform, even among a sea of billions of other users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that addresses individuals’ uniqueness considering a user base at the worldwide population’s order of magnitude,&#8221; they go on, referring to the scale inherent in Facebook&#8217;s data mining of its more than 2.8 billion active users (NB: The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/them-too/">processes information about non-users</a>, meaning its reach scales to even more internet users than are active on Facebook).</p>
<p>The researchers suggest the paper presents the first evidence of &#8220;the possibility of systematically exploiting the FB advertising platform to implement nanotargeting based on non-PII [interest-based] data&#8221;.</p>
<p>There have been earlier controversies over Facebook&#8217;s ad platform being a conduit for one-to-one manipulative &#8212; such as this 2019 <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/husband-brainwash-wife-spinner-ads-facebook/">Daily Dot</a> article about a company called the Spinner which was selling a &#8220;service&#8221; to sex-frustrated husbands to target psychologically manipulative messages at their wives and girlfriends. The suggestive, subliminally manipulative ads would pop up on the targets&#8217; Facebook and Instagram feeds.</p>
<p>The research paper also references an incident in U.K. political life, back in 2017, when Labour Party campaign chiefs apparently successfully used Facebook&#8217;s Custom Audience ad-targeting tool to &#8220;pull the wool&#8221; over former leader Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s eyes. But in that case the targeting was not just at Corbyn; it also reached his<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> associates, and a few aligned journalists.</span></p>
<p>With this research the team demonstrates it&#8217;s possible to use Facebook&#8217;s Custom Audience tool to target ads at just one Facebook user &#8212; a process they&#8217;re referring to as &#8220;nanotargeting&#8221; (versus the current adtech &#8220;standard&#8221; of microtargeting &#8220;interest-based&#8221; advertising at groups of users).</p>
<p>&#8220;We run an experiment through 21 Facebook ad campaigns that target three of the authors of this paper to prove that, if an advertiser knows enough interests from a user, the Facebook Advertising Platform can be systematically exploited to deliver ads exclusively to a specific user&#8221;, they write, adding that the paper provides &#8220;the first empirical evidence&#8221; that one-to-one/nanotargeting can be &#8220;systematically implemented on FB by just knowing a random set of interests of the targeted user&#8221;.</p>
<p>The interest data they used for their analysis was collected from 2,390 Facebook users via a browser extension they created that the users had installed before January 2017.</p>
<p>The extension, called <a href="https://www.it.uc3m.es/acrumin/papers/CHI_2017.pdf">Data Valuation Tool for Facebook Users</a>, parsed each user&#8217;s Facebook ad preferences page to gather the interests assigned to them, as well as providing a real-time estimate about the revenue they generate for Facebook based on the ads they receive while browsing the platform.</p>
<p>While the interest data was gathered before 2017, the researchers&#8217; experiments testing whether one-to-one targeting is possible through Facebook&#8217;s ad platform took place last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, we have configured nanotargeting ad campaigns targeting three authors of this paper&#8221;, they explain, discussing the results of their tests. &#8220;We tested the results of our data-driven model by creating tailored audiences for each targeted author using combinations of 5, 7, 9, 12, 18, 20, and 22 randomly selected interests from the list of interests FB had assigned them.</p>
<p>&#8220;In total, we ran 21 ad campaigns between October and November 2020 to demonstrate that nanotargeting is feasible today. Our experiment validates the results of our model, showing that if an attacker knows 18+ random interests from a user, they will be able to nanotarget them with a very high probability. In particular, 8 out of the 9 ad campaigns that used 18+ interests in our experiment successfully nanotargeted the chosen user&#8221;.</p>
<p>So having 18 or more Facebook interests just got really interesting to anyone who wants to manipulate you.</p>
<h2>Nothing to stop nanotargeting</h2>
<p>One way to prevent one-to-one targeting would be if Facebook were to put a robust a limit on the minimum audience size.</p>
<p>Per the paper, the adtech giant provides a &#8220;Potential Reach&#8221; value to advertisers using its Ads Campaign Manager tool if the potential audience size for a campaign is greater than 1,000 (or greater than 20, prior to 2018 when Facebook increased the limit).</p>
<p>However the researchers found that Facebook does not actually prevent advertisers running a campaign targeting fewer users than those potential reach limits &#8212; the platform just does not tell advertisers how many (or, well, few) people their messaging will reach.</p>
<p>They were able to demonstrate this by running multiple campaigns that successfully targeted a single Facebook user &#8212; validating that the audience size for their ads was one by looking at data generated by Facebook&#8217;s ad reporting tools (&#8220;FB reported that only one user had been reached&#8221;); having a log record in their web server generated by the (sole) user click on the ad; and &#8212; in a third validation step &#8212; they asked each nanotargeted user to collect a snapshot of the ad and its associated “Why am I seeing this ad?” option. Which they say matched their targeting parameters in the successfully nanotargeted cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main conclusions derived from our experiment are the following: (i) nanotargeting a user on FB is highly likely if an attacker can infer 18+ interests from the targeted user; (ii) nanotargeting is extremely cheap, and (iii) based on our experiments, 2/3 of the nanotargeted ads are expected to be delivered to the targeted user in less than 7 effective campaign hours,&#8221; they add in a summary of the results.</p>
<p>In another section of the paper discussing countermeasures to prevent nanotargeting, the researchers argue that Facebook&#8217;s claimed limits on audience size &#8220;have been proven to be completely ineffective&#8221; &#8212; and assert that the tech giant&#8217;s limit of 20 is &#8220;not currently being applied&#8221;.</p>
<p>They also suggest there are workarounds for the limit of 100 that Facebook claims it applies to Custom Audiences (another targeting tool that involves advertisers uploading PII).</p>
<p>From the paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most important countermeasure Facebook implements to prevent advertisers from targeting very narrow audiences are the limits imposed on the minimum number of users that can form an audience. However, those limits have been proven to be completely ineffective. On the one hand, Korolova et. al state that, motivated by the results of their paper, Facebook disallowed configuring audiences of size smaller than 20 using the Ads Campaign Manager. Our research shows that this limit is not currently being applied. On the other hand, FB enforces a minimum Custom Audience size of 100 users. As presented in Section 7.2.2, several works in the literature showed different ways to overcome this limit and implement nanotargeting ad campaigns using Custom Audiences.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the researchers refer throughout their paper to interest-based data as &#8220;non-PII&#8221; [aka, personally identifiable information] it is important to note that that framing is meaningless in a European legal context &#8212; where the law, under the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes a much broader view of personal data.</p>
<p>PII is a more common term in the U.S. &#8212; which does not have comprehensive (federal) privacy legislation equivalent to the pan-EU GDPR.</p>
<p>Adtech companies also typically prefer to refer to PII, given it&#8217;s far more bounded a category versus all the information they actually process which can be used to identify and profile individuals to target them with ads.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN">GDPR</a>, personal data does not only include the obvious identifiers, like a person&#8217;s name or email address (aka &#8216;PII&#8217;), but can also encompass information that can be used &#8212; indirectly &#8212; to identify an individual, such as a person&#8217;s location or indeed their interests.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the relevant chunk from the GDPR (Article 4(1)) [emphasis ours]:</p>
<blockquote><p>‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier <strong>or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person</strong>;</p></blockquote>
<p>Other research has also repeatedly &#8212; over decades &#8212; shown that re-identification of individuals is possible with, at times, just a handful of pieces of &#8220;non-PII&#8221; information, such as <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/on-the-reidentifiability-of-credit-card-metadata/overview/">credit card metadata</a> or <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/12/why-anonymous-data-sometimes-isnt/">Netflix viewing habits</a>.</p>
<p>So it should not surprise us that Facebook&#8217;s vast people profiling, ad targeting empire, which continuously and pervasively mines internet users&#8217; activity for interest-based signals (aka, personal data) to profile individuals for the purpose of targeting them with &#8220;relevant&#8221; ads, has created a new attack vector for &#8212; potentially &#8212; manipulating almost anyone in the world if you know enough about them (and they have a Facebook account).</p>
<p>But that does not mean there are no legal problems here.</p>
<p>Indeed, the legal basis that Facebook claims for processing people&#8217;s personal data for ad targeting has been under challenge in the EU for years.</p>
<h2>Legal basis for ad targeting</h2>
<p>The tech giant used to claim that users consent to their personal data being used for ad targeting. However it does not offer a free, specific and informed choice to people over whether they want to be profiled for behavioral ads or just want to connect with their friends and family. (And free, specific and informed is the GDPR standard for consent.)</p>
<p>If you want to use Facebook you have to accept your information being used for ad targeting. This is what EU privacy campaigners have dubbed &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">forced consent</a>&#8220;. Aka, coercion, not consent.</p>
<p>However, since the GDPR came into application (back in May 2018), Facebook has &#8212; seemingly &#8212; switched to claiming it&#8217;s legally able to process Europeans&#8217; information for ads because users are actually in a contract with it to receive ads.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">preliminary decision</a> by Facebook&#8217;s lead EU regulator, Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC), which was published earlier this week, has proposed to fine the company $36 million for not being transparent enough about that silent switch.</p>
<p>And while the DPC doesn&#8217;t seem to have a problem with Facebook&#8217;s ad contract claim, other European regulators disagree &#8212; and are likely to object to Ireland&#8217;s draft decision &#8212; so <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">the regulatory scrutiny over that particular Facebook GDPR complaint is ongoing and far from over. </span></p>
<p>If the tech giant is ultimately found to be bypassing EU law it could finally be forced to give users a free choice over whether their information can be used for ad targeting &#8212; which would essentially blast an existential hole in its ad targeting empire, since even holding a few pieces of interest data is personal data, as this research underlines.</p>
<p>For now, though, the tech giant is using its customary tactic of denying there&#8217;s anything to see here.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the research, a Facebook spokesperson dismissed the paper &#8212; claiming it is &#8220;wrong about how our ad system works&#8221;.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s statement goes on to try to divert attention from the researchers&#8217; core conclusions in an effort to minimize the significance of their findings &#8212; with its spokesperson writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>This research is wrong about how our ad system works. The list of ads targeting interests we associate with a person are not accessible to advertisers, unless that person chooses to share them. Without that information or specific details that identify the person who saw an ad, the researchers’ method would be useless to an advertiser attempting to break our rules<em>.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Responding to Facebook&#8217;s rebuttal, one of the paper&#8217;s authors &#8212; Angel Cuevas &#8212; described its argument as &#8220;unfortunate&#8221; &#8212; saying the company should be deploying stronger countermeasures to prevent the risk of nanotargeting, rather than trying to claim there is no problem.</p>
<p>In the paper the researchers identify a number of harmful risks they say could be associated with nanotargeting &#8212; such as psychological persuasion, user manipulation and blackmailing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is surprising to find that Facebook is implicitly recognizing that nanotargeting is feasible and the only countermeasure is assuming advertisers are unable to infer users interests,&#8221; Cuevas told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many ways interests could be inferred by advertisers. We did that in our paper with a browser plug-in (with explicit consent from users for research purposes). Even more, beyond interests there are other parameters (we did not use in our research) such as age, gender, city, zip code, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think this is an unfortunate argument. We believe a player like Facebook can implement stronger countermeasures than assuming advertisers are unable to infer user interests to be later used to define audiences in the Facebook ads platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>One might recall &#8212; for example &#8212; the 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/">Cambridge Analytica Facebook data misuse scandal</a>, where a developer that had access to Facebook&#8217;s platform was able to extract data on millions of users, without most of the users&#8217; knowledge or consent &#8212; via a quiz app.</p>
<p>So, as Cuevas says, it&#8217;s not hard to envisage similarly opaque and underhanded tactics being deployed by advertisers/attackers/agents to harvest Facebook users&#8217; interest data to try to manipulate specific individuals.</p>
<p>In the paper the researchers note that a few days after their<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> nanotargeting experiment had ended Facebook shuttered the account they&#8217;d used to run the campaigns &#8212; without explanation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The tech giant did not respond to specific questions we put to it about the research, including why it closed the account &#8212; and, if it did so because it had detected the nanotargeting issue, why it failed to prevent the ads running and targeting a single user in the first place. </span></p>
<h2>Expect litigation</h2>
<p>What might the wider implications be for Facebook&#8217;s business as a result of this research?</p>
<p>One privacy researcher we spoke to suggested the research will certainly be useful for litigation &#8212; which is growing in Europe, given the slow pace of privacy enforcement by EU regulators against Facebook specifically (and adtech more generally).</p>
<p>Another pointed out that the findings underline how Facebook has the ability to &#8220;systematically re-identity&#8221; users at scale &#8212; &#8220;while pretending it does not process &#8216;personal data&#8217; on the data&#8221; &#8212; suggesting the tech giant has amassed enough data on enough people that it can, essentially, circumvent narrowly bounded legal restrictions that might seek to put limits on its processing of PII.</p>
<p>So regulators looking to put meaningful limits on harms that can flow from behavioral advertising will need to be wise to how Facebook&#8217;s own algorithms can seek out and make use of proxies in the masses of data it holds and attaches to users &#8212; and its likely line of associated argument that its processing therefore avoids any legal implications (a tactic Facebook has used on the issue of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/facebook-faces-fresh-criticism-over-ad-targeting-of-sensitive-interests/">inferred sensitive interests</a>, for example).</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Another privacy watcher, Dr Lukasz Olejnik, an independent privacy researcher and consultant, called the research staggering &#8212; describing the paper as among the top 10 most important privacy research results of this decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reaching 1 user out of 2.8bn? While the Facebook platform claimed there are precautions making such microtargeting impossible? So far, this is among the top 10 most important privacy research results in this decade,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Such precision is totally identifying and singling out individuals. This is highly privacy invasive. I&#39;m SHOCKED that the researchers and the press describe it as &#39;without personal data&#39;. Not true! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDPR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GDPR</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ePrivacy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ePrivacy</a> <a href="https://t.co/LOe707CKyf">pic.twitter.com/LOe707CKyf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lukasz Olejnik (@lukOlejnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1448667592676175876?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;It seems that users are identifiable by their interests in the meaning of article 4(1) of the GDPR, meaning that interests constitute personal data. The only caveat is that we are not certain how such a processing would scale [given the nanotesting was only tested on three users].&#8221;</p>
<p>Olejnik said the research shows the targeting is based on personal data &#8212; and &#8220;perhaps even special category data in the meaning of GDPR Article 9&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would mean that the user&#8217;s explicit consent is needed. Unless of course appropriate protections were made. But based on the paper we conclude that these, if present, are not sufficient,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Asked if he believes the research indicates a breach of the GDPR, Olejnik said: &#8220;DPAs should investigate. No question about it,&#8221; adding: &#8220;Even if the matter may be technically challenging, building a case should take two days max.&#8221;</p>
<p>We flagged the research to Facebook&#8217;s lead DPA in Europe, the Irish DPC &#8212; asking the privacy regulator whether it would investigate to determine if there had been a breach of the GDPR or not &#8212; but at the time of writing it had not responded.</p>
<h2>Towards a ban on microtargeting?</h2>
<p>On the question of whether the paper strengthens the case for outlawing microtargeting, Olejnik argues that curbing the practice &#8220;is the way forward&#8221; &#8212; but says the question now is how to do that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if the current industry and political environment would be prepared for a total ban now. We should demand technical precautions, at the very least,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I mean, we were already told that these were in place but it appears this is not the case [in the case of nanotargeting on Facebook].&#8221;</p>
<p>Olejnik also suggested there could be changes coming down the pipe based on some of the ideas built into Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox proposal &#8212; which has, however, been stalled as a result of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">adtech complaints triggering competition scrutiny</a>.</p>
<p>Asked for his views on a ban on microtargeting, Cuevas told us: &#8220;My personal position here is that we need to understand the tradeoff between privacy risks and economy (jobs, innovation, etc.). Our research definitely shows that the adtech industry should understand that just thinking of PII information (email, phone, postal address, etc.) is not enough and they need to implement more strict measures regarding the way audiences can be defined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saying that, we do not agree that microtargeting &#8212; understood as the capacity of defining an audience with (at least) tens of thousands of users &#8212; should be banned. There is a very important market behind microtargeting that creates many jobs and this is a very innovative sector that does interesting things that are not necessarily bad. Therefore, our position is limiting the potential of microtargeting to guarantee the privacy of the users.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the area of privacy we believe the open question that is not solved yet is the consent,&#8221; he also said. &#8220;The research community and the adtech ecosystem have to work (ideally together) to create an efficient solution that obtains the informed consent from users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zooming out, there are more legal requirements looming on the horizon for AI-driven tools in Europe.</p>
<p>Incoming EU legislation for high-risk applications of artificial intelligence &#8212; which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">proposed earlier this year</a> &#8212; has suggested a total ban on AI systems that deploy &#8220;subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness in order to materially distort a person’s behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm&#8221;.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s at least interesting to speculate whether Facebook&#8217;s platform might face a ban under the EU&#8217;s future AI Regulation &#8212; unless the company puts proper safeguards in place that robustly prevent the risk of its ad tools being used to blackmail or psychologically manipulate individual users.</p>
<p>For now, though, it&#8217;s lucrative business as usual for Facebook&#8217;s eyeball targeting empire.</p>
<p>Asked about plans for future research into the platform, Cuevas said the obvious next piece of work they want to do is to combine interests with other demographic information to see if nanotargeting is &#8220;even easier&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, it is very likely that an advertiser could can combine the age, gender, city (or zip code) of the user with a few interests to nanotarget a user,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;We would like to understand how many of these parameters you need to combine. Inferring the gender, age, location and few interests from a user may be much easier than inferring few tens of interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cuevas added that the nanotargeting paper has been accepted for presentation at the <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2021/schedule/">ACM Internet Measurement Conference</a> next month.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Climate in the last decade has been unprecedented in many ways, none of them good.</p>
<p>Wildfires in California have consumed entire towns; thousands of miles away, New Yorkers inhale the ashes. Across Europe and Japan, flash floods wreak widespread devastation. We all see the videos on YouTube and CNN. And we shrug.</p>
<p>The recently released <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/">6th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report</a> concluded that human-created climate change is taking place faster than we thought, calling it a &#8220;code-red alert.&#8221; At just 2 degrees warmer than today, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02323/full">one estimate predicts more than 300,000,000 climate-related deaths</a> globally by 2100. And that’s the optimistic estimate. Global warming is overwhelming and feels impossible to fix. What the hell can we do?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218667" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like many of you, I am an optimist. Humanity has come to the limits of nature many times in the past, and has overcome them with technology. We have always adapted ourselves to our environment; changing our technology and behavior due to environmental change is part of our history.</p>
<p>Regulation will help incentivize corporations to clean up, but only technology can solve the intractable problem of sustainably giving us what we desire. Thoughtless consumption brought us climate change, but it is also true that mindful consumption can get us out of it.</p>
<p>How do we use capitalism to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions worldwide? Follow the carbon. That leads us to the three main bottlenecks on the road to net-zero carbon emissions.</p>
<p>What follows is necessarily a high-level overview of huge and complex industries. I’ve purposely left out granular details so we could address the overarching issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Electrification: 36 gigatons CO2 emitted</h2>
<h3>TAM: $7 trillion</h3>
<p>Global carbon usage is highest in energy production as we burn coal, oil and natural gas to power our cars, cities and industry (yes, coal is still mined and burned in 2021). That’s a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es400399h">whopping 36 gigatons of CO2 emissions per year</a>. Why do we still burn coal? It&#8217;s cheap, on-demand, universal, portable, an order of magnitude more efficient than lithium-ion batteries, and much safer.</p>
<p>But it needs to be eliminated, very soon.</p>
<p>The IPCC report found that 89% of global CO2 emissions come from fossil fuels. Further, it tells us we must cut these emissions in half over the next decade or risk a 1.5-degree Celsius increase in average global temperatures.</p>
<p>Currently, wind and solar cannot produce electricity 100% of the time; generated energy must be stored rather than just dumped if unused, as it is done today. There are many ways of producing clean energy today, including nuclear, tidal, hydroelectric, geothermal and other means. <a href="https://www.powermag.com/fusion-energy-is-coming-and-maybe-sooner-than-you-think/">Fusion is advancing every year</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Civilization was born alongside the sheep and cow, but 10,000 years later, the sheep, cow and pig are killing us. They emit 10% of global greenhouse gases, and global demand for meat is skyrocketing.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We will need more than double today’s clean energy output to service growing demand. But until we can store this energy and use it in cars, boats, airplanes and more, clean energy production will not eliminate the need for oil and coal. Energy storage is the main bottleneck for a global electric economy. We need bigger, safer and cleaner batteries that can be used everywhere from the grid to our cars to our homes, and keep the lights on when we need them most.</p>
<p>You and I won’t be buying these batteries, but they will power everything we do buy. From cars to the cargo ships that deliver them to the airplanes that carry us, they will all eventually be electric. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/united-airlines-to-buy-100-19-seat-electric-planes-from-heart-aerospace-.html">Boeing just ordered 100 electric planes from Heart Aerospace</a>, in which it also invested. The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/world/yara-birkeland-norway-crewless-container-ship-spc-intl/index.html">world’s first electric cargo ship</a>, the Yara Birkeland, built by Marin Teknikk, is scheduled to have its maiden voyage soon.</p>
<p>There are no fewer than a dozen electric aircraft companies and six dozen electric vehicle companies. But the bottleneck for these efforts to scale and replace all fossil fuel planes, ships and cars with equivalent performance is a humble battery capable of delivering sustained, high power output over a long period of time. Without that fundamental advancement, these companies will stay in the conceptual stage for a long time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, lithium-based battery technology still only has one-tenth the maximum energy density of gasoline (which is around 50 megajoules per kilogram). It isn&#8217;t enough. The closest we can get with lithium-ion technology is the lithium-air battery, which has a theoretical energy density of 40 megajoules per kilogram, but new electrolytes need to be invented for it to work. Like Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier to usher in the supersonic era, we need to break through this density barrier to power our green future.</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that melanin, our skin pigment, has also shown promise as a potent cathode that can make rechargeable sodium batteries a possibility. This would enable large-scale “salt” batteries that can be used to create a safe and clean grid storage solution. Researchers have also used viruses to create nanolayers of different elements to make higher-performance cathodes. Other lines of research have shown that batteries driven by enzymatic catalysts can potentially use sugar water to slowly charge your car or house with bio-electricity. None of the solutions above are within a decade to market; all are in the research stage.</p>
<p>The winners of the electrification wars will aggregate these technologies across industries and provide consumers with a seamless, wonderful experience. From fast wireless charging of electronics and vehicles to self-adapting national electrical grids, an electrified world will be quieter, efficient and clean. I am excited about the prospect of living in a fully electric world.</p>
<h2>Rematerialization: 10.2 gigatons emitted</h2>
<h3>TAM: $12 trillion</h3>
<p>Every object in the room you’re sitting in was made unsustainably and reeks of carbon emissions. The cement floor, sofa, dining table, desk, refrigerator, sink, chairs, even the walls contribute to climate change. Consumers have no choice; they can’t buy green, and we need to change this.</p>
<p>Durable goods and our built environment alone account for <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/es400399h">more than 10.2 gigatons of CO2 emissions yearly</a>, or nearly one-third of total emissions. The heights of dirty industry need to be toppled and rebuilt from scratch with a new goal in mind: Sustainable production for hundreds of years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Cement</strong></p>
<p>Global cement production emits <a href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/low-carbon-concrete-can-fight-global-warming">nearly 2.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year</a>. There are dozens of green cement companies now trying various approaches to eliminating CO2 emissions from cement and concrete. At IndieBio, I invested in Carbix, a company that takes CO2 emissions and uses them to make olivine cement. They have made a few bricks and are years from the market.</p>
<p>The main barrier for most green cement formulators is proving equivalent structural performance. Getting to scale is expensive. However, a few companies promising greener concrete are coming to market in the next few years.</p>
<p><strong>Steel</strong></p>
<p>Making steel and aluminum is energy-intensive. In fact, aluminum is referred to by many commodity traders as “energy in solid form.” Powering our foundries with clean energy and reducing their carbon usage <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/decarbonization-challenge-for-steel">will help eliminate 8% of emissions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wood</strong></p>
<p>Trees are our biggest carbon sinks. They suck in CO2 from the air and exhale the oxygen we breathe. So why do we still cut them down?</p>
<p>Hopefully, soon we won’t have to. Companies are using flax and other natural fibers to create bio-composites that are stiffer than steel and lighter than wood, or developing sustainable bamboo for exterior building panels. Others are experimenting with mushroom mycelium to grow entire buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Leather and fabrics</strong></p>
<p>Cows contribute 7.1 gigatons of CO2 per year to global warming, <a href="https://clear.ucdavis.edu/explainers/using-global-emission-statistics-distracting-us-climate-change-solutions">a full 14.5% of the total</a>. We don’t just eat them, we use their skin a lot. Leather is everywhere, from shoes and couches to purses and clothing. We need to replace this material if we are to eliminate cows from our supply chain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a dozen companies are making headway into eliminating plastic and leather from fashion. All are finding tremendous traction with consumer companies looking to provide their consumers with vegan and sustainable products.</p>
<p>Fabrics like polyester are made of petrochemicals. Fermentation technologies excel at making oils from sugar water by using algae or yeast as a factory. Fermentation is scalable and exists today, while a newer technology called cell-free synthesis is being applied to these same problems. We can expect new green fabrics in the next five years.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial chemicals</strong></p>
<p>Break down oil and you get a list of unpronounceable names that make much of our world. These chemicals are used in engines, antifreeze, cosmetics and even foods. To eliminate any need for oil, these products must be replaced through fermentation, which converts sugar into chemicals.</p>
<p>The sugar can come from corn or even waste CO2 in chimneys. Cells don’t have to be alive either, as cell-free synthesis allows the enzymes themselves to do the work. A huge number of companies have been started to remake all these chemicals through varieties of fermentation and synthesis.</p>
<p>Rematerializing our planets with sustainable, carbon-neutral sources can remove up to 10 gigatons of emissions from our economy. Our houses and everything inside them will eventually become carbon-neutral through rematerialization. I am excited about breaking this bottleneck to progress because it naturally leads to better products for everyone.</p>
<h2>Food: 3.6 gigatons C02 emitted</h2>
<h3>TAM: $10 trillion</h3>
<p>The first slide of a presentation I gave to explain the new food revolution depicted cavemen with spears being mauled by a giant prehistoric bear. The point? Protein is important enough to die for. As we transitioned from hunting to farming, our society reorganized around cities and the division of labor.</p>
<p>Civilization was born alongside the sheep and cow, but 10,000 years later, the sheep, cow and pig are killing us. They <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">emit 10% of global greenhouse gases</a>, and global demand for meat is skyrocketing. Over the past six years at IndieBio, I&#8217;ve invested in Clara Foods, Geltor, Memphis Meats (now Upside Foods), NotCo,and many others to reinvent agriculture through fermentation, plant-based formulations and cell-based culture.</p>
<p>These startups reinvented familiar foods like burgers, mayonnaise, popcorn shrimp, egg whites, poke bowls, sausages and chicken wings. As affluent societies began eating more processed foods, foods became products: Cows became burgers, pigs became bacon and chickens are now nuggets. A legion of food-as-product companies have followed in their footsteps and there are entire conferences dedicated to them. &#8220;Food is hot&#8221; is an understatement in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Having been a part of the food revolution from its earliest days, I am struck by the magnitude of these revolutions once they really get going. I am also wary of revolutions that stall. Cell-based foods should be on the market next year and consumers will get to decide for themselves if the revolution is for them. So the final shape and form of the world once the revolutions roll through society and become the new normal is not easy to predict.</p>
<p>I am a fan of history, so I look into the past to see where we are going next. My mother’s recipe for curry chicken is a good place to start. It calls for chicken thighs with the bone in, chopped. If I want to make a low-carbon, animal-free version of that recipe, I’d have to use something other than chicken, but what? Just’s cell-based chicken nuggets? No, breaded chicken nuggets won’t work, nor would soy alternatives. Beyond Curry? My mom wouldn&#8217;t approve.</p>
<h2>Biofarming real food</h2>
<p>For agriculture to be reinvented for everyone, not just the 1%, we must make food. Real, natural food. Steaks, chicken breasts and thighs, bone-in meats and spare ribs. Not a processed version of these products, but ingredients to make whole-food dishes.</p>
<p>Food 3.0 is biofarming. Biofarming will have to solve for taste and wholesome nutrition. Delicious foods with no processing other than mom’s recipe. Regenerative agriculture will enable carbon-neutral vegetables and plants if we can help farmers get their yields high enough to turn a profit while a field is fallow for a season. Numerous technologies are helping to achieve this.</p>
<h2>We aren’t F’d yet</h2>
<p>Bloomberg recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/climate-change-linked-to-5-million-deaths-a-year-new-study-shows">reported</a> that there have been over 5 million deaths a year globally from climate change-related events from 2009 to 2019. That&#8217;s 1 in 10 deaths on the planet. Since we do not track this statistic (we track heat stroke, drowning, landslide, suicide, and the things that directly kill us), nor other effects like people not having children and extreme anxiety, it is impossible to know the true magnitude of misery climate change will bring. How far will we let this go before we all act? How many more will have to die?</p>
<p>The new normal doesn’t need to be this way. Scientists can choose to apply their work to solve the paradox of carbon and production. Investors can choose to put money into companies rebuilding our world to be gentle and green. And entrepreneurs can choose to build companies that reshape our carbon economy for the greatest opportunity in history. The above road map represents the ability to erase nearly all carbon emissions by humanity.</p>
<p>We are far from doomed. Together, we will all build and we will all fight for our future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SiriusXM-owned Pandora is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pandora-launches-the-lookout-by-soundcloud-301401002.html">partnering with SoundCloud</a> to launch &#8220;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3324202-1&amp;h=2999458705&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpandora.app.link%2FDKybDpowkkb&amp;a=HERE">The Lookout by SoundCloud</a>,&#8221; a new station available on Pandora that aims to showcase music from the “hip hop superstars of tomorrow.” Today’s announcement comes as Pandora’s parent company, SiriusXM, recently partnered with SoundCloud to launch a show of the same name on its Hip-Hop Nation channel. It’s no surprise that SiriusXM is joining forces with SoundCloud across its properties, as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/11/music-streaming-pioneer-soundcloud-raises-75m-from-pandora-owner-siriusxm/">invested $75 million in SoundCloud</a> last year.</p>
<p>The Lookout by SoundCloud features new artists weekly, like Toosii, Sheff G, Metro Marrs, Young Devyn, $NOT, Dro Kenji, Cico P, Flo Milli, Nevi, SoFaygo, Isaiah Rashad, Sleepy Rose and more. The station features songs heard on the SiriusXM SoundCloud show.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a hit slot on SiriusXM&#8217;s Hip-Hop Nation and now a new home on Pandora, SoundCloud&#8217;s top playlist, &#8216;The Lookout&#8217;, is the go-to source with the largest digital audio reach for fans to discover the best in breaking hip hop,&#8221; said R. Caiaffa, the interim head of music at SoundCloud, in a statement. &#8220;Joining forces with Pandora to expand &#8216;The Lookout by SoundCloud&#8217; amps up our shared commitment to help the emerging hip-hop artist community to get heard and discovered.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218810" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new station originates from one of SoundCloud’s most popular playlists, ‘The Lookout,’ which launched in 2019. The playlist has since become a popular destination for discovering the next generation of rising stars in hip hop.</p>
<p>SiriusXM notes that The Lookout has spotlighted some of today’s biggest artists in hip hop before they became household names, including Pop Smoke, Megan Thee Stallion, Roddy Ricch, Rod Wave and more.</p>
<p>It’s clear that SiriusXM is looking to attract more younger listeners across its offerings with its various partnerships with SoundCloud. Additionally, SiriusXM recently launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/siriusxm-launches-tiktok-radio-a-music-channel-featuring-viral-hits-hosted-by-tiktok-stars/">TikTok Radio channel</a>, which features TikTok creators as channel hosts, in another push to capture a younger audience. The station is designed to sound like a radio version of TikTok’s &#8220;For You&#8221; feed.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, SiriusXM and Pandora have also struck deals with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/siriusxm-acquires-simplecast-to-double-down-on-podcasts-with-distribution-and-analytics-tools/">Simplecast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/siriusxm-buys-stitcher-for-325-million-steps-up-its-march-into-podcasts/">Stitcher</a> to become more competitive in both music and podcast streaming. Most recently, SiriusXM partnered with audio entertainment production studio <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/siriusxm-partners-with-audio-up-to-develop-new-original-podcasts/">Audio Up</a> to develop new original scripted podcasts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In emerging economies, where spending billions to build public transit infrastructure can be out of reach, startups are using technology to meet the mobility needs of a rising urban middle class.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.swvl.com/">Swvl</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/plentywaka-founder-onyeka-akumah-on-african-startups-and-global-expansion/">Treepz</a>, <a href="https://www.jatri.co/">Jatri</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/">SafeBoda</a>, <a href="https://urbvan.com/">Urbvan</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/chalo-raises-40-million-to-digitize-bus-commutes-in-india/">Chalo</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazil-startup-buser-raises-138-million-lgt-softbank-others-2021-06-10/">Buser</a> are just a few of the startups that have popped up in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America in recent years,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> all with a focus on providing on-demand access to transportation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are these startups products of the emerging markets, but because mobility is so essential to a thriving economy, they’re actually driving development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that if you want to get good economies of scale and see the positive spillovers of a big urban space, you need to be able to get around at a low cost and in an efficient way,” Nikos Tsafos, the James R. Schlesinger Chair in Energy and Geopolitics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told TechCrunch. “What this does is it enlarges the labor market and makes it more efficient.”</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2204834" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Necessity might be the mother of innovation, but that innovation isn&#8217;t limited to the economies where it was conceived. These startups are also providing a less car-centric blueprint for the rest of the world, including economies with existing public transit.</p>
<p>The table stakes stretch beyond the financial future of a handful of startups. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If startups like these don&#8217;t succeed, one of the risks is that as GDP continues to grow in emerging markets, populations with more discretionary funds will end up purchasing their own vehicles, which will only contribute to the global climate crisis.</span></p>
<h3><b>Swvl: Repurposing underutilized vehicles for shared transport</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl is a Dubai-based startup that provides shared transportation services for intracity and intercity trips for both individual commuters and corporations, schools and tour operators. Since its founding in 2017, the startup has expanded across UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kenya and Pakistan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its business model revolves around repurposing underutilized buses or minivans that are privately owned, usually by small or medium-sized businesses and fleet owners, for different uses throughout the day. For example, when a bus that usually drives kids to and from school only twice a day signs on with Swvl, it will also be used for a combination of intracity B2C routes, corporate drives, intercity rides or tour group rides.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This significantly increases utilization of that vehicle,&#8221; Mostafa Kandil, CEO and founder of Swvl, told TechCrunch. &#8220;With every incremental utilization of the vehicle, the fixed component of the cost of the vehicle itself gets amortized over more and more rides, so we’re able to pay less and less on a per-unit level and on a per-ride level. Hence, we’re able to continuously drop our price to the end consumer while actually significantly increasing our margin.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riders can book a seat on a fixed route and track their ride at every step. In cities where public transit is unreliable or dangerous, services like Swvl’s can be a game-changer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Swvl is close to becoming a unicorn is a signal of the strength of this industry. In July, the company entered into a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/swvl-a-transformative-mass-transit-platform-announces-business-combination-with-queens-gambit-growth-capital-301343236.html">SPAC agreement with Queen&#8217;s Gambit Growth Capital</a> with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an implied enterprise value of $1.5 billion, according to the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swvl says it is forecasting an annualized gross revenue of $79 million through December, which is an increase of about 55% from February 2020 revenues of $51 million. By 2025, the startup also plans to achieve $1 billion in annual gross revenue and operate in 20 countries on five continents, with SaaS or transportation as a Service (TaaS) expansions set to occur across Europe, the U.S. and the APAC region through a<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/swvl-expands-into-europe-latam-and-apac-via-acquisition-of-mass-transit-saas-platform-shotl-301358508.html"> recent acquisition of Spanish-based mass transit SaaS platform Shotl</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the immediate need to provide basic transportation to growing middle classes, Kandil says the initial product-market fit is naturally within emerging markets, but he sees Swvl’s services in global terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Governments across the world spend billions of dollars on transportation infrastructure that are actually becoming obsolete,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you think about New York in the summer versus in the winter, it’s a totally different city. The movements, the patterns in a city change quite significantly throughout the year, but the public transportation system doesn’t really change. So what we are building is the mass transit system of the future that can serve any type of city with a public transportation system that’s demand-responsive, that can change every day, every hour, and can self-optimize based on how the entire city is moving.”</span></p>
<h3><b>How Treepz provides ‘Uber for buses’ in Nigeria</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Onyeka Akumah, CEO and founder of Treepz, formerly Plentywaka, said the day his startup was conceived was the day he got off a plane in Lagos and had to take two bikes, a boat and then a bus just to get around town for meetings. He described the bus experience as a harrowing one where he literally “had to hold one of the doors throughout the trip from falling off.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lagos is Nigeria’s largest city, with 14 million residents who have to commute daily. While the country has the most startups in Africa, it falls short of other metrics that would help it rank competitively among other African nations, according to an </span><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2021/05/24/south-afria-future-tech-ecosystem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">African Tech Ecosystem ranking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For entrepreneurship to thrive, fDi Intelligence, the specialist division within Financial Times that published the report, says a country must have cost-effectiveness, country-wide tech talent, cooperative government, good internet access and healthy infrastructure. Much of this simply cannot be achieved if people can&#8217;t move around easily, efficiently and cheaply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treepz provides another example of the public sector stepping forward and, hopefully, driving the country toward prosperity. The startup offers a similar service to Swvl, one where commuters can book intracity or intercity travel through an app, reserve their seat and track their ride. While Treepz has expanded throughout the country, it also plans to move into Uganda, Ghana and a handful of other African nations over the next few years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Millions of people have to commute on a daily basis using public transportation, and if they can’t afford an Uber ride, and they want to get to work on time, this is the only way they can do it,” Akumah told TechCrunch. “We wanted to give people a better way to commute with predictability, where they can know when the bus will get here, the certainty that they will have a seat on the vehicle, that it’s a decent vehicle and a safe one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Swvl allows customers to book a seat online and then pay the driver later with cash, Treepz presently won’t accept cash, which is part of the reason the service is really geared toward the middle class. Akumah said at the moment, cash is too risky because it invites corruption at the worst and difficulty keeping track of sales at best.</span></p>
<h3><b>Creating accountability for Bangladesh’s public transport with Jatri</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bangladesh-based Jatri aims to address the problem of inconsistent public transportation timetables, payment difficulties and constantly changing routes. The startup says it’s the first bus tracking and digital ticketing platform in Bangladesh, serving both bus companies that need to regulate how their buses were functioning and commuters who need a more frictionless service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riders can subscribe, plan their trips, track buses and secure tickets, while operators can utilize Jatri’s bus trip analytics. The company is also working on creating data that regulators can use for urban planning purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jatri was founded in 2019 and in that time has digitized the operations of thousands of bus partners, hosting more than 3.5 million transport tickets on its platform across three cities. Earlier this month, the startup raised a $1.2 million pre-Series A round that it says it will use to expand its nationwide coverage. It recently partnered with BRTC, a state-owned transport corporation of Bangladesh, to provide its tracking and ticketing services for many of its routes, with the possibility of nationwide adoption.</span></p>
<h3>The role of transportation in emerging markets</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the middle class grows and incomes rise, people tend to become more concerned with the quality of services like mass transit. </span><a href="https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/reviews/bangladeshs-rising-middle-class-myths-and-realities-1614610680"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rising expectations could potentially become a source of friction for a country like Bangladesh, where its citizens may experience what economist Albert Hirschman described as the “tunnel effect.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is when vulnerable members of society start to see increased inequality based on an uneven growth process. They initially tolerate it, expecting that their time for prosperity will come. But if they do not catch up in time, their tolerance may morph into frustration &#8212; and ultimately sociopolitical upheavals. </span></p>
<p>Which is what makes the emergence of startups dedicated to easing the strain of public transportation so vital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transportation systems have the ability to connect people to jobs, as well as leisure and like green spaces and entertainment,&#8221; said Tsafos. &#8220;Those are the central elements for the vibrancy of the city, so what I would be expecting is in the absence of those transportation solutions is a city that&#8217;s underperforming and is not living up to its potential because you just have a fragmented urban space that can&#8217;t take full advantage of the human capital that resides in this sort of broad metropolitan area.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Millions of people who are blind or visually impaired use a technology known as a screen reader to access the Web. However, few websites are coded to work properly with screen readers. Global web standards that specify how to support screen reader users as well as other people with disabilities have been available since 1999, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/web-accessibility-blind-users-dominos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wired.com/story/web-accessibility-blind-users-dominos/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634311277322000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdb1YOPvAZoi0vK4ZikzwOQjSFNw">an estimated 70% of websites</a> are still not accessible. Why is that? And more importantly, what can be done?</p>
<p dir="ltr">At <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634311277322000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9a5EUx9efS8G_pRc65-Dicxw5xg">Sight Tech Global</a> (December 1-2, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634311277322000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGhwx1nnbiO75aOLtBprG2Xfy4x7A">register today</a>!), a free, virtual event centered on advanced technologies and accessibility for the blind and visually impaired, Facebook’s Mike Shebanek and Matt King will unfold a W3C community project years in the making that will address a huge technical limitation that has held back Web accessibility for screen readers. Be sure to join <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634311277322000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9a5EUx9efS8G_pRc65-Dicxw5xg">Sight Tech Global</a> for this very important session.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To understand the technical challenge to accessibility, it’s helpful to contrast screen readers with web browsers. For more than 20 years, web developers have been building consensus on how web browsers should interpret and display web code so every web page can look and feel the same no matter which browser or device is used to view it. Companies that develop browsers and other key stakeholders in the web industry have invested heavily to create standards and build massive infrastructure that runs millions of tests every day. These tests guarantee the thousands of little coding agreements that make it possible to “write code once and then run it everywhere.” When code operates the same way in two different browsers, it is called “browser interoperability.” Browser interoperability is one of the key ingredients in the explosion of the web.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218167" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, there has never been a similar consensus when it comes to screen reader interoperability. People using screen readers experience the same website differently depending on which screen reader, browser and device they are using. Conversely, there is no way for developers to code and test once for all screen readers. They have to test each combination and then make difficult choices because there are many types of experiences that cannot be made to work equally well in all screen readers. So, in addition to making accessible web development expensive and needlessly frustrating, the lack of screen reader interoperability is inherently exclusionary. If you need a screen reader but don’t use one of the same screen readers that the web developer used, it is likely you will run into challenges, if not outright barriers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lack of interoperability for not only screen readers but all assistive technologies is one of the most significant obstacles to a more inclusive web. It is responsible for much of the inconsistency in accessibility quality, and it explains why there is so little automation to make accessibility faster and easier for developers, content creators and accessibility auditors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Enter the W3C ARIA-AT Community Group, which has been intensely focused on solving this deeply embedded problem. The acronym stands for World Wide Web Consortium Accessible Rich Internet Application and Assistive Technology (ARIA-AT), which encompasses the standards-driving work of the W3C experts who are collaborating on the project. Facebook is underwriting the cost of the project and lending Matt King, a technical program manager for Facebook accessibility, to lead the effort.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At Sight Tech Global, Matt King will join Facebook’s Mike Shebanek and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-fairchild-15381928/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-fairchild-15381928/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634311277322000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGWsGvJxdrdWv6fg0q2EPeDJ27Frg">Michael Fairchild</a>, a senior accessibility consultant at Deque Systems, to explain how the ARIA-AT project is about to make a step-change in web accessibility by building consensus around screen reader behavior expectations and developing the tests, automation technologies and testing infrastructure needed to bring screen reader interoperability to the world of web engineering.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The ARIA-AT project is bringing to fruition a dream that has fueled years of work,&#8221; says King. “It will fundamentally change how we engineer web accessibility so it is finally practical to build experiences that are as reliable and enjoyable for assistive technology users as they are for anyone else. ARIA-AT will provide a missing cornerstone of equity for people who rely on assistive technologies.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://datasociety.net/people/fleet-chancey/">moderator</a> for the discussion will be <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chancey-fleet-35063317" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/chancey-fleet-35063317&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634311277322000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8jzNgV9dhElZfTL6RStTpoV1-rA">Chancey Fleet</a>, assistive technology coordinator at the New York Public Library, “whose writing, organizing and advocacy aims to catalyze critical inquiry into how cloud-connected accessibility tools benefit and harm, empower and expose communities of disability.”</p>

<p>Microsoft worked with merchandise manufacturer Ukonic! on the mini fridge, which has LEDs and a design to match the Xbox Series X. The small appliance can hold up to 12 cans of your favorite energy drink or another beverage. There&#8217;s some space in the door&#8217;s shelves for snacks too. A DC power adaptor is included, and there&#8217;s a USB port, which could come in handy for recharging your Xbox Wireless Controller.</p>
<p>The mini fridge will be available via Target in the US and Canada. Folks in the UK can buy it from Game for £90. The fridge will also ship in France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Netherlands and Poland at the outset. Microsoft plans to bring the Xbox Mini Fridge to more markets next year, though where and when depends on regulatory approvals and restrictions in each country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

These SSNs were discovered by viewing the HTML source code of the site&#8217;s web pages, allowing anyone with an internet connection to find the sensitive information by right-clicking the page and hitting &#8220;view page source.&#8221; For many, viewing a web page&#8217;s source code is as simple as hitting F12 on your keyboard.</p>
<p>The Post-Dispatch reported the vulnerability to state authorities to patch the website, and delayed publishing a story about the problem to give the state enough time to fix the problem. The DESE has since <a href="https://oa.mo.gov/commissioners-office/news/state-missouri-addresses-data-vulnerability">confirmed</a> that the &#8220;educator certification search tool was disabled immediately&#8221; and that the vulnerability is now fixed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218696" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That should have been the end of it. While any other official might have thanked the newspaper for uncovering the flaw and for giving a heads-up before going public<b>, </b>Missouri’s Republican Governor Mike Parson described the journalist who uncovered the vulnerability as a “hacker”, and said the newspaper uncovered the flaw in &#8220;an attempt to embarrass the state&#8221;.</p>
<p>“A hacker is someone who gains unauthorized access to information or content. This individual did not have permission to do what they did,” he said during a press conference on Thursday. “This individual is not a victim. They were acting against a state agency to compromise teachers’ personal information in an attempt to embarrass the state and sell headlines to their news outlet.</p>

</ul>

	</p>
<p>“The state is committed to bring to justice anyone who hacked our system and anyone who aided and abetted them to do so,&#8221; said Parson. The governor has also referred the case to county prosecutors.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the governor’s response to the Post-Dispatch report — and his clearly confused understanding of the term &#8220;hacker&#8221; — has sparked criticism, even from within his own party. Republican lawmaker Tony Lovasco wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/tonylovasco/status/1448672694065668105">Twitter</a> that it was &#8220;clear the governor&#8217;s office has a fundamental misunderstanding of both web technology and industry-standard procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities,” adding that “journalists responsibly sounding an alarm on data privacy is not criminal hacking.”</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Ron Wyden also called out Parson&#8217;s remarks, <a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1448733737856888840">tweeting</a>: “Journalism isn&#8217;t a crime. Cybersecurity research isn&#8217;t either. Real leaders don&#8217;t unleash their attack dogs on the press when they expose government failures, they roll up their sleeves and fix the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naturally, those within the cybersecurity industry have also been quick to weigh in on Parson&#8217;s comments. Rachel Tobac, a hacker and CEO of SocialProof Security, <a href="https://twitter.com/RachelTobac/status/1448732967967223816">tweeted</a>: “If your code leaks personal data via public development tools that any person can see by simply pressing F12 on a keyboard then you have a huge data leak issue, not a hacking situation, on your hands.”</p>
<p>The Post-Dispatch is also taking Parson’s response with a pinch of salt, and is standing by Renaud. The paper said its journalist “did the responsible thing by reporting his findings to DESE so that the state could act to prevent disclosure and misuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>“A hacker is someone who subverts computer security with malicious or criminal intent. Here, there was no breach of any firewall or security and certainly no malicious intent,&#8221; it added in a statement. &#8220;For DESE to deflect its failures by referring to this as ‘hacking’ is unfounded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, while Parson is vowing to hold the Post-Dispatch &#8220;accountable&#8221; for the supposed crime of helping the state find and fix a security vulnerability, the chances of Renaud facing an eventual conviction are likely slim, given a recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/supreme-court-hacking-cfaa-ruling/">case of Van Buren v. United States</a>, which ruled that a person violates the law when they access files or other information that they would otherwise be unable to.</p>
<p>But should the state take action, a prosecution could have a chilling effect on journalism and security research, further amplifying the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/what3words-legal-threat-whatfreewords/">problem of researchers facing legal threats and attacks</a> after discovering and reporting security flaws to their owners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security cameras, for better or for worse, are part and parcel of how many businesses monitor spaces in the workplace for security or operational reasons. Now, a startup is coming out of stealth with funding for tech designed to make the video produced by those cameras more useful. <a href="https://www.spot.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spot AI</a> has built a software platform that &#8220;reads&#8221; that video footage &#8212; regardless of the type or quality of camera it was created on &#8212; and makes video produced by those cameras searchable by anyone who needs it, both by way of words and by way of images in the frames shot by the cameras.</p>
<p>Spot AI has been quietly building its technology and customer base since 2018, and already has hundreds of customers and thousands of users. Notably, its customers reach well beyond tech early adopters, spanning from SpaceX to transportation company Cheeseman, Mixt and Northland Cold Storage.</p>
<p>Now that Spot AI is releasing its product more generally, it is disclosing $22 million in funding, a $20 million Series A led by Redpoint Ventures with Bessemer Venture Partners also participating, and a previous $2 million seed round from angels, Village Global and Stanford StartX (where the three founders studied). Other investors are not being disclosed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218606" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The gap in the market that Spot AI is aiming to fill is the one created by some of the more legacy technology used by organizations today: a huge amount of security cameras &#8212; in 2019 estimated at <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-u-s-uses-surveillance-cameras-just-as-much-as-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70 million in the U.S. alone</a>, although that also includes public video surveillance &#8212; are in use in the workplace today, usually set up around entrances to buildings, in office buildings themselves, in factories and other campus environments and so on, both to track the movement of people as well as the state of inanimate objects and locations used by the business (for example, machines, doorways, rooms and so on).</p>
<p>The issue is that many of these cameras are very old, analogue set-ups; and whether they are older or newer hardware, the video that is produced on them is of a very basic nature. It&#8217;s there for single-purpose uses; it is not indexable and older video gets erased; and often it doesn&#8217;t even work as it is supposed to. Indeed, security cam footage is neglected enough that people usually only realize how badly something works or didn&#8217;t work at all just when they actually need to see some footage (only to discover it is not there). And some of the more sophisticated solutions that do exist are very expensive and unlikely to be adopted quickly by the wider market of very non-tech, analogue companies.</p>
<p>On top of all this, security cameras have a very bad rap, not helped by their multifaceted, starring role in video surveillance systems. Backlash happens both because of how they get used in public environments &#8212; perhaps in the name of public safety, but still there as quiet observers and recorders of everything we do whether we want them there or not &#8212; and in how private security video footage gets appropriated in the aftermath of being recorded. In those cases, some of that is intentional, such as when Amazon&#8217;s Ring has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/ring-police-warrants-neighbors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared footage with police</a>. And some is unintentional &#8212; see the <a href="https://therecord.media/verkada-hacker-charged-in-the-us-for-hacking-more-than-100-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disclosure of hackers accessing and posting video</a> from another startup building video systems for enterprises, Verkada.</p>
<p>Spot AI is entering the above market with all good intentions, CEO and co-founder Tanuj Thapliyal said in an interview. The startup&#8217;s theory is that security cameras are already important and the point is to figure out how to use them better, for more productive purposes that can cover not just security, but health and safety and operations working as they should.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;If you make the video data [produced by these cameras] more useful and accessible to more people in the workplace, then you transform it from this idea of surveillance to the idea of video intelligence,&#8221; said Thapliyal, who co-founded the company with Rish Gupta and Sud Bhatija. &#8220;It can help you make all sorts of important decisions.&#8221; Its ethos seems to come out of the idea that these cameras are here, so we need to find better ways of using them more effectively and responsibly.</p>
<p>The Spot AI system currently comes in three parts. The first is a<a href="https://www.spot.ai/product/cameras" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> set of cameras</a> that Spot AI offers as an option to any of its customers, free of charge, currently to keep even if a customer decides to cease working with Spot AI. These cameras, 5MP, IP-based devices, are designed to upgrade the quality of video feeds, although Thapliyal points out that the Spot AI system can actually work with footage from any camera at all if necessary.</p>
<p>The second part is a <a href="https://www.spot.ai/product/nvr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">network video recorder</a> that captures video from all of the cameras you have deployed. These are edge computers, fitted with AI chips that process and begin reading and categorizing the video that is captured, turning it into data that can be then searched through the third part of Spot AI&#8217;s system.</p>
<p>That third part is a <a href="https://www.spot.ai/product/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dashboard</a> that both lets users search through a company&#8217;s video troves by keywords or processes, and create frames and alerts on current streams to note when something has occurred in the frame (for example, a door opening, or a person entering a space, or even something not working as it should).</p>
<p>The idea is that this part of the video service will become more sophisticated over time (and indeed there are more features being added even going from stealth into GA). While there are a number of IoT plays out there that are designed to help monitor connected devices, the pitch with Spot AI is that it can be more attuned to how connected and not-connected things are moving about in physical spaces, regardless of whether they involve connected devices or not.</p>
<p>I asked Thapliyal about the security issues reported about Verkada &#8212; both the incident involving<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> malicious hackers</a> earlier this year, and another accusation <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdyqm/surveillance-startup-used-own-cameras-to-harass-coworkers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going back years</a> about how some employees at the company itself abused its video systems. The company is close enough in targeting similar markets &#8212; and coincidentally both have a connection to Meraki, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/11/18/cisco-acquires-enterprise-wi-fi-startup-meraki-for-1-2-billion-in-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WiFi tech company acquired by Cisco</a>, in that both are founded by ex-Meraki employees &#8212; that I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder how Spot AI might insulate itself from similar issues, something that customers presumably also ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Verkada sells hardware, and their cloud software only works with their hardware,&#8221; he responded, adding that &#8220;They&#8217;re pretty expensive; up to a few thousand dollars <a href="https://www.verkada.com/pricing/#security-camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">per camera</a>.&#8221; (Spot AI&#8217;s cameras are free, while the <a href="https://www.spot.ai/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployments begin at $2,200</a>.) &#8220;They also sell more hardware for building security &#8212; like access control, environmental sensors, etc.,&#8221; he added, calling it, &#8220;a terrific set of products with terrific software.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, he noted, &#8220;We&#8217;re not in the hardware business. Our only focus is to make video easier to access and use. We only charge for software, and give away all camera hardware for free if customers want them. Our bet is that if we can help more customers get more value out of video, then we can earn more of their business through a software subscription.&#8221;</p>
<p>And on security, the company&#8217;s concept is very different, built around a zero-trust architecture &#8220;that siloes access away between customers and requires multi-factor authentication for any systems access,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like other technology companies, we are always reviewing, challenging and improving our cybersecurity. Our goal is to provide a great web dashboard, and let customers choose what&#8217;s best for them. For example, cloud backup of video is an optional feature that customers can opt into, at no extra charge. The product fully works with private and local storage already included in the subscription. This is particularly helpful for healthcare customers that have HIPAA requirements.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see the company having a position, and product set, that is aiming to address issues around security. The proof will be in the pudding, and it still remains predicated on the basic idea of video surveillance being something that can be used without being abused. That could make it a non-starter for many. It&#8217;s worth pointing out that for now, Spot AI has no intention of selling to public safety or government: its focus is solely on private enterprises and the opportunity to rethink their security camera investments and usage.</p>
<p>And indeed, it seems that for investors, the main message is how the company has created a tech platform with enough utility that it is finding traction in as wide a way as possible, including with non-tech customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a flood of new users and companies driving daily decisions using their cameras. In an industry crowded with legacy vendors, Spot AI&#8217;s software-focused model is by far the simplest choice for customers,” said Tomasz Tunguz, MD at Redpoint Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Today, only the world’s biggest businesses have access to proprietary AI camera systems, while most small and midsize businesses are left behind,” added Byron Deeter, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Spot AI’s easy-to-use technology is accelerating the consumption of video data across all businesses, big and small.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The all-electric Porsche Taycan outsold the German automaker&#8217;s iconic internal combustion-powered 911 sports car in the first nine months of the year, a milestone for the EV that was introduced in late 2019.</p>
<p>The sales figures <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/company/porsche-increase-deliveries-quarter-3-2021-26063.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=mail&amp;utm_campaign=weekly-newsletter">released Friday</a> show that Porsche delivered 217,198 vehicles worldwide in the first three quarters, a 13% increase year over year. The results were driven by a nearly threefold increase in Taycan deliveries as well as growth by its popular gas-powered Macan vehicle. Those figures show Porsche recovered from the <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2020/company/porsche-deliveries-quarter-3-2020-22584.html">5% dip in sales</a> it experienced in the nine-month period between 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While the gas-powered Porsche Cayenne led the portfolio with 62,451 vehicles delivered in the first nine months of the year, it actually represents a 2.8% decline from the same time period in 2020. Strong demand for the smaller Macan SUV, which saw a 12% increase in deliveries to 61,944 vehicles, the Taycan and 911 helped fuel Porsche&#8217;s overall increase.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218685" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Porsche delivered 28,640 Taycan vehicles in the January-to-September period, pushing ahead of the company&#8217;s longtime flagship, the Porsche 911 sports car. Porsche delivered 27,972 of its 911 sports cars, a 10% increase from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Porsche delivered 20,275 Panameras and 15,916 of its 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman vehicles, all of which rose about 1% from last year.</p>
<p>While the bulk of Porsche sales are represented by combustion vehicles, the success of the Taycan could bolster the company&#8217;s push into EVs. Porsche plans to introduce an all-electric version of the Macan in 2023.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This week was one of our strongest shows yet, with a wide diversity of news items that were genuinely fun (and complicated) to chew through.</p>
<p>And even though we started off kind of grumpy, we laughed through tech difficulties, crypto puns and fintech CAC. It&#8217;s called coping.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218479" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nintendo announced today that &#8220;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&#8221; has some big updates set for November 5.</p>
<p>This includes the arrival of characters from past games like Brewster, Kapp&#8217;n and Harriet; farming and cooking DIY recipes; new furniture items; and even a paid DLC called &#8220;Happy Home Paradise,&#8221; coming the same day for $24.99.</p>
<p>Nintendo also previously teased that Brewster, the coffee-brewing pigeon (strangely not a rooster), will make his way to &#8220;New Horizons.&#8221; In past games, Brewster has run a cafe called &#8220;The Roost.&#8221; Nintendo shared more information today, showing us how players can grab a cup o&#8217; joe for just 200 bells a cup with friends from other islands. If you have amiibo cards, you can call characters to drink coffee with you (and if you don&#8217;t, you can nab the next &#8220;Animal Crossing&#8221; amiibo pack, $5.99 for six cards, on November 5).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Kapp&#8217;n is also coming to &#8220;Animal Crossing: New Horizons.&#8221; The turtle will take you on his boat (and sing sea shanties on the way) to visit mysterious new islands, which might have different flora, seasons or times of day from your home island &#8212; it&#8217;s like using a Nook Miles Ticket to search for foreign fruit, only with more possibilities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Harv&#8217;s island, Harriet is coming to stay. The pink poodle ran the Shampoodle shop in past &#8220;Animal Crossing&#8221; games, and in &#8220;New Horizons,&#8221; she&#8217;ll help players learn new hairstyles. In the update, players can help Harv and Harriet build a plaza with various shops, where existing visitors like Sahara and Kicks can come to sell their wares. Katrina, the fortune-telling cat, will also make her &#8220;New Horizons&#8221; debut.</p>
<p>This update will also bring several quality-of-life improvements that players have been asking for. With the ability to enact island ordinances, players can talk to Isabelle to change what time of day villagers are most active. This can be helpful for gamers whose real-life schedules only allow them to play at a certain time of day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, everyone&#8217;s favorite capitalist raccoon, Tom Nook, will let you purchase more storage, so your home can hold up to 5,000 items, up from 2,400. You&#8217;ll also be able to have up to 10 bridges and inclines each on your island, up from eight, as well as ladders to make it easier to climb up ledges.</p>
<p>Other new items like a storage shed and ABDs (automatic bell dispensers) will make it easier to access home storage, bells and Nook Miles from anywhere on the island. We&#8217;ll need the ABDs to pay for the new items that are coming to Nook&#8217;s Cranny, including lighting and ceiling decor, which are accessible once you get a &#8220;pro decorating license&#8221; from Tom Nook.</p>

<p>For everyone who loves to cook <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYutF8qr7AY">a bit too much</a> in &#8220;Breath of the Wild,&#8221; rejoice. Now, a la &#8220;Stardew Valley,&#8221; we can grow vegetables on our islands, and then use DIY recipes to cook up tasty meals for our island friends. Finally, some nutrition beyond just native fruits.</p>
<p>The update will also let you plant and dig up gyroids on your island, but it&#8217;s probably best not to eat those. And while you&#8217;re making minestrone soup for Judy, you can listen to KK Slider&#8217;s latest hits, as 12 new songs will become available to collect. If you encounter a picture-perfect moment along the way, you can use the updated in-game camera app to take photos from your character&#8217;s vantage point &#8212; if you use the &#8220;tripod mode,&#8221; your character can get in the image, too.</p>
<p>If you feel a bit stiff after catching up on all the new updates, you can join in on a group stretching session in the plaza with your villagers. This connects with the motion controls on your joy-cons, though pressing buttons to simulate the stretches also works.</p>

<p>This will be the final free content update for &#8220;Animal Crossing: New Horizons.&#8221; Key word: free.</p>
<p>Nintendo also announced a DLC for &#8220;New Horizons&#8221; today, called &#8220;Happy Home Paradise.&#8221; The DLC is priced at $24.99, but will also be available as part of Nintendo Switch Online+ expansion pack, a new online membership that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/nintendo-announced-that-chris-pratt-will-play-mario-on-the-big-screen/">teased in September</a>, offering access to classic Nintendo 64 and SEGA games.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s &#8220;Animal Crossing&#8221; announcement revealed that Nintendo Switch Online+ will cost $49.99 for an individual yearly membership and $79.99 for a family yearly membership. Nintendo&#8217;s existing online plan costs $19.99 per year, or $34.99 for a yearly family plan.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218773" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218773" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2218773" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?w=680" alt="froggy chair in animal crossing" width="680" height="416" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png 1884w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=768,470 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=680,416 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=1536,939 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-11.50.19-AM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218773" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>The DLC will let you &#8220;go to work&#8221; (ah, yes, paying Nintendo to pretend-work &#8212; the &#8220;Animal Crossing&#8221; way) at a nearby island archipelago, where you can design vacation homes for villagers. Through the DLC, your character will learn new design techniques, like making counters different heights, adding partitions to rooms, polishing furniture to unlock new capabilities, adding custom lighting and more. Thankfully, your character gets paid for their labor (Tom Nook isn&#8217;t always great about this) in Poki, which can be exchanged to purchase DLC-exclusive furniture. You can also apply the design techniques from the DLC to your island, and when you gain enough expertise, you can remodel existing villagers&#8217; homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&#8221; debuted for Nintendo Switch in March 2020, right as the United States was heading into its first coronavirus lockdown. The idyllic social simulation game became the console&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210805_3e.pdf">second-best-selling game</a> yet, helping people around the world <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/02/virtual-worlds-video-games-coronavirus-social-networks-fortnite-animal-crossing/">connect during an isolating time</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the game&#8217;s smash success, Nintendo has barely updated the game since its launch, save for some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/animal-crossing-swimming-new-horizons/">deep-sea diving</a>. At a certain point, there&#8217;s only so much you can do after getting a five-star island, and logging in every day can feel like a chore.</p>
<p>So today&#8217;s announcements mark a chance for Nintendo to corral us back to our virtual islands, where our anthropomorphic animal friends have been missing us, and where we&#8217;ll have to get rid of the cockroaches in our pixelated homes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has removed Quran Majeed, a popular app for reading the Islamic religious text and other prayer-related information, in China, in compliance with Chinese government requests, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58921230">a report</a> by BBC. The move comes as part of a bigger shift in the country to crack down on foreign content, or simply making it harder for that content to exist within the Great Firewall. Just yesterday, LinkedIn said that it would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/microsoft-to-pull-linkedin-from-chinese-market/">removing the Chinese version of its site</a> by the end of this year in the face of growing compliance requirements by the state.</p>
<p>One of the most popular religious apps in China, Quran Majeed is available globally and has approximately 35 million users.</p>
<p>The Quran Majeed app remains available in other countries on the App Store, and on Google Play &#8212; although Google Play is technically also not available in China (people can access it via a VPN, however).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218635" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://applecensorship.com/">The Apple Censorship website</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which monitors apps on Apple’s App Store, was the first to notice that Quran Majeed was recently deleted.</span></p>
<p>China officially recognizes Islam as a religion but it has also faced criticism for human rights violations and genocide against the Muslim-majority Uyghur population in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>We have contacted Apple for a comment on this story and will update this post as we learn more.</p>
<p>Apple has faced a lot of controversy over the years over how it complies with local rules. Critics believe many local content-focused regulations in certain countries amount to censorship, and Apple is too quick to comply. Apple argues that its first priority is to respect laws of the countries in which it operates, irrespective of whether or not it agrees with the regulations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple’s <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_downloads/gov_docs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf">human rights policy</a> states: “We’re required to comply with local laws, and at times there are complex issues about which we may disagree with governments.”</p>
<p>There is consistency in what Apple will do, it seems. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-privacy-censorship.html">a report in The New York Times</a> in May, Apple will take down an app in China if the app in question discusses certain banned topics, including Tiananmen Square, the Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, the Dalai Lama, and independence for Tibet and Taiwan.</p>
<p>There are added complications for Apple as a business that point to the company continuing to follow state rules: China is one of Apple’s biggest markets, and Apple also heavily relies on the country to keep its hardware supply chain running.</p>
<p>Quran Majeed is not the only app to face removal from China&#8217;s Apple App Store. <a href="https://www.olivetree.com/">Olive Tree’s Bible App</a> was also withdrawn in China this week. Olive Tree claims that Apple proactively took it down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canalys <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-smartphone-market-Q3-2021?ctid=2378-1fd7255e6bac7d9b3af1138c987b7e14">reported this morning</a> that global smartphone sales are off 6% this quarter, and it&#8217;s not because of lack of demand. It&#8217;s due to the worldwide chip shortage.</p>
<p>The pandemic has had a negative impact across supply chains, and chips have been particularly hard hit. Canalys principal analyst Ben Stanton says that manufacturers are trying to keep up as best they can, but the chip shortage is a legitimate roadblock right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the supply side, chipset manufacturers are increasing prices to disincentivize over-ordering in an attempt to close the gap between demand and supply,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;But despite this, shortages will not ease until well into 2022.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218640" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What did the market look like this past quarter as a result of these supply chain issues? Well, the usual suspects maintained their market share positions, with Samsung holding steady year over year at 23%. Meanwhile, Apple saw sales increase 3 percentage points to 15% this quarter. Xiaomi held steady in third place at 14%, unchanged year on year.</p>

<p>Manufacturers have to be concerned by this turn of events, especially as we head into the crucial holiday shopping season. Apple released <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/this-is-the-iphone-13/">the new iPhone 13</a> at the end of September, too late for this quarterly report, but no doubt timed for the shopping season. The chip shortage issues could put <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-poised-to-slash-iphone-production-goals-due-to-chip-crunch?sref=HrWXCALa">a damper on its plans</a>. Even though both Samsung and Apple make their own chipsets for their mobile devices, each company is still feeling the impact of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/the-global-chip-shortage-is-starting-to-hit-the-smartphone-industry.html">the chip component shortage</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, Stanton says it&#8217;s unlikely consumers will see any cost-cutting this year, as manufacturing costs continue to spiral upward. Instead, he anticipates that we may see more bundling of phones with other devices as a buying incentive.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Customers should expect smartphone discounting this year to be less aggressive. But to avoid customer disappointment, smartphone brands which are constrained on margin should look to bundle other devices, such as wearables and IoT, to create good incentives for customers.”</p>
<p>CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/15/chip-shortage-could-persist-for-another-2-3-years-hisense-president.html">reported just yesterday</a> that the consumer chip shortage could persist even longer than Stanton is predicting, perhaps as long as two to three years, according to the president of Hisense, Jia Shaoqian, whose company makes devices like home appliances and consumer goods.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pagos, a payment intelligence infrastructure startup founded by former Braintree and PayPal execs, has raised $10 million in seed funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Started earlier this year, the remote-first </span><a href="https://pagos.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pagos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is building a data “platform” and API-driven micro-services that it says can integrate with any payment stack. The end goal is to drive better performance and “optimization” of a business’ existing payments infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept was born out of the founding team’s experience at their previous companies. </span>CEO <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/klasback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Klas Bäck</a></span> and CPO <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrouart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Albert Drouart</a></span> held senior leadership positions at Braintree/Venmo and PayPal over the last eight to nine years (Braintree/Venmo was acquired by PayPal). The pair also worked together at payment processor Netgiro (later sold to Digital River). <span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blombergdan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Blomberg</a></span>, the company&#8217;s CTO, has launched seven startups (and sold five) over the last two decades.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218535" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div>
<div>(Side note: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bäck and Blomberg </span>grew up in the same small town in the Swedish countryside but have both lived abroad &#8212; in different places &#8212; over the past two decades).</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The challenge we saw pretty much for every one of our customers was that they didn&#8217;t have enough knowledge, not enough data and not enough tools to be able to execute a strategy around payment processing or know how to optimize it,” said Bäck, who led Braintree’s international operations from inception and worked for PayPal after its acquisition of the startup. “This means they are a lot slower and they have a much harder time doing all the things they need to do and producing the results they want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In real terms, this can lead to higher operating costs, lost revenue and “unnecessary friction, making execution of business strategy a lot harder than it should be,” added Bäck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Pagos set out to build a SaaS platform with what it describes as API-driven micro-services to help companies optimize their payment processing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> execution of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to give them the insight and the data they need to answer &#8212; ‘what does it mean? How can I do better? How can I execute faster?”, Bäck said. “We want to give them those tools in an easy to consume way.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was enough to win over Underscore VC and Point72 Ventures &#8212; who co-led Pagos’ seed round &#8212; as well as angels including former Venmo GM and current Accel investor Amit Jhawar; Bill Ready, Google’s president of commerce &amp; payments; Billy Chen, VP of financial partnerships at Finix and former director of payments at Uber; and Rich LaBarca, GM of Dynamics 365 Customer Insights at Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short term, Pagos is offering services such as “immediate” payment data visualizations, automatic notifications on payment trends or problems and up-to-date bank identification number (BIN) details to manage customers and track costs. Looking ahead, the company is planning to offer network tokenization and account updater services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Midsize to large companies are getting reasonable traction on sales online or via their mobile app. Once they start hitting meaningful numbers, their payment infrastructure is holding them back,”  Bäck told TechCrunch. “We want to help them scale, and execute more with less resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since day one, the company has been working with customers on a global scale, from 50-person companies to others that are selling billions of dollars of products and services online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital mostly to scale its 20-person team, particularly engineers, noted Bäck.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218559" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218559" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2218559 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard-Peacock-Charts.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard-Peacock-Charts.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard-Peacock-Charts.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard-Peacock-Charts.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard-Peacock-Charts.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard-Peacock-Charts.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard-Peacock-Charts.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dashboard-Peacock-Charts.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218559" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pagos</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its investors are, naturally, bullish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Gardner, partner at Boston-based Underscore VC, told TechCrunch that he was drawn to Pagos because its team spent decades working with its target customers, “making them uniquely qualified to serve them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But their potential market is every e-commerce merchant in the world &#8212; and there are millions of them,” he wrote via e-mail. “Those are two potent ingredients in a winning recipe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his view, the Pagos offering is unique in both the capabilities of their services and the delivery model to customers. Over time, the team plans on delivering more than a dozen individual micro-services that solve specific payment optimization challenges &#8212; all accessible via APIs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And since there is no such thing as ‘one size fits all,’” he said, “they are available completely unbundled, free to try and individually priced when used at scale.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Matter, operating partner of Point72 Ventures, believes that as commerce becomes increasingly digitized, merchants’ payment stacks have become more complex and difficult to manage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pagos is led by two of the most accomplished payments product experts in the business, and their relationships, domain expertise and firsthand experience with these pain points is incredibly valuable,” he said in a written statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a clear pain point when it comes to drug discovery: Depending on which study you cite, creating an approved drug costs anywhere from </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2762311"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$985 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167629616000291?via%3Dihub"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.6 billion. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/deloitte-uk-measuring-the-return-from-pharmaceutical-innovation-2021.pdf#page=8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R&amp;D returns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have rebounded to only about 2.5% in 2020, up from a low of 1.6% in 2019. Not to mention the fact that drugs that fail in clinical trials don’t actually help people who need new treatments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a problem like that, there’s little surprise that we’ve seen countless startups entering the drug development space, each looking to carve out their own niche. That might be </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/a-i-drug-discovery-platform-insilico-medicine-announces-255-million-in-series-c-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI-based drug discovery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/isoplexis-a-company-uncovering-a-new-layer-of-cell-data-aims-for-125m-in-market-debut/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced proteomics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the study of proteins and their interactions) or, for one newly launched company, layers upon layers of biological data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Pepper Bio, a seed-stage company based in Boston, emerged from stealth. Pepper Bio has been building a “computational platform,” to use co-founder and chief scientific officer Samantha Dale Strasser&#8217;s words, that the company believes can aid in drug discovery. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217584" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pepper Bio has been working with several layers of biological data. That includes genetic data, proteomics, </span><a href="https://www.phgfoundation.org/blog/what-is-transcriptomics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transcriptomics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the study of RNAs, coding or non-coding, that exist in a cell) and phosphoproteomics &#8212; which is when a phosphate group is added to a protein and thereby changes its function. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To break that down further: Think of the genetics piece as a roadmap for the body’s proteins. Think of proteomics as the study of how those roads (proteins) interact and intersect with one another. Phosphoproteomics is the study of phosphorylation of proteins &#8212; essentially, a process by which the body adds a chemical tag to proteins and alters their function. Think of those as cars on the road. Transcriptomics is just another layer of traffic data that changes in real time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken together, Pepper Bio describes itself as a “Waze for drug discovery” because its developing computational platform is capable of extracting these layers of information from experimental data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea behind having global causal and functional data and analysis is that we&#8217;re much more equipped to handle very complex diseases,” says Jon Hu, CEO and co-founder of Pepper Bio. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives of Pepper Bio wouldn’t reveal the total amount of funding the company has garnered so far. The company has already raised a pre-seed round and is currently raising a seed round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is backed by NFX, also an investor in Mammoth Biosciences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the company has four employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pepper Bio’s founders have shaped Pepper Bio around their own brushes with disease. Hu has struggled with chronic migraines and has managed to successfully control the condition. However, when his grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s (a condition with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/alzheimers-is-open-for-business-controversial-fda-approval-could-pave-the-way-for-future-drugs/">just one highly controversial treatment option</a>), he found himself at a loss. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strasser experienced the same feeling when her father was diagnosed with dementia. Doctors could track the disease’s progression, but not halt it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was the first step &#8212; just feeling how much your world stops when that happens,” Strasser says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pepper Bio’s answer to the drug discovery problem appears to be accumulating (and analyzing) biological data. But the real value-add of Pepper Bio, per Strasser, is the addition of the transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics components. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We bring in information on modified proteins. This is what gives Pepper’s technology the ability to look at this data and have a functional understanding of what’s happening within drug discovery,&#8221; says Strasser. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, there are some general research papers suggesting this approach can be used to find therapeutic targets. One of Strasser’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 papers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/ib/article/11/7/301/5588257"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrative Biology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically applied the process of phosphoproteomic analysis to two mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the technique identified one kinase that was activated across the mouse models. In a follow-up experiment, animals with colitis (an inflamed colon), were treated with an oral drug that appeared to block activity in the identified pathway. In essence, the paper was a proof of concept that phosphoproteomics can identify relevant targets for preclinical studies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, Pepper Bio still needs to demonstrate that it can use its approach to yield new potential drug targets. So far, the company has two partnerships, says Hu. One is with a clinical stage “central nervous system company” in which Pepper Bio is helping profile a potential drug and illuminate how the drug actually works. Pepper Bio is currently writing a paper manuscript with this company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also working alongside an oncology lab at Stanford run by Dean Flesher, the director of translational and applied medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. The company aims to create a data set on solid tumors, develop a clinical prediction algorithm and identify novel targets for therapies, according to Hu. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the business perspective, the company doesn’t have aims on simply being a drug discovery platform for others to use. As Hu notes, they’d like to maintain the option of developing their own clinical pipeline of conditions &#8212; though Hu says this might come “three or four years” down the line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For right now, the company will measure success in terms of how well it can build out its own databases (to include more information on proteins, transcriptomes or phosphorylation), and by pursuing more partnerships with research institutions or drug makers. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA["We're going to unlock the potential of the power, the power of potentiality, and, potentially, power itself."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Continuing our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/an-interview-with-a-leading-venture-capitalist/">series of interviews with leading technology luminaries</a>, The Exchange recently caught up with <strong>Visionary Founder/CEO</strong> at <strong>Large Unicorn</strong> as its IPO priced and began to trade this week.</p>
<p>After a rapid-fire series of S-1 filings, Large Unicorn priced above its own expectations, raising more capital than it had likely anticipated during the lead-up to its public offering.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>Our first read that Large Unicorn&#8217;s IPO pricing saga indicated strong public market interest for its equity was born out when it began to trade this morning, with its shares appreciating sharply in early trading. Regular commentary regarding the value, lack of importance, or sheer perniciousness of IPO pops was alight on Twitter, of course.</p>

What follows is a loosely edited transcript of our call, condensed modestly for readability.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have some fun!</p>
<p><strong>The Exchange:</strong> Kicking off, your company priced above expectations. What can you tell us about the current appetite for high-growth, unprofitable technology shares among public-market investors?</p>
<p><strong>Visionary Founder/CEO: </strong>Hey, thanks Alex. Yeah, we were impressed with how sophisticated the market was. People really seemed to get Large Unicorn&#8217;s growth story, and how massive our market is. You know, with folks in Industry X and Industry Y really turning into digitally accelerated front-line leaders as opposed to the old labor model, we really do feel like public-market investors see the long haul. We&#8217;re building for the next 1,723 years over here at Large Unicorn.</p>
<p><strong>The Exchange: </strong>Got it, got it. One thing everyone noticed was that after pricing at $XX per share, you opened at $XXX per share. Did Large Unicorn leave money on the table?</p>
<p><strong>Visionary Founder/CEO:</strong> Yeah, great question. [pause, sound of paper shuffling] Look, an IPO is not the finish line; it&#8217;s really just another chapter in our longer journey. A milestone. So, I&#8217;m not looking at the share price today. And I&#8217;ll tell you what I told the company earlier this week: It&#8217;s business as usual.</p>
<p><strong>The Exchange:</strong> But you don&#8217;t feel like your company was underpriced? You aren&#8217;t irked that you could have raised more capital at what appears to be the market-clearing price?</p>
<p><strong>Visionary Founder/CEO: </strong>The company is well-capitalized now, and we&#8217;re looking ahead. And I&#8217;ll tell you, Alex, that we got the investors we wanted. I&#8217;m talking about long-term holders of our stock. But really, it&#8217;s all about the next 17 decades, not the next quarterly earnings report.</p>
<p><strong>The Exchange: </strong>OK. You raised a lot more capital than you probably intended to, post-IPO pricing issues aside. So what does the extended balance sheet unlock for the company?</p>
<p><strong>Visionary Founder/CEO: </strong>Yeah, Alex, listen, our market is 78 quadrillion dollars, and our current run rate is 78 cents, or less than a dollar per year, so we&#8217;re going to go out there and bring Large Unicorn&#8217;s key business-empowering services to more folks. We&#8217;re going to unlock the potential of the power, the power of potentiality, and, potentially, power itself. Businesses will be accelerated, and if you recall the first time we spoke, I told you that [inaudible] and how that would [inaudible] Mars [inaudible] EBITDA [inaudible].</p>
<p><strong>The Exchange: </strong>Hey, I lost you there for a moment &#8212; are you on a landline or cell phone? Want me to call you directly?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Clarifai enables customers to make sense of the 90% of unstructured data they have using artificial intelligence.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.clarifai.com/">Clarifai</a> wants to bring artificial intelligence into the lives of developers, business operators and data scientists so they can automate and accelerate their model development.</p>
<p>Matt Zeiler founded the New York-based company in 2013 focused on computer vision. Since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/clarifai-raises-30m-to-give-developers-visual-search-capabilities/">$30 million Series B in 2016</a>, Clarifai has been rolling out new capabilities and products targeting a company’s unstructured image, video, text and audio data files.</p>
<p>The new functionalities include natural language processing, audio recognition, scanning and an automated data labeling feature, Scribe, that was launched last year. It is also deploying its Edge AI capability that layers AI on top of data streams using various local hardware, from high-powered servers to cameras and drones. The company plans to unveil even more at its annual deep learning conference, Perceive 2021, on October 20.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218308" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Amid all of that activity — and to keep it going — Clarifai on Friday announced a $60 million Series C funding round, led by New Enterprise Associates, with participation from existing investors Menlo Ventures, Union Square Ventures, Lux Capital, LDV Capital, Corazon Capital and NYU Innovation Venture Fund, and new investors CPP Investments, Next Equity Partners, SineWave Ventures and Trousdale Capital. The latest round brings the company’s total funding raised to $100 million.</p>
<p>“We managed to go a long time without raising more funding,” Zeiler told TechCrunch. “We grew our revenue significantly while controlling costs and operating efficiently. We saw an opportunity and raised the round.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NowhkikKWZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/clarifai-raises-30m-to-give-developers-visual-search-capabilities/">Clarifai raises $30M to give developers visual search capabilities</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clarifai raises $30M to give developers visual search capabilities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/25/clarifai-raises-30m-to-give-developers-visual-search-capabilities/embed/#?secret=NowhkikKWZ" data-secret="NowhkikKWZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That opportunity included having the right team in place to execute enterprise sales, he added. In the early days of the company, the market was immature, so Clarifai started selling to small businesses and individuals. Now it is closing deals with Fortune 500 companies as the market has matured.</p>
<p>To the company, “unstructured data&#8221; is data that the human brain is good at, but computers are not, like images, videos and text. This is something that enterprises have steadily realized has huge value, and in fact up to 95% of a company’s data is unstructured, providing “a huge opportunity” for Clarifai, Zeiler said.</p>
<p>When the company started to see those enterprise signals in the market, it went after the Series C. It also partnered with Snowflake with an integration to link Clarifai with recently released unstructured data support from Snowflake.</p>
<p>“Snowflake has a $100 billion business built on structured data, and now it is doing unstructured data,” Zeiler added. “If customers are storing data with Snowflake, they can get value from it, they need AI from Clarifai to make sense of it.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2218355" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218355" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2218355" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png" alt="Clarifai" width="1024" height="567" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png 1904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=680,376 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=1536,850 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-9.07.38-AM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218355" class="wp-caption-text">Clarifai product pipeline. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clarifai</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company more than doubled its revenue over the last year and topped 130,000 users. The Series C funding enables Clarifai to scale its global team of 100 employees with plans to double that by next year.</p>
<p>The company will also invest in sales and marketing, as well as an international expansion. It already has an office in Estonia, and Zeiler is looking at Australia, India and Turkey, where it is amassing more customers. It will also continue to work on its Edge AI product, which just attracted its first commercial client.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Andrew Schoen, partner at NEA, joins Clarifai’s board of directors. The company was on his radar for a number of years, but Schoen felt at the time Clarifai was too early for investment.</p>
<p>“The early winds in AI were all around structured data, which was the low-hanging fruit since 90% of data is unstructured,” he said. “Now that the ecosystem is mature, companies realize the bottleneck of having squeezed everything they can out of the structured data. Now they have all that unstructured data they can’t use and it isn’t neatly organized. Clarifai is aimed at solving that problem.”</p>
<p>He sees Clarifai demystifying and democratizing AI and machine learning. Due to the company’s early focus on unstructured data, it was able to get some early adopters and is now leading in this area.</p>
<p>In addition, he says the team began an inflection point over the past 12 months with revenue projections and has a business “that is growing nicely.”</p>
<p>“The company had to work to land customers and educate the market, but now instead of pushing the market, it is pulling as companies look for solutions and see Clarifai is the right product,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">January 2020 seems like a long time ago: Billie Eilish swept the Grammy Awards, Tesla&#8217;s market cap made it America&#8217;s most valuable car company, and Visa announced plans to purchase Plaid for $5.3 billion.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/inside-plaids-plans-to-build-a-new-global-finance-network/">He spoke to CEO Zach Perret, CTO Jean-Denis Greze and COO Eric Sager</a> about what they learned while working with Visa, and looked at some new platform features designed to build customer trust while eliciting better insights.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218566" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Despite the outcome not being what we predicted when we went in, I think we as a company grew a lot and learned a lot,” said Perret.</p>

<p>Account-based marketing makes it easier to engage with key customers at the right moment, but for many early-stage startups desperate to reach takeoff velocity, ABM isn’t viewed as something they can do.</p>
<p>“This couldn’t be further from the truth, and both startups and SMBs can, and should, invest in ABM strategies,” advises Jonas van de Poel, head of content marketing at Unmuted, an Amsterdam-based growth agency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a post that offers a detailed overview, van de Poel identifies “distinctive characteristics” of businesses that should consider ABM strategies, along with specific recommendations for implementing them.</p>
<p>“With a handful of smart growth tactics and clever tools, ABM strategies don’t have to break the bank to be successful,” he writes.</p>

<p>Global startup funding has soared this year, but a number of exits and large funding rounds are drawing new attention to India&#8217;s startup ecosystem.</p>

<p>“Whether it is product-led growth, community-led, customer-led or what have you,” Bajaj said, “modern go-to-market playbooks have caused a fundamental shift in the software-as-a-service market by creating 10x+ as many buying/retention signals.</p>
<p>Accordingly, super-specialized GTM strategies are now the norm, not the exception.”</p>

<p>Analytics startup Mixpanel burst out of the gate in 2009, scoring big wins as it scooped up new users and approached the $100 million ARR mark, but by 2017, &#8220;it lacked focus, it was losing customers, and many of the customers it had weren’t terribly pleased with it,&#8221; reports Ron Miller.</p>
<p>To learn more about how the company course-corrected by returning to its roots, he interviewed Mixpanel CEO Amir Movafaghi, VP of people and strategy Amy Hsuan, and VP of product and design, Neil Rahilly.</p>
<p>“When you decide to make a huge strategic shift like this, it’s really a case of taking a step backward to take two steps forward, because in the short-term, there’s lots of pain,&#8221; Rahilly said.</p>

<p>GitLab stock popped 35% in its first day of trading, but before the bell rang, Alex Wilhelm shared his thinking about its $77 debut price, up from an initial range of $55 to $60. His conclusions?</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue growth is good, but revenue growth with top-tier SaaS metrics is god-tier.</li>
<li>You can go public with a top-five public multiple.</li>
<li>Public markets could be, somehow, warmer than private markets.</li>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My fiancé and I got engaged early this year. We’re planning a wedding for later in the year when my family can travel to the U.S. from Estonia, where I’m originally from. I’ve been living and working in the U.S. for almost two years on an L-1A visa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My company is sponsoring me for an EB-1C green card, but the process has been slow. I’m thinking about getting a green card through my spouse when we’re married.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there anything in particular that I should keep in mind? Also, would it be a problem if I keep my maiden name after my fiancé and I get married?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Fantastic Fiancée</strong></p>

<p>Predictive modeling is used for customer relationship management, health care and forecasting TV ratings, but more startup founders should be using it to inform their fundraising, suggests Billy Libby, CEO and co-founder of hybrid fund Upper90.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data can separate the healthy and experimental parts of all businesses, making it easier to utilize earnings, marketing ROI and inventory to make predictions about or get credit for future revenue streams,&#8221; he writes in a TechCrunch+ guest post.</p>

<p>Blockdaemon CEO Konstantin Richter is hiring at least 10 engineers a month.</p>
<p>“You can’t overlook the elephant in the room — money talks,” the CEO writes in a guest column for TechCrunch+.</p>
<p>Setting aside the $100,000 bounty the company now offers its recruiters, Richter also shares his company&#8217;s compensation framework. For example, instead of a yearly salary review, Blockdaemon revisits the matter every six months.</p>
<p>&#8220;This helps build a meritocratic and less bureaucratic culture, and ensures our team reaps the benefits commensurate with their work product,&#8221; he says.</p>
