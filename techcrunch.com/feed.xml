										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Social media executives will be answering to Congress directly for their role in January&#8217;s deadly attacks on the U.S. Capitol this week. Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter&#8217;s Jack Dorsey and Google&#8217;s Sundar Pichai will all appear virtually before a joint House committee <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-disinformation-nation-social-medias-role-in-promoting">Thursday at 12 p.m. Eastern Time</a>.</p>
<p>The hearing, held by the House&#8217;s Subcommittee on Communications and Technology and the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce, will focus on social media&#8217;s role in spreading disinformation, extremism and misinformation. The Energy and Commerce Committee previously held a parallel hearing reckoning with traditional media&#8217;s role in promoting those same social ills.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone Jr., joined by more than 20 other Democrats, <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ec-democrats-demand-accountability-for-facebook-s-advertising-practices-in">sent a letter to Zuckerberg</a> pressing the Facebook CEO for answers about why tactical gear ads showed up next to posts promoting the Capitol riot. &#8220;Targeting ads in this way is dangerous and has the potential to encourage acts of violence,&#8221; the letter&#8217;s authors wrote. In late January, Facebook said that it would pause ads showing weapon accessories and related equipment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While the subcommittee has signaled its interest in Facebook&#8217;s ad practices, organic content on the site has historically presented a much bigger problem. In the uncertain period following the election last year, the pro-Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">&#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; movement swelled to massive proportions</a> on social media, particularly in Facebook groups. The company took<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/facebook-says-it-will-remove-references-to-stop-the-steal-across-its-platform/"> incremental measures at the time</a>, but that same movement, born of political misinformation, is what propelled the Capitol rioters to disrupt vote counting and enact deadly violence on January 6.</p>
<p>The hearing is likely to go deep on extremists organizing through Facebook groups too. Chairs from both subcommittees that will question the tech CEOs this week previously questioned Facebook about reports that the company was well aware that its algorithmic group recommendations<a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/Facebook%20Letter%20re%20Misinformation%20Feb%202021.pdf"> were funneling users toward extremism</a>. In spite of warnings from experts, Facebook continued to allow armed anti-government militias to openly organize on the platform until late 2020. And in spite of bans, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2021-03-23/report-extremist-groups-thrive-on-facebook-despite-bans">some continued to do so</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yM45FxyjTd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/">Militia tied to plot to kidnap Gov. Whitmer was removed from Facebook in boogaloo purge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Militia tied to plot to kidnap Gov. Whitmer was removed from Facebook in boogaloo purge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/embed/#?secret=yM45FxyjTd" data-secret="yM45FxyjTd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Justice Department is reportedly considering charging members of the Oath Keepers, one prominent armed U.S. militia group involved in the Capitol attack, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/us/politics/sedition-oath-keepers-capitol-riot.html">with sedition</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook plays a huge role in distributing extremist content and ferrying it to the mainstream, but it isn&#8217;t alone. Misinformation that undermines the integrity of the U.S. election results is generally just as easy to find on YouTube and Twitter, though those social networks aren&#8217;t designed to connect and mobilize people in the same way that Facebook groups do.</p>
<p>Facebook began to course-correct its own rules around extremism, slowly through 2020 and then quickly this January when the company removed former President Trump from the platform. Facebook&#8217;s external policy oversight board continues to review that decision and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/facebook-trump-oversight-board-public-comment/">could reverse it in the coming weeks</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last year, Twitter made an effort to demystify some of its own policy decisions, transparently communicating changes and introducing ideas it was considering. Under Dorsey&#8217;s guidance the company treated its platform rules like a living document — one it&#8217;s begun to tinker around with in an effort to shape <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/twitter-retweet-prompt-android/">user behavior for the better</a>.</p>
<p>If Twitter&#8217;s recent policy decision making is akin to thinking out loud, YouTube took the opposite approach. The company wasn&#8217;t as proactive in shoring up its defenses ahead of the 2020 elections and rarely responded in real-time to events. YouTube waited a full month after Biden&#8217;s victory to articulate rules that would rid the platform of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/youtube-declares-war-on-us-election-misinformation-a-month-late/">disinformation declaring that the election was stolen from Trump</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully the joint hearing can dig a bit more into why that was, but we&#8217;re not counting on it. The subcommittees&#8217; decision to bring Google CEO Sundar Pichai to testify is a bit strange considering that YouTube&#8217;s CEO Susan Wojcicki — who has yet to be called to Congress for one of these high profile tech hearings — would make the better witness. Pichai is ultimately accountable for what YouTube does too, but in past hearings he&#8217;s proven a very polished witness who&#8217;s deft at neutralizing big picture criticism with technical detail.</p>
<p>Ultimately Wojcicki would have more insight into YouTube&#8217;s misinformation and extremism policies and the reason the platform has dragged its feet on matters of hate and misinformation, <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/youtube-explains-why-a-racist-video-didnt-violate-its-hate-speech-rules-3d74befde097">enforcing its own policies unevenly</a> when it chooses to do so at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In what looks like both an endorsement of its Premier Access streaming strategy and a tacit acknowledgement that theatrical moviegoing won&#8217;t be returning to normal anytime soon, Disney just announced that its movies &#8220;Black Widow&#8221; and &#8220;Cruella&#8221; will be coming to Disney+ at the same time that they&#8217;re released in theaters.</p>
<p>That means Disney+ subscribers will have the option to pay an additional, one-time $29.99 fee to watch the live action remake of &#8220;Cruella&#8221; at home on May 28, or to do the same for &#8220;Black Widow&#8221; on July 9. (The movies will later become available to all Disney+ subscribers at no extra charge.)</p>
<p>Disney first tested out this strategy with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/mulan-is-coming-to-disney-on-september-4-for-an-additional-price-of-29-99/">the release of the live action &#8220;Mulan&#8221; last fall</a>, followed by the animated &#8220;Raya and the Last Dragon&#8221; earlier this month. The studio has released other movies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/original-content-podcast-pixars-soul-offers-a-lively-visit-to-pre-pandemic-new-york/">like Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Soul,&#8221;</a> directly to Disney+ without an extra fee, and it says it will do the same for Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Luca&#8221; on June 18.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other big Disney releases have been pushed back repeatedly — &#8220;Black Widow,&#8221; for example, was originally supposed to be released on May 1 of last year, and Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige has <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/kevin-feige-black-widow-theatrical-release/">reportedly resisted</a> sending it straight to Disney+. (This will be the first Marvel Studios film released since the beginning of the pandemic.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cSgHPjNjPu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/">Disney+ has plans for 10 Marvel shows and 10 Star Wars shows in the next few years</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Disney+ has plans for 10 Marvel shows and 10 Star Wars shows in the next few years&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/embed/#?secret=cSgHPjNjPu" data-secret="cSgHPjNjPu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>However, Disney executives may only be willing to wait for so long. And because Marvel&#8217;s movies and new Disney+ shows are often interconnected, delaying one release can also require pushing back several others at the same time.</p>
<p>As vaccinations continue and COVID-19 case numbers decline from their peaks, movie theaters are reopening in major markets like Los Angeles and New York — but at reduced capacity, with box office numbers still <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/2021W12/?ref_=bo_wey_table_1">far below</a> what they were pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>In the face of this uncertainty (as well as a general shift to streaming), other Hollywood studios have adopted a variety of hybrid strategies for their 2021 theatrical slates. All Warner Bros. movies will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/warner-bros-hbo-max-simultaneous-release/">released simultaneously on HBO Max</a> this year, while Paramount will be bringing its films to Paramount+ in an accelerated fashion, 30 to 45 days after the theatrical release.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As exciting as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/mars-rover-perseverance-touches-down-tomorrow-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">entire Perseverance mission to Mars</a> is, one of the events most looked forward to by us Earthlings must be the first flight of Ingenuity. After conducting numerous checks and double-checks, the Perseverance team has set April 8 as the date on which they hope to attempt the first controlled powered flight on another planet.</p>
<p>If all goes well, then in about two weeks Ingenuity will make its first hovering flight about 10 feet above the Martian soil. But the meantime will be chock full of preparation.</p>
<p>In the first place the team had to identify an &#8220;airfield,&#8221; a ten-meter-square space of flat ground close at hand to Perseverance&#8217;s landing zone. Having done so, the rover will soon make its way to the exact center and confirm its location.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cAJYiGvZag"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/perseverance-lands-safely-on-mars-and-sends-back-its-first-images-of-the-surface/">Perseverance lands safely on Mars and sends back its first images of the surface</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Perseverance lands safely on Mars and sends back its first images of the surface&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/perseverance-lands-safely-on-mars-and-sends-back-its-first-images-of-the-surface/embed/#?secret=cAJYiGvZag" data-secret="cAJYiGvZag" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Then the helicopter itself must be detached from the belly of the rover, to which it is apparently locked, bolted, <em>and</em> cabled. These are meant to keep it secure during the chaotic landing process, and are irreversible — so the team has to be 100 percent sure this is the spot and the conditions are right. The process should take about five days.</p>
<p>Once Ingenuity has been detached from Perseverance and rotated to flight-ready position, it will hang just five inches above the surface and use its few remaining connections with the rover to charge its batteries. Perseverance will then set it down and quickly drive away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every step we have taken since this journey began six years ago has been uncharted territory in the history of aircraft,&#8221; said Bob Balaram, chief engineer of the project at JPL, in a NASA news release. &#8220;And while getting deployed to the surface will be a big challenge, surviving that first night on Mars alone, without the rover protecting it and keeping it powered, will be an even bigger one. Once we cut the cord with Perseverance and drop those final five inches to the surface, we want to have our big friend drive away as quickly as possible so we can get the Sun’s rays on our solar panel and begin recharging our batteries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the helicopter detaches, it has 30 Martian days, or sols, in which it is sure to have enough power to work — beyond that they can&#8217;t be sure.</p>
<p>The next couple days will involve tests of Ingenuity&#8217;s systems and a test spin-up of its rotors to 2,537 RPM. The atmosphere of Mars is only a tiny fraction of that on Earth, making flight considerably more difficult in many ways. But that&#8217;s what makes it so fun to try!</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RQWv1ybsjM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent&#038;listType=playlist&#038;list=PLTiv_XWHnOZpzQKYC6nLf6M9AuBbng_O8' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>If all the tests and checks are green, then on April 8 at the earliest Ingenuity will attempt to lift off, going up to 3 meters and staying for 30 seconds. The team should know if the flight was a success within a couple hours — and maybe even get some black and white imagery from the Ingenuity&#8217;s on-board cameras. Color imagery will come a few days later.</p>
<p>The team will evaluate what to do next based on this first flight, and the next weeks may bring more — and farther — forays around the airfield. We&#8217;ll know more after the data comes back.</p>
<p>A touching inclusion on Ingenuity&#8217;s chassis is a tiny scrap of the material from the Wright brothers&#8217; first aircraft, the Flyer. So the machine that flew first on Earth will be present in a small way at the first on another planet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Y Combinator’s latest batch &#8212; W21 &#8212; features 350 startups from 41 nations. Fifty percent of the firms, the highest percentage to date, in the new batch are based outside of the United States.</p>
<p>India is the second-largest demographic represented in the new batch. The world’s second-largest internet market has delivered 43 startups in the new batch, another record figure in the history of the storied venture firm. (For comparison, the W20 batch had 25 Indian startups, up from 14 in S20, 12 each in S19 and W19 and one each in W16, S15 and W15.)</p>
<p>“YC going remote has helped make YC more attractive to companies at different stages and far away geographies. For companies in India, founders no longer have to spend three months away from their customers or teams. Covid has also taught us that building a program that is remote and more software based makes YC more accessible to founders around the globe,” the firm said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When it comes to choosing founders in India, we accept them based on the same criteria we judge companies from anywhere else. Founders must be able to communicate their local context to investors. That is an important skill.”</p>
<p>Here’s a list of startups, in no particular order, from India that have made it to YC W21, with some context &#8212; wherever possible &#8212; on what they are attempting to build (several have elected to stay off the record).</p>

<p>In India only a fraction of the nation’s 1.3 billion people currently have access to insurance and some analysts say that digital firms could prove crucial in bringing these services to the masses. According to rating agency ICRA, insurance products had reached less than 3% of the population as of 2017.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">All successful companies start off as a <em>great idea</em>, scribbled on the back of a cocktail napkin during a late-night meeting of the minds or gleaned from a fleeting inspiration that leaves you with a feeling of “I could do that better.”</p>
<p>For most, that’s as far as entrepreneurship ever goes, because, unfortunately, a <em>great idea</em> can’t raise money, develop a product or disrupt an industry.</p>
<p>It’s only an <em>idea.</em></p>

			Investors’ heightened expectations for monetization potential and a company’s positioning within its competitive landscape are unlikely to lessen in the years to come, even in a post-COVID economy.					</blockquote>

<p>New data from the <a href="https://www.docsend.com/index/docsend-startup-index/">DocSend Startup Index</a> show that for early-stage fundraising, particularly in the pre-seed round, founders need to approach VCs with much more than a great idea to secure funding. Our <a href="https://try.docsend.com/fundraising-report?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=referral%20traffic&amp;utm_campaign=2021-02%20preseed%20report%20byline&amp;utm_content=techcrunch&amp;utm_term=preseed%20report">newest report</a> on the state of pre-seed fundraising shows that investors became laser-focused on sections of the pitch deck that address monetization and business viability — signs that founders need to come to the table with better-defined businesses in order to succeed.</p>
<h2><strong>Do not pass go — VCs insist pitch decks meet 3 key criteria </strong></h2>
<p>According to the data, overall founder and VC activity took a nosedive in early 2020 once the serious nature of the pandemic became apparent. But as the year progressed and investors adjusted to the new market conditions and remote dealmaking, overall activity quickly surpassed pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Despite this flurry of activity and an unprecedented appetite for new startup pitches, investors made it very clear that strong positioning in three sections of the pitch deck was nonnegotiable.</p>

<li><strong>Competitive landscape — </strong>When we published our 2019 pre-seed report, the competitive landscape section of pitch decks was firmly in the middle of the pack in terms of time spent reviewing by investors: They averaged around 35 seconds to clearly articulate their own uniqueness and product-market fit. In 2020, the VC time spent on the same section increased by 51% to an average of 53 seconds across both successful and unsuccessful decks (those that did or did not lead to a funding offer).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>David&#8217;s wife, Jamie Heinemeier Hansson, had also penned a blog post <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90429224/i-applied-for-an-apple-card-what-they-offered-was-a-sexist-insult">documenting</a> her experiences in more detail.</p>
<p>The numerous consumer complaints soon drew the attention of the New York Department of Financial Services, which then <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-09/viral-tweet-about-apple-card-leads-to-probe-into-goldman-sachs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched an investigation</a> into Goldman Sachs&#8217; credit card practices in order to see if gender-based discrimination was taking place, as alleged.</p>
<p>The NYDFS report, first spotted today by <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/23/goldman-sachs-cleared-of-apple-card-discrimination-claims">Appleinsider</a>, notes that Goldman Sachs re-reviewed the credit files of the some of the women who had been initially been offered dramatically lower credit scores than their spouses, and decided to raise their limits to match those of their spouses. At the time, the bank also eliminated the six-month waiting period for appeals on credit decisions.</p>
<p>These actions seemed to indicate that the Apple Card algorithms were making bad calls on credit worthiness, potentially even on the basis of gender; but the Department says that&#8217;s not the case &#8212; though it did stress the need or credit score reforms and updating existing laws around credit access.</p>
<p>The NYDFS said it reviewed several thousands pages of record and written responses from Apple and Goldman Sachs, interviewed witnesses, met with representatives from Apple and the bank, and analyzed the bank&#8217;s underwriting data using a data set covering nearly 400,000 New York applicants. It also interviewed the consumers who had complained of discrimination.</p>
<p>The Department concluded that there was no &#8220;unlawful discrimination&#8221; against applicants under fair lending law. However, statements made by the Superintendent of Financial Services Linda A. Lacewell, did stress that there is still discrimination built into the credit lending system itself, and the way credit scores can lead to unequal access to credit.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we found no fair lending violations, our inquiry stands as a reminder of disparities in access to credit that continue nearly 50 years after the passage of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) ,&#8221; <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202103231">Lacewell said</a>. &#8220;The report also notes that the use of credit scoring in its current form and laws and regulations barring discrimination in lending are in need of strengthening and modernization to improve access to credit. Consumer frustration with the Apple Card policy of not permitting an account holder to add an authorized user drew attention to the following: a person who relies on a spouse&#8217;s access to credit, and only accesses those accounts as an authorized user, may incorrectly believe they have the same credit profile as the spouse. This is one part of a broader discussion we must have about equal credit access,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>One common factor among the consumers who complained was a belief that a spouse who had access to the same shared bank account or other shared assets, like credit cards &#8212; even if only as authorized users &#8212; would receive the same credit terms as their spouses. But the way the system works today, underwriters don&#8217;t have to consider an authorized user the same as an account holder, and they may consider other factors, too. Combined, these are what led to the lower lending decisions, the investigation found.</p>
<p>The Department said that, when asked, Goldman Sachs was able to document underwriting that determined its lending decisions for the consumer complaints. Gender was not a factor, but spouses&#8217; credit scores, indebtedness, income, credit utilization, missed payments and other credit history elements were. None of the factors identified was an &#8220;unlawful basis&#8221; for a credit determination, the Department said.</p>
<p>Of course, the credit score system itself is one<a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/credit-score-gender-pay-gap/"> that overall, favors men</a>. (And <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/01/many-minorities-avoid-seeking-credit-due-to-decades-of-discrimination.html">specifically</a>, white men). There is no one single reason as to why that&#8217;s the case, but often has to do with women&#8217;s role as a primary caregiver, combined with how the credit scoring model operates. This is a system that needs reform, but as it relates to the Apple Card program and discrimination complaints, it was &#8220;lawfully&#8221; used to make the Apple Card lending decisions.</p>
<p>However, the Department did point out that there was a lack of transparency around Apple Card&#8217;s lending decisions &#8212; noting that although it was able to obtain the data about the bank&#8217;s decision for these complaints, the impacted consumers could not. It also suggested Apple could have offered a more robust appeals process, instead of requiring a six-month wait.</p>
<p>Apple has since responded to some of the issues raised, including by launching &#8220;Path to Apple Card&#8221; last year, which helps applicants follow steps that lead to an Apple Card approval. To date, more than 70K consumers have enrolled in this program and nearly 5,000 have been approved. Apple also updated its website with more information about how Apple Card approvals work. And now it&#8217;s in the process of adding support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/apple-card-multi-user-support-ios-14-5/">for Apple Card family sharing features</a> &#8212; meaning, authorized users. This would address issues around spouses not being able to gain access to the higher credit lending limits at least.</p>
<p>But this investigation highlighted the problems Apple faced by pairing its trusted brand with a credit card issued by a traditional lender and the accompanying crummy banking practices consumers hate, as well as how a lack of transparency had undermined trust in the lending decisions that were made.</p>
<p>Apple offered a statement regarding the investigation&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We appreciate the Department of Financial Services’ thorough investigation and welcome its conclusion of no fair lending violations. We remain committed to providing fair and equal access to credit,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Hansson, whose original tweet set this whole investigation into motion, has this to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;This read like a press release from Goldman Sachs, and ignores the specific facts in our case. My wife had a HIGHER credit score than I did, yet was determined to be worth a tenth the credit. There’s zero transparency in the credit assessment process, applicants can’t tell why they’re being denied, and Goldman Sachs and Apple employees don’t even seem to know. The algorithmic black box outcomes continue, there’s no possibility of doing audits, and unfair outcomes continue. Total regulatory failure.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The frequent difficulty of founders finding product-market fit has been a topic of constant (and ever-evolving) discussion at TechCrunch conferences over the years.</p>
<p>Superhuman founder and CEO Rahul Vohra will be joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2">TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a> in July to dive into the much-obsessed topic of product-market fit. We&#8217;re looking to dig into what exactly finding product-market fits means to the startup ecosystem of 2021.</p>
<p>The repeat founder&#8217;s email service platform has raised more than $33 million in funding from firms like Andreessen Horowitz and First Round Capital, providing users with an algorithmically-sorted email app that has set a lot of trends in emerging enterprise software on both the design and go-to-market strategy front.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is oft-referenced as a prime example of the &#8220;consumerization&#8221; of enterprise software trend which has seen more and more workplace SaaS apps level-up their focus on user-centric design. We&#8217;ll ask him how he feels about the fact that &#8220;Superhuman for X&#8221; has grown to be a fairly common formula for workplace elevator pitches.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll also talk with him about how he found an audience for a $30 per month subscription app and how the company has scaled its product to meet their customers&#8217; other needs. In addition to the hat he wears as the founder of Superhuman, we&#8217;ll ask him about how he views the challenge from the other side of the table as a prolific angel investor. The fund that he manages with Eventjoy founder Todd Goldberg announced a $7 million fund last year and the duo has backed several startups, including Clubhouse, Mercury and Coda.</p>
<p>We think it&#8217;s going to be a conversation you can&#8217;t miss and it&#8217;s just one part of a two-day event exploring the many aspects of early-stage startups this July.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eat Just, the purveyor of eggless eggs and mayonnaise and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/eat-just-to-sell-lab-grown-meat-in-singapore-after-gaining-world-first-regulatory-approval/">first government-approved vendor of lab-grown chicken</a>, has raised $200 million in a new round of funding, the company said.</p>
<p>The funding was led by the Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund of the state of Qatar, with additional participation from Charlesbank Capital Partners and Vulcan Capital, the investment arm of the estate of Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen.</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2011 as Hampton Creek, the company has raised more than $650 million all to build out capacity for its egg replacement products and its new line of lab-grown meat.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are very excited to work with our investors to build a healthier, safer and more sustainable food system. Their knowledge and experience partnering with companies that are transforming numerous industries were fundamental in our decision to partner with them,” said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and CEO of Eat Just, in a statement.</p>
<p>Eat Just&#8217;s evolution hasn&#8217;t been without controversy. In 2017, the company and its chief executive withstood <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/05/hampton-creek-just-mayo-firings">a failed coup</a>, which forced the firing of several executives. The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/every-member-of-hampton-creeks-board-has-stepped-down-except-for-the-ceo/">saw its entire board resign</a> in the aftermath of those firings, only to replace them <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/14/hampton-creek-rises-again-with-new-directors-and-patents-for-a-new-direction/">with a new slate of directors months later</a>.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, Hampton Creek rebranded and refocused. These days the company&#8217;s products fall into two somewhat related categories. There&#8217;re the plant-based egg replacement products and eggless mayonnaise and the lab grown chicken products that are meant to replace poultry farmed chicken meat.</p>
<p>Since the egg side of Eat Just&#8217;s chicken and egg business definitely came first, it&#8217;s worth noting that the company&#8217;s products are sold in more than 20,000 retail outlets and 1,000 foodservice locations. since it began selling the product, the company has moved more than 100 million eggs to roughly one million U.S. households.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s eggs are also on offer in Dicos, a fast food chain in China, and it&#8217;s got a deal to put out a sous vide egg replacement product with Cuisine Solutions. The eggs are also available in Peet&#8217;s Coffee locations around the country and Eat Just has expanded its eggless distribution platform into Canada.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the company&#8217;s<a href="https://goodmeat.co/"> GOOD Meat</a> product. That was available for a short time in Singapore. The company expects to slash production costs and expand its commercial operations while working on other kinds of meats as well, according to a statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a long way from where the Eat Just started, when it raised its first millions from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/20/founders-fund-backs-hampton-creek-foods/">Khosla Ventures and Founders Fund</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Move fast, break things, get hacked.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happened at Roll, the social currency platform that allows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/why-terry-crews-is-launching-a-social-currency/">creators to mint and distribute</a> their own Ethereum-based cryptocurrency known as social tokens. Last week, Roll disclosed a hacker had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/5-7m-stolen-in-roll-crypto-heist-after-hot-wallet-hacked/">stolen $5.7 million</a> from its hot wallet, a little over a year after the company launched.</p>
<p>Roll set up a $500,000 fund to help creators recoup their losses, and the company promised to hire a third-party to audit its security infrastructure.</p>
<p>But the company has so far been unable to contract with security investigators to probe the breach, leaving the startup to look for clues itself. A week has passed since the breach, and the social currency startup says it still doesn&#8217;t know how the hacker broke in or stole its private keys.</p>
<p>In a call with TechCrunch this week, Roll executives confirmed its infrastructure never underwent a security audit, a process designed to help find and fix vulnerabilities, prior to its launch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t ready from a security standpoint,&#8221; said Roll CEO Bradley Miles.</p>
<p>&#8220;This incident was a big setback for us, we will revamp a lot of infrastructure around this that we have in place to prevent something like this from happening again,&#8221; said Roll&#8217;s chief technology officer Sid Kalla, who oversees cybersecurity because the company does not have dedicated staff.</p>
<p>The executives said while its smart contracts — the technology that underpins the blockchain — were audited by a third-party firm, the rest of the company&#8217;s infrastructure was never stress-tested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a shortcoming on our end, and we should have done this earlier,&#8221; said Kalla.</p>
<p>The emptying of Roll&#8217;s hot wallet comes as social currency climbs to new levels of popularity. Roll has netted high-profile creators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/why-terry-crews-is-launching-a-social-currency/">like actor Terry Crews</a>, along with hundreds of other social currency on the platform, many plummeting in value after the hot wallet was hacked.</p>
<p>Some of the larger social currencies, like $WHALE, bounced back <a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro/status/1371017826408931329">fairly quickly</a> after the breach of Roll&#8217;s hot wallet. A month earlier, $WHALE &#8220;serendipitously withdrew&#8221; a large amount of its supply to its cold wallets, which aren&#8217;t connected to the internet, in anticipation of community distributions. The social currencies that had measures in place proved some resiliency against the hack.</p>

<p>After the company realized its hot wallet was emptied, the company spent the first two days following the money trail. Miles said the company engaged with forensic blockchain company Chainalysis for help. The company said it was looking at his logs, but says they have not seen any anomalous logins. Roll uses Amazon&#8217;s cloud for its infrastructure, and only a handful of employees have access to the private keys, and their accounts are secured with app-based authentication codes, said Kalla.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a young company, we&#8217;re growing extraordinarily quickly,&#8221; said Miles, who admitted that the company&#8217;s response &#8220;could have been better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no scenario in which you can lose that kind of money and not bring in incident response,&#8221; said Jake Williams, founder of cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec. &#8220;The idea that you would try to do a DIY incident response, especially if it&#8217;s not your core capability, is just ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To rebuild trust, the company has to come clean on where the failures were at,&#8221; said Williams, a former NSA hacker turned incident responder.</p>
<p>Roll is rebuilding its infrastructure, but did not give a timeline for when the work would be completed. The company said it won&#8217;t allow users to make withdrawals until it&#8217;s confident that its infrastructure is secure. The company says it will engage a security company to audit the changes to its infrastructure. Roll also said it will reduce how many tokens it holds in its hot wallet.</p>
<p>Miles said the company&#8217;s relief fund for creators was raised to $750,000, which he said will go directly to affected communities. The company also plans to hire a dedicated chief information security officer when its next financing round closes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, Y Combinator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be a major backer of most of the continent&#8217;s well-known startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the most talked-about in the last two quarters &#8212; Flutterwave and Paystack &#8212; are YC-backed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their recent successes (Flutterwave&#8217;s billion-dollar valuation and Paystack&#8217;s rare exit to Stripe) have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">greatly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased YC&#8217;s appeal in the eyes of founders on the continent with local investors clamoring to get their portfolio into the accelerator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike last year where Y Combinator held its Demo Day, both winter and summer in two days, it&#8217;s a single day for this Winter 2021 batch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the accelerator&#8217;s third online demo day, its second all-virtual class and remote pitch session following its decision to go </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remote from the previous batch (Summer 2020)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 319 companies pitched today from 41 countries drawing attention from more than 2,400 investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, only ten African startups pitched and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other batches; most of them are fintechs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other startups offer e-commerce fulfillment, edtech and B2B food marketplace services. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five startups represent Nigeria; three are from Egypt, and one each from the Ivory Coast and Kenya</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here&#8217;s what they are building.</span></p>
<h2><a href="http://dayra.co/">Dayra</a> (Egypt)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the gig workers in Egypt </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are unbanked,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and it&#8217;s difficult for digital platforms to pay them for their services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The traditional method would be to use cash or third-party institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Omar Ekram,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dayra</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is trying to solve this via an API. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its platform, Egyptian businesses can offer financial services including loans to unbanked workers and customers in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.djamo.ci/">Djamo</a> (Ivory Coast)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there has been a huge profusion of financial services that have emerged in recent years in Africa, there&#8217;s still a huge underserved gap in Francophone Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In fact, less than 25% of the population </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is banked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Djamo acts as a challenger bank and offers banking solutions to break into this huge untapped market and help with financial inclusion in the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Hassan Bourgi and Regis Bamba founded the Ivorian startup. </span></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.kidato.co/">Kidato</a> (Kenya)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In African public schools, the student-teacher ratio can be as high as 50:1. This doesn&#8217;t aid effective learning. Other options like private schools can be costly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidato, an edtech startup founded by Sam Gichuru, have classes with student-teacher ratios at 5:1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also offer the same international curriculum as private schools in the country but collect much lower fees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://iflux.app/">Flux</a> (Nigeria)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes days and sometimes weeks to send money from the U.S. to Nigeria and most African countries. There&#8217;s also the problem with expensive fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flux, a Nigerian remittance startup, is using crypto to tackle this. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via an application and from a wallet, people can convert fiat into crypto and send it to the wallets of people in other countries who convert back to fiat if they choose</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup was founded by Ben Eluan, Osezele Orukpe, and Israel Akintunde.</span></p>

<h2><a href="https://nowpay.cash/">NowPay</a> (Egypt)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial stress plays a major role as a top distraction for employees. NowPay, a startup founded by Sabry Abuelenien and Mostafa Ashour, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">bridges that gap and provides several benefits for employers that choose to address this area of employee wellness proactively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company enables corporates to offer salary advances to employees. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also improves savings, spending, budgeting, and borrowing for employees by building products that tackle every vertical</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://mono.co/">Mono</a> (Nigeria)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the proliferation of financial services in Africa, it has become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">extremely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> difficult for banks and fintechs to combine users&#8217; data from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> points and make sense of it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By streamlining various data in a single API, Mono helps companies and third-party developers retrieve vital information like account statements, real-time balance, historical transactions, income, expense, and account owner identification</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Abdul Hassan and Prakhar Singh founded the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2><a href="https://getprospa.com/">Prospa</a> (Nigeria)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. or the U.K, you can set up a business account in minutes but it can take hours and days in Nigeria. And most of this is still executed offline and on paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prospa is a neobank for microbusinesses in Nigeria </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Frederik Obasi and Rodney Jackson-Cole. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps these businesses make international payments to more than 10 countries including China, Kenya, the U.K., and the U.S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.flextock.com/">Flextock</a> (Egypt)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When merchants launch their e-commerce businesses, they can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">easily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> manage the end-to-end operations in the early stages</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But as they begin to grow, managing their own operations can become difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a burden for most businesses in Egypt and Flextock, a startup founded by Mohamed Mossaad and Enas Siam, solves it by providing an end to end fulfilment service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They manage a business inventory, pick, pack and ship orders while providing real-time visibility and insights into their products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<h2><a href="https://sendbox.co/">Sendbox</a> (Nigeria)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some individuals and merchants, shipping can be a painstaking process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To operate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they partner with one or more service providers or build their delivery operations themselves</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sendbox describes itself as a &#8220;fulfillment by Amazon for African merchants.&#8221; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company provides shipping, escrow payments, among other services, to social commerce merchants in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emotu Balogun and Olusegun Afolahan founded the company.</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://vendease.com/">Vendease</a> (Nigeria)</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For small and mid-sized restaurants in Nigeria and most of Africa, food procurement can be a complex process to manage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Tunde Kara, Olumide Fayankin, Gatumi Aliyu, and Wale Oyepeju, Vendease solves this problem by building a marketplace that allows restaurants to buy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from farms and food manufacturers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">QuantumScape has issued a share offering to pay for an expanded pilot production line for its solid-state batteries just months after it became a publicly traded company via a reverse merger.</p>
<p>QuantumScape said in a <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-089693/">regulatory filing</a> that the net proceeds from its sale of 13 million shares — along with an additional 1.95 million shares if underwriters exercise that option — could be much as $859 million based upon an assumed public offering price of $59.34 per share. The offering is expected to be priced after the market closes Wednesday, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/quantumscape-seeks-to-raise-859-million-to-fund-pilot-expansion?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. The funds will be used to build a larger pre-pilot line called QS-0 and cover its part of a joint venture with Volkswagen Group for an expanded manufacturing facility known as QS-1.</p>
<p>Investors haven&#8217;t responded well in the hours following the initial offering, with prices falling more than 13% since launching the share offering. The market&#8217;s response is likely tied to the surprising timing of this share offering. Just six months ago, QuantumScape agreed to merge with a special purpose acquisition company (Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp.). At the time, QuantumScape said it was able to raise more than $700 million through the business combination, a figure that includes $500 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE. The raise was anchored by institutional investors, including Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company and Janus Transaction.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>QuantumScape worked quietly for years to develop solid-state batteries, a next-generation technology that could help unlock longer ranges and faster charging times in electric vehicles. The company attracted attention and capital early on from high-profile venture firms like Kleiner Perkins and Khosla Ventures. Volkswagen entered the picture in 2012. The automaker has invested a total of $300 million in QuantumScape, including $200 million last year. That additional backing was to accelerate that joint development work, Thomas Schmall, chairman of the board of management of Volkswagen Group components, said at the time.</p>
<p>The heart of the VW-QuantumScape relationship is its joint venture, which was announced in 2018, that aims to accelerate the development of solid-state battery technology and then produce them at commercial scale. The companies have publicly disclosed plans to set up a pilot plant for the industrial-level production of the solid-state batteries. QuantumScape announced in September, just four months after that extra $200 million in VW investment, that it had agreed to merge with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp.</p>
<p>QuantumScape announced in 2021 plans to expand its manufacturing capacity by adding a 200,000 square foot pre-pilot line facility in California. This pre-pilot line, called QS-0, will now have more than double the announced capacity, if QuantumScape is successful in its plans. The QS-0 is intended in part to provide the large numbers of additional samples QuantumScape needs for its solid-state battery development and to test and tune the systems and processes it intends to use for mass production, the company said.</p>

<p>The pre-pilot line will also be used to produce enough prototype cells for Volkswagen and other automotive OEMs as well as prospective customers in other industries. QuantumScape said it expects to secure a long-term lease for QS-0 in the second half of this year and to be producing prototype cells in 2023.</p>
<p>QuantumScape has plans to also build a 21 GWh battery production line through its joint venture with Volkswagen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proceeds of this offering are intended to provide sufficient funding to build the larger version of QS-0, to fund QS-0 operating expenses, to fund our share of the equity portion of the joint venture&#8217;s costs of building the QS-1 Expansion, net of debt intended to be incurred by the joint venture, and for working capital and general corporate purposes,&#8221; the company said in the filing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.K. challenger stockbroker <a href="https://freetrade.io">Freetrade</a> has raised a $69 million Series B round led by Left Lane Capital. The growth fund of L Catterton and existing investor Draper Esprit also participated. Freetrade operates a stock trading app and has managed to attract 600,000 users in the U.K. — they generated £1 billion in quarterly trade volume.</p>
<p>Freetrade has reached a post-money valuation of $366 million following today’s funding round. In December 2020, the company generated $1.4 million in revenue.</p>
<p>After signing up, Freetrade lets you buy and sell shares from the company’s mobile app. If you want to invest in companies with expensive shares, such as Alphabet (Google’s parent company), you can buy fractional shares. Instead of spending over $2,000 for a single share, you can buy one-tenth of a share for one-tenth of the price.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Freetrade lets you access U.S. and U.K. stocks as well as ETFs. Like Robinhood in the U.S., the company doesn’t charge any trading commission for basic orders —&nbsp;there’s a 0.45% foreign exchange fee on transactions in foreign currencies. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html">Unlike Robinhood</a>, the company doesn’t want to push you toward day trading.</p>
<p>In addition to free general investment accounts, Freetrade offers <a href="https://freetrade.io/isa">individual savings accounts</a> (ISA). It’s a type of account specific to the U.K. that encourages long-term investments as tax on capital gains goes down over time. Freetrade charges £3 per month to open an ISA.</p>
<p>The company also offers <a href="https://freetrade.io/sipp">pension savings accounts</a> (SIPP). You get tax relief on contributions. If you live in the U.K., you’re probably familiar with SIPP. Those accounts cost £9.99 per month.</p>
<p>Finally, Freetrade has a premium plan for its most engaged users. You can pay £9.99 for Freetrade Plus. After that, you get 3% interest on cash up to £4,000, more stocks and more order types (limit and stop loss orders). You also get a free ISA and a discount on your SIPP.</p>
<p>As you can see, Freetrade is betting heavily on subscription revenue combined with a freemium approach. People who just want to buy a few shares probably stick with free accounts. But people who want to convert part of their savings into stocks and ETFs will likely end up subscribing to a tax-efficient account or a Freetrade Plus subscription.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to expand its product beyond its home country. You can expect some European expansion moves in the future.</p>
<p>For instance, Freetrade plans to launch in France with 5,000 stocks and ETFs from major European, U.K. and U.S. exchanges. Freetrade will support PEA, France’s equivalent of ISA, for €3 per month. And users will be able to subscribe to Freetrade Plus for €9.99 per month.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s going to be a very similar product in France and in the U.K. While there’s no dominant stock trading app in France, German startup Trade Republic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/stock-trading-app-trade-republic-expands-to-france/">recently launched</a> its app on the French market. It’s going to be interesting to see how these two startups grow outside of their home countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Researchers say a botnet targeting Windows devices is rapidly growing in size, thanks to a new infection technique that allows the malware to spread from computer to computer.</p>
<p>The Purple Fox malware was <a href="https://blog.360totalsecurity.com/en/purple-fox-trojan-burst-out-globally-and-infected-more-than-30000-users/">first spotted in 2018</a> spreading through phishing emails and exploit kits, a way for threat groups to infect machines using existing security flaws.</p>
<p>But researchers Amit Serper and Ophir Harpaz at security firm Guardicore, which discovered and revealed the new infection effort in <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/labs/purple-fox-rootkit-now-propagates-as-a-worm/">a new blog post</a>, say the malware now targets internet-facing Windows computers with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/05/california-passes-law-that-bans-default-passwords-in-connected-devices/">weak passwords</a>, giving the malware a foothold to spread more rapidly.</p>
<p>The malware does this by trying to guess weak Windows user account passwords by targeting the server message block, or SMB — a component that lets Windows talk with other devices, like printers and file servers. Once the malware gains access to a vulnerable computer, it pulls a malicious payload from a network of close to 2,000 older and compromised Windows web servers and quietly installs a rootkit, keeping the malware persistently anchored to the computer while also making it much harder to be detected or removed.</p>
<p>Once infected, the malware then closes the ports in the firewall it used to infect the computer to begin with, likely to prevent reinfection or other threat groups hijacking the already-hacked computer, the researchers said.</p>
<p>The malware then generates a list of internet addresses and scans the internet for vulnerable devices with weak passwords to infect further, creating a growing network of ensnared devices.</p>
<p>Botnets are formed when hundreds or thousands of hacked devices are enlisted into a network run by criminal operators, which are often then used to launch denial-of-network attacks to pummel organizations with junk traffic with the aim of knocking them offline. But with control of these devices, criminal operators can also use botnets to spread malware and spam, or to deploy file-encrypting ransomware on the infected computers.</p>
<p>But this kind of wormable botnet presents a greater risk as it spreads largely on its own.</p>
<p>Serper, Guardicore&#8217;s vice president of security research for North America, said the wormable infection technique is &#8220;cheaper&#8221; to run than its earlier phishing and exploit kit effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that it&#8217;s an opportunistic attack that constantly scans the internet and looks for more vulnerable machines means that the attackers can sort of &#8216;set it and forget it&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It appears to be working. Purple Fox infections have rocketed by 600% since May 2020, according to data from Guardicore&#8217;s own network of internet sensors. The actual number of infections is likely to be far higher, amounting to more than 90,000 infections in the past year.</p>
<p>Guardicore published indicators of compromise to <a href="https://github.com/guardicore/labs_campaigns/tree/master/Purple_Fox">help networks</a> identify if they have been infected. The researchers do not know what the botnet will be used for but warned that its growing size presents a risk to organizations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We assume that this is laying the groundwork for something in the future,&#8221; said Serper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese automaker Geely Automobile Holdings is launching a new brand of premium electric vehicles as it aims to capture a share of the luxury EV market that has been dominated by Tesla and other homegrown companies.</p>
<p>The new brand of vehicles, called Zeekr, will be manufactured by parent company Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. The first Zeekr vehicles are expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The launch of Zeekr, which was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-geely-electric-exclusive/exclusive-targeting-tesla-chinas-geely-to-launch-new-premium-ev-brand-sources-idUSKBN2BB054">first reported by Reuters</a> and confirmed today by Geely, has been couched as a bid to take on Tesla in China. Tesla has had success in the country, reporting in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm">a recent regulatory filing</a> that sales in China more than doubled last year, from $2.9 billion in 2019 to $6.6 billion in 2020. But Tesla is hardly the only competition in China, the world’s largest market for electric vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zeekr will have to jostle with domestic start-ups Li Auto and NIO that also offer luxury car models. While Geely remained the highest-selling Chinese auto brand by units sold in 2020 – its fourth consecutive year in the top spot – net profits dropped 32% last year, according to financial results posted Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Zeekr marque will be manufactured by Geely Holding using its Sustainable Experience Architecture, an open-source EV technology that the company said offers driving ranges of up to 435 miles (700 km) as well as smart connectivity options. Geely has plans to deploy the architecture across its nine automotive brands (the company is a minority shareholder of Daimler AG and owner of Volvo Cars) – and sell to other manufacturers.</p>
<p>Eric Li, founder of Geely Holding, said in a statement that the company intends to make the architecture accessible to other car makers.</p>
<p>The SEA platform is just one piece of Geely’s plans to position itself as a leading source of electric vehicle manufacturing and technology. Last month, Geely and Volvo Cars announced they had axed plans to merge but will instead set up a standalone company that will develop next-gen hardware and software for electric vehicles across its brands and with other manufacturers. The two companies will also jointly source batteries and electric motors under the new collaboration.</p>
<p>Geely Holding is also setting the stage to take on a larger role in manufacturing for other car companies, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/foxconn-geely-team-up-to-build-electric-autonomous-and-shared-vehicles-for-automakers-startups/">plans for a joint venture</a> with Chinese company Foxconn Technology Group – Apple’s main supplier – aimed at contract manufacturing for automakers. Geely said it would partner with Chinese tech giant Baidu in a separate venture to build EVs, also with its SEA platform. Baidu has been developing intelligent driving technologies, including autonomous driving, which it said it would contribute to the new company.</p>
<p>Zeekr will be jointly owned by the subsidiary and its parent with a 51% and 49% share structure, with a joint investment of 2 billion yuan ($307 million).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soft robotics have long been one of the more exciting categories among emerging technologies. Of course, as with most new tech, the field has some drawbacks over more traditional models. While they improve flexibility and complains over their more rigid counterparts, robots made of soft materials have often had an issue delivering electrical connectivity. In many cases, water and air-filled bladders are used to helped facilitate movement.</p>
<p><a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2021/03/11-touch-of-silver.html">New research</a> out of Carnegie Mellon University points to a method that could help increase conductivity in soft materials like hydrogels, without compromising the compliance at the core of the material’s appeal.</p>
<p>Recently <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/9/eabd3440">highlighted in a science journal</a>, the method essentially adds micrometer-sized silver flakes into the mix through a method similar to screen printing. When the material is partially dehydrated, the flakes begin forming connections that can be used to deliver a charge. The team describes the flakes as akin to, “a second layer of nervous tissue over your skin.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2129036" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/0311-em-touch-of-silver-01.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p>“With its high electrical conductivity and high compliance or ‘squishiness,’ this new composite can have many applications in bioelectronics and beyond,” mechanical engineer professor Carmel Majidi said in a release tied to the news. “Examples include a sticker for the brain that has sensors for signal processing, a wearable energy generation device to power electronics, and stretchable displays.”</p>
<p>There are a ton of potential uses for soft robotics, but medical remains one of the most compelling. Treatment of motor disabilities and muscular disorders are among those highlighted by the team, including assistance for stroke patients and people suffering from Parkinson’s-related tremor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well before the rumors, we knew this day was coming. After several generations of smartwatches and a handful of headphones, the smartwatch was the next logical step for OnePlus.</p>
<p>At today’s big launch event, the company made its first major wearable official, sporting the decidedly pared-down name, OnePlus Watch. As the title implies, the smartwatch is not a particularly flashy one. It has a minimalist design and, at $159, a price to match.</p>
<p>What’s perhaps most interesting here is the operating system. The Watch will be running the equally straightforwardly named OnePlus Watch OS. Google’s Wear OS was obviously the low-hanging fruit here. And then, after that, Tizen, which Samsung has used for several generations of Galaxy Watches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, the company opted to build its own operating system on top of RTOS (real-time operating system). CEO Pete Lau addressed the subject not long ago in a OnePlus forum, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>We chose to go with a smart wear operating system developed based on RTOS because we believe it provides you a smooth and reliable experience while offering a great battery life, covering some of the biggest concerns we&#8217;ve been hearing from people looking to buy a smartwatch.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2128693" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128693" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2128693 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1046" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png 11747w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=147,150 147w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=294,300 294w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=768,785 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=666,680 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=1504,1536 1504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=2005,2048 2005w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OnePlus</p></div></p>
<p>The battery aspect certainly rings true. That continues to be one of the largest hang-ups for smartwatches, particularly as companies continue to add features. According to the press materials, the 402 mAh battery gives the Watch anywhere between one to two weeks of life on a charge, which is a pretty impressive claim (we have yet to get our hands on a review unit to test this out). That would put it on par with many fitness bands.</p>
<p>There are a slew of sensors on board, measuring different health metrics, including heart rate and blood oxygen, accessible through OnePlus’s Health app. There’s 4GB of storage, half of which can be used for things like music. The Watch is rated IP68 waterproof.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard configuration, the company is also introducing a Cobalt model, which swaps the stainless steel body for a strong cobalt alloy, coupled with scratch-resistant sapphire glass.</p>
<p>The wearable will go on sale in North America on April 14.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cameras have long been the battleground on which the smartphone wars have been fought. Short of any left-field innovation like folding screens or strange form factors, that looks likely to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. Year after year and generation after generation, companies tout imaging breakthroughs to set themselves apart.</p>
<p>It makes sense. Smartphones have improved to a point where flagship devices are, as a rule, pretty good. And while cameras have been a part of those improvements, there’s still a lot of room for improvement, both in terms of hardware and the software/AI that augments it. Recently, OnePlus announced that it would be recruiting a big name to help it in that fight.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AXf85mNO8o"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/oneplus-recruits-hasselblad-for-three-year-smartphone-imaging-deal/">OnePlus recruits Hasselblad for 3-year smartphone imaging deal</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnePlus recruits Hasselblad for 3-year smartphone imaging deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/oneplus-recruits-hasselblad-for-three-year-smartphone-imaging-deal/embed/#?secret=AXf85mNO8o" data-secret="AXf85mNO8o" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Earlier this month, the Chinese smartphone maker unveiled a three-year deal with Hasselblad, one of the most iconic names in the photography space. Announced at an event today, the company’s new OnePlus 9 series will be the first handset to sport the early fruits of the $150 million deal.</p>
<p>The deal makes sense from a strategic standpoint. After all, OnePlus’s transformation from a high-end budget device to flagship competitor has put companies like Apple and Samsung in its sights. Both of those companies have established and long-standing imaging departments for their hardware, so in addition to a clear branding partnership, this does seem to be an earnest attempt to level the playing field.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128614" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128614" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128614" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128614" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It’s worth noting, up top, that the days of being the budget alternative are, to a degree, gone. The OnePlus 9 starts at $729 and the Pro starts at $969. As smartphone pricing goes, that’s toward the lower-end of premium devices, but after the introduction of the Nord, it seems safe to say that budget will no longer be a primary differentiator for OnePlus’s primary line.</p>
<p>Naturally, the OnePlus 9 Pro gets the most benefit from these early stages of the Hasselblad deal. The primary camera sports a 48-megapixel Sony sensor, coupled with improved focus speeds and increased color accuracy. The ultrawide camera has a 50-megapixel sensor (also Sony), with a lens designed to reduce distortion. Interestingly, the company says it’s also effective for shooting close macro shots with distances as close as 4cm.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Apple&#8217;s spectacular iPhone 12 sales figures boost the smartphone industry in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/will-apples-spectacular-iphone-12-sales-figures-boost-the-smartphone-industry-in-2021/embed/#?secret=xp9UMqdEbx" data-secret="xp9UMqdEbx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The third primary camera is an eight-megapixel telephoto capable of up to 30x digital zoom (though you’re going to lose a fair bit of information). There’s a fourth monochrome camera, as well, which primarily serves to help improve black and white shots. The standard OnePlus 9 has a similar setup, though you’ll drop that telephoto lens.</p>
<p>Here’s OnePlus on what Hasselblad is bringing to the table this time out:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new Hasselblad Pro Mode offers incredibly accurate and natural color for a solid foundation for post-editing. It has been revamped with a new user interface based on Hasselblad’s image processing software to give professional-level users a unique Hasselblad look and feel. It also allows for an unprecedented amount of control for expert photographers to fine-tune their photos, with the ability to adjust ISO, focus, exposure time, white balance and more. Users can also shoot in 12- bit RAW format for 64-times the color compared with 10-bit RAW traditionally found in other smartphones.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2128612" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128612" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128612" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9032.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128612" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Keep in mind, the partnership is still in its early stages, and much of the money is going toward R&amp;D, so we’ll probably be seeing more integration down the road.</p>
<p>The display is the same as the one found in the OnePlus 8T. That’s a 6.55-inch AMOLED with a 120Hz refresh rate. Brightness maxes out at 1,100 nits, and the screen sports HDR10+ certification. There’s a Snapdragon 888 inside, coupled with 8 or 12GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage. Both models feature a solid 4,500 mAh battery that goes from empty to 100% charge in 29 minutes.</p>
<p>Pre-orders start March 26. The handsets will ship April 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to fast-moving technology, mobility zooms ahead of the pack — both literally and figuratively.

					<description><![CDATA[There's a lot of news this morning, so let's discuss all the big dollars before YC demo day kicks off.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s demo day for the current Y Combinator class, so we&#8217;ll have a largely early-stage focus at TechCrunch today. But there&#8217;s also a host of late- and super-late-stage news this morning that matters.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get to all of it before we start to talk accelerators, overheated pre-seed valuations and the like.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>There are three things to discuss. First, the possible $10 billion exit of Discord to Microsoft. Discord is a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/discord/company_financials">well-financed unicorn</a> that has raised oodles of capital and reportedly sports rapidly expanding revenues. Our goal will be to vet whether the price tag in question makes any sense, or if it is too low.</p>
<p>Second: Real estate tech company Compass has set an IPO price range we need to explore. Is its resulting valuation strong? Does it line up with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/compass-files-for-ipo/">recent financial performance</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>And, third, Intermedia Cloud Communications has priced its IPO. We&#8217;re behind on this entire debut, so we&#8217;ll take a second to riff on what the company does and what it is worth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot. But if we don&#8217;t get through it all now, we&#8217;ll fall behind and feel silly later. Let&#8217;s get to work!</p>
<h2>Discord and Microsoft</h2>
<p>Microsoft might be getting good at community, which is an odd thing to say about the enterprise software and cloud computing giant. The company&#8217;s Xbox gaming ecosystem has survived the test of time, Github is doing fine under Microsoft&#8217;s auspices, and Minecraft seems unharmed by Redmond&#8217;s stewardship.</p>
<p>That means gamers, developers and kids are all content to hang with Satya Nadella and company. Adding Discord to the mix might give Microsoft even more tooling to augment its existing communities, or perhaps tie them more closely together. But that&#8217;s all product news, which isn&#8217;t our remit. Let&#8217;s talk numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/technology/microsoft-discord-deal.html">The New York Times</a> reported that Discord has &#8220;held deal talks with Microsoft for a transaction that could top $10 billion.&#8221; That figure has been widely reported, so we&#8217;ll use it for our work.</p>
<p>With a possible valuation in hand, we need revenue numbers to figure out if the possible sale price makes any sense. Happily, we have somewhat fresh numbers: The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-without-ads-discord-defies-convention-11615199401">Wall Street Journal reported</a> earlier this month that Discord &#8220;generated $130 million in revenue [in 2020], up from nearly $45 million in 2019.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://onetrust.com/">OneTrust</a>, a late stage privacy platform startup, announced it was adding ethics and compliance to the mix this morning by acquiring Convercent, a company that was built to help build more ethical organizations. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>OneTrust <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/onetrust-nabs-300m-series-c-on-5-1b-valuation-to-expand-privacy-platform/">just raised $300 million</a> on a fat $5.1 billion valuation at the end of last year, and it&#8217;s putting that money to work with this acquisition. Alan Dabbiere, co-chairman at OneTrust sees this acquisition as a way to add a missing component to his company&#8217;s growing platform of services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Integrating Convercent instantly brings a proven ethics and compliance technology, team, and customer base into the OneTrust, further aligning the Chief Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer strategy alongside privacy, data governance, third-party risk, GRC (governance, risk and compliance), and ESG (environmental, social and governance) to build trust as a competitive advantage,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Convercent brings 750 customers and 150 employees to the OneTrust team along with its ethics system, which includes a way for employees to report ethical violations to the company and a tool for managing disclosures.</p>

<p>Convercent can also use data to help surface bad behavior before it&#8217;s been reported. As CEO Patrick Quinlan explained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/converscent-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-companies-to-measure-ethical-behavior/">in a 2018 TechCrunch article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sometimes you have this interactive code of conduct, where there’s a new vice president in a region and suddenly page views on the sexual harassment section of the Code of Conduct have increased 200% in the 90 days after he started. That’s easy, right? There’s a reason that’s happening, and our system will actually tell you what’s happening.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Quinlan wrote <a href="https://www.convercent.com/blog/next-stop-trust-onetrust">in a company blog post</a> announcing the deal that joining forces with OneTrust will give it the resources to expand its vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a part of OneTrust, we’ll be combining forces with the leader across privacy, security, data governance, third-party risk, GRC, ESG—and now—ethics and compliance. Our customers will now be able to build centralized programs across these workstreams to make trust a competitive differentiator,&#8221; Quinlan wrote.</p>
<p>Convercent was founded in 2012 and has raised over $100 million, according to Pitchbook data. OneTrust was founded in 2016. It has over 8000 customers and 150 employees and has raised $710 million, according to the company.</p>
