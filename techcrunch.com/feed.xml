										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We are hearing that a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-95-effective-in-final-clinical-trial-results-analysis/">COVID-19 vaccine could be on the way</a> sooner than later, and that means we could be returning to normal life some time in 2021. That&#8217;s the good news. The perplexing news, however, is that each time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/moderna-reports-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-94-5-effective-in-first-data-from-phase-3-trial/">some positive news</a> emerges about a vaccine &#8212; and believe me I&#8217;m not complaining &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/31/is-wall-street-losing-its-tech-enthusiasm/">Wall Street punishes stocks</a> it thinks benefits from us being stuck at home. That would be companies like Zoom and Peloton.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m not here to give investment advice, I&#8217;m confident that these companies are going to be fine even after we return to the office. While we surely pine for human contact, office brainstorming, going out to lunch with colleagues and just meeting and collaborating in the same space, it doesn&#8217;t mean we will simply return to life as it was before the pandemic and spend five days a week in the office.</p>
<p>One thing is clear in my discussions with startups born or growing up during the pandemic: They have learned to operate, hire and sell remotely, and many say they will continue to be remote-first when the pandemic is over. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/tech/work-from-home-companies/index.html">Established larger public companies</a> like Dropbox, Facebook, Twitter, Shopify and others have announced they will continue to offer a remote-work option going forward. There are many other such examples.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/08/what-weve-learned-about-working-from-home-7-months-into-the-pandemic/">we learned many lessons</a> about working from home over this year, and we will carry them with us whenever we return to school and the office &#8212; and some percentage of us will continue to work from home at least some of the time, while a fair number of businesses could become remote-first.</p>
<h2>Wall Street reactions</h2>
<p>On November 9, news that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-95-effective-in-final-clinical-trial-results-analysis/">the Pfizer vaccine was at least 90% effective</a> threw the markets for a loop. The summer trade, in which investors moved capital from traditional, non-tech industries and pushed it into software shares, flipped; suddenly the stocks that had been riding a pandemic wave were losing ground while old-fashioned, even stodgy, companies shot higher.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK is moving ahead with a plan to regulate big tech, responding to competition concerns over a &#8216;winner takes all&#8217; dynamic in digital markets.</p>
<p>It will set up a new Digital Market Unit (DMU) to oversee a &#8220;pro-competition&#8221; regime for Internet platforms &#8212; including those funded by online advertising, such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> &#8212; the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) announced today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s moving at a clip &#8212; with the new Unit slated to begin work in April. Although the necessary law to empower the new regulator to make interventions will take longer. The government said it will consult on the Unit&#8217;s form and function in early 2021 &#8212; and legislate &#8220;as soon as parliamentary time allows&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A core part of the plan is a new statutory Code of Conduct aimed at giving platform users more choice and third party businesses more power over the intermediaries that host and monetize them.</p>
<p>The government suggests the code could require tech giants to allow users to opt out of behavioral advertising entirely &#8212; something Facebook&#8217;s platform, for example, does not currently allow.</p>
<p>It also wants the code to support the sustainability of the news industry by &#8220;rebalancing&#8221; the relationship between publishers and platform giants, as it puts it.</p>
<p>Concern over how to support quality public interest journalism in an era of ad-funded user-generated-content giants has been stepping up in recent years as online disinformation has been actively weaponized to attack democracies and try to influence votes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new code will set clear expectations for platforms that have considerable <span class="il">market</span> power &#8212; known as strategic <span class="il">market</span> status &#8212; over what represents acceptable behaviour when interacting with competitors and users,&#8221; DCMS writes in a press release.</p>
<p>It suggests the DMU will have powers to &#8220;suspend, block and reverse decisions of tech giants, order them to take certain actions to achieve compliance with the code, and impose financial penalties for non-compliance&#8221;. Although full details are set to be worked out next year.</p>
<p>AÂ <span class="il">Digital</span> <span class="il">Markets</span> Taskforce, which the government set up earlier this year to advise on the design of the competition measures, will inform the Unit&#8217;s work, including how the regime will work in practice, per DCMS.</p>
<p>The taskforce will also come up with the methodology that&#8217;s used to determine which platforms/companies should be designated as having strategic <span class="il">market</span> status.</p>
<p>On that front it&#8217;s all but certain Facebook and Google will gain the designation, and be subject to the code and oversight by the DMU, although confirmation can only come from the Unit itself once it&#8217;s up and running. But UK policymakers don&#8217;t appear to have been fooled by bogus big tech talking points of competition being &#8216;only a click away&#8217;.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Competition policy must change to help startups fight &#8216;winner takes all&#8217; platforms, says UK report&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/competition-policy-must-change-to-help-startups-fight-winner-takes-all-platforms-says-uk-report/embed/#?secret=ORvf3RgMUo" data-secret="ORvf3RgMUo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The move to set up a UK regulator for big tech&#8217;s market power follows a competition market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/competition-policy-must-change-to-help-startups-fight-winner-takes-all-platforms-says-uk-report/">review</a> chaired by former U.S. president Barack Obamaâs chief economic advisor, professor Jason Furman, which reported last year. The expert panelÂ recommended existing competition policy <em>was</em> fit for purpose but that new tools were needed for it to tackle market challenges flowing from platform power and online network effects.</p>
<p>Crucially, the Furman report advocated for a &#8216;broad church&#8217; interpretation of consumer welfare as the driver of competition interventions &#8212; encompassing factors such as choice, quality and innovation, not just price.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s key given big tech&#8217;s strategic application of free-at-the-point-of-use services as a tool for dominating markets by gaining massive marketshare which in turn gives it the power to set self-serving usage conditions for consumers and anti-competitive rules for third party businesses &#8212; enabling it to entrench its hold on the digital attention sphere.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) also undertook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/uks-cma-launches-investigation-into-digital-advertising-and-its-potential-harm-to-consumers/">a market study of the digital advertising sector</a> &#8212; going on to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">report</a> substantial concerns over the power of the adtech duopoly. Although in its final report it deferred competitive intervention in favor of waiting for the government to legislate.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK asks competition watchdog to put adtech market review top of its to-do list&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/14/uk-asks-competition-watchdog-to-put-adtech-market-review-top-of-its-to-do-list/embed/#?secret=LKmquQ0zBF" data-secret="LKmquQ0zBF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Commenting on the announcement of the DMU in a statement, digital secretary Oliver Dowden said: âIâm unashamedly pro-tech and the services of <span class="il">digital</span> platforms are positively transforming the economy &#8211; bringing huge benefits to businesses, consumers and society. But there is growing consensus in the UK and abroad that the concentration of power among a small number of tech companies is curtailing growth of the sector, reducing innovation and having negative impacts on the people and businesses that rely on them. It&#8217;s time to address that and unleash a new age of tech growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Business secretary Alok Sharma added: âT<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he dominance of just a few big tech companies is leading to less innovation, higher advertising prices and less choice and control for consumers.Â </span>Our new, pro-competition regime for <span class="il">digital</span> <span class="il">markets</span> will ensure consumers have choice, and mean smaller firms arenât pushed out.â</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s move to regulate big tech means there&#8217;s now broad consensus among European lawmakers that platform power must be curtailed &#8212; and that competition rules need properly resourcing to get the job done.</p>
<p>A similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/europe-to-limit-how-big-tech-can-push-its-own-services-and-use-third-party-data/">digital market regime</a> is due to be presented by EU lawmakers next month.</p>
<p>The European Commission has said the forthcoming ex ante pan-EU regulation &#8212; which it&#8217;s calling the Digital Markets Act &#8212; will identify platforms which hold significant market power, so-called Internet gatekeepers, and apply a specific set of fairness and transparency rules and obligations on them with the aim of rebalancing competition. Plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/big-techs-blackbox-algorithms-face-regulatory-oversight-under-eu-plan/">open algorithmic blackboxes to regulatory oversight</a> is also on the cards at the EU level.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe to limit how big tech can push its own services and use third-party data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/europe-to-limit-how-big-tech-can-push-its-own-services-and-use-third-party-data/embed/#?secret=ipZzDsRcY6" data-secret="ipZzDsRcY6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A second piece of proposed EU legislation, the Digital Services Act, is set to update rules for online businesses by setting clear rules and responsibilities on all players in specific areas such as hate speech and illegal content.</p>
<p>The UK is also working on a similar online safety-focused regime &#8212; proposing to regulate a range of harms in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">Online Harms</a> white paper last year. Though it has yet to come forward with draft legislation.</p>
<p>This summer the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53222665">BBC</a> reported that the government has not committed to introduce a draft bill next year either &#8212; suggesting its planned wider Internet regulation regime may not be in place until 2023 or 2024.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="E5uFQEymgg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">UK sets out safety-focused plan to regulate internet firms</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It looks savvy for UK lawmakers to prioritize going after platform power since many of the problems that flow from harmful Internet content are attached to the reach and amplification of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/facebook-wont-ban-political-ads-prefers-to-keep-screwing-democracy/">handful of tech giants</a>.</p>
<p>A more competitive landscape for social media could encourage competition around the quality of the community experienced for users &#8212; meaning that, for example, smaller platforms which properly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/22/watch-sacha-baron-cohen-skewer-zuckerbergs-twisted-logic-on-hate-speech-and-fakes/">enforce hate speech rules</a> and don&#8217;t <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/">torch user privacy</a> could gain an edge.</p>
<p>Although rules to enable data portability and/or interoperability are likely to be crucial to kindling truly vibrant and innovative competition in markets that have already been captured by a handful of data-mining adtech giants.</p>
<p>Given the UK&#8217;s rush to address the market power of big tech, it&#8217;s interesting to recall how many times the Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg snubbed the DCMS committee&#8217;s calls for him to give evidence over online disinformation and digital campaigning (including related to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/cambridge-analytica-sought-to-use-facebook-data-to-predict-partisanship-for-voter-targeting-uk-investigation-confirms/">Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal</a>) &#8212; not once but so many times we lost count.</p>
<p>It seems UK lawmakers kept a careful note of that.</p>

Companies from Alibaba to Huawei are striving to become relevant in the trillion-dollar auto industry, which itself is seeking an electric transition and intelligent upgrade as 5G comes of age.</p>
<p>State-owned automaker SAIC Motor, a major player in China, <a href="https://www.saicmotor.com/chinese/images/tzzgx/ggb/lsgg/2020nlsgg/2020/11/26/054391848471421FBE34F06ECF000991.pdf">unveiled</a> this week a new electric vehicle arm called Zhiji, in which Alibaba and a Shanghai government-backed entity are minority shareholders. The tie-up comes as Chinese EV startups like Xpeng and Nio and their predecessor Tesla see their stocks soaring in recent months.</p>

<p>Alibaba&#8217;s ties with SAIC can be traced back to 2015 when they<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saic-motor-alibaba-group/chinas-saic-motor-alibaba-to-invest-160-million-in-internet-connected-cars-idUSKBN0M80S920150312"> jointly announced</a> a $160 million investment in internet-connected cars. The partners moved on to form a <a href="https://www.ebanma.com/">joint venture called Banma</a> (or &#8216;Zebra&#8217;) and Alibaba has since developed a slew of auto solutions for the Banma platform to enable everything from voice-activated navigation to voice ordering coffee, which is, of course, linked to the Alipay e-wallet.</p>
<p>Alibaba is certainly not SAIC&#8217;s exclusive supplier, as it&#8217;s also worked closely with the likes of <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201026005438/en/BMW-and-Alibaba-Sign-a-MoU-for-Strategic-Partnership-Promoting-Digital-Transformation-Across-Businesses">BMW</a> and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190610005833/en/Alibaba-A.-I.-Labs-Partners-with-Audi-Renault-and-Honda-for-Intelligent-In-car-Experience">Audi</a> as well over the years.</p>
<p>For SAIC&#8217;s new EV brand, Alibaba will continue to be its &#8220;technology solution provider,&#8221; an Alibaba spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The other tech giant making big moves in auto is Huawei. Just this week, the telecoms equipment and smartphone maker <a href="http://xinsheng.huawei.com/cn/index.php?app=forum&amp;mod=Detail&amp;act=index&amp;id=5145121">announced</a> it would fold its smart car unit into its consumer business group, which previously focused on handsets. The expanded group will continue to be steered by Richard Yu, regarded as the man who helped grow Huawei from an underdog in the mobile industry to a leading global player.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s ambition in auto is &#8220;not to manufacture cars but to focus on developing ICT [information and communications technology] to assist automakers in producing cars,&#8221; the firm asserts in the statement, addressing rumors that it wants to encroach on traditional carmakers&#8217; turf.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s phone business has taken a hit since U.S. sanctions hobbled its supply chain. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/">sold its budget phone brand Honor</a> recently in the hope that the spinoff, independent from Huawei, will be free from trade curbs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Black Friday approaches! In a year where asking Alexa what day today is feels totally normal, this Black Friday seems like it came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>As we say pretty much every year, a lot of Black Friday deals are&#8230; not that good. While there are certainly deals to be found, there&#8217;s also a lot of hand-waving going on to help retailers and manufacturers clear out the old models and get that Q4 numbers boost.</p>
<p>It can also be a day where it&#8217;s <em>way</em> too easy to buy junk just because it&#8217;s got a 40% off tag on it. With that in mind, we&#8217;ve tried to limit this list to the stuff we&#8217;d recommend even when it&#8217;s <em>not</em> on sale. If we see anything else worthwhile over the next day or two, we&#8217;ll add it â so feel free to check back in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><strong>A few tips to keep in mind today:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you see something is on sale and want to check if the &#8220;sale&#8221; price is really any better than normal, pop it into a price tracker like <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com">camelcamelcamel</a>. If the price suddenly increased last week only to be &#8220;reduced&#8221; by whatever percent this week, you know somethings up.</li>
<li>Be at least a little wary of TV deals. There are TV deals to be had, for sure â but the most eye-popping deals tend to be surplus panels with a new model number slapped on them. Google the model number; if that specific TV seems to <em>only</em> exist for the sake of Black Friday, think twice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apple</h2>

<p>Once unheard of, Apple deals on Black Friday are now a little easier to find. They tend to go <em>fast</em> though!</p>
<ul>
<li>Both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07ZPC9QD4&amp;linkId=4a672239f97f8e652ea161233e55d2ba">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-Pro/520468661">Walmart</a> are selling AirPods Pro for $170 â a super steep discount from the usual $250. The stock seems to be coming and going fast, so this one might be tough to get.</li>
<li>The 40mm, GPS version of the latest Apple Watch (Series 6) is down to $379 from $399 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J5QC43Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08J5QC43Q&amp;linkId=bfe95b4f4f9a27deb75fc5ff7a675230">on Amazon right now</a>. While that&#8217;s only a drop of $20, these things only just hit the shelves <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/this-is-the-apple-watch-series-6/">back in September.</a></li>
<li>Best Buy has some pretty solid deals on the latest (8th gen) iPads, like a 10.2&#8243; 32GB model <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-10-2-inch-ipad-latest-model-with-wi-fi-32gb-space-gray/5199701.p?skuId=5199701">for $280</a> (usually $330), or the 128GB model <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-10-2-inch-ipad-latest-model-with-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/5200100.p?skuId=5200100">for $360</a> (usually $430.)</li>

<p>With people already flocking to Amazon on Black Friday, the company usually offers some pretty massive discounts on its Amazon-branded devices as a means of seizing the moment and getting more people into their ecosystem. Sure enough:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon&#8217;s Fire HD 10 tablet is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KD6BTCZ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07KD6BTCZ&amp;linkId=cb0ca1fb90b81ac3adb4f552b9640bf7">down to $80</a>, normally $150</li>

</ul>
<h2>Google</h2>

<p>Google tends to go pretty big with the Black Friday discounts, and this year is no exception. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The<a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_hello_doorbell"> Nest Hello doorbell</a> is down to $179, normally $229.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/google_nest_hub">Nest Hub</a> is down to $50 (normally $90), and its bigger brother the <a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/google_nest_hub_max">Nest Hub Max</a>Â (pictured above) is down to $179 (normally $229.)</li>
<li>The latest generation of the <a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/google_nest_mini">Nest Mini smart speaker</a> is $19, down from $50. The beefier <a href="https://store.google.com/config/nest_audio">Nest Audio</a> speaker, meanwhile, is down to $85 each (usually $99) with the catch that you&#8217;ve got to buy two.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/stadia_premiere_edition">Stadia Premiere Edition </a>â effectively a starter kit for Google&#8217;s gaming-in-the-cloud service Stadia, including both a Stadia controller and a Chromecast Ultra â is down to $70 from $100. The controller alone would normally cost you $70, so if you were already considering giving Stadia a spin it&#8217;s sort of like getting a free Chromecast Ultra?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Roku</h2>

<p>Roku&#8217;s new Streambar â basically a Roku box and a soundbar crammed into one package â is <a href="https://www.roku.com/products/audio/roku-streambar">going for $100 today</a>, down from its normal price of $130.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re going to expand your Sonos system (which, hey, is sort of the point of having a Sonos system), Black Friday is usually a good day to do it. Alas, this years Sonos sales are a bit limited, but there are still savings to be found. Amazon has the portable Sonos Move <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089DPZR96/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B089DPZR96&amp;linkId=4c5812b56e3620ce7812012ddd6595ef">down to $299</a> (normally $399) and the Sonos SUB <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087CCZH4Q/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B087CCZH4Q&amp;linkId=145fddde934b600ce94a990091c80d09">down to $599</a> (usually $699), while Sonos itself is also selling its <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/promotional-offers">Beam Playbar for $299</a> (usually $399.)</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t mind ads, Hulu is slashing the price of its ad-supported plan from $6 a month to $2 a month for 1 year. Sadly, no deal for the ad-free plan, which is still at its normal $12 a month â but if you were planning on checking out the ad-supported plan anyway, you might as well save a couple bucks.</p>

<p>You probably won&#8217;t be finding any deals on this year&#8217;s new Xboxes or Playstations because&#8230; well, they <em>already</em> couldn&#8217;t keep up with demand. This year&#8217;s best deals are going to be on games, services, and in a few cases, accessories.</p>
<p>Hell, the same goes for the Nintendo Switch. Even without a new hardware release this season, Nintendo&#8217;s console is <em>flying</em> off the shelves. If you&#8217;re looking for big savings on a Switch itself this year, know that the inventory is <em>incredibly</em> low â any retailer offering a Switch deal is really just doing it to get your hopes up and get you on the site. We&#8217;re having a hard time finding any in stock even at full price.</p>
<p><strong>Xbox Deals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/xbox-wireless-controller">Microsoft</a> is selling Xbox controllers (which will work with the next-gen Xbox Series consoles!) for $40, down from the usual $60.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reset yer counters: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has had to &#8216;fess up to yet another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/facebook-miscalculation-significantly-inflated-average-video-view-times-for-years/">major ad reporting fail</a>.</p>
<p>This one looks like it could be costly for the tech giant to put right &#8212; not least because it&#8217;s another dent in its reputation for self reporting. (For past Facebook ad metric errors check out our reports from 2016 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/22/facebook-miscalculation-significantly-inflated-average-video-view-times-for-years/">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/16/facebook-admits-to-another-metrics-mistake-affecting-instant-article-publishers/">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/09/facebook-corrects-more-metrics-affecting-ad-reach-streaming-reactions-plus-like-share-counts/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/facebook-overhauls-ad-metrics-admits-4-bugs-and-errors-led-to-misreported-numbers/?_ga=2.12067760.582495266.1606121626-1757155993.1533833482">here</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/facebook-conversion-lift-measurement-issue-goes-undetected-for-12-months/">AdExchanger</a> reported on the code error last week with Facebook&#8217;s free &#8216;conversion lift&#8217; tool which it said affected several thousand advertisers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The discovery of the flaw has since led the tech giant to offer some advertisers millions of dollars in credits, per reports this week, to compensate for miscalculating the number of sales derived from ad impressions (which is, in turn, likely to have influenced how much advertisers spent on its digital snake oil).</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://adage.com/article/media/facebook-offers-millions-dollars-refunds-advertisers-tripped-measurement-mistake/2297236?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_term=adage&amp;utm_content=6119fa46-baee-4fc2-a9af-d44a1aa12ed6">AdAge</a> report yesterday, which quotes industry sources, the level of compensation Facebook is offering varies depending on the advertiser&#8217;s spend &#8212; but in some instances the mistake means advertisers are being given coupons worth tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The issue with the tool went unfixed for as long as 12 months, with the problem persisting between August 2019 and August 2020, according to reports.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-latest-error-shakes-advertisers-confidence-11606346927">Wall Street Journal </a> says Facebook quietly told advertisers this month about the technical problem with its calculation of the efficacy of their ad campaigns, skewing data advertisers use to determine how much to spend on its platform.</p>
<p>One digital agency source told the WSJ the issue particularly affects certain categories such as retail where marketers have this year increased spending on Facebook and similar channels by up to 5% or 10% to try to recover business lost during the early stages of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Another of its industry sources pointed out the issue affects not just media advertisers but the tech giant&#8217;s competitors &#8212; since the tool could influence where marketers chose to spend budget, so whether they spend on Facebook&#8217;s platform or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Last week the tech giant told AdExchanger that the bug was fixed on September 1, saying then that it was &#8220;working with impacted advertisers&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a subsequent statement a company spokesperson told us: âWhile making improvements to our measurement products, we found a technical issue that impacted some conversion lift tests. We&#8217;ve fixed this and are working with advertisers that have impacted studies.â</p>
<p>Facebook did not respond to a request to confirm whether some impacted advertisers are being offered millions of dollars worth of ad vouchers to rectify its code error.</p>
<p>It did confirm it&#8217;s offering one-time credits to advertisers who have been &#8216;meaningfully&#8217; impacted by the issue with the (non-billable) metric, adding that the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> impact is on a case by case basis, depending on how the tool was used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Nor did it confirm how many advertisers had impacted studies as a result of the year long technical glitch &#8212; claiming it&#8217;s a small number.</span></p>
<p>While the tech giant can continue to run its own reporting systems for b2b customers free from external oversight for now, regulating the fairness and transparency of powerful Internet platforms which other businesses depend upon for market access and reach is a key aim of a major forthcoming digital services legislative overhaul in the European Union.</p>
<p>Under the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act plan, the European Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/big-techs-blackbox-algorithms-face-regulatory-oversight-under-eu-plan/">has said</a> tech giants will be required to open up their algorithms to public oversight bodies &#8212; and will also be subject to binding transparency rules. So the clock may be ticking for Facebook&#8217;s self-serving self-reporting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As people prepare and eat their Thanksgiving meals, or just &#8220;work&#8221; on relaxing for the day, some are <em>also</em> going online to get a jump on holiday shopping deals. Adobe, which is <a href="https://www.adobe.com/special/retail-shopping-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following online sales in real time</a> at 80 of the top 100 retailers in the US, covering some 100 million SKUs, says that initial figures indicate that the US will fall just short of $6 billion in e-commerce sales for Thanksgiving Day. Shopify, meanwhile, said that based on activity of over 1 million merchants on its platform, the average cart price globally was $84.50, and in the US specifically it was $88.30.</p>
<p>Adobe had originally predicted that the US would spend $6 billion online on the day, but it seems that early activity did not follow through in later hours. Adobe said one reason for the lower number is because of the sales cycle starting even earlier for many retailers: &#8220;Retailers of all sizes appear to have successfully moved shoppers to buy earlier in the season with early discounts and effective promotions,&#8221; the company noted. We&#8217;ll update this post with final numbers on Friday.</p>
<p>Overall, Adobe says that we are still on track for consumers to spend $189.1 billion shopping online this holiday season &#8212; a period that others are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/despite-pandemic-forecasts-predict-u-s-online-holiday-sales-increase-of-20-30-or-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicting will be strong</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To put Adobe&#8217;s $6 billion figure into some context, the overall holiday sales season represents a 33.1% jump on 2019. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/28/thanksgiving-2019-online-shopping-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last year Adobe said shoppers spent $4.2 billion online</a> on Thanksgiving: this years&#8217;s numbers represent a jump of 42.3%. And leading up to today, each day this week had sales of more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on? The figures are a hopefully encouraging sign that despite some of the economic declines of 2020 caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, retailers will at least be able to make up for some of their losses in the next couple of months, traditionally the most important period for sales.</p>
<p>As we have been reporting over the last several months, overall, 2020 has been a high watermark year for e-commerce, with the bigger trend of more browsing and shopping online &#8212; which has been growing for years &#8212; getting a notable boost from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The push for more social distancing to slow the spread of the coronavirus has driven many to stay away from crowded places like stores, and it has forced us to stay at home, where we have turned to the internet to get things done.</p>
<p>These trends are not only seeing those already familiar with online shopping spending more. It&#8217;s also introducing a new category of shoppers to that platform.</p>
<p>Adobe said that so far this week, 9% of all sales have been &#8220;generated by net new customers as traditional brick-and-mortar shoppers turn online to complete transactions in light of shop closures and efforts to avoid virus transmission through in-person contact.&#8221; Tellingly, in US states where there are more Covid-19 restrictions &#8212; either related to numbers that can gather, or in the closure of some venues like shops &#8212; online sales growth was 47% higher.</p>
<p>Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, has traditionally been marked as the start of holiday shopping, but the growth of e-commerce has given more prominence to Thanksgiving Day, when physical stores are closed and many of us are milling about the house possibly with not much to do. This year seems to be following through on that trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Families have many traditions during the holidays. Travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and fear of spreading the virus are, however, preventing Americans from enjoying so many of them. Shopping online is one festive habit that can be maintained online and sales figures are showcasing that gifting remains a much beloved tradition this year,&#8221; said Taylor Schreiner, Director, Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement.</p>
<p>(That&#8217;s not to say that Black Friday won&#8217;t be big: Adobe predicts that it will break $10.3 billion in sales online this year.)</p>
<p>Some drilling down into what is selling:</p>
<p>Adobe said that board games and other categories that &#8220;bring the focus on family&#8221; are seeing a strong surge, with sales up five times over last year.</p>
<p>Similarly &#8212; in keeping with how much we are all shopping for groceries online now &#8212; grocery sales in the last week were up a whopping 596% compared to October, as people stocked up for the long weekend (whether or not, it seems, it was being spent with family).</p>
<p>Other top items include Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, Just Dance 2021, as well as vTech toys and Rainbow High Dolls.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Amazon&#8217;s announcement this week that it would be offering more options for delivery this season speaks to how e-commerce is growing beyond simple home delivery, and how this has become a key part of how retailers are differentiating their businesses from each other. Curbside pickup has grown by 116% over last year this week, and expedited shipping is up 49%. Adobe said that 56% of items purchased online were received via curbside pickup or expedited shipping.Â Â Â </span></p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/u-s-holiday-shopping-season-on-mobile-expected-to-be-largest-to-date-topping-1b-hours-on-android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predicted</a>, Smartphones are playing an ever-stronger role, too. Adobe said $25.5 billion has been spent via smartphones in November to date &#8212; significantly, up 48% over 2019. As the day went on, more people shifted to shopping on their handsets, with smartphones accounting for roughly half of all online sales (versus 38.6% just in the morning). Shopify was even more bullish on smartphones: it said that they accounted for a whopping 70% of all the sales on its platform on Thanksgiving globally.</p>
<p>In the US, Adobe said that big retailers continue to dominate how people shop, with the likes of Walmart, Target Amazon and others pulling in more than $1 billion in revenue annually collectively seeing their sales go up 147% since October. Part of the reason could be more sophisticated websites, with conversion rates 100% higher than those of smaller businesses. (That leaves a big opening for companies that can build tools to help smaller businesses compete better on this front.)</p>
<p>It should be noted, though, that the Shopify story paints a different picture. As a platform to enable any brand to build an e-commerce experience into their online profile, its focus on the &#8220;long tail&#8221; of online retailers, with some 1 million merchants using its platform to power the sales, run fulfillment and more. Shopify will be publishing more detailed results on Black Friday, but the message seems to be that the size of the business isn&#8217;t everything: having an efficient sales experience for what you are selling is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/astrazeneca" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="astrazeneca">AstraZeneca&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-26/astra-likely-to-run-fresh-global-covid-vaccine-trial-ceo-says?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business">Bloomberg</a> that the pharmaceutical company will likely conduct another global trial of the effectiveness of its COVID-19 vaccine trial, following the disclosure that the more effective dosage in the existing Phase 3 clinical trial was actually administered by accident. AstraZeneca and its partner the University of Oxford reported interim results that showed 62% efficacy for a full two-dose regimen, and a 90% efficacy rate for a half-dose followed by a full dose â which the scientists developing the drug later acknowledged was actually just an accidental administration of what was supposed to be two full doses.</p>
<p>To be clear, this shouldn&#8217;t dampen anyone&#8217;s optimism about the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The results are still very promising, and an additional trial is being done only to ensure that what was seen as a result of the accidental half-dosage is actually borne out when the vaccine is administered that way intentionally. That said, this could extend the amount of time that it takes for the Oxford vaccine to be approved in the U.S., since this will proceed ahead of a planned U.S. trial that would be required for the FDA to approve it for use domestically.</p>

<p>The Oxford vaccine&#8217;s rollout to the rest of the world likely won&#8217;t be affected, according to AstraZeneca&#8217;s CEO, since the studies that have been conducted, including safety data, are already in place from participants around the world outside of the U.S.</p>
<p>While vaccine candidates from Moderna and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/pfizer" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="pfizer">Pfizer <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> have also shown very strong efficacy in early Phase 3 data, hopes are riding high on the AstraZeneca version because it relies on a different technology, can be stored and transported at standard refrigerator temperatures rather than frozen, and costs just a fraction per dose compared to the other two leading vaccines in development.</p>
<p>That makes it an incredibly valuable resource for global inoculation programs, including distribution where cost and transportation infrastructures are major concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.bigblue.co">Bigblue</a>, a French startup that just raised a $3.6 million seed round (â¬3 million) to build an end-to-end fulfillment solution in Europe. If you sell products on your own website and across multiple marketplaces, you can use Bigblue to handle everything that happens after a transaction.</p>
<p>Bigblue doesnât try to reinvent the wheel. Instead, it partners with existing logistics companies so that you only have to manage one relationship with Bigblue. It means that Bigblue works with several fulfillment centers to store your products as well as multiple shipping carriers.</p>
<p>Essentially, Bigblue lets you improve the experience for your customers. When you start using Bigblue, you send your products to a fulfillment center and you integrate Bigblue with your online stores. The startup has integrations with Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, Wix Store, Prestashop, Fastmag and Amazonâs marketplace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When a client orders a product from you, it is packed and shipped directly from the fulfillment center to your customers. Bigblue customers pay a flat fee per order and donât have to deal with anything. Some packages might be delivered through DHL, others might be sent out using Chronopost, etc. It is completely transparent as Bigblue chooses the right carrier for you.</p>
<p>The startup also gives you more visibility into your shipping process. Retailers get an overview of their operations and can see the inventory from Bigblueâs interface. Clients receive branded delivery emails.</p>
<p>While itâs hard to build a good logistics network if youâre a small e-commerce company, Bigblue lets you compete more directly with Amazon big e-commerce websites. You can level up the customer experience without putting together an in-house logistics team.</p>
<p>Samaipata is leading todayâs funding round. Bpifrance is contributing to the round. Plug and Play, ClÃ©ment Benoit, Thibaud Elziere and Olivier Bonnet are also investing.</p>
<p>With the new influx of funding, the startup plans to hire 50 people and improve its product. You can expect more integrations with e-commerce platforms, ERPs and marketplaces. Bigblue is also going to build out its own shipment tracking pages and email personalization toolkit. The company will also improve product returns and delivery ETAs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following a request from <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Foxconn could be shifting production out of China for some iPad and MacBook models according to a report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-foxconn-vietnam-apple-exclusive-idUSKBN2860VN">Reuters</a>. The new assembly lines would be based in Vietnam.</p>
<p>As a recent investigation from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-apples-eroding-partnership-with-foxconn">The Information</a> highlighted, both companies are intrinsically connected. The Taiwanese manufacturer is Appleâs main production partner. Apple is also Foxconnâs main client. When it comes to raw numbers, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/foxconn" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="foxconn">Foxconn <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is making 60% to 70% of iPhones, Appleâs main product.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Apple has tried to diversify its supply chain in two major ways. First, Apple is trying to work with other manufacturing companies, such as Luxshare Precision Industry and Wistron.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Second, Apple is trying to manufacture its products in different countries. New tariffs and import restrictions have made that issue more pressing.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Apple asked Foxconn to move some iPad and MacBook assembly to Vietnam. The assembly line should be operating at some point during the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>In addition to Vietnam, Foxconn also produces iPhone 11 devices in a plant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/apple-begins-assembling-iphone-11-in-india/">near Chennai, India</a>. Wistron also assembles iPhone models in India. Foxconn has also manufactured some iPhone models <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/04/20/apple-likely-planning-2020-iphone-se-assembly-in-brazil/">in Brazil</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. Fertility, one of the largest networks of fertility clinics in the United States, has confirmed it was hit by a ransomware attack and that data was taken.</p>
<p>The company was <a href="https://www.amuletcapital.com/2020/05/21/amulet-capital-and-shady-grove-fertility-form-us-fertility/">formed in May</a> as a partnership between Shady Grove Fertility, a fertility clinic with dozens of locations across the U.S. east coast, and Amulet Capital Partners, a private equity firm that invests largely in the healthcare space. As a joint venture, U.S. Fertility now claims 55 locations across the U.S., including California.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20417507-us-fertility-ransomware-attack">a statement</a>, U.S. Fertility said that the hackers &#8220;acquired a limited number of files&#8221; during the month that they were in its systems, until the ransomware was triggered on September 14. That&#8217;s a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">common technique of data-stealing ransomware</a>, which steals data before encrypting the victim&#8217;s network for ransom. Some ransomware groups publish the stolen files on their websites if their ransom demand isn&#8217;t paid.</p>
<p>U.S. Fertility said some personal information, like names and addresses, were taken in the attack. Some patients also had their Social Security numbers taken. But the company warned that the attack may have involved protected health information. Under U.S. law, that can include information about a person&#8217;s health or medical conditions, like test results and medical records.</p>
<p>A spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the incident. (Thursday is a national holiday in the U.S..)</p>
<p>U.S. Fertility didn&#8217;t say why it took more than two month to publicly disclose the attack, but said in the notice that its disclosure was not delayed at the request of law enforcement.</p>
<p>This is the latest attack targeting the healthcare sector. In September, one of the largest hospital systems in the U.S., Universal Health Services, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/universal-health-services-ransomware/">hit by the Ryuk ransomware</a>, forcing some affected emergency rooms to close and to turn patients away. Several <a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/ransomware-hackers-post-data-from-2-providers-device-manufacturer">other</a> fertility clinics have been <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/twin-cities-fertility-clinic-hit-by-ransomware-attack">attacked</a> by ransomware in recent months.</p>

<p>The tech giant continues to make billions in ad revenue, including by processing and monetize Internet users&#8217; location data.

<p>But it could still be years before Google faces any regulatory action in Europe related to its location tracking.</p>
<p>This is because Ireland&#8217;s DPC has yet to issue <em>any</em> cross-border GDPR decisions, some 2.5 years after the regulation started being applied. (Although, as we reported recently, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/twitter-could-face-its-first-gdpr-penalty-within-days/">case related to a Twitter data breach</a> is inching towards a result in the coming days.)</p>
<p>By contrast, France&#8217;s data watchdog, the CNIL, was able to complete a GDPR investigation into the transparency of Google&#8217;s data processing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">much quicker order</a> last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-court-slaps-down-googles-appeal-against-57m-gdpr-fine/">This summer</a> French courts also confirmed the $57M fine it issued, slapping down Google&#8217;s appeal.</p>
<p>But the case predated Google coming under the jurisdiction of the DPC. And Ireland&#8217;s data regulator has to deal with a disproportionate number of multinational tech companies, given how many have established their EU base in the country.</p>
<p>The DPC has a major backlog of cross-border cases, with more than 20 GDPR probes involving a number of tech companies including Apple, Facebook/WhatsApp and LinkedIn. (Google has also been under investigation in Ireland over its adtech since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">2019</a>.)</p>

<p>This week the EU&#8217;s internet market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said regional lawmakers are well aware of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/europes-data-strategy-aims-to-tip-the-scales-away-from-big-tech/">enforcement &#8220;bottlenecks&#8221;</a> in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>He suggested the Commission has <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">learned lessons from this friction &#8212; claiming it will ensure similar concerns don&#8217;t affect the future working of a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/europe-sets-out-the-rules-of-the-road-for-its-data-reuse-plan/">Â regulatory proposal related to data reuse</a> that he was out speaking in public to introduce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Commission wants to create standard conditions for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/europes-data-strategy-aims-to-tip-the-scales-away-from-big-tech/">rights-respecting reuse of industrial data</a> across the EU, via a new Data Governance Act (DGA), which proposes similar oversight mechanisms as are involved in the EU&#8217;s oversight of personal data &#8212; including national agencies monitoring compliance and a centralized EU steering body (which they&#8217;re planning to call the European Data Innovation Board as a mirror entity to the European Data Protection Board).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Commission&#8217;s ambitious agenda for updating and expanding the EU&#8217;s digital rules framework, means criticism of GDPR risks taking the shine off the DGA before the ink has dried on the proposal document &#8212; putting</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> pressure on lawmakers to find creative ways to unblock GDPR&#8217;s enforcement &#8220;bottleneck&#8221;. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">(Creative because national agencies are responsibility for day to day oversight, and Member States are responsible for resourcing DPAs.)Â </span></p>
<p>In an initial GDPR review this summer, the Commission praised the regulation as a âmodern and horizontal piece of legislationâ and a âglobal reference pointâ &#8212; claiming it&#8217;s served as a point of inspiration for California&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-officially-takes-effect-today/">CCPA</a> and other emerging digital privacy frameworks around the world.</p>
<p>But they also conceded GDPR enforcement is lacking.</p>
<p>The best answer to this concern &#8220;will be a decision from the Irish data protection authority about important cases&#8221;, the EU&#8217;s justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, said in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/gdprs-two-year-review-flags-lack-of-vigorous-enforcement/">June</a>.</p>

<p>Beuc&#8217;s report &#8212; which it&#8217;s called <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2020-074_two_years_of_the_gdpr_a_cross-border_data_protection_enforcement_case_from_a_consumer_perspective.pdf"><em>The long and winding road: Two years of the GDPR: A cross-border data protection case from a consumer perspective</em></a> &#8212; details the procedural obstacles its member organizations have faced in seeking to obtain a decision related to the original complaints, which were filed with a variety of DPAs around the EU.</p>
<p>This includes concerns of the Irish DPC making unnecessary &#8220;information and admissibility checks&#8221;; as well as rejecting complaints brought by an interested organization on the grounds they lack a mandate under Irish law, because it does not allow for third party redress (yet the Dutch consumer organization had filed the complaint under Dutch law which does&#8230;).</p>
<p>The report also queries why the DPC chose to open an own volition enquiry into Google&#8217;s location data activities (rather than a complaint-led enquiry) &#8212; which Beuc says risks a further delay to reaching a decision on the complaints themselves.</p>
<p>It further points out that the DPC&#8217;s probe of Google only looks at activity since February 2020 not November 2018 when the complaints were made &#8212; meaning there&#8217;s a missing chunk of Google&#8217;s location data processing that&#8217;s not even being investigated yet.</p>
<p>It notes that three of its member organizations involved in the Google complaints had considered applying for a judicial review of the DPC&#8217;s decision (NB: others have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/facebook-eu-us-data-transfer-complaint-schrems-gets-a-judicial-review-of-the-irish-dpcs-procedure/">resorted to that route</a>) &#8212; but they decided not to proceed in part because of the significant legal costs it would have entailed.</p>
<p>The report also points out the inherent imbalance of GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism shifting the administration of complaints to the location of companies under investigation &#8212; arguing they therefore benefit from &#8220;easier access to justice&#8221; (vs the ordinary consumer faced with undertaking legal proceedings in a different country and (likely) language).</p>
<p>&#8220;If the lead authority is in a country with tradition in âcommon lawâ, like Ireland, things can become even more complex and costly,&#8221; Beuc&#8217;s report further notes.</p>
<p>Another issue it raises is the overarching one of rights complaints having to fight what it dubs &#8216;a moving target&#8217; &#8212; given well-resourced tech companies can leverage regulatory delays to (superficially) tweak practices, greasing continued abuse with misleading PR campaigns. (Something Beuc accuses Google of doing.)</p>
<p>DPAs must &#8220;adapt their enforcement approach to intervene more rapidly and directly&#8221;, it concludes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over two years have passed since the GDPR became applicable, we have now reached a turning point. The GDPR must finally show its strength and become a catalyst for urgently needed changes in business practices,&#8221; Beuc goes on in a summary of its recommendations. &#8220;Our members experience and that of other civil society organisations, reveals a series of obstacles that significantly hamper the effective application of the GDPR and the correct functioning of its enforcement system.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/beuc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="beuc">BEUC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> recommends to the relevant EU and national authorities to make a comprehensive and joint effort to ensure the swift enforcement of the rules and improve the position of data subjects and their representing organisations, particularly in the framework of cross-border enforcement cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>We reached out to the Commission and the Irish DPC with questions about the report. But at the time of writing neither had responded. We&#8217;ve also asked Google for comment.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>The DPC&#8217;s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told us the reason it chose to open a &#8220;forward looking&#8221; enquiry into Google&#8217;s location practices in early 2020 was it wanted to be able to investigate &#8220;in real time&#8221;, rather than try to go back and replicate how things were.</p>
<p>Doyle also said the location-related Google complaints had been lodged with different DPAs at difference times &#8212; meaning some complaints had taken considerably longer to reach Ireland than November 2018, raising questions about the efficiency of the current procedures for European DPAs to sent complaints to a lead supervisor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The complaints in question were lodged with different Supervisory Authorities on different dates from November 2018,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The DPC received these complaints in July 2019, following which we engaged with Beuc. We then opened an own-volition inquiry in February 2020 in a manner that will enable us to undertake real time testing in order to evidence our findings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beuc earlier sent a list of <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2020-040_gdpr_second_anniversary_-_recommendations_for_efficient_enforcement_letter.pdf">eight recommendations for &#8220;efficient&#8221; GDPR enforcement</a> to the Commission in May.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back toÂ <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunchâs venture capital-focused podcast (<a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">now on Twitter!</a>), where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This week, we&#8217;re doing a first-ever for the show and taking a deep dive into one specific sector: Edtech.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha Mascarenhas</a> has covered education technology since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/edtech-startups-prepare-to-become-not-just-a-teaching-tool-but-a-necessity/">Stanford first closed down classes</a> in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. In the wake of the historic shuttering of much of the United States&#8217; traditional institutions of education, the sector has formed new unicorns, attracted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/vcs-pour-funding-into-edtech-startups-as-covid-19-shakes-up-the-market/">record-breaking venture capital</a> totals, and most of all, enjoyed time in a long-overdue spotlight.</p>
<p>For this <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/equity-87d6" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="equity-87d6">Equity <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Dive, we zero into one part of that conversation: Edtech&#8217;s impact on higher education. We brought together Udacity co-founder and Kitty Hawk CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/sebastianthrun?lang=en">Sebastian Thrun</a>, Eschaton founder and college drop-out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imdilick/">Ian Dilick</a>, and Cowboy Ventures investor <a href="https://twitter.com/jomayra_herrera">Jomayra Herrera</a> to answer our biggest questions.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the state of remote school is leading to gap years among students</li>
<li>A framework for how to think of higher education&#8217;s main three products (including which is most defensible over time)</li>
<li>What learnings we can take from this COVID-19 experiment on remote schooling to apply to the future</li>
<li>Why ed-tech is flocking to the notion of life-long learning</li>
<li>And the reality of who self-paced learning serves &#8212; and who it leaves out</li>
</ul>
<p>And much, much more. If you celebrate, thank you for spending part of your Thanksgiving with the Equity crew. We&#8217;re so thankful to have this platform and audience, and it means a ton that y&#8217;all tune in each week.</p>

Below is a timeline of how TikTok grew from what some considered another &#8220;copycat&#8221; short video app to global dominance and eventually became a target of the U.S. government.</p>
<h1>2012-2017: The emergence of TikTok</h1>
<p><em>These years were a period of fast growth for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bytedance">ByteDance, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the Beijing-based parent company behind TikTok. Originally launched in China as Douyin, the video-sharing app quickly was wildly successful in its domestic market before setting its sights on the rest of the world.Â </em></p>
<h1><strong>2012Â </strong></h1>
<p>Zhang Yiming, a 29-year-old serial engineer, establishes ByteDance in Beijing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h1><strong>2014</strong></h1>
<p>Chinese product designer Alex Zhu launches Musical.ly.</p>
<h1><strong>2016</strong></h1>
<p>ByteDance launches Douyin, which is regarded by many as a Musical.ly clone. It launches Douyin&#8217;s overseas version TikTok later that year.</p>
<h1>2017-2019: TikTok takes off in the United States</h1>
<p><em>TikTok merges with Musical.ly and and launches in the U.S., where it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/its-time-to-pay-serious-attention-to-tiktok/">quickly becomes popular</a>, the first social media app from a Chinese tech company to achieve that level of success there. But at the same time, its ownership leads to questions about national security and censorship, against the backdrop of the U.S.-China tariff wars and increased scrutiny of Chinese tech companies (including Huawei and ZTE) under the Trump administration.</em></p>

<p><em>After weeks of speculation, Trump signs an executive order in August against ByteDance. ByteDance begins seeking American buyers for TikTok, but the company also fights the executive order in court. A group of TikTok creators also file a lawsuit challenging the order. The last few months of 2020 become a relentless, and often confusing, flurry of events and new developments for TikTok observers, with no end in sight.Â </em></p>
<h2><strong>August</strong></h2>
<p>Reports say ByteDance agrees to divest TikTok&#8217;s U.S. operations and Microsoft will take over. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/01/bytedance-and-microsoft-offer-a-deal-to-allow-tiktok-to-remain-in-the-u-s-per-report/">link</a>)</p>

(<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/)">link</a>). TikTok says the order was &#8220;issued without any due process&#8221; and would risk &#8220;undermining global businessesâ trust in the United Statesâ commitment to the rule of law.&#8221; (<a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-responds">link</a>)</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>August 24:</strong> TikTok and ByteDance file their first lawsuitÂ in federal court against the executive order, naming President Trump, Secretary of State Wilbur Ross and the U.S. Department of Commerce as defendants.

<h2><strong>September</strong></h2>
<p>China says it would rather see TikTok shuttered than sold to an American firm. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/china-may-kill-tiktoks-u-s-operations-rather-than-see-them-sold/">link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>September 13</strong>: Oracle confirms it is part of a proposal submitted by ByteDance to the Treasury Department in which Oracle will serve as the &#8220;trusted technology provider.&#8221; (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/oracle-wins-bid-to-buy-tiktok/">link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>September 18</strong>: The Commerce Department <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/09/commerce-department-prohibits-wechat-and-tiktok-transactions-protect">publishes regulations</a> against TikTok that will take effect in two phases. The app will no longer be distributed in U.S. app stores as of September 20, but it gets an extension on how it operates until November 12. After that, however, it will no longer be able to use internet hosting services in the U.S., rendering it inaccessible.Â  (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/tiktok-and-wechat-will-be-banned-in-the-u-s-from-sunday/">link</a>)</p>
<p><em>On the same day as the Commerce Department&#8217;s announcement, two separate lawsuits are filed against Trump&#8217;s executive order against TikTok. One is filed by ByteDance, while the other is by three TikTok creators.</em></p>
<p>The one <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04518061204">filed by TikTok and ByteDance</a> is in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (case number 20-cv-02658), naming President Trump, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and the Commerce Department as defendants. It is very similar to the suit ByteDance previously filed in California. TikTok and ByteDance&#8217;s lawyers argue that Trump&#8217;s executive order violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the right to free speech, and due process and takings clauses.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other lawsuit, filed by TikTok creators Douglas Marland, Cosette Rinab and Alec Chambers, also names the president, Ross and the Department of Commerce as defendants. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (case number </span><span class="s2">2:20-cv-04597), argues that Trumpâs executive order &#8220;violates the first and fifth amendments of the U.S. Constitution and exceeds the Presidentâs statutory authority.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>September 19:</strong> One day before the September 20 deadline that would have forced Google and Apple to remove TikTok from their app stores, the Commerce Department <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2020/09/statement-delayed-prohibitions-related-tiktok">extends it by a week to September 27</a>. This is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-commerce-idUSKCN26A11J">reportedly</a> to give ByteDance, Oracle and Walmart time to finalize their deal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the same day, Marland, Rinab and Chambers, the three TikTok creators, <a href="https://ecf.paed.uscourts.gov/doc1/153119035733">file</a> their first motion for a preliminary injunction against Trumpâs executive order. They argue that the executive order violates freedom of speech and deprives them of âprotected liberty and property interests without due process,â because if a ban goes into effect, it would prevent them from making income from TikTok-related activities, like promotional and branding work.</span></p>
<p><strong>September 20</strong>: After filing the D.C. District Court lawsuit against Trump&#8217;s executive order, TikTok and ByteDance formally withdraw their similar pending suit in the U.S. District Court of Central District of California.</p>
<p><strong>September 21</strong>: ByteDance and Oracle confirm the deal but send conflicting statements over TikTok&#8217;s new ownership. TikTok is valued at an estimated $60 billion. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/tiktok-wtf/">link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>September 22</strong>: China&#8217;s state newspaper says China won&#8217;t approve the TikTok sale, labeling it &#8220;extortion.&#8221; (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/china-says-it-wont-greenlight-tiktok-deal/">link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>September 23: </strong>TikTok and ByteDance <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04518069190">ask</a> the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to grant a preliminary injunction against the executive order, arguing that the September 27 ban removing TikTok from app stores will &#8220;inflict direct, immediate, and irreparable harm on Plaintiffs during the pendency of this case.&#8221; (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/tiktok-files-for-injunction-against-pending-trump-app-ban/">link</a>)</p>
<p><span class="s1"><strong>September 26:</strong> U.S. District Court Judge Wendy Beetlestone <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/27/21458242/judge-rejects-tiktok-creators-request-ban-says-they-wont-suffer-irreparable-harm">denies Marland, Rinab and Chambersâ motion</a> for a preliminary injunction against the executive order, writing that the three did not demonstrate &#8220;they will suffer immediate, irreparable harm if users and prospective users cannot download or update&#8221; TikTok after September 27, since they will still be able to use the app.</span></p>
<p><strong>September 27</strong>: Just hours before the TikTok ban was set to go into effect, U.S. District Court Judge Carl J. Nichols <a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/doc1/04518076799">grants ByteDance&#8217;s request for a preliminary injunction </a>while the court considers whether the app poses a risk to national security.

<h2>November</h2>
<p><strong>November 7:</strong> After five days of waiting for vote counts, Joe Biden is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/media-calls-joe-biden-winner-bee69f9d1d32e84d68e6164ea956e67a">declared the president-elect by CNN</a>, followed by the AP, NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox News. With Biden set to be sworn in as president on January 20, the future of Trump&#8217;s executive order against TikTok becomes even more uncertain.</p>
<p><strong>November 10:</strong> ByteDance asks the federal appeal court to vacate the U.S. government&#8217;s divestiture order that would force it to sell the app&#8217;s American operations by November 12. Filed as part of the lawsuit in D.C. District Court, ByteDance said it asked the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States for an extension, but hadn&#8217;t been granted one yet. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/bytedance-asks-federal-appeals-court-to-vacate-u-s-order-forcing-it-to-sell-tiktok/">link</a>)</p>
<p><strong>November 12: </strong>This is the day that the Commerce Department&#8217;s ban on transactions with ByteDance, including providing internet hosting services to TikTok (which would stop the app from being able to operate in the U.S.), was set to go into effect. But instead the case becomes more convoluted as the U.S. government sends mixed messages about TikTok&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-25360.pdf">says it will abide</a> by the preliminary injunction granted on October 30 by Judge Beetlestone, pending further legal developments. But, around the same time, the Justice Department files an appeal against Beetlestone&#8217;s ruling. Then Judge Nichols sets new deadlines (December 14 and 28) in the D.C. District Court lawsuit (the one filed by ByteDance against the Trump administration) for both sides to file motions and other new documents in the case. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/the-u-s-government-sends-mixed-messages-about-tiktoks-future/">link</a>)</p>

And then on top of that, your tour manager is constantly calling you, asking you logistical questions.â</p>
<p>As far as internet pitch videos go, itâs not the most universal. If anything, the three-minute clip loses any hope of populist appeal by the end. In a final shot, the singer in a maroon SpaceX hoodie is the last up the ramp onto a private jet. The plane door closes revealing a Weezer flying âWâ logo.</p>
<p>âDownload Drivetimes now, on GitHub,â Cuomo adds in voice-over. âThis is CS50X.â</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Itâs not the most polished app pitch video, and Cuomoâs elevator pitch could probably do with a bit of refining before approaching venture capitalists about a seed round. As far as final projects for online programming courses go, however, itâs something to behold. The images alternate between pages of code, Google spreadsheets and POV shots as he takes the stage for a co-headlining tour with the Pixies.</p>
<p>It helped earn Cuomo a 95 in the class.</p>

<p>But while, in its current configuration, the Drivetimes tour scheduling tool might have limited appeal, the musicianâs final project from Harvardâs follow-up course, CS50W, is immediately apparent for an army of fans who have followed his quarter-century-plus career.</p>
<p>This week Cuomo <a href="https://www.riverscuomo.com/demos">dropped more than 2,400 demos</a> totaling more than 86 hours. Spanning 1976 to 2015, the songs range in quality from tape-recorded sketches to more polished fare. Some would eventually find their way onto Weezerâs 13 albums, or assorted side projects. Others wouldnât be so lucky.</p>
<p>Available through Cuomoâs âMr. Riversâ Neighborhoodâ site, the tracks are gathered into nine bundles, each available for $9 a piece. âBy the way,â Cuomo writers at the bottom of a disclaimer, âthis market is my final project for a course I&#8217;m taking in web programming.â</p>
<p>For half a decade, the platinum-selling rock star has been moonlighting as a computer programming student.</p>
<p>âI was always a spreadsheet guy,â Cuomo tells TechCrunch. âAround 2000, I think I started in Microsoft Access and then Excel. Just keeping track of all my songs and demos and ideas. Spreadsheets got more and more complicated to the point where it was like, âWell, I&#8217;m kind of almost writing code here in these formulas, except it&#8217;s super hard to use. So maybe I should actually do programming instead.â â</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/okthJIVbi6g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It would be an odd side hustle for practically any other successful musician. For Cuomo, however, itâs the next logical step. In the wake of the massive success of Weezerâs self-titled debut, he enrolled as a sophomore at Harvard, spending a year living in a dorm. He would ultimately leave school to record the bandâs much-loved follow-up, <em>Pinkerton</em>, but two more more enrollments in 1997 and 2004 found the musician ultimately graduating with an English BA in 2006.</p>
<p>CS50 found Cuomo returning to Harvard â at least in spirit. The course is hosted online by the university, a free introduction to computer science.</p>
<p>âI went through some online courses and was looking for something that looked appealing and so I saw the Harvard CS50 was very popular,â Cuomo says. âSo I was like, âWell, I&#8217;ll give this a shot.â It didn&#8217;t take immediately. The first week course was using Scratch. I don&#8217;t know if you know that, but it&#8217;s like kind of click and drag type of programming, and you&#8217;re making a little video game.â</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_Wu6lI-42w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>A six-week course stretched out for six months for the musician. That same year, the musician â now a father of two â played dozens of shows and recorded Weezerâs 10th album, the Grammy-nominated <em>White Album</em>.</p>
<p>âWhen we hit <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/python" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="python">Python <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> halfway through the course,â Cuomo says, âI was just amazed at how powerful it was and intuitive it was for me, and I could just get so much done. Then by the end of the course, I was writing programs that were really helping me manage my day-to-day life as a traveling musician and then also managing my spreadsheets and managing my work as a creative artist.â</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/UV5F3vcQyrY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>For Cuomo, productivity has never been much of an issue. The band has two albums completed beyond this yearâs <em>Black Album</em>, and heâs already begun work on two more follow-ups. What has seemingly been a bigger issue, however, is organizing those thoughts. Thatâs where the spreadsheets and database come in.</p>
<p>The âthousandsâ of spreadsheets became a database, cataloging Cuomoâs own demos and work he was studying from other artists.</p>
<p>âFor years it seemed like kind of a waste of time or an indulgence,â he says. âI should be writing a new song or recording a song rather than just cataloging these old ideas, but I&#8217;ve found that, years later, I&#8217;m able to very efficiently make use of these ancient ideas because I can just tell my Python program, âHey, show me all the ideas I have at 126 BPM in the key of A flat that start with a third degree of the scale and the melody and are in Dorian mode and that my manager has given three stars or more to.â â</p>
<p>He admits that the process may be lacking in some of the rock and roll romanticism for which fans of the bands might hope. But in spite of drawing on pages of analytics, Cuomo insists thereâs still magic present.</p>
<p>For Cuomo, productivity has never been much of an issue. Given his level of productivity, however, organizing all of those thoughts can get tricky. Thatâs where the spreadsheets and database come in.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/THb3ncBWMms?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>âThere&#8217;s still plenty of room for spontaneity and inspiration in what we traditionally think of as human creativity,â Cuomo explains. âOne of my heroes in this realm is Igor Stravinsky. Thereâs a collection of his lectures called &#8220;Poetics of Music.&#8221; And he had a note in that collection. He said he has no interest in a composer that&#8217;s only using one of his faculties, like a composer that says, âI am only going to write what pops into my head spontaneously when I&#8217;m in some kind of a creative zone. I won&#8217;t use any of my other tools.â</p>
<p>âHe says, âNo, I prefer to listen to the music of a composer who&#8217;s using every faculty at his disposal, his intuition, but also his intellect and his ability to analyze and categorize and make use of everything he has.â I find that those ended up being the most wild and unpredictable and creative compositions.â</p>
<p>And thereâs been no shortage of compositions. Cuomo says the band has two albums completed beyond this yearâs<em> Black Album</em>, and heâs already begun work on two more follow-ups. After decades of feeling beholden to the 18-month major label album release cycle, the singer says that after the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/demos-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="demos-3">Demos <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> project, he has a newfound interest in finding more ways to release music directly to fans.</p>
<p>âI don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m really good at understanding the big-picture marketplace and how to make the biggest impact in the world,â he says. âMy manager is so good at that, but I just told them like, âHey, this feels like something here. First of all, it&#8217;s really fun. The fans are really happy. It&#8217;s super easy for everyone involved.â The coding part wasn&#8217;t easy, but for everyone else, it&#8217;s a couple of clicks and you&#8217;ve got all this music, and it&#8217;s a cheap price, and there&#8217;s no middleman. PayPal takes a little bit, but it&#8217;s nothing like a major label. So, this could be something. And there&#8217;s just something, it feels so good when it&#8217;s directly from me to the audience.â</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOIsYA1QDuk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>For now, computer science continues to take up a major chunk of his time. Cuomo estimates that heâs been spending around 70% of his work hours on programming projects. On Wednesday nights, he helps out with programming for a meditation site (another decades-long passion), and he plans to take Harvardâs follow-up CS50M course, which centers around developing for mobile apps.</p>
<p>There are, however, no immediate plans to quit his day job.</p>
<p>âI can&#8217;t see me getting a job at a startup or something or maintaining somebody&#8217;s website,â he says. âBut maybe the line between rock star and web developer is getting blurred so that musicians will be making more and more use of technological tools. Besides just the music software, weâll be making more and more use of means of distribution and organization and creativity that&#8217;s coming out in the way we code our connection to the audience.â</p>

<p>Even in a normal year, the holidays can be an anxiety-inducing hellscape. In 2020, though â honestly, itâs hard to say what manner of climactic finale this historically rough year might have on tap. In honor of one of the most epically rotten years on record, weâve cobbled together a list of gifts that could go a ways toward helping folks make it triumphantly across the finish line.</p>
<p>Itâs a bit of a mixed bag, I admit. Everyone blows off stress differently â some like to play video games, come cook, some go for a run, others meditate. This is an attempt to round up some gadgets and software that can help increase sleep, reduce blood pressure and generally help survive whatâs left of 2020 intact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>Muse S</h2>

<p>I was using Museâs latest headband quite a bit during CES, back when that show still felt like it was going to be the apex of stress for my year. The device offers a clever kind of gamified approach to meditation â something I, as one of the worst meditators of all-time, have come to appreciate. I recognize that words like âgamifyâ sound counterproductive when it comes something like meditating, but Muse does a surprisingly good job getting you into the right headspace.</p>

<p>The company also recently added sleep tracking to the wearable. I will say that the Muse S is reasonably comfortable as far as tech headbands go (an admittedly low bar), but even so, sleeping with one on still takes some getting used to.</p>

<p>We can recommend a number of all-purpose, noise-cancelling headphones for help relaxing. The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bose" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bose">Bose <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Sleepbuds II arenât that. These little Bluetooth buds are built for one purpose only: sleep. Theyâre comfortable, they get good battery life and theyâll stay in place while you sleep. Theyâre built for noisy environments â whether youâre trying to sneak in a midday nap or sleep next to a snorer.</p>

<p>Theyâre a bit pricy and not very versatile, only designed to play back Boseâs preloaded sleep sounds. But if someone in your life is having trouble falling â or staying â asleep, theyâre a solid investment.</p>

<p>Thereâs no shortage of meditation apps these days, but Calm has been my go-to for a long time. The app has been tremendously successful over the past couple of years, even landing a star-studded show on HBO Max. With more than 90 million downloads, Calm offers some of the most extensive and best guided meditation courses and tracks to help lull listeners to sleep.</p>

<p>I really dug this thing before my rabbit chewed the cord and rendered the thing effectively useless. Iâm going to go out on a limb and assume thatâs not an issue most users are going to run into. Withings Sleep is, effectively, a pad that sits under the mattress to detect your sleep progress during the night. Those results are then collected and displayed in Withings&#8217; Health app. Iâve tested a lot of wearable sleep trackers over the year, but if youâre really invested in sleep tracking, this is a good way to go. Among other things, you donât have to wear a band to sleep.</p>
<p>Withings Sleep goes deep with its tracking, including cycles heart rate tracking and even snore detection. Itâs also one of the first of this class of consumer device to offer sleep apnea detection.</p>

<p>Back when we used to do travel gift guides, I included one of Dreamlightâs masks for long flights. Even though weâre all grounded, though, Iâve actually got a fair amount of use out of the thing, dealing with some health struggles this year.

[&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jason-green-3" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jason-green-3">Jason Green <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has a pretty solid reputation as venture capitalists go. The enterprise-focused firm he co-founded 17 years ago, <a href="https://www.emcap.com/">Emergence Capital</a>, has backed Saleforce, Box and Zoom, among many other companies, and even while every firm is now investing in software-as-a-service startups, his remains a go-to for many top founders selling business products and services.</p>
<p>To learn more about the trends impacting Green&#8217;s slice of the investing universe, we <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/zoom-investor-jason-green-on-whats-next/id1498270180?i=1000499674063">talked</a> with him late last week about everything from SPACs to valuations to how the firm differentiates itself from the many rivals with which it&#8217;s now competing. Below are some outtakes edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What do you make of the <a href="https://twitter.com/EricNewcomer/status/1328770446993534978">assessment</a> that SPACs are for companies that aren&#8217;t generating enough revenue to go public the traditional route?</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>JG: Well, yeah, it&#8217;ll be really interesting. This has been quite a year for SPACs, right? I can&#8217;t remember the number, but it&#8217;s been something like $50 billion of capital raised this year in SPACs, and all of those have to put that money to work within the next 12 to 18 months or they give it back. So there&#8217;s this incredible pent-up demand to find opportunities for those SPACs to convert into companies. And the companies that are at the top of the charts, the ones that are the high-growth and profitable companies, will probably do a traditional IPO, I would imagine.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="A8AIZTgGb3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/">Almost everything you need to know about SPACs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Almost everything you need to know about SPACs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/embed/#?secret=A8AIZTgGb3" data-secret="A8AIZTgGb3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>[SPAC candidates are] going to be companies that are growing fast enough to be attractive as a potential public company but not top of the charts. I think [sponsors are] going to target companies that are probably either growing slightly slower than the top-quartile public companies but slightly profitable, or companies that are growing faster but still burning a lot of cash and might actually scare all the traditional IPO investors.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are you having conversations with CEOs about whether or not they should pursue this avenue?</strong></p>
<p>JG: We just started having those conversations now. There are several companies in the portfolio that will probably be public companies in the next year or two, so it&#8217;s definitely an alternative to consider. I would say there&#8217;s nothing impending I see in the portfolio. With most entrepreneurs, there&#8217;s a little bit of this dream of going public the traditional way, where SPACs tend to be a little bit less exciting from that perspective. So for a company that maybe is thinking about another private round before going public, it&#8217;s like a private-plus round. I would say it&#8217;s a tweener, so the companies that are considering it are probably ones that are not quite ready to go public yet.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of the SPAC fundraising has seemed like a reaction to uncertainty around when the public window might close. With the election behind us, do you think there&#8217;s less uncertainty?</strong></p>
<p>JG: I don&#8217;t think risk and uncertainty has decreased since the election. There&#8217;s still uncertainty right now politically. The pandemic has reemerged in a significant way, even though we have some really good announcements recently regarding vaccines or potential vaccines. So there&#8217;s just a lot of potential directions things could head in.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an environment generally where the public markets tend to gravitate more toward higher-quality opportunities, so fewer companies but higher quality,Â  and that&#8217;s where SPACs could play a role. In the first half of next year, I could easily see SPACs being the more likely go-to-market for a public company, then the latter half of next year, once the vaccines have kicked in and people feel like we&#8217;re returning to somewhat normal, I could see the traditional IPO coming back.</p>
<p><strong>TC: When we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/06/top-vcs-on-the-changing-landscape-for-enterprise-startups/">sat down</a> in person about a year ago, you said Emergence looks at maybe 1,000 deals a year, does deep due diligence on 25 and funds just a handful or so of these startups every year. How has that changed in 2020?</strong></p>
<p>JG: I would say that over the last five years, we&#8217;ve made almost a total transition. Now we&#8217;re very much a data-driven, thesis-driven outbound firm, where we&#8217;re reaching out to entrepreneurs soon after they&#8217;ve started their companies or gotten seed financing. The last three investments that we made were all relationships that [date back] a year to 18 months before we started engaging in the actual financing process with them. I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s required to build a relationship and the conviction, because financings are happening so fast.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re going to actually do more investments this year than we maybe have ever done in the history of the firm, which is amazing to me [considering] COVID. I think we&#8217;ve really honed our ability to build this pipeline and have conviction, and then in this market environment, Zoom is actually helping expand the landscape that we&#8217;re willing to invest in. We&#8217;re probably seeing 50% to 100% more companies and trying to whittle them down over time and really focus on the 20 to 25 that we want to dig deep on as a team.</p>
<p><strong>TC: For founders trying to understand your thinking, what&#8217;s interesting to you right now?</strong></p>
<p>JG: We tend to focus on three major themes at any one time as a firm, and one we&#8217;ve termed &#8216;coaching networks.&#8217; This is this intersection between AI and machine learning and human interaction. Companies like [the sales engagement platform] <a href="https://salesloft.com/">SalesLoft</a> or [the knowledge management system] <a href="https://www.getguru.com/">Guru</a> or Drishti [which sells video analytics for manual factory assembly lines] fall into this category.</p>
<p>The second [theme] is going deep into more specific industry verticals. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-16/veeva-ipo-generates-300-fold-return-for-emergence-capital-1-">Veeva</a> was the best example of this early on with with healthcare and life sciences, but we now have one called <a href="https://www.project44.com/">p44</a> in the transportation space that&#8217;s doing incredibly well. <a href="https://www.doximity.com/">Doximity</a> is in the healthcare space and going deep like a LinkedIn for physicians, with some remote health capabilities. And then [lending company] <a href="https://blend.com/">Blend</a>, which is in the financial services area. These companies are taking cloud software and just going deep into the most important problems of their industries.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="6iCFvC03nQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/">Zoom&#8217;s earliest investors are betting millions on a better Zoom for schools</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zoom&#8217;s earliest investors are betting millions on a better Zoom for schools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/embed/#?secret=6iCFvC03nQ" data-secret="6iCFvC03nQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The third theme [centers around] remote work. Zoom, which has obviously has been [among our] best investments is almost a platform, just like Salesforce became a platform after many years. We just funded a company called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/class-for-zoom-earliest-investors-are-betting-millions/">ClassEDU</a>, which is a Zoom-specific offering for the education market. Snowflake is becoming a platform. So another opportunity is is not just trying to come up with another collaboration tool, but really going deep into a specific use case or vertical.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What&#8217;s a company you&#8217;ve missed in recent years and were any lessons learned?</strong></p>
<p>JG: We have our hall of shame. [Laughs.] I do think it&#8217;s dangerous to assume that things would have turned out the same if if we had been investors in the company. I believe the kinds of investors you put around the table make a difference in terms of the outcome of your company, so I try to not beat myself up too much on the missed opportunities because maybe they found a better fit or a better investor for them to be successful.</p>
<p>But Rob Bernshteyn of <a href="https://www.coupa.com/">Coupa</a> is one where I knew Rob from SuccessFactors [where he was a product marketing VP], and I just always respected and liked him. And we were always chasing it on valuation. And I think I think we probably turned it down at an $80 million or $100 million valuation [and it&#8217;s valued at] $20 billion today. That can keep you up at night.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the moment, there are some risks and concerns about the business and there are other people who are willing to be more aggressive and so you lose out on some of those opportunities. The beautiful thing about our business is that it&#8217;s not a zero-sum game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">3D-rendered faces are a big part of any major movie or game now, but the task of capturing and animating them in a natural way can be a tough one. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/disney-research" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="disney-research">Disney Research <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is working on ways to smooth out this process, among them a machine learning tool that makes it <a href="https://studios.disneyresearch.com/2020/11/25/semantic-deep-face-models/">much easier to generate and manipulate 3D faces</a> without dipping into the uncanny valley.</p>
<p>Of course this technology has come a long way from the wooden expressions and limited details of earlier days. High-resolution, convincing 3D faces can be animated quickly and well, but the subtleties of human expression are not just limitless in variety, they&#8217;re very easy to get wrong.</p>
<p>Think of how someone&#8217;s entire face changes when they smile â it&#8217;s different for everyone, but there are enough similarities that we fancy we can tell when someone is &#8220;really&#8221; smiling or just faking it. How can you achieve that level of detail in an artificial face?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Existing &#8220;linear&#8221; models simplify the subtlety of expression, making &#8220;happiness&#8221; or &#8220;anger&#8221; minutely adjustable, but at the cost of accuracy â they can&#8217;t express every possible face, but can easily result in impossible faces. Newer neural models learn complexity from watching the interconnectedness of expressions, but like other such models their workings are obscure and difficult to control, and perhaps not generalizable beyond the faces they learned from. They don&#8217;t enable the level of control an artist working on a movie or game needs, or result in faces that (humans are remarkably good at detecting this) are just <em>off</em> somehow.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/awnqYKNJamU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>A team at Disney Research proposes a new model with the best of both worlds â what it calls a &#8220;semantic deep face model.&#8221; Without getting into the exact technical execution, the basic improvement is that it&#8217;s a neural model that learns how a facial expression affects the whole face, but is not specific to a single face â and moreover is nonlinear, allowing flexibility in how expressions interact with a face&#8217;s geometry and each other.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: A linear model lets you take an expression (a smile, or kiss, say) from 0-100 on any 3D face, but the results may be unrealistic. A neural model lets you take a learned expression from 0-100 realistically, but only on the face it learned it from. <em>This</em> model can take an expression from 0-100 smoothly on any 3D face. That&#8217;s something of an over-simplification, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>The results are powerful: You could generate a thousand faces with different shapes and tones, and then animate all of them with the same expressions without any extra work. Think how that could result in diverse CG crowds you can summon with a couple clicks, or characters in games that have realistic facial expressions regardless of whether they were hand-crafted or not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a silver bullet, and it&#8217;s only part of a huge set of improvements artists and engineers are making in the various industries where this technology is employed â markerless face tracking, better skin deformation, realistic eye movements and dozens more areas of interest are also important parts of this process.</p>

<p>The promise of the <a href="https://www.brilliant.tech/home">Brilliant Controls</a>Â panel is to provide a dedicated place to control your myriad smart home devices, all while adding a few remotely controllable light switches to your walls. It&#8217;s got a built-in camera (with a physical privacy shutter) that you can use for room-to-room video chats, or to check up on your home while you are away.Â Supported devices include Wemo smart plugs, Ring alarms,Â SonosÂ speakers, Philips Hue and Lifx lights, as well Schlage, Yale and August locks,Â among others. The number of integrations keeps growing and covers most of the major brands, but if youâve bet on other systems, this isnât the controller for you. It comes with built-in Alexa support and works with the Google Assistant, too.</p>

<p>Smart thermostats are fairly ubiquitous these days, but depending on which one youâre using, you could be getting a lot more from your home heating and cooling with relatively simple DIY upgrades. TheÂ <a href="https://flair.co">Flair Smart Vent</a> system is one such upgrade, and though it costs a bit upfront to get going (each register is $79 to start, depending on size â and you&#8217;ll need at least one control puck to act as a hub, which adds around $100 to the cost of entry) you wonât have to call an HVAC contractor or break down any walls to take advantage of what it offers.</p>
<p><strong>Price:Â </strong>Around $200 for a starter kit that includes one register and one puck, <a href="https://flair.co/pages/catalog#">direct from Flair</a></p>

<p>Many smart home gadgets focus on convenience or automation of typically manual tasks, butÂ <a href="https://flumewater.com">Flumeâs</a>Â smart water sensor provides a potentially much more vital service: the ability to track how much water youâre consuming and alert you to potential leaks in your homeâs plumbing. The company just released itsÂ second-generation Flume Smart Home Water Monitor ($199), and the device is easier to set up and smarter than ever.</p>

<p>Think of the <a href="https://sensibo.com">Sensibo</a> as a smart thermostat for those who do not have a central/heating cooling unit. If a person has a window air conditioner, portable room heater or modern heat pump &#8212; any device that has a remote control &#8212; the Senisbo will control the temperature. The latest version retails for $149 (it&#8217;s often on sale) and works great. If you have multiple heating and cooling devices, get a couple of these devices to have complete control.</p>
<p>The company launched in TechCrunch&#8217;s Hardware Battlefield competition in 2015 and has since evolved the product into a powerful platform that can automate a person&#8217;s heating and cooling needs.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Starts at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MTGD3D9/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07MTGD3D9&amp;linkId=53c23145826d30531dfb81f47d47e7d1">$115 on Amazon</a></p>

<p>There are countless DIY smart home kits on the market and Adafruit has a great collection. The <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4116">company&#8217;s PyPortal</a> is a great jumping off point as it provides the builder with a touchscreen display and basic computing platform that allows for all sorts of uses. With just this kit, a person could build a smart alarm, smart display or Amazon Echo clone.</p>

<p><a href="https://us-shop.nanoleaf.me">Nanoleaf</a> products work like interactive, programmable art displays&#8230; and, for bonus points, they look like something out of a sci-fi movie. Once you&#8217;ve snapped the modular panels together, you can tie them into HomeKit, Alexa, Google Home, or if you&#8217;re feeling fancy, use services like IFTTT to programmatically recolor the lights based on the weather outside, or flash whenever you&#8217;ve got an incoming message. The kits with everything you&#8217;d need to get started (the controller, power plug, and a handful of panels) start at around $150-200, while expansion packs with more panels go for around $60-70 â so it&#8217;s not a cheap hobby, but you can start with just a few panels and build up over time if you&#8217;re so inclined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robots are no longer the high-tech tools reserved for university labs, e-commerce giants and buzzy Silicon Valley startups. The local grocer now has access too.</span></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tortoise-dev" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tortoise-dev">Tortoise, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the one-year-old Silicon Valley startup known for its remote repositioning electric scooters, has taken its tech and adapted it to delivery carts. The company recently partnered with online grocery platform Self Point to provide neighborhood stores and specialty brand shops with electric carts that â with help from remote teleoperators â deliver goods to local consumers.</p>
<p>The companies have launched the product offering in Los Angeles with three customers. Each customer, which includes Kosher Express, has two to three carts that can be used to make deliveries up to a three-mile radius from the store. Unlike the network models used by some autonomous sidewalk delivery companies, grocery stores lease the delivery carts and are responsible for storage, charging and packing it up with goods that their customers have ordered.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The initial Self Point/Tortoise launch is small. But it has the makings of expanding far beyond Los Angeles. More importantly for Tortoise, it&#8217;s a validation of the company&#8217;s larger vision to make remote repositioning a horizontal business with numerous applications.</p>
<p>Tortoise started by equipping electric scooters with cameras, electronics and firmware that allow teleoperators in distant locales to drive the micromobility devices to a rider or deliver it back to its proper parking spot. Now, it has taken that same hardware and software and used it to build its own delivery cart.</p>
<p>TortoiseÂ co-founder and president Dmitry Shevelenko has said the company&#8217;s remote repositioning kit can be used for security and cleaning bots as well as electric wheelchairs and other accessibility devices. He&#8217;s even fielded inquiries from farmers interested in using remote repositioning scooters to monitor crops.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a practical point of view we&#8217;re not trying to not be everywhere overnight, but there&#8217;s really no technological constraint for us,&#8221; Shevelenko said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>The emergence of COVID-19 and its effects on consumer behavior prompted Tortoise to home in on delivery carts as its second act.</p>
<p>&#8220;We kind of quickly realized that we&#8217;re living in a once-in-a-generation change in consumer behavior where now everything is online and people are expecting it to be delivered same day,&#8221; Shevelenko said. Tortoise was able to go from the first renderings in May to a delivery cart launch by the fourth quarter because of its ability to repurpose its hardware, software and workforce.</p>
<p>The company still remains bullish on its initial application in micromobility. Earlier this year, Tortoise, GoX and and tech incubator Curiosity Labs launched a six-month pilot in Peachtree Corners, Georgia that allows riders to use an app to hail a scooter. The scooters are outfitted with Tortoise&#8217;s tech. Once riders hail the scooter, a Tortoise employee hundreds of miles away remote controls the scooter to the user. After riders complete trips, the scooters drive themselves back to a safe parking spot. From there, GoX employees charge and sanitize the scooters and then mark them with a sticker that indicates they have been properly cleaned.</p>
<p>While partnership with Self Point is Tortoise&#8217;s next big project, Shevelenko was quick to note that the company is only focused on one slice of the on-demand delivery pie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Low speeds and hot foods don&#8217;t work too well,&#8221; he said. Startups such as Kiwibot and Starship have smaller robots that focus on that market, Shevelenko added. Tortoise&#8217;s delivery carts were designed specifically to hold large amounts of groceries, alcohol and other goods.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw kind of a big opening in grocery,&#8221; he said, adding that relying on remote operators and its kit is a low-cost combination that can be used today while automated technology continues to develop. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing for last-mile delivery what globalized call centers did for customer support.&#8221;</p>
