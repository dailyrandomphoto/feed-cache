										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://krisp.ai/">Krisp</a>, a startup that uses machine learning to remove background noise from audio in real time, has raised $9M as an extension of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/krisp-snags-5m-a-round-as-demand-grows-for-its-voice-isolating-algorithm/">$5M A round announced last summer</a>. The extra money followed big traction in 2020 for the Armenian company, which grew its customers and revenue by more than an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/krisp-reduces-noise-on-calls-using-machine-learning-and-its-coming-to-windows-soon/">first covered Krisp</a> when it was just emerging from UC Berkeley&#8217;s Skydeck accelerator, and founder Davit Baghdasaryan was relatively freshly out of his previous role at Twilio. The company&#8217;s pitch when I chatted with them in the shared office back then was simple, and remains the core of what they offer: isolation of the human voice from any background noise (including other voices) so that audio contains only the former.</p>
<p>It probably comes as no surprise, then, that the company appears to have benefited immensely from the shift to virtual meetings and other trends accelerated by the pandemic. To be specific, Baghdasaryan told me that 2020 brought the company a 20x increase in active users, a 23x increase in enterprise accounts, and 13x improvement of annual recurring revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The rise in virtual meetings — often in noisy places like, you know, homes — has led to significant uptake across multiple industries. Krisp now has more than 1,200 enterprise customers, Baghdasaryan said: banks, HR platforms, law firms, call centers — anyone who benefits from having a clear voice on the line (&#8220;I guess any company qualifies,&#8221; he added). Enterprise-oriented controls like provisioning and central administration have been added to make it easier to integrate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113198" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113198" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113198" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png" alt="Illustration of six people using a video chat app." width="1024" height="672" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png 1723w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=1536,1007 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/krisp-teams.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113198" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Krisp</p></div></p>
<p>B2B revenue recently eclipsed B2C; the latter was likely popularized by Krisp&#8217;s inclusion as an option in popular gaming (and increasingly beyond) chat app Discord, though of course users of a free app being given a bonus product for free aren&#8217;t always big converters to &#8220;pro&#8221; tiers of a product.</p>
<p>But the company hasn&#8217;t been standing still, either. While it began with a simple feature set (turning background noise on and off, basically) Krisp has made many upgrades to both its product and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Noise cancellation for high-fidelity voice channels makes the software useful for podcasters and streamers, and acoustic correction (removing room echos) simplifies those setups quite a bit as well. Considering the amount of people doing this and the fact that they&#8217;re often willing to pay, this could be a significant source of income.</p>
<p>The company plans to add cross-service call recording and tracking; since it sits between the system&#8217;s sound drivers and the application, Krisp can easily save the audio and other useful metadata (How often did person A talk vs person B? What office locations are noisiest?). And the addition of voice cancellation — other people&#8217;s voices, that is — could be a huge benefit for people who work, or anticipate returning to work, in crowded offices and call centers.</p>
<p>Part of Krisp&#8217;s allure is the ability to run locally and securely on many platforms with very low overhead. But companies with machine learning based products can stagnate quickly if they don&#8217;t improve their infrastructure or build more efficient training flows — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/with-ai-translation-service-that-rivals-professionals-lengoo-attracts-new-20m-round/">Lengoo</a>, for instance, is taking on giants in the translation industry with better training as more or less its main advantage.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aiYmh1bJvl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/with-ai-translation-service-that-rivals-professionals-lengoo-attracts-new-20m-round/">With AI translation service that rivals professionals, Lengoo attracts new $20M round</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With AI translation service that rivals professionals, Lengoo attracts new $20M round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/with-ai-translation-service-that-rivals-professionals-lengoo-attracts-new-20m-round/embed/#?secret=aiYmh1bJvl" data-secret="aiYmh1bJvl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Krisp has been optimizing and re-optimizing its algorithms to run efficiently on both Intel and ARM architectures, and decided to roll its own servers instead of renting from the usual suspects.</p>
<p>&#8220;AWS, Azure and Google Cloud turned out to be too expensive,&#8221; Baghdasaryan said. &#8220;We have invested in building a datacenter with Nvidia&#8217;s latest A100s in them. This will make our experimentation faster, which is crucial for ML companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baghdasaryan was also emphatic in his satisfaction with the team in Armenia, where he&#8217;s from and where the company has focused its hiring, including the 25-strong R&amp;D crew. &#8220;By the end of 2021 it will be a 45 member team, all in Armenia,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are super happy with the math, physics and engineering talent pool there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding amounts to $14M if you combine the two disparate parts of the A round, the latter of which was agreed to just three months after the first. That&#8217;s a lot of money, of course, but may seem relatively modest for a company with a thousand enterprise customers and revenue growing by more than 2,000 percent year-over-year.</p>
<p>Baghdasaryan said they just weren&#8217;t ready to take on a whole B round, with all that involves. They do plan a new fundraise later this year when they&#8217;ve reached $15M ARR, a goal that seems perfectly reasonable given their current charts.</p>
<p>Of course startups with this kind of growth tend to get snapped up by larger concerns, but despite a few offers Baghdasaryan says he&#8217;s in it for the long haul — and a multi-billion dollar market.</p>
<p>The rush to embrace the new virtual work economy may have spurred Krisp&#8217;s growth spurt, but it&#8217;s clear that neither the company nor the environment that let it thrive are going anywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Efficient and cost-effective vaccine distribution remains one of the biggest challenges of 2021, so it’s no surprise that startup <a href="https://www.notablehealth.com">Notable Health</a> wants to use their automation platform to help. Initially started to help address the nearly <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/reports/2019/04/08/468302/excess-administrative-costs-burden-u-s-health-care-system/">$250 billion annual administrative costs in healthcare</a>, Notable Health launched in 2017 to use automation to replace time-consuming and repetitive simple tasks in health industry admin. In early January of this year, they announced plans to use that technology as a way to help manage vaccine distribution.</p>
<p>“As a physician, I saw firsthand that with any patient encounter, there are 90 steps or touchpoints that need to occur,” said Notable Health medical director Muthu Alagappan in an interview. “It’s our hypothesis that the vast majority of those points can be automated.”</p>
<p>Notable Health’s core technology is a platform that uses robotic process automation (RPA), natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to find eligible patients for the COVID-19 vaccine. Combined with data provided by hospital systems’ electronic health records, the platform helps those qualified to receive the vaccine set up appointments and guides them to other relevant educational resources.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;By leveraging intelligent automation to identify, outreach, educate and triage patients, health systems can develop efficient and equitable vaccine distribution workflows,” said Notable Health strategic advisor and Biden Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board Member Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/notable-health-first-to-launch-automated-identification-and-engagement-of-patients-eligible-for-covid-19-vaccine-301208397.html?tc=eml_cleartime">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Making vaccine appointments has been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/covid-vaccines-all-i-did-was-cry-elderly-americans-struggle-to-set-up-covid-vaccine-shots-.html">especially difficult for older Americans</a>, many of whom have reportedly struggled with navigating scheduling websites. Alagappan sees that as a design problem. “Technology often gets a bad reputation, because it’s hampered by the many bad technology experiences that are out there,” he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Robotic process automation platform UiPath raises $750M at $35B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/embed/#?secret=NtX7ubUJnH" data-secret="NtX7ubUJnH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Instead, he thinks Notable Health has kept the user in mind through a more simplified approach, asking users only for basic and easy-to-remember information through a text message link. “It’s that emphasis on user-centric design that I think has allowed us to still have really good engagement rates even with older populations,” he said.</p>
<p>While the startup’s platform will likely help hospitals and health systems develop a more efficient approach to vaccinations, its use of RPA and NLP holds promise for future optimization in healthcare. Leaders of similar technology in other industries have already gone on to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">multi-billion dollar valuations</a>, and continue to attract investors’ interest.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7325854/">expected to grow in healthcare over the next several years</a>, but Alagappan argues that combining that with other, more readily available intelligent technologies is also an important step towards improved care. “When we say intelligent automation, we’re really referring to the marriage of two concepts: artificial intelligence—which is knowing what to do—and robotic process automation—which is knowing how to do it,” he said. That dual approach is what he says allows Notable Health to bypass administrative bottlenecks in healthcare, instructing bots to carry out those tasks in an efficient and adaptable way.</p>
<p>So far, Notable Health has worked with several hospital systems across multiple states in using their platform for vaccine distribution and scheduling, and are now using the platform to reach out to tens of thousands of patients per day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is excited to announce that Zoom chief revenue officer (CRO) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanazus/">Ryan Azus</a> is joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=zoompost">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> on April 1.</p>
<p>Azus has worked at Cisco, RingCentral and most recently Zoom. In his previous roles he held a number of sales titles, including his final role at RingCentral where he was its executive vice president of global sales and services.</p>
<p>Zoom needs little introduction, having crossed over from enterprise software success story <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/remote-work-helps-zoom-grow-169-in-one-year-posting-328-2m-q1-revenue/">to consumer phenomenon during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, during which time companies, groups, individuals and families leaned on the video chat provider to stay in touch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9NXnrrGtuZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/remote-work-helps-zoom-grow-169-in-one-year-posting-328-2m-q1-revenue/">Remote work helps Zoom grow 169% in one year, posting $328.2M in Q1 revenue</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Remote work helps Zoom grow 169% in one year, posting $328.2M in Q1 revenue&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/remote-work-helps-zoom-grow-169-in-one-year-posting-328-2m-q1-revenue/embed/#?secret=9NXnrrGtuZ" data-secret="9NXnrrGtuZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Azus has been at the helm of Zoom&#8217;s money engine since mid-2019, which means that he has sat atop it during one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/zooms-q2-report-details-some-of-the-most-extraordinary-growth-ive-ever-seen/">most impressive periods of sales growth</a> at any software company &#8212; ever.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re glad that he&#8217;ll be at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=zoompost">TC Early Stage</a> this year, where we&#8217;ll pepper him with questions. Bring your own, of course, as we&#8217;ll be reserving around half our time for audience Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>But the TechCrunch crew has a plethora of things we want to chat about too, including the importance of bottom-up sales during the pandemic, especially in contrast to the more traditional sales bullpen model that many startups have historically used; how to balance self-service sales and human-powered sales at a tech company that presents both options to customers, and their relative strength in 2021; changes to sales incentive metrics at Zoom over time from which startups might be able to learn; and how to maintain order and culture in a quickly scaling, remote sales organization.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also curious how Zoom managed to adapt to the pandemic itself, like how long it took the company to reach full-strength from a sales perspective as it moved to remote work and customers that were also out of the office. The simple answer is that his company simply used more of its own product, but there&#8217;s more to the story that we want to hear.</p>

<p>Often at TechCrunch events we round up a cadre of executives from well-known technology companies and then hammer them for news. Early Stage is a bit different, focusing instead on extracting knowledge, tips and what-pitfalls-to-avoid from tech folks interested in helping startups do more, more quickly.</p>
<p>Azus won&#8217;t be coming alone. <a href="https://twitter.com/buckymoore?lang=en">Bucky Moore</a> from Kleiner will be in the house, along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nealsalesgriffin/">Neal Sales-Griffin</a> (a managing director at Techstars) and <a href="https://twitter.com/EghosaO">Eghosa Omoigui</a> (a managing general partner at EchoVC Partners). The list goes on, as you can see <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/#6db46596-2ca9-43aa-bbb6-9a7aab71bf62">here</a>. (We&#8217;re also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/announcing-the-tc-early-stage-pitch-off/">having a big pitch-off</a>, so make sure to come to both days of the event.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If we are not careful, every entry of this column could consist of SPAC news.</p>
<p>Special purpose acquisition companies, or blank-check companies, whatever you prefer to call them, are enormous business today. But they aren&#8217;t the only thing going on, and we&#8217;ll get to other things shortly. Consider this an apology for having written about SPACs twice in two days.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/investors-spac-push-could-revamp-the-private-market-money-game/">considered the rise of the VC-led SPAC</a> and whether venture capital groups that offer seed-through-SPAC money will wind up with advantage in the market over firms that specialize on any particular startup stage. Sticking to the blank-check theme, this morning we&#8217;re looking into two SPAC-led deals, namely those involving Rover and MoneyLion.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>We&#8217;re doubling up to prevent more SPAC-related posts. And we&#8217;ve selected Rover because Chewy, another pet-themed entity, is an already-public company. As <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rover-com/company_financials">both were venture-backed</a>, we may be able to contrast their trading performance post-debut. Sadly, Chewy is focused on pet e-commerce while Rover is more centered around pet services, but they may prove close enough for some loose comparisons.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>And why chat about MoneyLion? Because it&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/moneylion/company_financials">heavily venture-backed fintech startup</a>, one that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/us-mobile-bank-moneylion-raises-100-million-at-near-unicorn-valuation/">TechCrunch has covered extensively</a>. If its SPAC-assisted vault into the public markets goes well, it could smooth the same path forward for myriad other yet-private fintechs sitting atop a mountain of raised capital.</p>
<p>So this <em>is</em> a SPAC post, but as we&#8217;ll largely be looking at the financial health of two companies that we&#8217;ve heard about for ages and never got to see inside of, I hope you join me all the same.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re starting with the Rover investor presentation, before zipping over to MoneyLion&#8217;s own.</p>
<h2>Rover</h2>
<p>Rover is <a href="https://www.rover.com/blog/press-release/rover-announces-business-combination/">merging</a> with Nebula Caravel Acquisition Corp., which is affiliated with <a href="https://www.truewindcapital.com/portfolio">True Wind Capital</a>. The deal gives Rover an anticipated market cap of around $1.6 billion, with around $300 million in cash on its books.</p>
<p>So, how attractive is this new unicorn? You can find its investor deck <a href="https://www.rover.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rover_Investor_Call_Presentation.pdf">here</a>, if you want to read along as we peek.</p>
<p>First up, the company stresses rising use of digital services in the last year thanks to the pandemic and the fact that pet ownership is growing. Both of which are true. We&#8217;ve seen the accelerating digital transformation for both companies <em>and</em> consumers. And if you&#8217;ve tried to adopt a pet lately, you&#8217;ve seen how few are left waiting for forever homes.</p>
<p>With those things behind it, you might be wondering why Rover is pursuing a SPAC-led debut as well. If its market is hot and it has previously raised venture capital, why not just go public via an IPO? Because 2020 was tough on the company.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2113578" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-11.47.31-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="320" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-11.47.31-AM.png 1056w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-11.47.31-AM.png?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-11.47.31-AM.png?resize=300,141 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-11.47.31-AM.png?resize=768,361 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-11.47.31-AM.png?resize=680,320 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-16-at-11.47.31-AM.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Revenue dipped from $95 million in 2019 to just $48 million last year. Bookings fell from 4.2 million to 2.4 million over the same time frame, leading to gross booking value falling from $436 million in 2019 to $233 million in 2020. Why? Because everyone was stuck at home. With their pets. A situation that limited demand for Rover-delivered pet services.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, the Kanban board-centric project management tool <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/atlassian-acquires-trello/?_ga=2.53581992.1873979552.1613357161-1848710987.1592239160">acquired by Atlassian in 2017</a>, today launched what is likely one of its most important updates in recent years. With significantly more than 50 million users, Trello is one of the most popular project management tools around ,and in many ways, it brought digital Kanban boards to the mainstream. That focus doesn&#8217;t change with today&#8217;s release, but the team is now adding a slew of new board views and new capabilities to the individual cards that make up those views, with a special focus on bringing more data from third-party tools right into those cards. That&#8217;s in addition to a number of changes to the overall look and feel of the service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years, we&#8217;ve built this huge, passionate audience of people,&#8221; Michael Pryor, Trello&#8217;s co-founder and now Atlassian&#8217;s head of Trello, told me ahead of today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We have way over 50 million signups &#8212; and that 50 million numbers is from 2018 or something, they won&#8217;t let me yet give out the current number. [&#8230;] Then last year, the pandemic hits. We talked about the future of work, right? And then, all of a sudden, it was like: nope, that&#8217;s just work. That&#8217;s how everyone works. Now, it&#8217;s all distributed. We just compressed it all at once. And we had this overnight shift. We would talk previously about this explosion of apps, we would talk about all the browser tabs, people getting lost in information sprawl. Now, it&#8217;s just turned up to eleven.&#8221;</p>
<p>The behind a lot of the new features was to make it easier for users to do more work inside of Trello and to get better macro views of what teams are working on themselves, but also what is happing across teams and inside an organization. In addition, the new Trello adds more ways to see data from other tools natively inside the service, without having to switch tools.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2113127" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trello-TimelineAdjustStartEnd.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113127" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113127" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trello-TimelineAdjustStartEnd.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="500" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113127" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p>In practice, that means Trello is adding five new views to Trello (and making it easy to switch between them): team table view for tracking cross-company or cross-project work in a spreadsheet-like fashion; timeline view for managing roadblocks and making data adjustments; calendar view for tracking deadline and time-sensitive tasks; map view for users who have location-based projects; and finally dashboard view for better visualizing success metrics and building reports.</p>
<p>For the most part, the names here are self-explanatory. What&#8217;s maybe the most interesting feature here, though, is that the new team table view is Trello&#8217;s first view that brings in multiple boards.</p>
<p>&#8220;It raises your perspective up to the portfolio level &#8212; not just at a single board level,&#8221; Pryor said. &#8220;Eventually, all the views will do that same thing and so we will essentially have this ability that if you&#8217;re on a board, you can pivot your cards and look at them depending on what the project is and how you need them.&#8221; The idea here, he explained, was to use and extend Trello&#8217;s existing visual language to add these shared perspectives.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s also important here is that Trello plans to open this feature to third parties that may want to build their own views as well. The Trello team itself, for example, built a slide view that automatically creates slides for all of the cards in a project to make it easy for somebody to present them in a meeting, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113125" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trello-TableSort.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113125" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113125" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trello-TableSort.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="500" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113125" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p>Pryor argues that what Trello is doing with its new cards, though, is maybe even more important. The team is adding over 30 new card types where, just by adding a URL that links to YouTube, Google Drive, Figma, JIRA  or even other Trello boards, you&#8217;ll be able to see previews of what you linked to right inside of Trello.</p>
<p>&#8220;What that does, I think, is that it elevates what that card represents from just being a thing that exists only within Trello to represent work that&#8217;s happening across all these other tools,&#8221; Pryor explained. &#8220;So now your JIRA tickets can exist alongside your Trello cards. And you&#8217;re categorizing that and moving and talking about it in a way that&#8217;s independent of what&#8217;s happening in JIRA &#8212; it could be connected to it, but it adds this ability to create a dashboard that brings all that work into one place.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113126" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trello-CalendarDragDrop.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113126" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2113126" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Trello-CalendarDragDrop.gif" alt="" width="1000" height="500" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2113126" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Atlassian</p></div></p>
<p>Pryor noted that the team wanted to leverage the simplicity and visual language that Trello&#8217;s users already love and then apply that to other tools. &#8220;We could get into a race and just build project management-type features. We&#8217;re really trying to build a project management app, instead of building an app that helps you manage all your projects. That&#8217;s distinct from going down this road where we&#8217;re just like: feature, feature, feature.&#8221; That approach, he argues, would just lead to bloat. Instead, the team wants to take its card metaphor, expand on that and allow its users to build new solutions inside of Trello, using a visual language they are already familiar with.</p>
<p>Another new feature that&#8217;s coming soon &#8212; and one that the Trello community has been expecting for a while &#8212; is mirror cards, which essentially allow you to share the same card between boards. All you have to do is link from a source card to a card on a card on another board and that new card will look just like the original card.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://talkshop.live">Talkshoplive</a> is a startup that&#8217;s worked with stars like Paul McCartney and Garth Brooks, as well as small businesses, to host shopping-focused live videos. Today, it&#8217;s announcing that it has raised $3 million in seed funding from <a href="https://spero.vc">Spero Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>CEO Bryan Moore founded the company with his sister Tina in 2018. Moore previously led social media efforts at Twentieth Television (previously known as Twentieth Century Fox) and CBS Television, and he said he was inspired  to launch Talkshoplive by the rise of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/wechat-livestreaming-china-economy/">livestreamed shopping experiences in China</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, Moore said it wasn&#8217;t enough to just copy what worked in China: &#8220;Small businesses are different here, talent is different, the needs are different.&#8221; One of the keys, in his view, is to focus on helping creators and businesses meet their customers where those customers already are — which he also suggested differentiates Talkshoplive from competing services as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For one thing, the startup does not require consumers to download any additional apps in order to watch its videos. Instead, it&#8217;s created a video player that works on the Talkshoplive website, on the websites of its partners and anywhere else that videos can be embedded. And wherever those videos are played, they also include a one-click buy button.</p>

<p>Moore said Talkshoplive started out with a focus in books and music, working with famous names like Matthew McConaughey, Alicia Keys and Dolly Parton, as well as the aforementioned Brooks and McCartney. For example, Brooks used Talkshoplive to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danafeldman/2019/05/04/garth-brooks-sells-more-than-1m-vinyl-records-on-pre-order/?sh=7df94f0e51a5">exceed more than 1 million vinyl pre-sales</a> for his &#8220;Legacy Collection&#8221; box set in 2019.</p>
<p>On the book side, Talkshoplive has worked with publishers including Harper Collins, Penguin Random House, Simon &amp; Schuster and Macmillan. And Moore claimed the platform is driving three to nine times the sales an author would see on other e-commerce sites.</p>
<p>At the same time, he emphasized that the startup is also working with more than 3,500 small businesses, and he said that when a small business owner is broadcasting on Talkshoplive, &#8220;You&#8217;re creating your own micro-fandom by being able to tell the story &#8230; You&#8217;re making yourself a brand story, even as a small business.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;When you’re able to help people move $25,000 in a show — for a small business, that’s a huge deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this sense, Moore said he sees Talkshoplive as a continuation of his previous work in social media, all connected by the question, &#8220;How are you creating human connection in a digital landscape?&#8221; The &#8220;ultimate goal,&#8221; he added, is turn the platform into a &#8220;digital Main Street&#8221; for businesses everywhere.</p>
<p>More recently, Talkshoplive has been moving into other categories like food and beauty, and Moore said he&#8217;s excited to work with Spero Founding Partner Shripriya Mahesh (previously an executive at eBay and First Look Media) to &#8220;continually evolve our product and create these tools that help us scale faster — and also help benefit these businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>“From the moment we met the talkshoplive team, we were impressed with their focus on enabling SMB’s with a new, creative, innovative way to build their businesses,&#8221; Mahesh said in a statement. &#8220;Talkshoplive also innovates on the marketplace model with a way for buyers to truly engage with the sellers, get to know them, and experience shopping in a whole new way. We are incredibly excited by the community that is taking shape at talkshoplive and are thrilled to be working with Bryan, Tina, and the TSL team as they grow their community and the marketplace.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">I’m a Black man in America &#8212; that’s hard. Black founders, and uniquely Black founders in tech, are facing insurmountable odds.</p>
<p>As the recipients of less than 1% of venture capital raise, institutionalized systems are visibly at play. Within almost 10 years of my entrepreneurial journey, I have encountered just as many setbacks and failures as I have successes.</p>
<p>However, I have pressed forward despite the disparities that often plague the Black entrepreneurial community. From imbalances in fundraising to minimal capital and access, Black brilliance and its cloak of resilience continues to rise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now, as a CEO who has ambitiously raised nearly $13 million for my current venture, against the odds, I posit that it is not the Black founders who are missing out the most &#8212; it is the investors who are at a loss, not comprehending that they have underestimated the power of these founders’ Black brilliance.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Black founders need to own their resiliency and leverage the power that has resulted from their unique experiences.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When you think about the intersection of venture capital and technology, and specifically how it works &#8212; it is being led from an engineering perspective. Developers and coders historically go to specific schools and colleges, entering a funnel that guides them to success.</p>
<p>Historically, many Black students (more so Black male students), are influenced by sports as a vehicle to higher education and not necessarily the institutions recognized for technological prowess.</p>
<p>Their parents and community encourage athleticism because that is the only thing they know &#8212; as an institutionalized mindset reinforced over time. Unless they are guided into the accepted foundations for technology, or get into a Cal Berkeley, Stanford or Harvard, where many of the technology companies are built, they are immediately funneled outside of the “circle,” which sets the first of many ongoing obstacles for a Black tech founder.</p>
<p>I offer, however, that these “obstacles” are not in fact barriers but the crucial catalyst for these founders’ superpowers.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there were no entrepreneurs in my family. I did not have access to information about the best colleges. Despite having great grades and graduating with honors, I was completely unaware of how valuable an Ivy League education could be.</p>
<p>As a star basketball player, with my skills and grades, I could have played and graduated from somewhere like Yale, Brown, Columbia or even a school like Southern Methodist University where I was offered a full scholarship. But because of the lack of knowledge that I could actually do so and benefit from being inside the Ivy League &#8220;circle,&#8221; I didn’t.</p>
<p>I was in college from 2000 to 2004. A lot of great companies were started at elite schools during that period. It is this institutional blocking of information from myself and many other Black students that molded our overall perspective and created our glass ceilings.</p>
<p>Breaking through that glass ceiling, overcoming these odds to press forward relentlessly, with unyielding focus, and to hold conversations with the types of investors I have had to sit in front of, with the type of company that I have built, takes a different level of brilliance that only the Black experience can provide. For 2021 and beyond, Black founders need to not only recognize, but unlock that power as they look to fundraise and catapult their tech companies to success. It would be smart, and incredibly beneficial for investors, venture capitalists and the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem to take heed.</p>
<p>For Black founders, a paradigm shift is evident, but it can only manifest if implemented in these five ways.</p>
<h2><strong>Black founders: Forget what you think works in fundraising</strong></h2>
<p>Black founders and specifically Black tech founders are fed a monotonous script of how to raise money “the right way,” in light of disparaging statistics highlighting a lack of funding &#8212; so much that there is a robotic approach to the process. They try to become this cookie-cutter entrepreneur that is designed to raise money from investors, with <em>their</em> playbook and by <em>their </em>rules.</p>
<p>Black founders capitulate and conform to what society has dictated as appropriate fundraising, often glorifying the investor with the fate of their startup in their hands, without realizing that they hold the negotiating power. Their playbook hasn’t won us any games. As of today, own your power.</p>
<h2><strong>Become an irresistible force: Leverage your expertise</strong></h2>
<p>Set the playbook aside and lean more into your expertise and uniqueness.</p>
<p>Years ago, Mark Cuban delivered a keynote address at Dallas Startup Week that chronicled his road to success. One of his main points was to “Know your business, and know your business cold.” It was so simple, yet so impactful.</p>
<p>Early on in my career, I learned about venture capital from my experiences working for a startup. While I did not know the area in depth, I referenced what little knowledge I had as I raised for my own company years later. Although I was limited in my dealings with venture capitalists, I was confident in my background and expertise (at that time as a payroll technology sales professional) to truly stake my claim and seat at the table.</p>
<p>So while they may have sold a company for $7 billion or have $35 billion AUM (assets under management), I knew that they were not as well-versed in payroll or payroll technology than I was. It was this tenacious mindset that made me look <em>at</em> investors, rather than <em>up</em> to them, thereby positioning us on equal footing.</p>
<h2><strong>Connect in the common goal of brilliance</strong></h2>
<p>As a Black founder in tech, I have encountered many injustices &#8212; from networking to fundraising to the game of business as a whole. Even among those sitting at the table, there is a plethora of worldviews, political preferences, religious propensities and more that create a melting pot of divisiveness. However, recognizing that the common thread between all of the players in the game is the desire to be part of the brilliant business opportunity at hand is what will ultimately prevail.</p>
<p>It served me well not to overindex whether the venture capitalists liked me or on our differences. Locking in on the ambition of my entrepreneurial spirit and focusing on my brilliance &#8212; my Black brilliance &#8212; made them want to invest in me. Simplistically, investors want to give their money to founders who will make them money &#8212; passionately and ambitiously. Be you and find the investor that appreciates you.</p>
<h2><strong>Get in front of as many investors as you can</strong></h2>
<p>Black founders are not getting in front of enough investors. Systemically, the venture capital landscape has marginalized this community and has failed to expand their network for inclusiveness. Currently, ethnic minorities are severely underrepresented in the venture capital industry. Eighty percent of investment partners are white, with only a staggering 3% being Black or African-American.</p>
<p>Regardless, Black entrepreneurs must press forward and still show up. The sheer number of people that entrepreneurs must face during the fundraising process is astronomical, so one must not be swayed by the disillusionment of opportunity.</p>
<p>Realistically speaking, it takes a long time to raise money. Period. I have talked to thousands of potential investors to raise nearly $13 million for my current company. If you are a Black founder, it is going to take you longer to fundraise and you are going to have to get in front of more people. So I ask, &#8220;Do you have enough oxygen in the tank to withstand the obstacles, for a long enough period of time, to attract the venture capital that you need?<em>&#8221; </em>The wealth gap says no.</p>
<p>When I first started Gig Wage, the number one question I received from investors is, “How much runway do you have?” I would answer, “Until I get to where I need to get.” They would then rephrase, “How much money do you have in the bank? How long is your wife going to let you do this?” I would reply, “It does not matter how much money I have in the bank because I’m going to keep going until this happens.”</p>
<p>Discriminatively, there was this unspoken expectation that I lacked the financial wherewithal and stamina to withstand the fundraising process, and at times it was extremely discouraging &#8212; because to be honest, when I looked in the bank account, I realistically had about nine to 12 months of runway.</p>
<p>The reason Black people raise less than 1% of venture capital is because the racism weaved into the fabric of American society bleeds over into the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Despite it all, I took thousands of meetings. I was willing to endure with an ambitious conviction that I was going to win. Again, this is Black brilliance.</p>
<h2><strong>Own your resiliency, own your power </strong></h2>
<p>As a Black man, I have personally endured challenges to build resiliency &#8212; mirroring similar realities of other Black men in America. Whether it was dealing with the police or witnessing men in my family struggle with drugs, violence, poverty or the like &#8212; I often think, &#8220;Why would I be intimidated by an investor meeting or a term sheet?&#8221; The construct of America has dealt me much worse.</p>
<p>Black founders need to own their resiliency and leverage the power that has resulted from their unique experiences. The victory mentality that ensues thereafter is the type of mindset that venture capitalists should want to invest in, and if they do not, they are undoubtedly missing out.</p>
<p>The unyielding focus of “The world is stacked against me but I’m not going to quit. I’m going to pivot. I’m going to be resourceful. I’m going to figure it out &#8212; even if I’m scared,” is a person you need to invest in. It is not necessarily that they have a groundbreaking business idea, but culturally, Black people have a passion and a perspective that is unmatched, with limitless possibilities that venture capitalists are overlooking.</p>
<p>So for 2021 and well beyond, Black founders, and those especially in tech, need to shift their respective paradigms, own their place within the entrepreneurial space, take back their power and continue to operate at the utmost in Black brilliance. It is the investors, not the founders, that are missing out. Be bold. Be courageous. Be audacious.</p>
<p>As for me, the best thing that I can do right now is to continue to drive the conversation, illuminate the disparities and be as successful for Black entrepreneurs, Black professionals and the world at large as possible. I am owning my power and I’m committed to epitomizing and evangelizing Black brilliance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tackling the learning curve that comes with building a startup is not for the faint of heart. So many questions, so little time to search out reliable, actionable advice. Enter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1?promo=2weeksleftpost">TechCrunch Early Stage 2021</a> — two distinct, virtual bootcamps designed specifically for early-stage founders and open to entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts.</p>
<p><strong>Budget-friendly tips:</strong> TC Early Stage part one takes place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1?promo=2weeksleftpost">April 1-2</a>, and you have two weeks left to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1?promo=2weeksleftpost&amp;display=true">score the early bird price</a> and save up to $250. Founder passes cost $199 and Innovator passes (for investors and other startup fans) cost $299. The early-bird deadline ends at <strong>11:59 p.m. (PT) on February 27</strong>. Buy a dual-event pass to learn and save even more (TC Early Stage &#8211; Marketing and Fundraising runs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-2?promo=2weeksleftpost">July 8-9</a>). The TC Early Stage April and July bootcamps feature different speakers, topics and content.</p>
<p>At TC Early Stage, you’ll take part in interactive sessions and learn from the leading experts and investors who span the range of the startup ecosystem — operations, product lifecycle, fundraising and recruiting for starters. Here are just two examples of the people ready to help you move your startup dreams forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Learn from folks like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/alexa-von-tobel-brings-15-years-of-financial-savvy-to-early-stage-2021/">Alexa von Tobel </a>as she leads a discussion on Finance for Founders. Got questions about raising Series A funding? Don’t miss <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/kleiner-perkins-bucky-moore-will-outline-what-to-think-about-before-raising-a-series-a-at-early-stage-in-april/">Bucky Moore</a> of Kleiner Perkins as he breaks down that complicated topic.</p>
<p>Ready for an awesome plot twist? We’re adding an exciting opportunity on day two of both TC Early Stage bootcamps — the TC Early Stage Pitch-Off. Ten early-stage startups will get to pitch live to a global audience of investors, press and tech industry leaders. That kind of exposure can change a startup’s trajectory in the best possible way.</p>
<p>You’ll <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/announcing-the-tc-early-stage-pitch-off/">find all the Pitch-off details here</a> — how it works, who qualifies to compete, what competitors receive and the prizes in store for the ultimate winner. Or cut to the chase and <a href="https://tc692057.typeform.com/to/jNejpAvG">apply for the April 2 pitch-off here</a> before the clock hits 11:59 p.m. (PT) on February 21.</p>
<p>Whether you’re competing or watching, Katia Paramonova, founder and CEO of Centrly (who attended Early Stage 2020), says a pitch critique shows you ways to strengthen your pitch deck.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The pitch deck teardown session was great. VCs reviewed my deck and gave specific, actionable advice. Watching them provide comments on other decks was helpful, too. We’re incorporating the feedback and when we start fundraising, the improved slides will make it easier for VCs to understand our value proposition.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1?promo=2weeksleftpost">TC Early Stage Operations &amp; Fundraising</a> takes place on April 1-2. Don’t miss this opportunity to learn the essentials of building a stronger startup. And don’t miss out on early bird savings. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1?promo=2weeksleftpost&amp;display=true">Buy your pass</a> (remember, you’ll save more and learn twice as much with a dual-event pass) before 11:59 p.m. (PT) on February 27.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While companies have embraced the offerings of software-as-a-service companies with growing vigor, getting those new offerings to work in a seamless way from the outset isn&#8217;t so easy, with some business customers feeling forgotten as soon as the digital ink dries.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://onboard.io/">Onboard</a>, a 10-month-old, startup that aims to help SaaS businesses delight those new customers instead of turning them off.</p>
<p>The company was cofounded by CEO Jeff Epstein, who previously launched the referral marketing and affiliate marketing software company Ambassador, which sold in 2018, eight years after it was founded.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Terms of the sale to West Corporation &#8212; now Intrado &#8212; were never disclosed, but Epstein says it was a &#8220;good outcome&#8221; for shareholders. (Ambassador was <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/i2h-makes-another-acquisition-buying-ambassador-intrado">sold again</a> last month to a small Seattle company.)</p>
<p>As for how Onboard works, Epstein makes the process sound straightforward. &#8220;You determine the variables of your customer segment, because different plan types might mean that companies need to do something different.&#8221; (They could use an API or some code snippet, for example.) After that, Onboard works with the SaaS company to create a global task list with requirements it has hopefully gleaned from the sales process, and helps it create a kind of dynamic, drop-down task list with assignees and due dates and alerts and notifications.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s largely a self-service product that makes accountability more transparent, ultimately, though Epstein describes the onboarding process as a &#8220;shared responsibility&#8221; between his company and its customers. He also says his nascent startup is already working on building out a more sophisticated notification layer with automated nudges that are helpful yet not obnoxious.</p>
<p>The five-person company is not charging its dozens of beta customers right now. It wants to get the product right before it shifts into revenue gear, says Epstein. The plan eventually is to charge the types of customers it is chasing &#8212; mid-size companies &#8212; hundreds of dollars of month, plus a per-person-per-month fee. (&#8220;We don&#8217;t plan on being enterprise-y in any way,&#8221; says Epstein of the company&#8217;s plan to eschew long contracts.)</p>
<p>Onboard is not without competitors. On the contrary, a lot of upstarts have sprung up around this problematic slice of the enterprise universe. That it&#8217;s an aggravating period for many new customers was brought to Epstein&#8217;s attention by one of his cofounders, William Stevenson, who spent four years as Ambassador&#8217;s VP of customer success, where like a lot of people in his position at other companies, he was trying to make do with a less-than-ideal patchwork of offerings, sometimes from Monday or Asana or Basecamp or Google Docs.</p>
<p>It was the same problem that Jonathon Triest of Ludlow Ventures &#8212; whose firm quietly led a $1.25 million seed round for Onboard in late summer, joined by Zelkova Ventures and Detroit Venture Partners &#8212; says he know well.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2113554 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png" alt="" width="2872" height="1488" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png 2872w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png?resize=300,155 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png?resize=768,398 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png?resize=680,352 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png?resize=1536,796 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png?resize=2048,1061 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2872px) 100vw, 2872px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Over and over again, throughout our portfolio, especially in B2B SaaS sales,&#8221; Ludlow&#8217;s portfolio companies have been &#8220;forced to piece together solutions or use tools not made for them,&#8221; Triest says.</p>
<p>The question is whether Onboard can gain a foothold faster than some of its other rivals, and unsurprisingly, Epstein believes his team has what it takes to get started. (A third founder, Matt Majewski, more recently left Ambassador to help the company gain momentum.)</p>
<p>Epstein&#8217;s resume is helping, too, he says. As a founder in Detroit who sold a company, he&#8217;s known to local investors and then some. (&#8220;We were able to be a big fish in a small pond,&#8221; he says.)</p>
<p>Epstein also says that investors realize there&#8217;s &#8220;an opportunity generally in the space,&#8221; adding that &#8220;partners [from venture firms] have been calling&#8211; not associates &#8212; and they are coming through third-party connections on LinkedIn in some cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has &#8220;obviously raised a bit of money&#8221; in the past, Epstein says, but he hasn&#8217;t seen anything quite like this before. &#8220;It&#8217;s weird,&#8221; he adds, &#8220;but cool.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The creator movement has exploded in the last few years as platforms ranging from Substack to Clubhouse have made it easier than ever to reach an audience of willing readers and listeners. Yet the key to building sustainable creator businesses is the economics of these enterprises themselves. Get enough subscribers, and what often starts as a side hobby can quickly become a full-time job.</p>
<p><a href="https://circle.so">Circle</a> was founded in January 2020 to make engaging with paying customers and thus building creator businesses as effortless as possible. We profiled the NYC-based startup last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/circle-community-tools-for-creators/">when it announced its $1.5 million seed round in August</a>, discussing how its founder DNA originates in the online course platform Teachable. Since then, all signs point to very strong early growth.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aCZ5ahmMq5"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/circle-community-tools-for-creators/">Creators need better community tools &#8212; Circle wants to fill the gap</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Creators need better community tools &#8212; Circle wants to fill the gap&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/circle-community-tools-for-creators/embed/#?secret=aCZ5ahmMq5" data-secret="aCZ5ahmMq5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company surpassed $1 million ARR last month, and it already has 1,000 paying customers and is heading toward 2,000 paying communities. Usage is also growing rapidly, expanding 40-50% per month for both DAUs and MAUs, according to the company. It also brought its <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/circle-communities/id1509651625">iOS app</a> out of beta <a href="https://community.circle.so/c/product-updates/our-ios-app-has-launched">last month</a>.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Sid Yadav said that “we happened to catch the tide at the right time [with] the creator movement, the community movement.” So far, paying communities have been largely centered around “a lot of YouTubers, course creators, Twitch streamers, Patreon personalities” with Yadav estimating that 60% of the platform’s communities are “personality-led.” That said, “a lot of brands are starting to think of this creatively.”</p>
<p>All that positive news can’t be ignored by VCs too long. The company announced today that it has raised a $4 million seed round at a valuation “north of” $40 million, which closed late last year. The round was officially led by Notation Capital, which led the company’s pre-seed round last year, but the firm only took a quarter of a round according to Yadav.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113161" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113161" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2113161" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/circle-team-photo.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="390" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/circle-team-photo.png 2232w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/circle-team-photo.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/circle-team-photo.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/circle-team-photo.png?resize=768,440 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/circle-team-photo.png?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/circle-team-photo.png?resize=1536,881 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/circle-team-photo.png?resize=2048,1174 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/circle-team-photo.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2113161" class="wp-caption-text">Circle&#8217;s team has grown to 20 across multiple continents.

<p>Instead, much of the round’s allocations were handed out to the entrepreneurs building on the platform. “We had all of these offers from top-tier firms, but for the kind of product that we are — which is a creator platform — it made sense to allocate the round as much as possible to our customers,” Yadav said. According to the company, a majority of the round went to individual angels and community builders on the platform, among them Anne-Laure Le Cunff, David Perell, Tiago Forte and Nat Eliason.</p>
<p>Given the company’s early stage, product development remains the highest priority. “Our approach is like a Notion,” Yadav said, describing how Circle allows its communities to stitch together “building blocks” to lay out pages. Circle’s primary mode is through a <a href="https://community.circle.so/c/spaces/spaces">Space</a>, where community members can discuss topics with each other and the creator as well. Communities built on Circle can be white-labeled, with <a href="https://community.circle.so/c/customization/how-do-i-set-up-a-custom-root-domain">their own custom domains</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2112865" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112865" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2112865" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Circle-UI.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Circle-UI.png 2148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Circle-UI.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Circle-UI.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Circle-UI.png?resize=768,426 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Circle-UI.png?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Circle-UI.png?resize=1536,852 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Circle-UI.png?resize=2048,1137 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Circle-UI.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2112865" class="wp-caption-text">Circle&#8217;s community platform allows creators to publish content and engage with their community. Photo via Circle.</p></div></p>
<p>Circle’s ultimate goal is to integrate every tool a creator needs to engage with a customer under one roof, from publishing newsletters and podcasts to setting up streaming, event ticket sales, merchandise, and event calendars — all buttressed by a payments layer. Many of those features remain to be built on top of the company’s core community platform, but Yadav and his team are certainly ambitious in their expansive scope.</p>
<p>Circle’s team is now 20 people, with team members in Europe, India, Australia, and across the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After working as a general manager for Uber in Nevada, Jason Radisson realized the need for a way to connect blue-collar workers to companies looking to employ them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in late 2018, the idea for <a href="http://shiftone.net">Shift One</a> &#8212; a marketplace aimed at pairing workers and employers &#8212; was born. The startup is focused on last-mile logistics and delivery, e-commerce fulfillment and large-scale event management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since formally launching in 2019, Shift One has grown to have 25,000 workers on its platform &#8212; many of whom it says were unemployed at the time of hire. And it has about 50 clients in the U.S. and Colombia, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon, NASCAR, Weee!, Mensajeros Urbanos and the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It matches employers with workers, and also helps them with tasks such as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> time, taxes, attendance, productivity and work-order management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help it grow and further expand its reach, Shift One just raised a $5.2 million seed round led by </span><a href="https://citylight.vc/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">City Light Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with participation from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> K50 Ventures, Ventura Investments and Human Ventures, as well as Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen’s JAM fund and angel </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felipe Villamarin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the operations side, all of Shift One’s original team either worked for Uber or Lyft, according to founder and CEO Radisson. The early technical team were all previously Uber employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radisson says the impetus behind starting the company was the desire “to correct and improve some of the things in Gig 1.0.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wanted it to be more balanced for workers, and break some negative flywheels where people were cycling through a lot of logistics jobs and not getting paid well,” he told TechCrunch. “We wanted to give them stability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Radisson said, he knew that companies on the logistics side were struggling to find good workers. Shift One works with a range of skill levels, from entry-level employees to supervisors and warehouse managers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing that many logistics workers are used to working as contract employees with no benefits, Shift One gives all the workers on its platform full benefits with “low contributions” from the first day of hire. It also provides them with checking accounts and debit cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of these workers are unbanked and didn’t have the ability to even get a paycheck,” Radisson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also aims to give them “full schedules” and have them work on whole teams as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s part of our value prop that our teams are cohesive and really high functioning,” he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now, San Francisco-based Shift One has been bootstrapped. It is “slightly” profitable and has been re-investing that money into growing the business. It saw its revenue climb by tenfold in 2020 from an admittedly “small base.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offices in Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Bogotá and Bucharest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, it plans to use its new capital to expand into new markets (it’s currently operating in about 12 states), boost its headcount of 20 and accelerate its tech roadmap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the last four to five months, we’ve moved very strong into last mile” as the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, Radisson said. “We want to give opportunities to millions that didn’t go to college and that have seen stagnant wages for years. We want to give them opportunities to get ahead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JAM Fund principal and Tinder co-founder Mateen believes Shift One is turning the labor problem of “adverse selection” on its head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gig work has been defined by seasonality and availability &#8212; neither are particularly good for workers,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has thoughts, pointing out that blue-collar jobs have been among the hardest hit by COVID-19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Shift One, &#8220;workers receive fairly compensated jobs with the opportunity to grow and develop,&#8221; he said in a written statement. &#8220;Companies get access to a steady, predictable source of high-quality labor. And Miami benefits from the virtuous circle of higher employment and strong local businesses.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://knoq.com">Knoq</a> (formerly known as Polis) was a startup that recruited representatives to go door-to-door in their neighborhoods, talking up client products and services. So for obvious reasons, it faced challenges in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stopped knocking on doors in February, and this summer, we were trying to figure out what the path forward was,&#8221; founder and CEO Kendall Tucker told me.</p>
<p>The company has already pivoted once, shifting focus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/polis-the-door-to-door-marketer-raises-another-2-5-million/">from political work to commercial marketing</a>. But Tucker said Knoq also had some attractive assets, namely its &#8220;unique, huge consumer models&#8221; designed to predict whether someone would be interested in a given product, as well as &#8220;the experience of building out these teams of neighborhood representatives.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So after what she described as a competitive bidding process, Knoq was acquired by <a href="https://www.adpractitioners.com">Ad Practitioners</a>, a digital media company that owns properties like <a href="https://money.com">Money.com</a> and <a href="https://www.consumersadvocate.org">ConsumersAdvocate.org</a>.</p>
<p>As part of Ad Practitioners, Tucker said the Knoq team will be able to interact with visitors to those properties and help  &#8220;pair consumers with the right product,&#8221; whether that&#8217;s auto insurance or software. After all, she noted that there plenty of consumers already reaching out to Ad Practitioners via chat bots and phone calls: &#8220;These are people already asking for help &#8230; we&#8217;re really just connecting the dots.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2113530" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2113530" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2113530" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knoq-Data-and-Script-Tech.jpg?w=680" alt="Knoq screenshot" width="680" height="672" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knoq-Data-and-Script-Tech.jpg 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knoq-Data-and-Script-Tech.jpg?resize=150,148 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knoq-Data-and-Script-Tech.jpg?resize=300,297 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knoq-Data-and-Script-Tech.jpg?resize=768,759 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knoq-Data-and-Script-Tech.jpg?resize=680,672 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knoq-Data-and-Script-Tech.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knoq-Data-and-Script-Tech.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knoq-Data-and-Script-Tech.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Knoq-Data-and-Script-Tech.jpg?resize=96,96 96w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2113530" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Knoq</p></div></p>
<p>In the acquisition announcement, Ad Practitioners CEO Greg Powel made a similar point, saying that the deal represents &#8220;a shared vision of helping people make decisions through conversations driven by data and technology while educating people about products and services that matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The Money and ConsumersAdvocate.org brands are already trusted by millions of highly-engaged users,&#8221; Powel continued. &#8220;Together, we foresee a world where consumers come to our sites for great content [and] reviews and to speak with representatives who can help them find the personal information they need.”</p>
<p>Knoq leadership has already moved to join Ad Practitioners in Puerto Rico, with the rest of the Knoq team set to relocate as well later this year.</p>
<p>You might think a startup would be inclined to stay put in its current location (in Knoq&#8217;s case, Boston), at least for the duration of the pandemic, but Tucker said she&#8217;s a big believer in seeing your team in person. In fact, the Knoq team had socially distanced outdoor meetups over the summer, &#8220;to brainstorm or just hang out and make sure people are okay.&#8221; Plus, she&#8217;s excited about the possibility of &#8220;hiring the amazing people on this island.&#8221;</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. Knoq had most recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/polis-the-door-to-door-marketer-raises-another-2-5-million/"> raised $2.5 million</a> from Initialized Capital and Haystack.vc, and Tucker said it was crucial that the acquisition provided a good outcome not just for her team and herself, but also her investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re so excited for Kendall and her team on their successful exit to Ad Practitioners,&#8221; said Initialized General Partner Alda Leu Dennis in a statement. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a pleasure partnering with <span class="il">Knoq</span> over the last few years. The <span class="il">Knoq</span> team will bring a tech-forward approach to sales outreach and customer analytics. And, Kendall’s skills as a brilliant builder, operator and strategic thinker will be a huge asset for Ad Practitioners.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.metropolis.io/">Metropolis</a> is a new Los Angeles-based startup that&#8217;s looking to compete with BMW-owned ParkMobile for a slice of the automated parking lot management market.</p>
<p>Upgrading parking with a computer vision based system that recognizes cars as they enter and leave garages has been Metropolis&#8217; mission since founder and chief executive Alex Israel first formed the business back in 2017.</p>
<p>Israel, a serial entrepreneur, has spent decades thinking about parking. His last company, ParkMe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/09/inrix-buys-parkme-to-add-smart-parking-services-to-its-real-time-traffic-data/">was sold to Inrix back in 2015</a>. And it was with those earnings and experience that Israel went back to the drawing board to develop a new kind of parking payment and management service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Inrix Buys ParkMe To Add Smart Parking Services To Its Real Time Traffic Data&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/09/inrix-buys-parkme-to-add-smart-parking-services-to-its-real-time-traffic-data/embed/#?secret=eQQXnp9YOH" data-secret="eQQXnp9YOH" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, the company is ready for its closeup, announcing not only its launch, but $41 million in financing the company raised from investors including the real estate managers <span style="font-weight: 400;">Starwood and RXR Realty; Dick Costolo&#8217;s 01 Advisors; Dragoneer; former Facebook employees Sam Lessin and Kevin Colleran&#8217;s Slow Ventures; Dan Doctoroff, the head of Alphabet&#8217;s Sidewalk Labs initiative; and NBA All star and early stage investor, Baron Davis. Global growth equity firm 3L led the round. </span></p>
<p>According to Alex Israel, the parking payment application is the foundation for a bigger business empire that hopes to reimagine parking spaces as hubs for a broad array of urban mobility services.</p>
<p>In this, the company&#8217;s goals aren&#8217;t dissimilar from the Florida-based startup, REEF, which has its own spin on what to do with the existing infrastructure and footprint created by urban parking spaces. And REEF&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/reef-technology-raises-1-billion-from-softbank-and-others-to-remake-parking-lots/">$700 million round of funding from last year</a> shows there&#8217;s a lot of money to be made &#8212; or at least spent &#8212; in a parking lot.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="MezhVgCpSz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/reef-technology-raises-1-billion-from-softbank-and-others-to-remake-parking-lots/">REEF Technology raises $700M from SoftBank and others to remake parking lots</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;REEF Technology raises $700M from SoftBank and others to remake parking lots&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/reef-technology-raises-1-billion-from-softbank-and-others-to-remake-parking-lots/embed/#?secret=MezhVgCpSz" data-secret="MezhVgCpSz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike REEF, Metropolis will remain focused on mobility, according to Israel. &#8220;How does parking change over the next 20 years as mobility shifts?&#8221; he asked. And he&#8217;s hoping that Metropolis will provide an answer. </span></p>
<p>The company is hoping to use its latest funding to expand its footprint to over 600 locations over the course of the next year. In all, Metropolis has raised $60 million since it was formed back in 2017.</p>
<p>While the computer vision and machine learning technology will serve as the company&#8217;s beachhead into parking lots, services like cleaning, charging, storage and logistics could all be part and parcel of the Metropolis offering going forward, Israel said. &#8220;We become the integrator [and] we also in some cases become the direct service provider,&#8221; Israel said.</p>
<p>The company already has 10,000 parking spots that it&#8217;s managing for big real estate owners, and Israel expects more property managers to flood to its service.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;[Big property owners] are not thinking about the infrastructure requirements that allow for the seamless access to these facilities,&#8221; Israel said. His technology can allow buildings to capture more value through other services like dynamic pricing and yield optimization as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Metropolis is finding the highest and best use whether that be scooter charging, scooter storage, fleet storage, fleet logistics, or sorting,&#8221; Israel said.  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the new space startups with the loftiest near-term goals <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/axiom-space-raises-130m-in-series-b-funding-301228475.html">has raised $130 million</a> in a Series B round that demonstrates investor confidence in the scope of its ambitions: Axiom Space, which has been tapped by NASA to add privately developed space station modules to the ISS, announced the new funding led by C5 Capital.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a string of high-profile announcements for Axiom, which was founded in 2016 by a team including space professionals with a history of demonstrated expertise working on the International Space Station. Eventually, Axiom hopes to go from adding the first private commercial modules to the existing station, to creating their own, wholly private on-orbital platforms &#8212; for research, space tourism and more.</p>
<p>Axiom <a href="https://www.axiomspace.com/press-release/ax1-crew">announced</a> the people who will take part in its first-ever private astronaut launch to the ISS, which is set to fly next January using a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket. Axiom is the service provider for the mission, brokering the deal for the private spacefarers and setting up training and mission profile. That should be the first time we see a crew made up entirely of private individuals (i.e. not astronauts selected, trained and employed by their respective national government) make its way to the station.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company was also in discussions with Tom Cruise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/tom-cruise-reportedly-talking-to-spacex-about-shooting-a-movie-in-space/">about filming at least part of an upcoming film</a> aboard the ISS, and it&#8217;s in development with a production company on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/contestants-will-compete-for-a-spacex-trip-to-the-international-space-station-in-new-reality-tv-show/">forthcoming competition reality show that will see contestants vie for a spot on a private flight to the station</a>.</p>
<p>Axiom is emerging as the leading linkage between private human spaceflight and the existing infrastructure and industry, covering both public sector partners like NASA, and the &#8220;rails&#8221; of the bourgeoning industry &#8212; SpaceX and its ilk. It&#8217;s been focused on this unique opportunity longer than most in the private market, and it has all the relationships and in-house expertise to make it work.</p>

<p>This new, significant injection of capital will help the company hire, as well as boost its ability to construct the pieces of its forthcoming private space station modules, as well as its eventual station itself. The Houston-based company aims to put its ISS modules on the station by 2024, and it has raised $150 million to date.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.citadelid.com/">Citadel ID</a> announced a combined $3.5 million raise for its income and employment verification service. The startup provides an API to customer companies, allowing them to rapidly verify details of consumer employment.</p>
<p>The capital came from a blend of venture firms and angels. On the firm side, <a href="https://www.abstractvc.com/">Abstract</a> and <a href="https://www.somacap.com/">Soma VC</a> were in there, along with <a href="https://chapterone.com/">ChapterOne</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/briannekimmel">Brianne Kimmel</a> put capital in as well, according to the startup. And denizens with work histories at companies like Zynga (Mark Pincus), Stripe (Lachy Groom), Carta (Henry Ward) and others also put cash into the fundraise<em>. (The company reached out to add that <a href="https://www.fathomcap.com/">Fathom Capital</a> also put a good amount in the round.)</em></p>
<p>Citadel was founded back in June of 2020, before raising capital, snagging its first customer and shipping its product all inside of the same year.</p>
<p>The idea for Citadel ID came when co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/kirklokov">Kirill Klokov</a> worked at Carta, the cap-table-as-a-service startup that recently built an exchange for the trading of private stock. Klokov discovered while working on the tech side of the company how hard it was to verify certain data, like employment and income and identity.</p>

<p>As Carta deals with money, stock and the collection and distribution of both, you can imagine why having a quick way to verify who worked where, and since when, mattered to the company. But Klokov came to realize that there wasn&#8217;t a good solution in the market for what Carta needed, sans building integrations to a host of payroll managers by hand and dealing with lots of data with varying taxonomies. That or using an in-the-market product, like <a href="https://theworknumber.com/">Equifax&#8217;s The Work Number</a>, which the founder described as expensive and offering relatively low coverage.</p>
<p>To fill the market void Klokov helped found Citadel ID, quickly building integrations into payroll managers where there were hooks for code, and working around older login systems when needed. Citadel ID&#8217;s service allows regular folks to provide access to their employment data to others, allowing for the verification of their income (a rental group, perhaps), or employment (Carta, perhaps) quickly.</p>
<p>Per the startup the market demand for such verifications is in the hundreds of millions every year in the United States. So, Citadel should have plenty of market space to grow into. Citadel ID has around 20 customers today, it told TechCrunch, and charges on a per verification basis.</p>
<p>Finally, while Citadel also offers data via its website and not merely through its API, the startup still fits inside the growing number of startups we&#8217;ve seen in recent quarters foregoing traditional SaaS, and instead offering their products via a developer hook (sometimes referred to as a &#8220;headless&#8221; approach). API-delivered startups are not new, after all Twilio went public years ago. But their model of product delivery feels like it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/jeff-lawson-on-api-startups-picking-a-market-and-getting-dissed-by-vcs/">gaining momentum</a> over managed software offerings.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how quickly Citadel ID can scale before it raises its Series A.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new breed of startups is acquiring and growing small but promising third-party merchants, and building out their own economies of scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while there are a number of such startups based in the U.S. and Europe, none had emerged in the Latin American market. Until now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://valoreo.com/en/">Valoreo</a>, a Mexico City-based acquirer of e-commerce businesses, announced Tuesday that it has raised $50 million of equity and debt financing in a seed funding round.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar amount is large for a seed round by any standards, but most certainly ranks among the highest ever raised by a Latin American startup &#8212; further evidence of increased investor interest in the region’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">burgeoning venture scene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upper90, FJ Labs, Angel Ventures, Presight Capital and a slew of angel investors participated in the round. Those angels included David Geisen, head of Mercado Libre Mexico; BEA Systems’ co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alfred Chuang;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Tushar Ahluwalia, founder of Razor Group, a European marketplace aggregator, among others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in late 2020, Valoreo aims to invest in, operate and scale e-commerce brands as part of its self-described mission “to bring better products at more affordable prices” to the Latin American consumer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were substantially oversubscribed and were therefore able to select investors that not only provide capital, but also additional know-how in key areas,” said co-founder Alex Gruell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo joins the growing number of startups focused on rolling up e-commerce brands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> model is similar to that of Thrasio &#8212; which just </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised another $750 million</span></a> &#8211;<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;  and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. But Valoreo says its approach has been tailored to “the specific needs of the Latin American market and is specifically focused on the Latin American end customer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another new company in the space called Branded recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched its own roll-up business on $150 million in funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others in the space include </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berlin Brands Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SellerX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/press-releases/heyday-emerges-from-stealth-with-175m-series-a-funding-to-accelerate-marketplace-native-brands-15493868"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heyday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as my colleague Ingrid Lunden </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">points out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the feverish pace of fundraising in the area of FBA roll-ups feels very much like a bubble in the market — not least because none of these still-young companies have yet to prove that the strategy to buy up and consolidate these sellers is a useful and profitable one.”</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How it works</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo (which the company says is an extension of the Spanish word “valor,” meaning to add value</span><b>),</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquires merchants that operate their own brands and primarily sell on online marketplaces such as Mercado Libre, Amazon and Linio. The company targets brands that offer “category-leading products” and which it believes have “significant growth potential.” It also develops brands in-house to offer a broader selection of products to the end customer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Thrasio, Valoreo says it’s able to help entrepreneurs who may lack the resources and access to capital to take their businesses to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founder and co-CEO Stefan Florea says the company takes less than five weeks typically from its initial contact with a seller to a final payout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the acquired and developed brands are integrated into the company’s consolidated holding. By tapping its team of “specialists” in areas such as digital marketing and supply chain management, it claims to be able to help these brands “reach new heights” while giving the entrepreneurs behind the companies “an attractive exit,” or partial exit in some cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have different structures, always taking into account the personal objectives of the seller,” Stefan Florea added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally Valoreo acquires the majority of the business, with the purchase price typically being a combination of an upfront cash payment and a profit share component so sellers can still earn money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Valoreo plans to use its new capital mostly to acquire and develop “interesting” brands, as well as build out its current team of 10 while expanding its infrastructure and operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is currently focused on the Mexican and Brazilian markets, but is planning its expansion into other Latin American countries where it has strong local support systems, such as Colombia, according to co-founder Martin Florea.</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our mission is to be a pan-Latin American player providing value to the entire region,” Martin Florea said. “Latin America in general and Mexico in particular are in a distinct situation which provides phenomenal opportunities for e-commerce merchants on the one hand but also presents particular challenges on the other hand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those challenges, according to Martin Florea, include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">limited access to growth capital, a lack of specialized expertise in certain areas (such as supply chain management), limited opportunities to sell their business and pursue new ventures, as well as operational burdens and the lack of capacities to expand into new countries and marketplaces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valoreo emphasizes it is not out to compete with Mercado Libre, Amazon and other regional marketplaces but instead wants to partner with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without these platforms, this opportunity would not exist,” Martin Florea said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hernán Fernández, founder and managing partner of Angel Ventures, believes Valoreo “will add a lot of value” to the Latin American e-commerce landscape, which is experiencing both market growth and the fragmentation of the seller space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/mexican-online-grocer-justo-raises-65m-in-general-atlantic-led-series-a/">Jüsto</a> co-founder and CEO (and Valoreo investor) Ricardo Weder notes that the e-commerce market is at an inflection point in Latin America. According to eMarketer, the region was the </span><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/latin-america-will-fastest-growing-retail-ecommerce-market-this-year"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fastest-growing e-commerce market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the world in 2020, with 37% year over year growth. However, it is a much more fragmented and crowded market compared to other regions, such as the United States.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This, Valoreo believes, provides an opportunity for consolidation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are still many consumers that are not aware of the great variety of outstanding local brands that sell innovative products on marketplaces online,” Stefan Florea said. “In the U.S. or Europe e-commerce is the new way of shopping, offering an even greater range of products and brands than offline shopping. We firmly believe it will not take long until end-customers in Mexico and across Latin America discover all the benefits that e-commerce offers.”</span></p>

<p>The price of bitcoin, the world&#8217;s best-known cryptocurrency, has historically proven a reasonable proxy for consumer interest in the cryptocurrency space, and for <a href="https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/price_volume/2y/USD?r=week&amp;t=lb&amp;vu=curr">trading activity amongst blockchain-based assets</a>. Bitcoin&#8217;s price has retreated since the milestone, and is now worth just over $49,000.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has been on a tear this year, rising from around the $30,000 mark at the start of 2021 to its recent $50,000 milestone, a gain of around 66%. Looking back a year and the gains are even more impressive, with the price of bitcoin rising from around $10,000 a year ago to its current price, a gain of 400%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Luckily for investors and believers in other decentralized tokens, it&#8217;s not just bitcoin that is enjoying a valuation updraft. Cardano, one of the most highly valued blockchain assets, is up around 27% in the last week, according <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">to CoinMarketCap</a>. Its total value is nearing the $27 billion mark.</p>
<p>Companies built atop the burgeoning cryptocurrency space could be enjoying a boom as the price of bitcoin advances; as trading activity and consumer interest tend to rise along with the price of bitcoin, and companies like Coinbase make money from trading activity and consumer use, 2021 is starting off strongly.</p>
<p>Coinbase has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/coinbase-files-to-go-public-confidentially-and-were-hyped/">filed to go public</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/coinbase-is-going-public-via-direct-listing/">intends to pursue a direct listing</a> in short order.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s driving up the price of bitcoin and its sister-tokens in the short-term? In a market melt-up its hard to point fingers with any accuracy. But broadly speaking, if it feels that nearly every asset class is setting new all-time records, so why not bitcoin as well?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://pex.com">Pex</a>, a startup aiming to giving rightsholders more control over how their content is used and reused online, has raised $57 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The round comes from existing investors including Susa Ventures and Illuminate Ventures, as well as Tencent, Tencent Music Entertainment, the CueBall Group, NexGen Ventures Partners, Amaranthine and others.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Pex had <a href="https://pex.com/pex-secures-7m-in-series-seed-financing/">previously raised $7 million</a>, and it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/legalizing-remix-culture/">acquired music rights startup Dubset</a> last year. Founder and CEO Rasty Turek told me that while the product has evolved from what he described as &#8220;a Google-like search engine for rightsholders to find copyright infringement&#8221; into a broader platform, the vision of creating a better system of managing copyright and payments online has remained the same.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup describes its Attribution Engine as the &#8220;licensing infrastructure for the Internet,&#8221; bringing together the individuals and companies who own content rights, creators who might want to license and remix that content, the big digital platforms where content gets shared and the law enforcement agencies that want to monitor all of this.</p>
<p>The product includes six modules — an asset registry, a system for identifying those assets when they&#8217;re used in new content, a licensing system, a dispute resolution system, a payment system and data and reporting to see how your content is being used.</p>
<p>Turek said that while Pex is being used by &#8220;most of the largest rightsholders in the world,&#8221; the system was built to be accessible to &#8220;a struggling musician out on the streets of Los Angeles&#8221; who doesn&#8217;t have the resources to &#8220;police all of this content&#8221; online.</p>

<p>He also suggested that the broader regulatory environment is calling for a solution like Pex, with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/"> the European Union passing a new copyright directive</a> that&#8217;s set to take effect this year, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/stimulus-bill-streaming/"> new copyright legislation</a> also on the table in the United States. The EU bill was criticized for potentially prompting larger platforms to preemptively block broad swaths of content, but Turek argued, &#8220;There&#8217;s so much content out there in search of an audience that this is going to be the opposite of overblocking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not that Pex is relying entirely on regulators. Turek also said the platform is structured to balance the needs of the different groups using it — and that it has an incentive to strike that balance because its revenue comes from licensing deals, so it&#8217;s focused on &#8220;really being the Switzerland, really being the neutral party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We designed all of our business around the idea that if we try to abuse the system, we lose, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t make money [when someone] abuses the system, we only make money when everybody plays nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turek also claimed that public domain and Creative Commons licenses are &#8220;first-class citizens&#8221; on the platform, and that many of the rightsholders using the Attribution Engine don&#8217;t necessarily want monetary compensation: &#8220;A lot of people are happy to do this for recognition. We are social animals.&#8221; (Plus, recognition can lead to moneymaking opportunities.)</p>
<p>Pex says the new funding will allow it to continue scaling the Attribution Engine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe investments are validation,&#8221; Turek added. &#8220;I believe they&#8217;re more obligation than validation, but they do prove you are directionally correct.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in late-2014, Salt Lake City-based Zencastr has become a kind of lifeline for many podcasters, as the pandemic pushed formerly in-person podcasts online. The startup is hardly a household name, but the company says it’s used by around 6% of all podcasts, based on an estimated 800,000 to 1.2 million active shows in the world.</p>
<p>I can certainly say, anecdotally, that just about every podcaster I’ve spoken to has tried the service, which offers a more specialized solution than video chat programs like Zoom and Skype. Some have managed to retrofit the latter to their needs, but Zencastr’s solution offers, among other things, high-quality audio recordings saved both locally and in the cloud.</p>
<p>As of last June, the company has also been testing a video feature. That’s long been a missing piece of the puzzle. I know I’ve moved over to Zoom since taking my show online during the pandemic. As pretty much any person can tell you a little over a year into the pandemic, video chat is no replacement for in-person interactions, but it works in a pinch. At the very least, it creates an additional dimension of human interaction you don’t get with voice alone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Up to now, the video offering was only available as a closed beta. Today the beta opens to all users, bringing with it HD video recording, coupled with the already high-quality sound. I’ve been toying around with the feature for my own podcast and find it to be less straightforward than services like Zoom, but more customizable. It leaves you with HD video files you can edit into a tighter show or simply go with the split screen. There’s also a live chat, footnotes and a soundboard, much of which seemed aimed at essentially editing the shows in real time.</p>
<p>Along with the broader arrival of the video feature, Zencastr is announcing a $4.6 million seed round &#8212; the service’s first major funding since launch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mgMGNtp7bo"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/zencastr-is-testing-a-video-podcasting-tool-in-limited-beta/">Zencastr is testing a video podcasting tool in limited beta</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Zencastr is testing a video podcasting tool in limited beta&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/11/zencastr-is-testing-a-video-podcasting-tool-in-limited-beta/embed/#?secret=mgMGNtp7bo" data-secret="mgMGNtp7bo" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Founder and CEO Josh Nielsen tells TechCrunch that Zencastr has thus far been, “bootstrapped, self-funded and really just kind of a grassroots company in the podcasting space. A lot of people are getting interested in podcasting right now and we feel like it’s important to have a company like ours continue to represent our creators. They’re our North Star.”</p>
<p>As interest in podcasting has grown, Zencastr’s use has expanded with it. The company says it has seen around a 147% growth in podcasting hours since the beginning of COVID-19. The seed round is led by Utah-based Kickstart, with participation from former Flipagram executives Brian Dilley and Farhad Mohit and former Skullcandy CEO Jeremy Andrus, among others.</p>
<p>“This company started off pretty small and didn’t have a lot of resources,” Nielsen adds. “But we’ve always been profitable, we’ve always been growing. We still are, but we’re raising money to accelerate that growth. This is also a rebrand and a step forward in the reliability and stability of the platform.”</p>
<p>Stability has been something of an issue in the past with many of the Zencastr users I’ve spoken to. Spending more time with this service ahead of this news, I certainly found some nits to pick, including an audio delay I haven’t experienced with non-devoted services like Skype and Zoom. It’s not the end of the world, but it’s the kind of thing that can really throw you off your rhythm during an interview. The video presentation is also lacking in sophistication, but that’s to be expected in a closed beta.</p>
<p>The funding will go to smoothing out some of those wrinkles, as well as hiring.</p>
<p>“Headcount is one of the primary reasons for raising this round,” co-founder and CPO Adrian Lopez tells TechCrunch. “We were a fully distributed team before COVID existed. We have people in 11 different countries around the world. That was a very conscious choice. We believe that distribution allows us to work with some of the best people, regardless of where they are.”</p>
<p>Today also sees the launch of “Digital Nomad,” a podcast series produced by Zencastr that explores its own origin story. Though, the company is quick to add that this isn’t the beginning of a major push into producing original content.</p>
<p>“We believe strongly in podcasting as a medium that connects people,” says Lopez. “We formed the company around that. We’re fully distributed so we can put our money where our mouth is and put people all over and connect via this medium. We want to start telling that story.”</p>
<p>Zencastr has seen a fair bit of increased competition in the category, including the likes of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/squadcast-adds-video-podcast-recording/"> SquadCast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/rverside-fm/">Riverside.fm</a>. The company’s solid growth over the past year could also see some regression as more people feel comfortable recording shows in person, as the vaccines have been sufficiently distributed.</p>
<p>“We’re going to see some retraction, I think, as things and people go back to work,” says Lopez. “But I think it will all come out in the wash, because there’s just a much bigger-growing interest in podcasting over all. It happened before COVID and it will continue after COVID.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.titanvest.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that is building a retail investment management platform aimed at millennials, has closed on $12.5 million in a Series A round led by VC heavyweight General Catalyst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bevy of other investors put money in the round, including Sound Ventures (actor Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s VC firm), Scribble VC, BoxGroup, Y Combinator, South Park Commons, Instagram founder Mike Krieger, Lee Fixel and others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan is hoping to build on the momentum it saw in 2020, during which it grew revenue, customers and assets under management by 600%, “with effectively no marketing budget, according to co-founder Joe Percoco. The New York-based company says it’s approaching $500 million in assets under management and was cash flow positive last year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percoco met co-CEO Clay Gardner while the pair were at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We came from two different backgrounds with respect to investing,” Percoco recalled. “He was the type that bought his first shares of stock at the ages of 11 and 12. I’m the exact opposite and couldn’t invest myself until after Goldman Sachs, where I went to work after Penn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the duo both worked in the industry, they found that friends and family were always asking them how they should manage their capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were sending them to ETFs and mutual funds in our day jobs,” Percoco said. “But we realized they did not have the same access to investing that the wealthier did.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated with only helping the rich get richer, the pair </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">founded Titan in 2017 with the goal of disrupting what they viewed as “an archaic industry. They&#8217;ve since built an operating system aimed at giving “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyday investors access to the types of investment products and experiences that they’ve historically been locked out of.&#8221; Or, as they describe, it a mobile version of what investment giants Fidelity and BlackRock created decades ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan&#8217;s capital management platform is designed for both accredited and unaccredited investors. The company says it provides access to services that would historically require a $1 million minimum, such as direct portfolio manager access. It charges a fee amounting to just 1% of assets, compared to the 2% – and in some cases 20% of profits – that legacy players charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe Fidelity 2.0 will be direct-to-consumer with no walls and no black boxes,” Percoco said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(For the unacquainted, according to </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/black-box-accounting.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investopedia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lack box accounting is the deliberate use of complex bookkeeping methodologies to make interpreting </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial statements</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging and time-consuming.)</span></p>
<p>Its simplicity sets it apart. Titan chooses stocks via its &#8220;proprietary and discretionary&#8221; research process based on the principals&#8217; previous experience.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup currently offers two stock-focused strategies on its platform,</span></p>
<p>One of those strategies, called Flagship, is focused on large cap growth. The other, called Opportunities, focuses on smaller, under-the-radar companies.</p>
<div>All clients have direct access to its investment team and investor relations via Titan&#8217;s mobile operating system. The company also offers instant deposits, personal digital vaults (or separately managed accounts), fractional share-trading, and no lock-ups.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Titan’s core customer is the young professional in the 25-35 age range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re already investing money somewhere, even if not that much of their money,” Gardner said. “But they’re well attuned to the reasons they should be&#8230; And, most asset management products remain in the Stone Age, offering 90-page prospectuses and black-box client experiences.”</span></p>
<p>As former TC editor Josh Constine explained when the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/31/titan-robo-advisor/">raised a $2.5 million seed round</a> in October 2018, Titan differs from Robinhood or E*Trade, where users essentially are left to fend for themselves. But clients also have some control, unlike passive options such as Wealthfront and Betterment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Titan plans to use its new capital to scale its engineering and investment team, as well as make “significant investments” in product, marketing and operations. It also plans to launch several investment products across a variety of asset classes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many legacy players are hungry to have an OS to serve more folks they historically could not,” Percoco said. “We’re getting inbounds from legacy players in the space seeking to manage capital for new generations and realizing it will shift to mobile operating systems like Titan&#8217;s. Eventually, we can enable them to build their own investment products on Titan.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katherine Boyle, partner at General Catalyst and Titan board member, said she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was struck by Percoco and Gardner’s “deep empathy” for investors who are often overlooked &#8212; such as millennials and new investors “who have cash sitting in their checking accounts and want expert management but don’t know where to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They don’t want to be stock pickers but they don’t want a set-it-and-forget-it product,” Boyle said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s another level of sophistication with actively managed products where the best managers are making investment decisions on behalf of those who can afford it. But there’s no reason why retail investors should be excluded from this model.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thinks Titan can capitalize on what she believes is millennials’ “deep lack of trust” in legacy institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need new institutions like Titan to combat this lack of trust,” Boyle said. “And these new institutions need to have incentives that are aligned with their clients, not with hedge funds or banks.”</span></p>
