										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile gaming hasn&#8217;t seen the same demand for streaming content in the past as desktop has, but Amazon sees a market there to extend Twitch&#8217;s dominance. After launching on Android back in November, the company&#8217;s mobile streaming centric app has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1457912496">just launched</a> on Apple&#8217;s App Store.</p>
<p>The app lets users record short clips (anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes of content) of gameplay from a variety of titles that support screen recording capture. Users can screen record these clips directly into the GameOn library at which point they can add commentary or additional edits before publishing to the GameOn platform or sharing links to the platform on other sites.</p>
<p>The GameOn platform is interestingly fully disconnected from Twitch with separate branding and different channels. Amazon has been partnering with streamers to wholly focus on mobile gaming while promoting challenges unique to the app.The company says the service is compatible with over 1,000 mobile games.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Developers have been increasingly vigilant about brining more full-featured ports of desktop titles to mobile though the lack of sophisticated controls has made this a challenge. As gaming platforms aim to bring cloud streaming networks to iOS there could end up being more demand for shot-on-mobile content and titles that users control with a gamepad, but this will depend on whether the App Store grows more amenable to these platforms over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new digital marketplace called <a href="https://www.westtenth.com/">West Tenth</a>, now backed by $1.5 million in seed funding, wants to give women a platform to start and grow their home-based businesses. Through its mobile app, women can promote their business to others in the local community, then field inquiries and requests through the app&#8217;s integrated messaging platform, as well as finalize transactions through in-app payments.</p>
<p>The startup was co-founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lwjohnson/">Lyn Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lwjohnson/">Sara Sparhawk</a>, who met when they both worked in finance. Johnson remained in finance, but Sparhawk later moved on to work at Amazon.</p>
<p>Johnson explains that her experience led her to better understand the economic inequality of women in the U.S., where they only own 32 cents to every dollar in financial assets than men own. A large driver of this is that women leave the workforce, often to raise children, which results in years where they don&#8217;t have earnings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really good as a society at supporting women on the way of out of the workforce to care for their kids, but really terrible at supporting them on the way back in,&#8221; Johnson says. &#8220;Women know this, and as an alternative to employment that just seems to fail them, they&#8217;re starting businesses in droves.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119836" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119836" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2119836" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119836" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> West Tenth</p></div></p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.westtenth.com/">West Tenth</a>, the goal is to encourage this sort of entrepreneurship &#8212; and more broadly, to help women understand that the many of the talents they&#8217;ve developed at home are, in fact, potential businesses.</p>
<p>This includes opportunities like home-based bakers and cooks, photographers, home organizers or designers, home florists, baby sleep consultants, party planning and event services, crafting classes, fitness training, homemade goods, and more.</p>
<p>The company notes that the app isn&#8217;t necessarily closed to men, but the current market for U.S. home businesses favors women as they&#8217;re more often the partner who chooses to leave work to raise children. However, there are some men on its platform.</p>
<p>Though today many of these entrepreneurs market their home businesses on Facebook, they&#8217;re missing opportunities to reach customers if they&#8217;re not heavily involved in local groups and responding to requests for recommendations. West Tenth instead centralizes local businesses in one place to make discovery easier.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119843" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119843" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2119843" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-9.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-9.png 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119843" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> West Tenth</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the app, customers can browse and shop local businesses, filtering by category via buttons at the top of the screen. The results are sorted by distance and offer photos, description, and the starting price for the goods or services offered. Through integrated messaging, users can reach out directly for a quote or more information. Customers can also complete their purchases through the app&#8217;s Stripe payments integration. West Tenth takes a 9.5% commission on these sales.</p>
<p>Another key aspect to West Tenth is its education component, <a href="https://www.westtenth.com/foundry">The Foundry</a>.</p>
<p>Through a $100 per quarter subscription membership (or $350 per year), business owners will be able to attend bi-monthly events, including classes focused on the fundamentals of setting up home-based businesses, marketing, customer acquisition, and other topics. These classes will also be available à la carte at around $30 apiece, for those who want to pay per session.</p>
<p>In addition, attendees will hear from guest speakers who have experience in the home-based business market, and they&#8217;ll be able join mastermind networking groups to exchange ideas with their peers.</p>

<p>This system of combining education and networking with business ownership could potentially help more women become home-based business entrepreneurs instead of joining multi-level marketing (MLM) companies, as is common.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started this, we recognized that MLMs are one of the few kind of industries that&#8217;s focused on this demographic of women who&#8217;ve left the workforce &#8212; which is a huge, untapped talent pool in the U.S.,&#8221; notes Johnson. &#8220;But they&#8217;re really predatory. Only the top 1% of sellers distributors really make money and the rest lose money. And they lose their social capital, as well. What we&#8217;re really interested in doing is becoming an alternative to MLMs in many respects,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, MLMs aren&#8217;t allowed on the West Tenth platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119840" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119840" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2119840" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-8.png?w=453" alt="" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-8.png 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-8.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-8.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-8.png?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-8.png?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-8.png?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-8.png?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-8.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119840" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> West Tenth</p></div></p>
<p>The startup, which completed Kansas City TechStars last summer, has now raised $1.5 million in seed funding to get its platform off the ground. The round was led by Better Ventures along with Stand Together Ventures Lab, Kapital Partners,The Community Fund, Backstage Capital, Wedbush Ventures, and Gaingels.</p>
<p>The funds will be used to develop the product and grow its user base. In time, West Tenth aims to build out product features to better highlight local businesses. This includes shopping elements that will let you see what friends are buying and video demonstrations, among other things.</p>
<p>Since 2019, West Tenth has grown its footprint from just 20 businesses on the app to now over 600, largely in suburban L.A. and Salt Lake City. It&#8217;s now aiming to target growth in Phoenix, Boise, and Northern California.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119833" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119833" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2119833" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/West-Tenth-2.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119833" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> West Tenth</p></div></p>
<p>The timing for West Tenth&#8217;s expansion is coming on the tail end of the COVID-19 crisis, where things have only gotten worse for women&#8217;s traditional employment.</p>
<p>School and daycare closures combined with job losses that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/unemployment-coronavirus-women.html">greatly impacted women&#8217;s roles</a> have <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/10/30/492582/covid-19-sent-womens-workforce-progress-backward/">now driven more women out of the workforce</a> compared with men. And according to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/achieving-an-inclusive-us-economic-recovery#">McKinsey</a>, women accounted for nearly 56% of workforce exits since the start of the pandemic, despite making up just 48% of the workforce. This COVID-driven &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/unemployment-coronavirus-women.html">shecession</a>,&#8221; as some have dubbed it, is also disproportionately impacting women of color, studies have found.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen 5 million women exit the workforce &#8212; some because they were laid off or furloughed, and a huge chunk because they&#8217;re opting out because the caregiving responsibilities just became overwhelming,&#8221; says Johnson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing is when women leave the workforce for caregiving reasons &#8212; for some reason we really discount that and we make it even harder for them to return to work. So I think over the next 18 to 24 months, we&#8217;ll see a big surge in economic activity in the home with women trying to bring in additional sources of income by running a business from the home,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>The West Tenth app is available on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/west-tenth/id1478134804#?platform=iphone">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wtenth.w10">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon on Tuesday issued a rare apology to users in India for an original political drama series over allegations that a few scenes in the nine-part mini series hurt religious sentiments of some people in the key overseas market.</p>
<p>The series, called “<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11117570/">Tandav</a>,” has faced criticism from some people in India &#8212; including a few members of the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party &#8212; over its depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses.</p>
<p>In a message titled, “Amazon Prime Video Apologizes,” the American e-commerce group said it “deeply regrets that viewers considered certain scenes to be objectionable” and that it had either edited those scenes or removed them altogether from the show after hearing concerns from viewers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We respect our viewers’ diverse beliefs and apologize unconditionally to anyone who felt hurt by these scenes. Our teams follow company content evaluation processes, which we acknowledge need to be constantly updated to better serve our audiences. We will continue to develop entertaining content with partners, while complying with the laws of India and respecting the diversity of culture and beliefs of our audiences.”</p>
<p>The show, which stars several top Bollywood actors including Saif Ali Khan, premiered in mid-January and immediately prompted <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">controversy and criminal complaints. Things have escalated in recent weeks as several high-profile executives of Amazon Prime Video have been questioned by the authority.</span></p>

<p>Prime Video has amassed millions of subscribers in India, where it competes with Disney&#8217;s Hotstar, Netflix, Times Internet&#8217;s MX Player, and dozens more streaming services. Amazon has grown more aggressive with Prime Video in India in recent months. It recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/amazon-launches-mobile-only-prime-video-subscription-in-india/">introduced an even cheaper subscription tier</a> and <a href="https://scroll.in/field/978130/cricket-amazon-prime-video-acquires-indian-territory-rights-for-all-matches-in-new-zealand">secured rights</a> for streaming some cricket matches.</p>
<p>Amazon’s rare apology today comes days after New Delhi announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new rules for on-demand video streaming services and social media firms</a>.</p>
<p>Until now Amazon Prime Video and other streaming services have operated in India without having to worry too much about the nature of their content. But that’s changing, according to the new rules.</p>
<p>“The category classification of a content will take into account the potentially offensive impact of a film on matters such as caste, race, gender, religion, disability or sexuality that may arise in a wide range of works, and the classification decision will take account of the strength or impact of their inclusion,” the new rules state.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/india-plays-hardball-with-amazon/">wrote recently</a>, the controversy surrounding the political drama and the new rules from India for streaming services are only few of the challenges that Amazon is facing in India, where it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">committed to deploy over $6.5 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, an influential India trader group that represents tens of millions of brick-and-mortar retailers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/indian-trader-group-calls-for-ban-on-amazon-following-dodging-regulations-claims/">called New Delhi to ban Amazon in the country</a> after an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation/">investigation by Reuters</a> claimed that the American e-commerce group had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers in India, publicly misrepresented its ties with those sellers and used them to circumvent foreign investment rules in the country.</p>

<p>“It’s no secret that Epic is invested in building the metaverse and Tonic Games shares this goal,” Epic founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said in a release tied to the news. “As Epic works to build this virtual future, we need great creative talent who know how to build powerful games, content and experiences.”</p>
<p>Epic notes in its announcement post that gameplay for the popular title won&#8217;t change under the new ownership. As with Fornite, the company says it&#8217;s investing in cross platform play for the title, which is currently available on the PlayStation and PC with Nintendo Switch and Xbox arriving later this year.</p>
<p>Mediatonic was founded in the U.K. in 2005. Tonic Games Group was developed as a parent company last year. Based in London, the group now employs roughly 300 people, globally. Released last August, Fall Guys has proven a major hit for audiences and critics, alike. The brightly-colored title allows for up to 60 players to compete in battle royale-style matches.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Epic, we feel like we have found a home that was made for us,&#8221; Tonic cofounder and CEO Dave Bailey said in the release. &#8220;They share our mission to build and support games that have a positive impact, empower others and stand the test of time and we couldn’t be more excited to be joining forces with their team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Epic, of course, has money to burn. In addition to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/27/epic-fortnite-3-billion-profit/">massive revenue</a> generated from Fortnite, the company has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/epic-games-2">raised $3.4 billion to date</a>, including a $1.78 billion round in August of last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are many jobs in the construction industry that fall under the &#8220;dull, dirty, and dangerous&#8221; category said to be ripe for automation — but only a few can actually be taken on with today&#8217;s technology. One such job is the crucial but repetitive task of rebar tying, which<a href="https://skymul.com/"> a startup called SkyMul is aiming to completely automate</a> using fleets of drones.</p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;ve put together reinforced concrete at some point in your life, you may not know what rebar tying is. The steel rebar that provides strength to concrete floors, walls, and other structures is held in place during the pouring process by tying it to the other rebar where the rods cross. For a good-size building or bridge this can easily be thousands of ties — and the process is generally done manually.</p>
<p>Rodbusters (as rebar tying specialists are called, or so I&#8217;m told) are masters of the art of looping a short length of plastic or wire around an intersection between two pieces of rebar, then twisting and tying it tightly so that the rods are secured in multiple directions. It must be done precisely and efficiently, and so it is — but it&#8217;s backbreaking, repetitive work. Though any professional must feel pride in what they do, I doubt anyone cherishes the chronic pain they get from doing that task thousands of times in an hour. As you might expect, rodbusters have high injury rates and develop chronic issues.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Automation of rebar tying is tricky because it happens in so many different circumstances. A prominent semi-robotic solution is the <a href="https://www.constructionrobots.com/tybot">TyBot</a>, which is a sort of rail-mounted gantry that suspends itself over the surface — but while this makes sense for a bridge, it makes far less for the 20th floor of an office building.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119802" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skyty-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119802" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119802" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skyty-1.gif" alt="Animated image of a drone floating over rebar and tying it together at intersections." width="700" height="394" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119802" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SkyMul</p></div></p>
<p>Enter SkyMul, a startup still in the very early stages but with a compelling pitch: rebar tying done by a fleet of drones. When you consider that the tying process doesn&#8217;t involve too much force, and that computer vision has gotten more than good enough to locate the spots that need work&#8230; it starts sounding kind of obvious.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Eohan George said that they evaluated a number of different robotic solutions but that drones are the only ones that make sense. The only legged robots with the dexterity to pick their way through the rebar are too expensive, and treads and wheels are too likely to move the unsecured rebar.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119789" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119789" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119789" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg" alt="Diagram showing how SkyMul's drones map an area of rebar then divide it up for tying." width="1024" height="714" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg?resize=300,209 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg?resize=768,536 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg?resize=680,474 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skymul-process.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119789" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SkyMul</p></div></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the company&#8217;s SkyTy system works. First, a mapper drone flies over the site to mark the boundaries and then, in an automated closer flyover, to build a map of the rebar itself and where the ties will need to go. This map is then double-checked by the rodbuster technician running the show, which George said only takes about a minute per thousand square feet of rebar (though that adds up quickly).</p>
<p>Then the tying drones are released, as many as needed or wanted. Each one moves from spot to spot, hovering and descending until its tying tool (much like those used by human rodbusters) spans the rebar intersection; the tie is wrapped, twisted, and the drone is off to the next spot. They need their batteries swapped every 25 minutes, which means they generally have time to put down 70-80 ties; right now each drone does one tie every 20 seconds, which is in line with humans, who can do it faster but generally go at about that speed or slower, according to numbers George cited.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Drone-focused construction startup TraceAir raises $3.5M&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/drone-focused-construction-startup-traceair-raises-3-5m/embed/#?secret=r4ScGhNmvW" data-secret="r4ScGhNmvW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to estimate the cost savings and value of the work SkyTy does, because the value of the labor varies widely. In some places rodbusters cost more than $80/hour, meaning the draw of automation is in cost savings. But in other markets the pay is less than a third of that, which compounded with the injury risk makes rodbusters a scarce quantity — so the value is in availability and reliability. Drone-based tying seems to offer value one way or the other, but that means the business model is somewhat in flux as SkyMul figures out what makes the most sense. Generally contractors at one level or another would lease and eventually own their own drones, though other methods are being looked into.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119803" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skyty-2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119803" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119803" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/skyty-2.gif" alt="Animated image of a computer-generated grid overlaid on images of rebar." width="700" height="394" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119803" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SkyMul</p></div></p>
<p>The system offers value-add services as well, for instance the precise map of the rebar generated at the beginning, which can be archived and used later for maintenance, quality assurance, comparison with plans, and other purposes. Once a contractor is convinced it&#8217;s as good or better than the manually-produced ones currently used, this could save hours, turning a 3-day job into a 2-day job or otherwise simplifying logistics.</p>
<p>The plan at the company is to first offer SkyTy as an option for bridge construction, which is a simpler environment than a multi-story building for the drones. The market there is on the order of $30-40 million per year for rebar tying services, providing an easier path to the more complex deployments.</p>
<p>SkyMul is looking for funding, having spun out of Georgia Tech and going through Comcast-NBC accelerator The Farm and then being granted a National Science Foundation SBIR Phase I award (with hopes for a Phase II). They have demonstrated the system but have yet to enter into any pilot programs — there are partnerships in the works but the construction business isn&#8217;t a nimble one and a drone-based solution isn&#8217;t trivial to swap in for human rodbusters on short notice. But once a few projects are under its belt the company seems likely to find serious traction among forward-thinking contractors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today, at a special AR/VR focused event held inside its virtual reality community platform Altspace, Microsoft showcased a new product aiming to provide their AR HoloLens platform and VR Windows Mixed Reality platform with a shared platform for meetings.</p>
<p>The app is called Microsoft Mesh and it gives users a cross AR/VR meeting space to interact with other users and 3D content, handling all of technical hard parts of sharing spatial multi-player experiences over the web. Like Microsoft&#8217;s other AR/VR apps, the sell seems to be less in the software than it is in enabling developers to tap into one more specialization of Azure, building their own software that builds on the capabilities. The company announced that AltspaceVR will now be Mesh-enabled.</p>
<p>In the company&#8217;s presentation, they swung for the fences in showcasing potential use cases, bringing in James Cameron, the co-founder of Cirque du Soleil and <em>Pokémon Go</em> developer Niantic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s HoloLens platform has always been at its most impressive when it comes to viewers in a shared space looking at the same digital content in the same room that&#8217;s invisible to everyone else. Inside Mesh, other users are represented as cartoonish avatars, a design break that has plagued countless other AR/VR apps and platforms. Microsoft says the hope is to one day beam a user&#8217;s 3D photo-realistic presence into the app but that will assuredly require the commoditization of some complex camera hardware.</p>
<p>The company showcased a concept video of Mesh, which seems to be a few years further ahead in several places than the current software is.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jd2GK0qDtRg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Mesh isn&#8217;t offering any capabilities that are terribly unique to the spatial computing world &#8212; it&#8217;s all pretty standard faire in terms of bells and whistles &#8212; the distinguishing factor is the breadth of access, something once the unique distinguishing feature of the AltspaceVR platform back in the day. Mesh can be accessed on the HoloLens 2, many VR headsets, phones, tablets, and PCs, providing a window into the futuristic platform for even desktop users.</p>
<p>The software is available in preview now on HoloLens 2 alongside its AltspaceVR integration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://airbyte.io/">Airbyte</a>, an open-source data integration platform, today announced that it has raised a $5.2 million seed funding round led by Accel. Other investors include Y Combinator, 8VC, Segment co-founder Calvin French-Owen, former Cloudera GM Charles Zedlewski, LiveRamp and Safegraph CEO Auren Hoffman, Datavant CEO Travis May and Alain Rossmann, the president of Machinify.</p>
<p>The company was co-founded by Michel Tricot, the former director of engineering and head of integrations at LiverRamp and RideOS, and John Lafleur, a serial entrepreneur who focuses on developer tools and B2B services. The last startup he co-founded was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/11/anaxi-brings-more-visibility-to-the-development-process/">Anaxi</a>.</p>

<p>In its early days, the team was actually working on a slightly different project that focused on data connectivity for marketing companies. The founders were accepted into Y Combinator and built out their application, but once the COVID pandemic hit, a lot of the companies that had placed early bets on Airbyte&#8217;s original project faced budget freezes and layoffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;At that point, we decided to go into deeper data integration and that&#8217;s how we started the Airbyte project and product as we know it today,&#8221; Tricot explained.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Airbyte is geared toward data engineering, without the specific industry focus of its early incarnation, but it offers both a graphical UI for building connectors, as well as APIs for developers to hook into.</p>
<p>As Tricot noted, a lot of companies start out by building their own data connectors &#8212; and that tends to work alright at first. But the real complexity is in maintaining them. &#8220;You have zero control over how they behave,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;So either they&#8217;re going to fail, or they&#8217;re going to change something. The cost of data integration is in the maintenance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even for a company that specializes in building these connectors, the complexity will quickly outpace its ability to keep up, so the team decided on building Airbyte as an open-source company. The team also argues that while there are companies like Fivetran that focus on data integration, a lot of customers end up with use cases that aren&#8217;t supported by Airbyte&#8217;s closed-source competitors and that they had to build themselves from the ground up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our mission with Airbyte is really to become the standard to replicate data,&#8221; Lafleur said. &#8220;To do that, we will open source every feature that addresses the need of the individual contributor, so all the connectors.&#8221; He also noted that Airbyte will exclusively focus on its open-source tools until it raises a Series A round &#8212; likely early next year.</p>
<p>To monetize its service, Airbyte plans to use an open-core model, where all of the features that address the needs of a company (think enterprise features like data quality, privacy, user management, etc.) will be licensed. The team is also looking at white-labeling its containerized connectors to others.</p>
<p>Currently, about 600 companies use Airbyte&#8217;s connectors &#8212; up from 250 just a month ago. Its users include the likes of Safegraph, Dribbble, Mercato, GraniteRock, Agridigital and Cart.com.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the new funding to double its team from about 12 people to 25 by the end of the year. Right now, the company&#8217;s focus is on establishing its user base, and then it plans to start monetizing that &#8212; and raise more funding &#8212; next year.</p>

Sales of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/19/what-doomsday-preppers-stock-up-on.html">survival goods from food kits to nuclear-proof bunkers are way up</a>, we <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling">doomscroll on Twitter all day</a>, and it seems like there isn’t a week that goes by where civilizational collapse isn’t at least a possibility on the agenda.</p>
<p>Yet, if you hang out in tech circles long enough, there remains an astonishing divergence between the realities of existential risk and the speculative nature this subject tends to push us toward.</p>
<p>In Silicon Valley, the fun topics here are scenarios like custom-designed pathogens that assassinate individuals or the entire human population constructed in a small biolab by an irascible bio Ph.D. (throw in CRISPR as an acronym to make it sound interesting). Coronal mass ejections or some sort of electromagnetic bomb comes up frequently, events that could knock out all power as we know it. You’ll also frequently run into some sort of hacking scenario where all the chips in the world are vulnerable to the same line of code (perhaps inspired in the vein of <a href="https://meltdownattack.com">Meltdown or Spectre</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			What the last year has shown is that we have a very bad cognitive bias where we think about the speculative dangers far too much and the mundane civilizational dangers far too little.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>These scenarios are fun and imaginative, and it’s a great Zoom drinking game in an otherwise “what do you do for a living” conversation.</p>
<p>What the last year has shown, however, is that we have a very bad cognitive bias here where we think about the speculative dangers far too much and the mundane civilizational dangers far too little.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is the too-obvious example, a pandemic that has been predicted in some form or another for literally decades. But it’s hardly the only “boring” disaster that’s befallen us. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/severe-weather-blackouts-shows-the-grids-biggest-problem-is-infrastructure-not-renewables/">The failure last month of much of Texas’ energy grid</a> knocked out power for days for millions of people at some of the coldest temperatures experienced locally — no electromagnetic bomb required. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/as-california-burns-climate-goals-may-go-up-in-smoke-even-after-the-flames-are-out/">California’s wildfire season has expanded</a>, leading to lives lost, wide-scale power outages, billions of dollars in damages and that iconic orange air — no Hollywood special effects required. A “software issue” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-fios-outage-cut-fiber-cable-brooklyn-2021-1">led to a swath of the East Coast losing the internet in January</a>, while a lone bomber in Nashville <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/us/nashville-bombing-telecommunications.html">knocked out much of the telecommunications in that metropolitan area</a> over the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>Here, then, is the divergence: we have <i>had</i> forms of civilizational collapse, but so far, they’ve been limited in duration and limited in scope. We didn’t all lose power: just Texas last month and California last year. We didn’t all lose internet: just the East Coast and Nashville at different times. We didn’t lose civilization, we just had a pandemic that has forced much of the world to regularly shut down schools and stores to limit viral spread. It’s almost like a disaster doesn’t count if Netflix still operates for 10% of the population.</p>
<p>So we have folks talking about artificial general intelligence and the singularity and fleeing to Mars, when the immediate reality is that <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/water-warning-the-looming-threat-of-the-worlds-aging-dams">there are thousands of dams under incredible strain where millions of people could perish in the coming years if a number of these fail</a>. Not just fail hypothetically, but fail as <i>predicted</i> when these structures reach the end of their usable lives and become increasingly vulnerable to collapse.</p>
<p>What’s strange is how much we as people have begun to cognitively route around these quotidian catastrophes. AWS outages that used to elicit extreme opprobrium a few years ago are now a snow day from Zoom calls. Power outages are just the new normal. Pandemics — well, why bother wearing a mask at this point anyway, even as variants start to threaten the recovery we all expect? As one colleague put it me, just buy a battery-powered radio — you know you’ll need it here soon, as if we should just expect to lose connectivity at any time.</p>
<p>The solutionism that makes Silicon Valley an entrepreneurial spectacle never seems to migrate over to the solvable world of most daily existential threats. Power grid failures are preventable. The internet was supposed to be designed to route around damage, not be based in a couple of central data centers and exchanges where one rogue patch or saboteur brings down the global GDP. Healthcare systems are capable of managing outbreaks — we know the playbook, if only we could execute on one.</p>
<p>Perhaps more frustrating than the lack of resilience and planning, which use precisely the sort of analytical skills that the Valley loves, is the sheer lack of action during these catastrophes. If the last year has shown us anything, it’s the complete lethargy from government to organizations to everyday citizens, all of which are apparently completely unprepared to do anything if disaster strikes.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t want to cast aspersions on the crowdsourced projects that sprung out of COVID-19 to direct people to hospitals, or to track data, or to guide people to finding vaccines today or finding masks in the early, hectic days. These projects are important despite their fumbles, and represent a fresh and flourishing civil society. It’s key though not to assume that keyboard actions can somehow compensate entirely for a lack of action in the field. The tech industry loves to code up a web app to solve all problems, when most disasters really and truly can’t be responded to with Python code.</p>
<p>Within the tech community, the one exception I have been able to find is Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who seems to have put his time and resources behind building out global capacity for disaster response with an organization called <a href="https://gsd.ngo">Global Support and Development</a>, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/google-co-founder-sergey-brin-has-a-secret-disaster-relief-squad">which Mark Harris described at length in a piece last year</a>. Per his article:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the past five years, GSD has been quietly using high-tech systems to rapidly deliver humanitarian assistance during high-profile disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic. These range from drones and super-yachts to a gigantic new airship that the outfit apparently hopes will make it easier to get aid supplies into disaster zones.</p></blockquote>
<p>We need more of this, and stat.</p>
<p>Existential risk has always been at the heart of the tech industry. From a radio broadcast of &#8220;The War of the Worlds&#8221; and the Manhattan Project to AI and cybernetics in the 1960s, cyberpunk and climate punk and all the other punks in the 80s, continuing right up to artificial general intelligence and the singularity today, we’ve always known that the technological progress we make could have massive consequences for the world as we know it.</p>
<p>Yet, it’s time to turn our attention away from the crazy and speculative and future, and more toward the chaos and challenges facing our world right now, using tools that we have available to us today. Most of our major challenges aren’t just solvable, they’re eminently solvable if we put the time into them. But that requires us to actively thwart our cognitive bias away from the scary and improbable to the mundane and normal — the boring events that almost certainly will actually kill us in the end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Making money on livestreams has never been easier thanks to a suite of tools from the Los Angeles-based startup <a href="https://info.maestro.io/">Maestro</a>, which just nabbed $15 million in financing to grow its business.</p>
<p>As video commerce becomes the norm and entertainers, brands, businesses, and franchises of all sizes and stripes look to cut out the middle man, the array of services on offer from Maestro may be the scissors these entities need to cut the cord.</p>
<p>The company has already worked with names as diverse as the Golden State Warriors, the Dallas Cowboys, and pop sensation Billy Eilish on embedding its interactive tools into various live events and promotions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Initially the LA-based company launched to the gaming community with interactive features that folks could use in-stream to create better engagement with fans. But what started in the gaming world quickly spun out as the company slashed prices to $500 per month for its services.</p>
<p>The pandemic also helped as artists who were cut off from their audiences began to explore alternative ways to reach fans &#8212; and make money.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We were targeted to a small number of very premier customers. It was around 50 to 60 and we grew to in the hundreds,&#8221; said Maestro chief executive, Ari Evans, said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 was a blowout year… People needed an interactive streaming platform that they could spin up quickly that they could launch on their website.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p>Celebrities from Katy Perry to Post Malone to Billie Eilish all turned to the service and so did other streaming platforms like the Los Angeles-based virtual concert platform, The Wave.</p>
<p>Now the company has $15 million in new financing to capitalize on its growth from investors including <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">NetEase, Sony Music Entertainment, and Acronym Venture Capital, alongside a host of industry titans including Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin and Moonwell Capital, founded by former Activision Blizzard executives Michael and Amy Morhaime, the company said in a statement. </span></p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Existing investors like SeventySix Capital, The Strand Partners, Stadia Ventures, Hersh Interactive Group, and Transcend Fund, as well as early Zoom employees Richard Gatchalian and Aaron Lewis, also participated. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Since the launch of monetization tools in May of last year, Evans estimated that the platform has paid out at least $5 million to entertainers who used the service.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“We are pleased to be supporting the continued development of Maestro as part of our ongoing investment in new technologies that provide artists with cutting-edge tools and solutions for growing their careers. Maestro gives artists greater flexibility and control to build the most engaging and customized events for their fans, allowing creators at any stage of their career to put together a world class live stream event,” said Dennis Kooker, President, Global Digital Business and U.S. Sales, Sony Music Entertainment, in a statement. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Maestro is at the forefront of redefining the relationship of content owners and creators with their viewers. Instead of relying on incumbent distribution platforms, customers control the audience relationship directly and maximize engagement and monetization in a way that fits with their brand objectives. We are very excited by Maestro’s potential to be a fundamental driver in the growth of the creator economy,” said Joshua Siegel, General Partner, Acronym Venture Capital.  </span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Maestro&#8230; started off with the content and now we’re adding membership and community management and ticketing and all that stuff,&#8221; said Evans. </span></p>
<p>The next step, and a big part of what Evans and his team of 55 employees will work on building will be a developer ecosystem, so software designers can start building out new tools to sell through the Maestro platform.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The third piece is a developer ecosystem,&#8221; Evans said. &#8220;We’re really copying Shopify, Squarespace for video or Shopify for video. It’s kind of strange that this has taken so long to develop.</span></p>
<p>The one thing that Maestro won&#8217;t do is discovery or search services, Evans said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re helping creators make money and build a business on top of video. That’s something creators need to be aware of if they’re going to  build that direct to consumer channel,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you do do that and you’re successful you’re in control over your audience.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Get ready to engage in essential conversations about some of the most important issues facing the tech industry — diversity, equity, inclusion and labor. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a> — a day-long virtual symposium — begins tomorrow, March 3, and we’re here to highlight just a few of the powerful people, presentations and fireside chats you won’t want to miss.</p>
<p>Hold up — if you don’t have a ticket yet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">secure your seat here</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from top experts, leading voices and social justice warriors — from the tech industry and beyond. It’s a highly interactive day, and the virtual platform lets you engage in the conversations, ask questions and connect with participants around the world.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here are just a few of tomorrow’s compelling presentations and exciting events. You’ll find a complete listing of the day’s programming in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">event agenda</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Equity in Tech with Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-CA):</strong> When it comes to myths, lack of tech diversity as a “pipeline problem” is a whopper. Don’t miss our discussion with Congresswoman Lee, California’s East Bay representative, about the opportunities to create an equal playing field in tech so that underrepresented investors, founders, designers and coders can reap the benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Fireside Chat &#8211; Diversity Is More Than Hiring People of Color:</strong> It may appear that the country is accepting change — from racial diversity to equality in the workplace. However, we still have ways to go. For example, organizational diversity is still about hiring from diverse talent pools. However, activating the full potential of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requires more than a “people strategy.” Robust and sustainable work in this area requires embedding DEI principles, policies, systems and practices into all parts of the business, including the employee and customer experience, brand culture and overall industry/corporate citizenship. Sponsored by Onshape.</p>
<p><strong>Pitch Feedback:</strong> Join us for a pitch feedback session for select TC Include founders exhibiting at TC Sessions: Justice 2021 and moderated by TechCrunch staff.</p>
<p><strong>Access All Areas &#8211; Designing Accessibility From Day One:</strong> This session examines the importance of ensuring accessible product design from the beginning. We’ll ask how the social and medical models of disability influence technological evolution. Integrating the expertise of disabled technologists, makers, investors, scientists and software engineers into your company’s DNA from the very beginning is vital to the pursuit of a functioning and equitable society. And could mean you don’t leave money on the table.</p>
<p>That’s just a tiny taste of what to expect tomorrow at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">Grab a pass</a>, check <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">the agenda</a>, plan your day accordingly and join us for the important work of creating a more diverse, inclusive and equitable tech industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve known for a long time that music streaming royalties are fundamentally broken. As revenue has shifted away from sales of physical music, it’s become increasingly difficult for many independent artists to make a living off recorded music. But all of that has come to a head as the pandemic has stripped live music out of the equation entirely.</p>
<p>Some services have looked to buck the trend. The immensely popular Bandcamp Fridays are a notable example, offering all revenue to artists and labels one day a month. And now SoundCloud is<a href="https://community.soundcloud.com/fanpoweredroyalties?utm_source=Braze&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=fanpoweredroyalties-launch"> looking to shake up</a> how it pays its own independent creators &#8212; a move that could prove a nice boon for musicians on a service that’s lent its name to at least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumble_rap">one popular musical subgenre</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The site will institute a new revenue structure at the beginning of next month. Soundcloud breaks down “Fan-powered” royalties thusly,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fan-powered royalties are a more equitable and transparent way for independent artists who monetize directly with SoundCloud to get paid. The more fans listen on SoundCloud, and listen to your music, the more you get paid.</p>
<p>Under the old model, money from your dedicated fans goes into a giant pool that&#8217;s paid out to artists based on their share of total streams. That model mostly benefits mega stars.</p></blockquote>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UX3jC0TOEO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bandcamp-fridays-will-continue-through-next-may/">Bandcamp Fridays will continue through next May</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Bandcamp Fridays will continue through next May&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bandcamp-fridays-will-continue-through-next-may/embed/#?secret=UX3jC0TOEO" data-secret="UX3jC0TOEO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Under fan-powered royalties, you get paid based on your fans&#8217; actual listening habits. The more of their time your dedicated fans listen to your music, the more you get paid. This model benefits independent artists.</p>
<p>The service is available for independent artists who monetize their pages through select Pro accounts. There are a number of factors that go into the final payment (the first of which will arrive in May), including whether listeners have a subscription, the amount they’ve listened to one artist relative to others and ads they’ve listened to. The <a href="https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260801306810">fine print is available here</a>.</p>
<p>Musicians have become increasingly vocal about their inability to live off of streaming revenue as the pandemic has cut off major income sources over the past year. Spotify, in particular, has drawn harsh criticism as the company has spent hundreds of millions on podcast acquisitions while maintaining old revenue models for musicians.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Postmates X, the robotics division of the on-demand delivery startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/uber-officially-completes-postmates-acquisition/">Uber acquired last year for $2.65 billion</a>, has officially spun out as an independent company called Serve Robotics.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/uber-planning-to-spin-out-postmates-delivery-robot-arm/">reported in January</a> that a deal was being shopped to investors.</p>
<p>Serve Robotics, a name taken from the autonomous sidewalk delivery bot that was developed and piloted by Postmates X, has raised seed funding in a round led by venture capital firm Neo. Other investors included Uber as well as Lee Jacobs and Cyan Banister&#8217;s Long Journey Ventures, Western Technology Investment, Scott Banister, Farhad Mohit and Postmates co-founders Bastian Lehmann and Sean Plaice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Serve Robotics didn&#8217;t share specifics of the funding except to confirm that the round, which will be a Series A, has not been completed yet. Funding a spin out can occur in phases, with the first tranche used for the initial launch and the rest of the round closing once IP has been transferred.</p>
<p>The new company will be run by Ali Kashani, who headed up Postmates X. Other co-founders include Dmitry Demeshchuk, the first engineer who joined the Serve team at Postmates and MJ Chun, who previously led product at Anki, has been heading up product strategy at Serve. The company is launching with 60 employees with headquarters in San Francisco and offices in Los Angeles and Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119707" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119707" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2119707 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg" alt="Serve Robotics Uber Postmates" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Serve-meets-dog.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119707" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Serve Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;While self-driving cars remove the driver, robotic delivery eliminates the car itself and makes deliveries sustainable and accessible to all,&#8221; said Kashani, co-founder and CEO of Serve Robotics. &#8220;Over the next two decades, new mobility robots will enter every aspect of our lives&#8211;first moving food, then everything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Postmates’ exploration into sidewalk delivery bots began in earnest in 2017 after the company quietly acquired Kashani’s startup Lox Inc. As head of Postmates X, Kashani set out to answer the question: why move two-pound burritos with two-ton cars? Postmates revealed its first Serve autonomous delivery bot in December 2018. A second generation — with an identical design but different lidar sensors and few other upgrades — emerged in summer 2019 ahead of its planned commercial launch in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s mission to <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">design, develop, and operate delivery robots specialized in navigating sidewalks will continue, albeit with an eye towards expansion. Serve </span>will continue its delivery operations in Los Angeles. It plans to ramp up research and development in the San Francisco Bay area and expand its market reach<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> through new partnerships.</span></p>
<p>The spin out is consistent with Uber&#8217;s aim to narrow the focus of its business on ride-hailing and delivery in a push towards profitability. This strategy began to take shape after Uber&#8217;s public market debut in May 2019 and accelerated last year as the COVID-19 pandemic put pressure on the ride-hailing company. Two years ago, Uber had enterprises across the transportation landscape, from ride-hailing and micromobility to logistics, public transit, food delivery and futuristic bets like autonomous vehicles and air taxis. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has dismantled the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach as he pushes the company toward profitability.</p>
<p>In 2020, Uber offloaded shared scooter and bike unit Jump in a complex deal with Lime, sold a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash/">stake worth $500 million</a> in its logistics spinoff Uber Freight and rid itself of its autonomous vehicle unit Uber ATG and its air taxi play Uber Elevate. Aurora <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b/">acquired Uber ATG</a> in a deal that had a similar structure to the Jump-Lime transaction. Aurora didn’t pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora, which gave it a 26% stake in the combined company. In a similarly crafted deal, Uber Elevate was sold to Joby Aviation in December.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.parabol.co/">Parabol</a>, a startup that provides retrospective meeting software to agile development teams, announced that it has closed an $8 million Series A. Microsoft&#8217;s venture capital arm, M12, led the deal. The investment also saw participation from Techstars, CRV, and Haystack.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Parabol CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/jrhusney?lang=en">Jordan Husney</a> to talk about the round, and his company. We were curious how large the market that Parabol serves is, and if the company was overly-nicheing its service. While the startup is still young, the answer appears to be no – adding to our general sentiment that the software market is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">even larger than we perhaps thought</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore how Parabol came to be, and how it came to pick its target market. Or more precisely, how its target market chose it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Building horizontally, focusing vertically</h2>
<p>After a stint in the consulting world, Husney was more than aware of the communications issues that distributed teams can endure. With multiple offices the norm among big companies, he told TechCrunch in an interview, communications between remote workers came down to an email thread, or a meeting. A self-described &#8220;recovering engineer,&#8221; Husney wondered if there was space in the business market for &#8220;structured communications,&#8221; or the type of asynchronous meetings that are popular in the code-writing world.</p>
<p>Borrowing from the ethos of agile development, a method of writing software that prioritizes collaboration and evolution over process and documentation, Husney built Parabol to bring agile work and communications methods to non-developer business teams. If agile principles were good at helping foster developer results through status meetings, why wouldn&#8217;t the same process translate to other work settings?</p>
<p>But the market had other ideas. Instead of hitting it big in the business world, owing to the friction resulting from needing what Husney described as a &#8220;behavior change&#8221; &#8212; something often lethal to rapid adoption of a new service, or product &#8212; agile teams themselves started using Parabol&#8217;s tech.</p>
<p>The startup followed the demand. And there&#8217;s quite a lot of it, as it turns out. Husney estimated that there are around 20 million agile developers in the world, the business from which has helped propel companies like Atlassian to enormous heights. It&#8217;s a big enough pool for the startup to swim in for a long time.</p>
<p>Returning to our earlier note about the depth of the software market, Parabol is a good reference point. It appears capable of building a real company on the back of supporting a subset of the software creation world&#8217;s peculiar meeting style; the market for software is simply gigantic.</p>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>After deciding to support agile software teams, growth came quickly to Parabol. In 2018 and 2019, the company saw growth of 20% to 40% each month, its CEO said. Calling his company a &#8220;rocket,&#8221; Husney gave partial credit to Parabol&#8217;s freemium go-to-market model, a common approach when selling to developers who eschew the traditional sales process.</p>
<p>By selling to the already-converted, Parabol found product-market fit. Husney himself had underestimated the demand from agile software developers for tools to support they work, because he thought that they&#8217;d already figured out their own needs, he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>What Parabol has built is not a simple tool, however. Powering retrospective meetings and incident post-mortems, its software collects notes from workers on things that should be done, things that should no longer done, and things that should be kept up. The service then aggregates them automatically by topic, followed by users voting to decide on changes and takeaway actions. The result is an asynchronous way for developer teams to stay in sync.</p>
<p>The startup closed a Seed round in November of 2019, just in time to have cash on hand for the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid switch to remote work quickly drove Parabol&#8217;s user growth from 600 per week in January of 2020, to 5,000 per week in March of the same year. The company has <a href="https://www.parabol.co/blog/241-remote-strategic-planning">some public usage data available here</a>, in case you want to check the spike yourself.</p>
<p>After raising its $4 million Seed, Husney decided to raise more capital after being told by others that it was a great time to do so. And after winding up with a few firms to choose between, wound up taking Microsoft&#8217;s money.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a story there. Per Husney, Microsoft&#8217;s M12 was not on the top of its venture capital list; there is a somewhat good reason for that, as taking strategic capital over pure-venture capital is a choice and not the best one for every startup. But after Husney and company got to know the Microsoft partners, and each side underwent diligence, the fit became clear. According to the CEO, M12&#8217;s investing team called various Microsoft groups &#8212; Azure, GitHub, etc &#8212; to ask them about their views on Parabol. They raved. So Microsoft had strong internal signals concerning the deal, and Parabol learned that its potential investor was a heavy user of its product.</p>
<p>The deal worked out.</p>
<p>Why $8 million and not more? The startup&#8217;s growth plan isn&#8217;t super capital intensive according to Husney, and its market is pulling it instead of the other way around. The team is dilution-conscious as well, he explained. The founding team put the company together in 2015, and didn&#8217;t raise its seed round until 2019. It was ramen days back then, he explained; you&#8217;ll cling to your ownership, I suppose, when you have bought it that dearly.</p>
<p>Parabol runs lean on purpose. Husney said that his team was not following the Reid Hoffman blitzscaling ethos, instead focusing on hiring for individual leverage. In the CEO&#8217;s view, you don&#8217;t need to scale quickly to build collaboration products.</p>
<p>The $8 million raise could give Parabol infinite runway, the CEO said, but his company instead raised it for about a 24 month spend. At the end of that he expects the company to have around 30 workers, up from its current 10.</p>
<p>Parabol wants to quadruple its revenues this year, and triple them in 2022. And it wants to scale to 500,000 users from its current 100,000 this year, reaching one million by the end of next year. Let&#8217;s see how it performs against those goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Way back in 2019, Apple launched Research. The app was the latest effort by a company looking to take a more serious approach to user health, built (naturally) around data collected from the iPhone and Apple Watch. The app debuted with four studies: heart health, women’s health, movement and hearing.</p>
<p>Today, the company is issuing results from the latter, conducted alongside the<a href="https://sph.umich.edu/applehearingstudy/"> University of Michigan School of Public Health</a>, a day prior World Hearing Day. Hearing loss is an issue the company has looked to tackle, due in no small part to its large &#8212; and growing &#8212; involvement in the headphone category.</p>
<p>Headphones have, of course, become a common source of long term hearing loss as the technology has proliferated. The company has also built noise level readings into its mobile operating systems, to offer notifications of loud environments. That info is also built into the health app, showing off both headphone levels and environmental sound levels – the latter of which can be a subtler source of hearing loss.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apple-hearing-study-shares-new-insights-on-hearing-health/">to the study of “thousands”</a> of participants in the U.S., a quarter of those involved encounter more than the WHO’s recommended daily limit of environmental sound exposure. 50% of those in the survey work or worked in in a loud environment. The numbers remain reasonably high, even as many or most have transitioned to a work-from-home setting during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Even during this pandemic, when many people are staying home, we’re still seeing 25%of our participants experiencing high environmental sound exposures,” University of Michigan Associate Profession Rick Neitzel says in a release tied to the news. “The results of this study can improve our understanding of potentially harmful exposures, and help identify ways that people can proactively protect their hearing.”</p>
<p>Ten-percent of those surveyed, meanwhile, exceed the recommended limit for weekly headphone exposure, while a quarter reported ringing in their ears a few times a week or more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://us.vestiairecollective.com">Vestiaire Collective</a> announced a new funding round. The company has raised $216 million, or €178 million — it has reached a valuation above $1 billion, making it a unicorn. French fashion and luxury group Kering is leading the round with Tiger Global Management. Kering now owns 5% of Vestiaire Collective.</p>
<p>The startup operates an online marketplace where you can find pre-owned luxury and fashion items. And it’s a complicated industry as you don’t want to buy a damaged item or a cheap knockoff. The company controls and authenticate some items before they reach the buyer. If you opt for direct shipping, you can get reimbursed if there’s something wrong with what you ordered.</p>
<p>In addition to the two lead investors, many of the company’s existing shareholders are investing once again, such as Vestiaire Collective’s own CEO Max Bittner, Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund, Condé Nast, Eurazeo through Eurazeo Growth and Idinvest Venture, Fidelity International, Korelya Capital, Luxury Tech Fund and Vitruvian Partner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As you may have noticed, it’s been a bit harder to travel and buy fashion items in store. Many fashion e-commerce companies have been thriving during the coronavirus outbreak, and Vestiaire Collective is one of them. Transaction volume doubled in 2020 compared to 2019. There are 140,000 new listings every week.</p>
<p>In addition to the current pandemic, many consumers are concerned about the impact of fashion on the environment. At the lower end of the spectrum, retailers and fast fashion brands encourage you to buy more and more stuff as trends change with each season. At the higher end of the spectrum, luxury brands don’t want to undermine the value of their goods by putting items on sale to clear room for a new collection.</p>
<p>That’s why Vestiaire Collective is particularly well positioned to find new customers who are looking for quality goods that are going to last for a while and that haven’t been specifically produced for them. Similarly, people can sell their stuff instead of throwing them away.</p>
<p>While Vestiaire Collective originally started in Europe, the company is now growing rapidly in the U.S. and Asia. “As of January 2021, local sellers in those regions had increased their items sold by more than 250% year-over-year,” Tiger Global partner Griffin Schroeder said in the release.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company plans to further develop partnerships with brands through buy-back circular solutions. The company also wants to encourage more people to sell something every time they buy something. Vestiaire Collective aims to be carbon neutral by 2026 and get the B Corp certification. The startup will also hire 155 people in the technology team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Live events in the age of Covid-19 have largely been moved into the virtual world: we buy tickets (or simply click on a link), go to a site or app, and watch the action unfold on a screen. Your seat or mine might be just as good as that of any other audience member, but these affairs also leave a lot to be desired. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.loopedlive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Looped</a> that&#8217;s trying to build a livestreaming event service that is more engaged and interactive is announcing some funding to see how it can fill that gap.</p>
<p>The startup, which powers music concerts, comedy and other entertainment, has closed funding of $7.7 million, money that Faisel Durrani, co-CEO of Looped, said in an interview will be used to continue building out the company&#8217;s technology stack. It has now raised $8.8 million in total.</p>
<p>The funding comes on the heels of a strong year for the company, which was founded in October 2019 and has since launch seen some 300,000 people buy virtual tickets to join events led by some 1,000 creators on its platform. Stars have included Billie Eilish, Shawn Mendes, BTS, Kevin Durant, Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Lamar Jackson, Baker Mayfield, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Usher, Sam Smith, Charlie Puth, Khalid, Dua Lipa, the original cast of Hamilton, and many more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These creators use Looped to set up and broadcast performances (using Looped&#8217;s own tools or integrating with whatever production tools a creator prefers to use), sell tickets and merchandise, create &#8220;backstage pass&#8221; rooms, initiate conversations between a couple or many people, create &#8220;co-viewing&#8221; suites for groups to watch something together, and more.</p>
<p>As an example of what you can do on Looped, the Hamilton cast assembled for a charity event called <a href="https://www.loopedlive.com/blog-post/celebrating-black-history-month-a-look-back-on-ham4change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ham4Change</a>, to raise money for 9 non-profits working on fighting racial injustice. The event, which saw the cast chatting and singing for their audience, raised over $1.1 million, selling 15,500+ livestream tickets and 1,000+ Virtual Meet &amp; Greets with 35 cast members. (One of the screenshots of the event is illustrated here.)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2119671" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ham4change.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="382" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ham4change.jpg 2024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ham4change.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ham4change.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ham4change.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ham4change.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ham4change.jpg?resize=1536,862 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ham4change.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>The funding is notable for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, Looped is yet another example of the proliferation of streaming startups and virtual event services that are seeing attention in the market today. In addition to the very obvious and biggest players like Zoom (which is&#8230; <a href="http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/01/2184699/0/en/Zoom-Video-Communications-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2021-Financial-Results.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zooming</a> right now, and also moving into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/zoom-launches-its-events-platform-and-marketplace-brings-apps-to-your-calls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">events</a>), there are sizable startups like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/vcs-are-chasing-hopin-upwards-of-5-6b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopin</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/bizzabo-raises-138m-for-a-platform-that-helps-you-build-and-run-virtual-conferences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bizzabo</a>, and smaller or newer tech player like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/event-networking-app-grip-raises-13m-as-pandemic-forces-events-to-stay-virtual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grip</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/welcome-raises-12-million-to-be-the-ritz-carlton-for-event-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Welcome</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/26/hubilo-raises-4-5-million-led-by-lightspeed-to-focus-on-virtual-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubilo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/touchcast-raises-55m-to-grow-its-ar-based-virtual-event-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Touchcast</a>, and many others slicing up different segments or aspects of running a virtual event.</p>
<p>Big tech platforms like Google&#8217;s YouTube already have a strong business in live streaming massive events, and other online media companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/pinterest-tests-online-events-with-dedicated-class-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/spotify-is-developing-a-virtual-events-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify</a> are also testing the waters for its users&#8217; appetites for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/spotify-adds-virtual-event-listings-to-its-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual events</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many people playing in this space, which is the good news because it’s the future,&#8221; said Durrani, himself a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/faisel-durrani/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longtime entertainment and music industry executive</a>. &#8220;Those that create the most innovation will be the ones that win. The question is: how do we build new products for further engagement?&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, the<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> other reason why Looped&#8217;s funding is notable is because of who is doing the backing: a 100+ person syndicate of people who are strategic network partners for the startup as it looks to expand the list of creators who use it. </span></p>
<p>The funding is led by Will Ventures, with participation from Rocketship VC, Alpaca VC, Forefront Venture Partners, HOF Capital, Toy Ventures, Intuition Capital, Predictive VC and Ketch Ventures. Alongside that tame list, it lists more than 90 strategic angel investors.</p>
<p>At the risk of getting something wrong or missing something out, I&#8217;m copying the whole list directly from the company. Angel investors include former Bunim/Murray Productions CEO and Emmy-winning Television Producer Gil Goldschein; President of Live Nation Urban &amp; Maverick Management Partner Shawn Gee; Blueprint Group Co-CEOs &amp; Maverick Management Partners Gee Roberson &amp; Cortez “Tez” Bryant; Grammy-winning Singer and Songwriter Jill Scott; California Film Commissioner, Former U.S. Ambassador, and Emmy-nominated Television Producer Colleen Bell; Former Uber CFO and Former Microsoft &amp; Google executive Brent Callinicos; RealNetworks Founder Rob Glaser; Arcot Systems &amp; Acalvio Technologies Founder Ram Varadarajan; Consumer Media &amp; Technology Pioneer and HelloTech Founder Richard Wolpert; Goodreads Founders Elizabeth Khuri Chandler &amp; Otis Chandler; Prominent angel investor and podcast host James Beshara; Former Turner CCMO Lauren Hurvitz; Founder of Multi-Platinum band &amp; record label Laurie Marvald; LA Lakers Partnerships Executive Erika Singal; Immortals Gaming Club Founder Noah Whinston; and Gen Z VC Patrick Finnegan.</p>
<p>“I have always been driven by innovation. The underlying technology combined with audience interactivity built by the team at Looped forms a truly impressive media platform,” said Gil Goldschein, Former CEO of Bunim/Murray Productions, in a statement. &#8220;“This type of intersection between media and technology is the way of the future.”</p>
<p>Others include Grammy-winning Musician and Entrepreneur Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson; Musician, Entrepreneur, and member of Grammy-winning group Backstreet Boys AJ McLean; Actor and Grammy-winning lead MC of hip-hop group The Roots Tariq “Black Thought” Trotter; and Super Bowl LV Champion, NFL All-Pro Defensive Tackle, and House of Spears Management Managing Partner Ndamukong Suh.</p>
<p>“Looped is an absolute game changer. It provides so many great opportunities for artists to connect with fans while they&#8217;re off the road, and to create new hybrid experiences while touring as well,” said AJ McLean in another statement. “This platform is going to be a staple in fan interaction for many years to come.”</p>
<p>That network of investors may sound a little noisy and highlight how party rounds can find companies without dedicated avocates or close advisors, but in this case Durrani said it&#8217;s done intentionally for the purposes of improving its network.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest hurdle right now is still one of adoption,&#8221; he said, with virtual events nowhere near the scale of activity as that of a typical performer on a tour. In fact, many artists have pulled away from performing almost entirely in the current climate: they too face &#8220;Zoom fatigue&#8221; and there is a hesitation too about flooding the market too much right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;This space is still fairly new, and we&#8217;re all going through a difficult time in this pandemic where we are having screen exhaustion. It means that many people are eager to get back to the old ways rather than embracing what will be the new world as we move forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a believer that the virtual event business will be part of the portfolio as we move forward, but we&#8217;re still just on the cusp of it.&#8221; He added that a recent Goldman Sachs survey of consumers found that 74% said they would continue to consume content virtually even after the pandemic has passed. Encouraging numbers for Looped and many others, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
<p>For the more usual suspect VC investors, they see in Looped a company that, by virtue of its specialization on entertainment events (similar to how Touchcast is specializing on corporate events) it has a strong play to make here.</p>
<p>“In a crowded virtual venue market, Looped clearly stands out from the pack. Their focus on product innovation sets them apart, and it&#8217;s enabled them to establish industry-leading talent, partners, and traction,” said Brian Reilly, Managing Partner at Will Ventures, in a statement. “Their products will change how creators engage with their fans by increasing access and facilitating authentic connections. We&#8217;re excited to support Looped in their mission to bring creators closer to their fans all over the world.”</p>
<p>It will definitely be worth watching, especially as huge tech companies like Apple, Spotify, Google continue to eye up the space and look for leaders among startups that can help them build out their own offerings and connections to artists and creators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Investors appear excited to buy shares in impending public companies Oscar Health and Coupang. TechCrunch covered both extensively during their ramp toward the public markets, and more recently regarding their IPO march. And now, with a combined valuation well above $50 billion, both public offerings should make a splash.</p>
<p>And in good news for their respective investors, recent pricing points to an IPO market that remains enthusiastic about new listings, despite some recent chop among public technology equities.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The valuation news from Coupang and Oscar Health bodes well for other impending offerings, including a host of SPAC-led flotations and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">coming direct-listing of cryptocurrency giant Coinbase</a>.</p>

<p>These companies will soon convert tens of billions of dollars of illiquid private shares into public currency. As such, their offerings may reveal investors&#8217; sentiments regarding e-commerce and insurance companies backed by venture capital.</p>
<h2>Oscar Health and Coupang&#8217;s IPO pricing</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/coupang-may-raise-up-to-3-6-billion-in-its-ipo-at-a-potential-valuation-of-51-billion/">TechCrunch reported this morning</a>, South Korean e-commerce player Coupang could be worth as much as $51 billion in its IPO if its first debut price range of $27 to $30 per share holds up; the price range matches <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/coupang-files-for-mega-us-ipo/">earlier expectations for the company</a>, which recorded revenues of $11.97 billion in 2020, up more than 90% from its year-ago results.</p>
<p>Oscar Health&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568651/000119312521064668/d28906ds1a.htm">new IPO price range</a> is even more interesting than Coupang&#8217;s first. The insurance startup&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/oscar-healths-initial-ipo-price-is-so-high-it-makes-me-want-to-swear/">first IPO pricing interval of $32 to $34 per share</a> valued the company at a midpoint, full-diluted price of <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/78076/Health-insurer-Oscar-Health-sets-terms-for-$1-billion-IPO">around $7.7 billion</a>. Its range is now $36 to $38 per share, more than modestly higher than its prior target price range.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

But before that can occur, Spotify has to get more people listening to podcasts through its app. On that front, the streaming service has momentum. According to a new market <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-podcast-listener-numbers-will-surpass-apples-this-year">forecast</a>, Spotify&#8217;s U.S. podcast listenership will surpass Apple Podcasts for the first time this year when 28.2 million U.S. users will listen to podcasts on Spotify at least monthly, compared with 28.0 million via Apple Podcasts.</p>
<p>This shift will come on the heels of expected 41.3% in 2021, the analysts at <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/spotify-podcast-listener-numbers-will-surpass-apples-this-year">eMarketer</a> are predicting.</p>
<p>In the two years that follow, Spotify will widen the gap with Apple, reaching 33.1 million monthly U.S. podcast listeners by 2022, versus 28.5 million for Apple Podcasts. And by 2023, Spotify will see 37.5 monthly million listeners in the U.S., compared with Apple&#8217;s still flat 28.8 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firm notes that Apple has been losing podcast listener share since it first began tracking the market back in 2018. At that point, Apple Podcasts had a 34% market share, which will fall to 23.8% this year.</p>
<p>Overall, there will be 117.8 million people in the U.S. who listen to podcasts on a monthly basis in 2021, a 10.1% year-over-year increase. Podcast listeners will also account for 53.9% of monthly digital audio listeners, surpassing 50% for the first time, eMarketer says. This growth is also likely to benefit Spotify at Apple&#8217;s expense.</p>
<p>Apple, unlike other streaming music services &#8212; including Spotify, Amazon, and Pandora, for example &#8212; has split off podcasts into their own app instead of offering an integrated experience with music and podcasts combined. That means it&#8217;s missing out from some of the crossover that occurs when someone is streaming music or thinking of doing so, but then decides to listen to podcasts instead and vice versa. In other apps, making the jump between music and other audio is easier &#8212; and there are even ways to listen to music and podcasts combined, as with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/pandora-stories-launches-combining-music-and-podcasting-in-a-new-format/">Pandora Stories</a> or Spotify&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-10-14/spotify-launches-new-audio-experience-combining-music-and-talk-content/">Shows with Music</a> and its other <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-09-30/how-to-make-your-own-podcast-playlists/">mixed-media playlists</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;By putting podcasts and music in one place, Spotify quickly became the convenient one-stop-shop for everything digital audio,&#8221; noted eMarketer forecasting analyst Peter Vahle. &#8220;Apple was the de facto destination for podcasts for a long time, but in recent years, it has not kept up with Spotify&#8217;s pace of investment and innovation in podcast content and technology. Spotify’s investments have empowered podcast creators and advertisers through its proprietary hosting, creation, and monetization tools,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Apple today still seems to be experimenting with podcasts. It recently began calling attention to quality podcasts, through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/apples-new-editorial-franchise-apple-podcasts-spotlight-to-highlight-interesting-creators/">increased editorial curation</a>. It&#8217;s dabbled in releasing a few podcasts of its own, as with its <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/apple-for-all-mankind-companion-podcast-1234693923/">recently launched</a> &#8220;For All Mankind&#8221; companion podcast for its Apple TV+ series or its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/apple-further-expands-into-original-podcasts-with-launch-of-the-zane-lowe-interview-series/">original podcasts</a> focused on music. But Apple seems to have largely ignored the market momentum around the format, instead focusing on expansions to new areas &#8212; like streaming TV and movies or subscription-based fitness.</p>
<p>Spotify, which already has a set of originals and exclusives via acquisitions, is moving ahead to what&#8217;s next. Last week, for instance, it announced a number of upcoming products and features, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature/">paid podcast subscriptions</a>, WordPress integrations to turn blogs into podcasts, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature/">tools to make its podcasts more interactive</a> &#8212; the latter an attempt at challenging the growing interest in social audio apps like Clubhouse.</p>
<p>The company is also newly investing in the advertising business around podcasts with plans to launch an audio ad marketplace, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/">the Spotify Audience Network</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119653" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119653" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2119653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="613" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png 1020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?resize=300,271 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?resize=768,693 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?resize=680,613 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/podcast-ad-spending.png?resize=50,45 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119653" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> eMarketer</p></div></p>
<p>That could be a timely launch, eMarketer&#8217;s forecast indicates. The firm is predicting that podcast advertising will top $1 billion for the first time in 2021, reaching $1.28 billion &#8212; a 41% year-over-year increase. This figure will continue to grow in the years to come, with podcasts going from a 24% share of the total digital audio ad spend in 2021 to 29% by 2024.</p>
<p>To what extent Spotify can actually follow through on converting its podcast listenership to paid subscribers of some sort, or whether it can successfully monetize them through advertisements, remains to be seen, of course. After all, Spotify today is losing money, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-with-focus-on-podcasts-11612350000?mod=djemalertNEWS">The Wall St. Journal</a> recently pointed out in covering its Q4 2020 earnings. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s still prioritizing investments in subscriber growth and podcasting over turning a profit for the time being. And there are some early indications that its exclusive model could have issues &#8212; last year, for example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-27/spotify-loses-joe-budden-company-s-first-big-podcasting-star">it lost its first big podcast star,</a> Joe Budden, when it failed to reach a new agreement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple has been said to be <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-podcasting-subscription-service-in-threat-to-spotify">exploring a podcast subscription service</a> of its own, too &#8212; something it could bundle into a higher-value subscription that includes other services like cloud storage, streaming TV, games and more. And Amazon just made its own investment in podcast with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/amazon-acquires-podcast-network-wondery/">acquisition of podcast network Wondery</a>. These factors could come into play over the next few years, potentially disrupting this forecast and Spotify&#8217;s future podcast listenership growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Semih Korkmaz and Hantz Févry launched <a href="https://www.stoovo.com/">Stoovo</a> in 2019 as a way to help gig workers make the best use of their time.</p>
<p>Févry, who immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, knew first hand the struggles that come with part time work from his days as a student at Stonybrook University. While there bouncing from job to job, Févry would feel the sting associated with hidden fees, unkept promises, and variability of part-time labor.</p>
<p>The time at Stonybrook was also when Févry got his first taste of entrepreneurship. In 2010 and 2011 Févry said the Dean of the University&#8217;s business school let the budding business owner cut back on his hours so he could start <a href="http://www.i-tradeonline.com/">iTrade International,</a> an import-export business selling earthquake detection equipment in Haiti.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That first taste of tech and business development eventually landed Févry a job at Google in Hong Kong and offered him the chance to travel around the world. After a stint in Europe, Févry moved back to the U.S. where he set to work building Stoovo.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question on his mind was this: How can we leverage technology to help gig workers or people taking short term assignments?</span></p>
<p>Févry and his co-founder Korkmaz envisioned Stoovo as a way to level they playing field by providing gig workers with information about the highest paying jobs available on the gig platforms at any one time. &#8220;What the platforms are doing is they are  optimizing to make sure that they&#8217;re responding to demand,&#8221; Févry said. &#8220;What we do is use the same approach to predict what will be the demand, where will be the demand, what will be the competition, and what&#8217;s the payout.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s software advises gig workers on the optimum time for using each service based on their earning criteria and hours, Févry said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We tell you when to start working, where you need to start working, and when you need to go when you need to take your break,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p>But the company&#8217;s service isn&#8217;t only about optimization. There&#8217;s also a banking component and a suite of products to ensure that gig workers are also getting the most out of their gigs financially. The company offers a checking account, a tax management service, and lending services as well through services like <a href="https://bellbizzer.com/">BellBizzer</a>, a Seattle-based company which offers a short-term rental service for consumer goods.</p>
<p>Both Korkmaz and Févry spent time working as delivery drivers or freelancing to get a feel for the challenges gig workers faced, Févry said. During lunch breaks at Google, Févry would do food deliveries to seewhat he could do so that he could understand how to make the gig economy work better.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best solution would be to pay gig workers a fair wage for the time they spend doing their work, but barring that, technologically developed band-aids to help heal technologically enabled wounds seem like the only option.</p>
<p>Gig companies like Uber have a history of using their algorithms to wring more money from drivers &#8212; sometimes unbeknownst to the workers.</p>
<p>Back in August, a developer named Armin Samii created an app called UberCheats that monitored the UberEats application for a software bug to inform drivers if they were underpaid by the company for the distance they&#8217;d traveled to make a delivery. Last week,<a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/uber-drivers-underpaid-app-google-remove/"> the app was taken dow</a>n, but only because of a copyright infringement claim from Uber.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">UberCheats is now live! Download the Chrome extension to detect if UberEats has underpaid you.</p>
<p>Uber could block this at any time, so if you&#39;re an UberEats driver/biker, please download it before it&#39;s blocked by Uber and let me know if Uber cheated you!<a href="https://t.co/NsIuTbsSU1">https://t.co/NsIuTbsSU1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Armin Samii (@ArminSamii) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArminSamii/status/1295857106080456706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stoovo and UberCheats seem to come from the same place. The idea is to equip workers with tools that can work for workers instead of for big platforms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s this vision that attracted investors like Derek Norton from <a href="https://www.watertowerventures.com/">Watertower Ventures</a> to invest in the company. To date, Stoovo has raised $2.4 million from investors including Watertower, 500 Startups, Plug and Play Ventures, and TSEF, Févry said.</p>
<p>With the money the company hopes to build out more products that can enable things like low-cost money transfers. Ultimately, the company just wants to give these gig workers a chance, Févry said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The gig economy is rife with frustrations,&#8221; Févry said, and Stoovo is making a pitch to smooth over the obstacles. &#8220;We really understand your life. We are also immigrants,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We know that of that $200&#8230; we know you have to send $40 overseas&#8230; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are building a product with [gig workers], we are not building for them.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On-demand grocery delivery platform Instacart has raises a $265 million funding ground from existing investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and others. The new funding, which, like its past few rounds, isn&#8217;t assigned a Series alphabetical designation, pushes the company&#8217;s valuation to $39 billion – more than double its $17.7 billion valuation when it raised is last financing, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/instacart-raises-200m-more-at-17-7b-valuation/">$200 million venture round in October 2020</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s behind the massive increase in the value investors are willing to ascribe to the business? Put simply, the pandemic. Last year, Instacart announced three separate raises, including a $225 round in June, followed by a $100 million round in July. The rapid sequence of venture capital injections were likely designed to fuel growth as demand for grocery delivery services surged while people attempted to quarantine or generally spend less time frequenting high-traffic social environments like grocery stores.</p>

<p>In a blog post announcing the news, Instacart doesn&#8217;t put specifics on the growth rates of usage over the course of 2020, but it does express its intent to grow headcount by 50% in 2021, and continue to scale and invest in its advertising, marketing and enterprise efforts specifically in a quote.</p>
<p>On the product side, Instacart broadened its offerings from groceries to also include same-day delivery of a wide range of products, including prescription medicine, electronics, home decor, sport and exercise equipment and more. It&#8217;s capitalizing on the phenomenon of increased consumer spending during the pandemic, which is a reverse from what many anticipated given the impact the ongoing crisis has had on employment.</p>
<p>Instacart <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/instacart-announces-265-million-in-new-funding-from-existing-investors-301238155.html">Chief Financial Officer Nick Giovanni said in a quote</a> that the company expects this to be &#8220;a new normal&#8221; for shopping habits, and the size and pace of the company&#8217;s recent funding, as well as its ballooning valuation, seem to suggest its investors also don&#8217;t think this is a trend that will revert post-pandemic.</p>
