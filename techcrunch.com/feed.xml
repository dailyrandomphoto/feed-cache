										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The only thing happening faster than tech mobility right now is the speed at which our early bird price for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=4daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb4days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> will disappear. You have just <strong>four days left</strong> to save $100 to our June 9 deep-dive exploration into the current and future state of mobility and transportation.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=4daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb4days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy your pass to TC Sessions Mobility 2021</a> before the price increase goes into effect on <strong>Thursday, May 6 at 11:59 pm (PT).</strong></p>
<p>The event is virtual (thanks a bunch, you nasty pandemic), but the information you’ll glean and the worldwide connections you’ll make are very real. The global nature of the opportunities waiting for you to find is a big democratizing benefit of going virtual.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The day comes jam-packed with presentations, one-on-one interviews and breakout sessions with the top founders, investors and makers in mobility. Don’t stress about missing out over a schedule conflict — your pass includes access to video-on-demand once the event ends.</p>
<p>Here’s what Rachael Wilcox, a creative producer at Volvo Cars, told us about her experience at TC Sessions: Mobility 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was impressed with the virtual platform. It was easy to navigate and a great format for asking questions. Combining live-stream and VOD options provided schedule flexibility, which let me be more focused and attend more presentations than I could at a live event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at just some of the topics and the people who will cover them. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=4daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb4days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check out the agenda here</a> and plan your strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Will Venture Capital Drive the Future of Mobility?</strong> Clara Brenner, Quin Garcia and Rachel Holt will discuss how the pandemic changed their investment strategies, the hottest sectors within the mobility industry, the rise of SPACs as a financial instrument and where they plan to put their capital in 2021 and beyond.</li>
<li><strong>Equity, Accessibility and Cities:</strong> Can mobility be accessible, equitable and remain profitable? We have brought together community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer Tamika L. Butler; Remix by Via co-founder and CEO Tiffany Chu and Revel co-founder and CEO Frank Reig to discuss how (and if) shared mobility can provide equity in cities, while still remaining a viable and even profitable business. The trio will also dig into the challenges facing cities and how policy may affect startups.</li>
<li><strong>EV Founders in Focus:</strong> We sit down with the founders poised to take advantage of the rise in electric vehicle sales. This time, we will chat with Kameale Terry, co-founder and CEO of ChargerHelp! a startup that enables on-demand repair of electric vehicle charging stations.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re into mobility, you can’t afford to miss the information, trends, networking and connection opportunities you’ll find at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=4daysebcountdown&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=eb4days&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s widely known that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/dells-debt-hangover-from-67b-emc-deal-could-put-vmware-stock-in-play/">Dell has a debt problem</a> left over from its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/67-billion-dell-emc-deal-becomes-official-today/">massive acquisition of EMC</a> in 2016, and it seems to be moving this year to eliminate part of it in multi-billion chunks. The first step <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/">was spinning out VMware</a> as a separate company last month, a move expected to net close to $10 billion.</p>
<p>The second, long expected, finally dropped last night when the company announced it was selling Boomi to a couple of private equity firms for $4 billion. Francisco Partners is joining forces with TPG to make the deal to buy the integration platform.</p>
<p>Boomi is not unlike Mulesoft, a company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">Salesforce purchased in 2018 for $6.5 billion</a>, although a bit longer in tooth. They both help companies with integration problems by creating connections between disparate systems. With so many pieces in place from various acquisitions over the years, it seems like a highly useful asset for Dell to help pull these pieces together and make them work, but the cash is trumping that need.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Providing integration services is a growing requirement as companies look for ways to make better use of data locked in siloed systems. Boomi could help and that&#8217;s one of the primary reasons for the acquisition, according to Francisco executives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ability to integrate and connect data and workflows across any combination of applications or domains is a critical business capability, and we strongly believe that Boomi is well positioned to help companies of all sizes turn data into their most valuable asset,&#8221; Francisco CEO Dipanjan Deb and partner Brian Decker said in a statement.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Dell is spinning out VMware in a deal expected to generate over $9B for the company&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/dell-is-spinning-out-vmware-in-a-deal-expected-to-generate-over-9b-for-the-company/embed/#?secret=nY35pcMla8" data-secret="nY35pcMla8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As you would expect, Boomi&#8217;s CEO Chris McNabb put a positive spin on the deal about how his new bosses were going to fuel growth for his company. &#8220;By partnering with two tier-one investment firms like Francisco Partners and TPG, we can accelerate our ability for our customers to use data to drive competitive advantage. In this next phase of growth, Boomi will be in a position of strength to further advance our innovation and market trajectory while delivering even more value to our customers,&#8221; McNabb said in a statement.</p>
<p>All of this may have some truth to it, but the company goes from being part of a large amorphous corporation to getting absorbed in the machinery of two private equity firms. What happens next is hard to say.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2000, and sold to Dell in 2010. Today, it has 15,000 customer, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/dell-spent-67b-buying-emc-more-than-3-years-later-was-it-worth-the-debt/">Dell&#8217;s debt has been well documented,</a> and when you string together a couple of multi-billion deals as Dell has recently, pretty soon you&#8217;re talking real money. While the company has not stated it will explicitly use the proceeds of this deal to pay off debt as it did with the VMware announcement, it stands to reason that this will be the case.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close later this year, although it will have to pass the typical regulatory scrutiny prior to that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remote work is no longer a new topic, as much of the world has now been doing it for a year or more because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies &#8212; big and small &#8212; have had to react in myriad ways. Many of the initial challenges have focused on workflow, productivity and the like. But one aspect of the whole remote work shift that is not getting as much attention is the culture angle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 100% remote startup that was tackling the issue way before COVID-19 was even around is now seeing a big surge in demand for its offering that aims to help companies address the “people” challenge of remote work. It started its life with the name Icebreaker to reflect the aim of “breaking the ice” with people with whom you work.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We designed the initial version of our product as a way to connect people who’d never met, kind of virtual speed dating,” says co-founder and CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry Rosenstein. “But we realized that people were using it for far more than that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So over time, its offering has evolved to include a bigger goal of helping people get together beyond an initial encounter –– hence its new name: <a href="https://gatheround.com">Gatheround</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For remote companies, a big challenge or problem that is now bordering on a crisis is how to build connection, trust and empathy between people that aren’t sharing a physical space,” says co-founder and COO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lisa Conn.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “There’s no five-minute conversations after meetings, no shared meals, no cafeterias &#8212; this is where connection organically builds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations should be concerned, Gatheround maintains, that as we move more remote, that work will become more transactional and people will become more isolated. They can&#8217;t ignore that humans are largely social creatures, Conn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup aims to bring people together online through real-time events such as a range of chats, videos and one-on-one and group conversations. The startup also provides templates to facilitate cultural rituals and learning &amp; development (L&amp;D) activities, such as all-hands meetings and workshops on diversity, equity and inclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gatheround’s video conversations aim to be a refreshing complement to Slack conversations, which despite serving the function of communication, still don’t bring users face-to-face.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146442" style="width: 624px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146442" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2146442" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="614" height="385" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Gatheround-Group-Share.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146442" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gatheround</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, Gatheround has quietly built up an impressive customer base, including 28 Fortune 500s, 11 of the 15 biggest U.S. tech companies, 26 of the top 30 universities and more than 700 educational institutions. Specifically, those users include Asana, Coinbase, Fiverr, Westfield and DigitalOcean. Universities, academic centers and nonprofits, including Georgetown&#8217;s Institute of Politics and Public Service and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, are also customers. To date, Gatheround has had about 260,000 users hold 570,000 conversations on its SaaS-based, video platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All its growth so far has been organic, mostly referrals and word of mouth. Now, armed with $3.5 million in seed funding that builds upon a previous $500,000 raised, Gatheround is ready to aggressively go to market and build upon the momentum it’s seeing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture firms Homebrew and Bloomberg Beta co-led the company’s latest raise, which included participation from angel investors such as Stripe COO Claire Hughes Johnson, Meetup co-founder Scott Heiferman, Li Jin and Lenny Rachitsky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founders Rosenstein, Conn and Alexander McCormmach describe themselves as “experienced community builders,” having previously worked on President Obama’s campaigns as well as at companies like Facebook, Change.org and Hustle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trio emphasize that Gatheround is also very different from Zoom and video conferencing apps in that its platform gives people prompts and organized ways to get to know and learn about each other as well as the flexibility to customize events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re fundamentally a connection platform, here to help organizations connect their people via real-time events that are not just really fun, but meaningful,” Conn said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebrew Partner Hunter Walk says his firm was attracted t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o the company&#8217;s founder-market fit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re a really interesting combination of founders with all this experience community building on the political activism side, combined with really great product, design and operational skills,” he told TechCrunch. “It was kind of unique that they didn’t come out of an enterprise product background or pure social background.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also drawn to the personalized nature of Gatheround’s platform, considering that it has become clear over the past year that the software powering the future of work “needs emotional intelligence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Many companies in 2020 have focused on making remote work more productive. But what people desire more than ever is a way to deeply and meaningfully connect with their colleagues,” Walk said. “Gatheround does that better than any platform out there. I&#8217;ve never seen people come together virtually like they do on Gatheround, asking questions, sharing stories and learning as a group.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Cham, partner at Bloomberg Beta, agrees with Walk that the founding team&#8217;s knowledge of behavioral psychology, group dynamics and community building gives them an edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;More than anything, though, they care about helping the world unite and feel connected, and have spent their entire careers building organizations to make that happen,&#8221; he said in a written statement. &#8220;So it was a no-brainer to back Gatheround, and I can&#8217;t wait to see the impact they have on society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 14-person team will likely expand with the new capital, which will also go toward helping adding more functionality and details to the Gatheround product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even before the pandemic, remote work was accelerating faster than other forms of work,” Conn said. “Now that’s intensified even more.”</span></p>
<p>Gatheround is not the only company attempting to tackle this space. Ireland-based Workvivo last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/inside-workvivos-plans-to-take-on-microsoft-in-the-employee-experience-space/">raised $16 million</a> and earlier this year, Microsoft  launched Viva, its new “employee experience platform.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following several days of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ef0992ec-1d4f-4030-95a9-d950e47338e1">negotiation</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/02/business/verizon-yahoo-aol-sale.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">rumors</a>, Verizon <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-media-be-acquired-apollo-funds">today announced</a> that it has entered an agreement to sell its media assets to private equity firm Apollo Global Management for $5 billion. Apollo will be paying Verizon  $4.25 billion in cash, along with preferred interests of $750 million, and Verizon will keep 10% of the company.</p>
<p>The new company, when the deal is complete, will be known simply as Yahoo, and it will continue to be led by current CEO, Guru Gowrappan.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be joining forces with Apollo,” said Gowrappan, CEO, Verizon Media, in a statement. “The past two quarters of double-digit growth have demonstrated our ability to transform our media ecosystem. With Apollo’s sector expertise and strategic insight, Yahoo will be well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities, media and transaction experience and continue to grow our full stack digital advertising platform. This transition will help to accelerate our growth for the long- term success of the company.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are thrilled to help unlock the tremendous potential of Yahoo and its unparalleled collection of brands,” said Reed Rayman, private equity partner at Apollo, in the same statement. “We have enormous respect and admiration for the great work and progress that the entire organization has made over the last several years, and we look forward to working with Guru, his talented team, and our partners at Verizon to accelerate Yahoo’s growth in its next chapter.”</p>
<p>Although Verizon is retaining a stake, its divestment signifies a formal retreat for the telecoms giant, away from its expensive effort to take a stronger role in efforts to own, build and monetize content on top of its own and others&#8217; networks.</p>
<p>The news today caps off days, weeks, months and arguably years of speculation about the future of the media business under Verizon. The price Apollo is paying is in line with reports of the deal in recent days, which collectively pegged the deal at around $4-5 billion.</p>
<p>Those figures may sound big, but not when compared to what Verizon originally paid: a combined $9 billion+ respectively first<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/23/verizon-completes-its-acquisition-of-aol-for-4-4b/"> for AOL</a> in 2015 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/13/verizon-closes-4-5b-acquisition-of-yahoo-marissa-mayer-resigns-memo/">then Yahoo</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>The former deal brought AOL and its various media holdings &#8212; including The Huffington Post, TechCrunch, Engadget &#8212; under the VZW umbrella, while the latter added the iconic Yahoo search portal along with a slate of Yahoo services and Tumblr, resulting in a curious mix of newer services skewing to younger audiences mixed with a number of legacy internet properties, plus some experimental efforts thrown into the mix. (And some of those newer efforts are still a part of the process: Verizon notes that Yahoo News is currently the fastest-growing news organization on TikTok.)</p>
<p>After the acquisition, the two companies were merged under the umbrella of a new brand, Oath, part of a bigger strategy that Verizon had to grow a media empire to help it take on online ad giants like Google and Facebook, with the operation run by Tim Armstrong, who had been AOL&#8217;s longtime CEO going into the Verizon acquisition.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it never quite played out as Verizon thought that it would, or at least not as quickly as it had hoped.</p>
<p>Hans Vestberg &#8212; a longtime telecoms executive who first joined Verizon as CTO in 2017 &#8212; became the CEO in June 2018. In doing so, he essentially inherited a digital media business strategy that he had no hand in building.</p>
<p>“Verizon Media has done an incredible job turning the business around over the past two and a half years and the growth potential is enormous,” Vestberg said in a press release. “The next iteration requires full investment and the right resources. During the strategic review process, Apollo delivered the strongest vision and strategy for the next phase of Verizon Media. I have full confidence that Yahoo will take off in its new home.”</p>
<p>Within six months of him taking the top role, Armstrong had left the company (to be succeeded by Guru Gowrappan); and then Verizon <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/12/12/verizon-takes-massive-billion-write-down-its-media-business/">wrote the value of its media assets down to $4.6 billion</a>, noting at the time that Oath “experienced increased competitive and market pressures throughout 2018 that have resulted in lower-than-expected revenues and earnings.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;After an unexpected reveal, AOL&#8217;s CEO explains that Oath is about B2B branding&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/04/after-an-unexpected-reveal-aols-ceo-explains-that-oath-is-about-b2b-branding/embed/#?secret=5S7EF9N8LE" data-secret="5S7EF9N8LE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And the Oath name was short lived, with Verizon adopting a far more straightforward name, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/18/oath-officially-becomes-verizon-media-group-on-january-8/">Verizon Media</a>, in January 2019.</p>
<p>Further moves happened in increments. In August 2019, the company sold blogging platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/verizon-is-selling-tumblr-to-wordpress-parent-automattic/">Tumblr to WordPress-owner, Automattic</a>, for what was described then as a &#8220;nominal&#8221; price.</p>
<p>Then late last year, as the media world suffered from lack of ad revenue amid the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/buzzfeed-acquires-huffpost/">Verizon sold off HuffPost to Buzzfeed</a>, coupled with an equity investment into the digital media company and an advertising and syndication deal. And there have been various layoffs to trim the wider media operation.</p>
<p>Since the HuffPost transaction, the rumors swirling around Verizon&#8217;s plans to shed its remaining media assets intensified. (Although, again, there were reports around a possible sale for years before this.)</p>
<p>Yet that isn&#8217;t the full story.</p>
<p>In spite of a rough year for online publishing, Verizon Media began to see a rebound earlier this year, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-strong-start-2021-company-accelerates-5g-growth">marking a 12% year-over-year jump in revenue for Q1</a>. In this morning&#8217;s release, the company cites Yahoo News&#8217; growth on TikTok, staying that platform &#8220;continues to evolve as a key destination for finance and news among Gen Z.&#8221; It was, at very least, some short term good news that may have ultimately better positioned the telecom for a big selloff.</p>
<p>Founded in 1990, Apollo has a wide and diverse range of assets, including the recently purchased Venetian resort in Las Vegas and craft giant, Michael’s. It also has a pretty extensive range of holdings in the telecoms, media and tech sector, including ADT, Coinstar, radio and television conglomerate Cox Media, with some assets going private but then getting spun out as public businesses (Rackspace, another Apollo investment, is one example of that). In other words, precisely what shape a company like Verizon Media would ultimately take as part of the Apollo portfolio is still something of a question mark.</p>
<p>“We are big believers in the growth prospects of Yahoo and the macro tailwinds driving growth in digital media, advertising technology and consumer internet platforms,” Apollo senior partner David Sambur says in the release. “Apollo has a long track record of investing in technology and media companies and we look forward to drawing on that experience to help Yahoo continue to thrive.”</p>
<p>The deal is subject to the standard regulator scrutiny. It&#8217;s expected to close in the second half of the year. LionTree served as lead financial advisor to and will invest alongside the Apollo Funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Columbus, Ohio-based firm Path Robotics today announced the completion of a $56 million Series B. The round, led by Addition (featuring Drive Capital, Basis Set and Lemnos Lab) brings the robotic welding company’s total funding to $71 million.</p>
<p>Adding another piece to the broader automated manufacturing puzzle, the company is focused on robotic welding. The system uses scanning, computer vision and AI to adjust itself to different parts, understanding that sizing parts is a kind of imperfect science. Add to that the additional difficulty of working with highly reflective metals and you’ve got some interesting robotics problems to solve.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/rDmmWjKUt6g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Current industrial robotics have very little ability to understand their environment and the task at hand. Most robots merely repeat what they are told and have no ability to improve themselves,” CEO Andrew Lonsberry said in a release tied to the news. Our goal is to change this. The future of manufacturing hinges on highly capable robotics.”</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s looking to address a shortage in the welding workforce, which the American Welding Society says will experience a shortage of around 400,000 by 2024. The pandemic has also driven a number of companies to look for a more localized solution, apparently somewhat curbing the trend of offshoring the industry has seen in recent decades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has announced a $10 million grant to support emergency response efforts in India and has rolled out its Vaccine Finder tool in the country as the South Asian nation grapples with the latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The American social network said that it has partnered with a number of organizations including United Way, Swasth, Hemkunt Foundation, I Am Gurgaon, Project Mumbai and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) to help augment critical medical supplies with over 5,000 oxygen concentrators and other life-saving equipments such as ventilators, BiPAP machines and to increase hospital bed capacity.</p>
<p>Facebook also said it has partnered with the Government of India to roll out a Vaccine Finder tool on the company’s marquee app. The tool, available in 17 languages, is designed to help people identify and spot vaccine centres in their vicinity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, India opened vaccination to people aged between 18 to 45, though its website quickly crashed and wasn’t immediately accepting appointment requests from most people in that age group.</p>
<p>Also worth checking out: Folks over at <a href="https://www.wifidabba.com/">WiFi Dabba</a>, a Bangalore-based startup that is working to build a low-cost ISP, have also <a href="https://findslot.in/">developed a tool</a> to help people easily find vaccination slots.</p>
<p>A bigger challenge confronting India currently, however, is the <a href="https://twitter.com/adarpoonawalla/status/1389166756871041024">shortage of vaccine</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook said it is also supporting non-government organizations and United Nation agencies in India with ad credits to reach the majority of people on Facebook with Covid-19 vaccine and preventive health information.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company said it is providing health resources to people from UNICEF India about when to seek emergency care and how to manage mild Covid-19 symptoms at home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canadian fintech giant Wealthsimple has raised a new round of $750 million CAD (~$610 million) at a post-money valuation of $5 billion CAD (~$4 billion). The round was led by Meritech and Greylock, and includes funding from Inovia, Sagard, Redpoint, TSV, as well as individual investors including Drake, Ryan Reynolds and Michael J. Fox (basically, all the most famous Canadians).</p>
<p>Wealthsimple&#8217;s big new raise more than doubles its valuation from its last round, a $114 million CAD (roughly $93 million) funding announced last October, which carried a post-money valuation of $1.5 billion CAD ($~1.22 billion USD). The Toronto-based company has been a leader in the realm of democratizing financial products for consumers, including stock trading, crypto asset sales, and peer-to-peer money transfers.</p>
<p>The company says that it experienced significant growth during the pandemic, which is likely one big reason why its valuation rose so much between its most recent raise and this one. Its commission-free retail investment platform has grown &#8220;rapidly&#8221; over the course of the past 14 months, the company says, and the crypto trading platform which it launched last August has also seen strong uptake given the recent surge in consumer interest in cryptocurrency assets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Late last year, Wealthsimple soft-launched its P2P money transfer app, Wealthsimple Cash, and in March it made it available to all Canadians. The app is very similar in terms of features to Venmo or Square&#8217;s Cash app, but neither of those offerings have been available to Canadians thus far. Wealthsimple&#8217;s app, which is free to use and distinct from its stock trading and crypto platforms, has thus tapped significant pent-up demand in the market and seen rapid uptake rthus far.</p>
<p>With this funding, Wealthsimple plans to &#8220;expand its market position, build out its product suite, and grow its team.&#8221; The company also offers automated savings and investing products (the robo-advisor tools it was originally founded around), as well as tax filing tools, and it has demonstrated a clear appetite and ability to expand its offerings to encompass even more of its customers financials lives when committed with fresh resources to do so.</p>
<p>The company says it has over 1.5 million users, with over $10 billion in assets under management as of the last publicly available numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ishangry.com/">Hangry</a>, an Indonesian cloud kitchen startup that wants to become a global food and beverage company, has raised a $13 million Series A. The round was led by returning investor Alpha JWC Ventures, and included participation from Atlas Pacific Capital, Salt Ventures and Heyokha Brothers. It will be used to increase the number of Hangry’s outlets in Indonesia, including launching its first dine-in restaurants, over the next two years before it enters other countries.</p>
<p>Along with a previous round of $3 million from Alpha JWC and Sequoia Capital’s Surge program, Hangry’s Series A brings its total funding to $16 million. It currently operates about 40 cloud kitchens in Greater Jakarta and Bandung, 34 of which launched in 2020. Hangry plans to expand its total outlets to more than 120 this year, including dine-in restaurants.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Abraham Viktor, Robin Tan and Andreas Resha, Hangry is part of Indonesia’s burgeoning cloud kitchen industry. Tech giants Grab and Gojek both <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Food-Beverage/Southeast-Asia-s-cloud-kitchens-swell-powered-by-Grab-and-Gojek">operate networks of cloud kitchens </a>that are integrated with their food delivery services, while other startups in the space include Everplate and Yummy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indonesian cloud kitchen startup Yummy gets $12 million Series B led by SoftBank Ventures Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/indonesian-cloud-kitchen-startup-yummy-gets-12-million-series-b-led-by-softbank-ventures-asia/embed/#?secret=PQhgqs0p54" data-secret="PQhgqs0p54" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One of the main ways Hangry sets itself apart is by focusing on its own brands, instead of providing kitchen facilities and services to restaurants and other third-party clients. Hangry currently has four brands, including Indonesian chicken dishes (Ayam Koplo) and Japanese food (San Gyu), that cost about 15,000 to 70,000 IDR per portion (or about $1 to $6 USD). Its food can be ordered through Hangry’s own app, plus GrabFood, GoFood and ShopeeFood.</p>
<p>“Given that Hangry has developed an extensive cloud kitchen network across Indonesia, we naturally would have interest from other brands to leverage our networks,” chief executive officer Viktor told TechCrunch. “However, our focus is to grow our brands since our brands are rapidly growing in popularity in Indonesia and require all kitchen resources that they need to realize their full potential.”</p>
<p>Providing food deliveries helped Hangry grow during COVID-19 lockdowns and social distancing, but in order to become a global brand within a decade, it needs to operate in multiple channels, he added.</p>
<p>“We knew that we will one day have to serve customers in all channels, including dine in,” said Viktor. “We started the hard way, doing delivery-first business, where we faced the challenges surrounding making sure our food still tastes good when it reaches customers’ homes. Now we feel ready to serve our customers in our restaurant premises. Our dine-in concept is an expansion of everything we’ve done in delivery channels.”</p>
<p>In a press statement, Alpha JWC Ventures partner Eko Kurniadi said, “In the span of 1.5 years, [Hangry] launched multiple brands across myriad tastes and categories, and almost all of them are amongst the best sellers list with superior ratings in multiple platforms, tangible examples of product-market fit. This is only the beginning and we can already foresee their growth to be a top local F&amp;B brand in the country.”</p>

<p>This brings Bibit’s total funding to $110 million, including a Series A announced in May 2019. Its latest round will be used on developing and launching new products, hiring and increasing Bibit’s financial education services.</p>

<p>Bibit was launched in 2019 by Stockbit, a stock investing platform and community, and is part of a crop of Indonesian investment apps focused on new investors. Others include SoftBank Ventures-backed Ajaib, Bareksa, Pluang and FUNDtastic. Bibit runs robo-advisor services for mutual funds, investing users’ money based on their risk profiles, and claims that 90% of its users are millennials and first-time investors.</p>
<p>According to Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan), the number of retail investors <a href="https://kr-asia.com/indonesias-millennial-investors-drive-interest-for-new-investment-apps">grew 56% year-over-year in 2020</a>. For mutual funds in particular, Bibit said investors grew 78% year-over-year to 3.2 million, based on data from the Indonesia Stock Exchange and Central Securities Custodian.</p>
<p>Despite the economic impact of COVID-19, interest in stock investing grew as people took advantage of market dips (the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EJKSE/">Jakara Composite Index</a> fell in the first quarter of 2020, but is now recovering steadily). Apps like Bibit and its competitors want to make capital investing more accessible with lower fees and minimum investment amounts than traditional brokerages like Mandiri Sekuritas, which <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/27/the-rise-of-the-retail-investor-a-new-force-in-indonesias-pandemic-hit-stock-market.html">also saw an increase</a> in new retail investors and average transaction value last year.</p>

<p>But the <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/02/07/govt-idx-still-hope-to-attract-more-to-invest-in-stock-market.html">percentage of retail investors in Indonesia is still very low</a>, especially compared to markets like Singapore or Malaysia, presenting growth opportunities for investment services.</p>
<p>Apps like Bibit focus on content that helps make capital investing less intimidating to first-time investors. For example, Ajaib also presents its financial educational features as a selling point.</p>
<p>In press statement, Sequoia Capital India vice president Rohit Agarwal said, “Indonesian mutual fund customers have grown almost 10x in the past five years. Savings via mutual funds is the first step towards investing and Bibit has helped millions of consumers start their investing journey in a responsible manner. Sequoia Capital India is excited to double down on the partnership as the company brings the same customer focus to stock investing with Stockbit.”</p>

<p>Clubhouse hosted another excellent conversation between Josh Constine and Facebook&#8217;s audio czar Fidji Simo. The format continues to sparkle, as I was once again forced to choose between MSNBC&#8217;s Rachel Maddow or Lawrence O&#8217;Donnell and just plain audio. JPA won going away. The talk was crisp and the strategies thick with optimism about the creator economy. Monetization, priming the emergent pump, etc. If this were the Gold Rush, it would be blue skies ahead for picks and shovels and pans.</p>
<p>It remains hard to listen to the creator talk. If this is the moment for creators, then what is the moment for us listening? The question is who gets the short end of the crypto stick, a zero sum game where the losers are the equivalent of who buys high and sells low. I guess in the elegant world of startups, being one and not the other nine of ten is worth it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s still damn exciting to see the outcome at a safe distance from ground zero. Once the tech companies run out of slots at the start of the race, there will be plenty of industries waiting for the early smoke to clear. Walmart, table for two? This is not a live audio story but rather a realignment of the media industries around notifications. Let&#8217;s approach the rebuild of the economy and our way of life from the inside out, or backwards in a kind of reverse engineered insight replayed forward like a Beatles guitar solo.</p>
<p>Back before the virus, we thought of life as weekday and weekends, work week or vacation, a series of not-holidays punctuated by long weekends every 6 to 8 weeks or so.We paced ourselves in waves: not liking Mondays to hump days to going to the movies on Friday to watching the political shows on Sunday. Enduring the nightmare that was Trump, sedating us with the binge economy as it surfed the streaming disruption, addicted to our phones and awestruck by the possibilities of the hive mind. Things changed, and then the plague struck.</p>
<p>Now we realized our folly, not in assuming the unassumable but in thinking we had any clue at all of how much time we had to dream about the future. Our belief in technology was still there, but not necessarily how it would work. Saving us was a goal, not a sure thing or even close. We held our breath. And got incredibly lucky. Time inverted itself, and in surviving we found a desperate grace in treasuring our networks of family and friends.</p>
<p>As much as we knew everything was different, we were shocked at how quickly we adapted to the crisis. The rapid deployment of mobile and social technology over the previous couple decades was suddenly ratified, accelerated, and made table stakes. Not surprisingly the tech companies were able to consume the wave; the startup surge was financed by eating its own dog food. Remember Y2K, where it was still not a sure thing there was any real ROI for collaboration, or groupware as it was pigeonholed.</p>
<p>It got a lot harder to say digital collaboration was not realistic. The Cloud made corporate transformation a subscription service going in and pivoting to market fit a viable exit strategy. Startups could scale up without multi-million dollar bets, leaving enterprise incumbents with no choice but to adopt Software As A Service to survive. Consumer laptops, TCPIP, and 2400 baud modems became the platform where continuous innovation found a home, virtualizing the office as a set of familiar services deployed both on desktop and phones.</p>
<p>Notifications became less a source of interruption and more the quickest way to manage the converging streams of work and personal life. These intermittent alerts allowed us to navigate multiple conversations and interactions on an as-needed basis. Collaboration tools orchestrated the abstraction of email with group messaging, video conferencing became a time saver and easy onboarding tool, screen sharing an IT replacement. And all sat on the notification backbone, reducing channel conflict and shifting the social aspects of team engagement to a more personal basis. And then the pandemic happened.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder, the Bowie song asks. Notification etiquette kicks in at daybreak with the overnight roundup, tracks the news throughout while avoiding the repetitive eyeball-baiting of the cable networks, and creates a calendar of things to click on or store for free time or cram for a meeting. No, it&#8217;s not any wonder that audio fits more and more into this work-from-wherever climate shift. Notification chimes differentiate between critical alerts, parkable alerts, and ignorable scroll-offs. Newsletters become havens for binging cached 10 minute reads, managing live audio and recorded podcasts, and a rallying point for influencer analytics. This last one offers value for not just creators but consumers, also known as tippers.</p>
<p>The creator bandwagon sounds promising, but who cares which major platform captures the pole position? I like Clubhouse&#8217;s work in establishing a complementary social cloud via notifications. I like Twitter Spaces as a driver to squeeze a record button into the UI for all, just as Anchor does for podcasting. I like the idea of Facebook sneaking onto the playing field by allowing Instagram to turn off video. Wow, thanks. I love how Josh Constine seems to have landed in just the right place to triangulate his venture casting chops, reportorial finesse, handy summarizing of the calls, and matter-of-fact direct to podcast strategy.</p>
<p>But these early winners in format and style should soon give way to a more constructive dialogue between creators and their listeners. Newsletter platforms seem to have made the case that a few hit writers will pay for developing tools to support subscriptions, distribution, legal services, analytics, and more. I keep wanting to backchannel directly with specific people in the room, but Clubhouse doesn&#8217;t want that to happen natively. We&#8217;re live audio, not chat, they don&#8217;t say but imply. What if listeners could sign up for receiving (and sending) commentary via some form of group @mention. Moderators could tap into that and invite people onstage to engage with speakers. Organic discovery of talent and impact. Sign me up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past five years, the Southeastern region, led by Atlanta, has gone from being &#8220;one of the best kept secrets&#8221; in tech, to a vibrant ecosystem teeming with a herd of the billion dollar tech businesses that are referred to in the investment world as &#8220;unicorns&#8221; (thanks to their supposed rarity).</p>
<p>In those five years venture capital investments surged to $2.1 billion in the region, with $1 billion invested in the last year alone, according to Lisa Calhoun, a partner with the Atlanta based investment firm, <a href="https://valor.vc/">Valor Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s indicative of the entrepreneurial talent coming from the network of private and public schools across the region like Georgia Tech, the University of Alabama, Auburn, the University of Georgia, Vanderbilt, Emory, and the historically black colleges and universities like Morehouse, Spelman, and Xavier. And it&#8217;s also a sign of a reinvestment in local entrepreneurship &#8212; a decades-long campaign to turn Atlanta into the center of a hub-and-spoke network of startup cities that spans Miami to Atlanta, with stops in Birmingham, Nashville, New Orleans,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Atlanta is what a next generation, global, post-Silicon Valley tech hub looks like. Our demographics are ten years ahead of the U.S.&#8217;s transformation into a majority minority society,&#8221; wrote Calhoun in an email. &#8220;With over 40% of the U.S. population in the Southeast, the greatest density of founders and executives of color, rafts of tech companies like AirBnB locating here, and our own legacy of top tech and talent, Atlanta sets the tone for what&#8217;s next. We have the growing, diverse population base all strong founders need to scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done for the region to establish itself as one of the next engines of economic return for the venture capital and investment business, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Southeast is 24% of the US GDP, but only accounts for 7% of the venture investment,&#8221; noted Blake Patton, the founder and general partner of the Atlanta-based investment firm, <a href="https://www.techsquareventures.com/">Tech Square Ventures</a>. &#8220;With the recent momentum in the region, that is changing and investors are taking notice and backing local managers who in turn are investing the region’s best and brightest entrepreneurs.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Internet boom and bust in Atlanta</h2>
<p>In the years after the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta was a high-flying contender for the title of one of the next big startup hubs in the United States.</p>
<p>The Olympics had put the city on the world&#8217;s stage, and seeing the wave of activity, excitement, and investment that came with the advent of internet companies like Virginia&#8217;s America Online, Atlanta&#8217;s city council and mayor were making a push for the city to become a telecom and startup hub in the early days of the first Internet boom.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Something happened in the mid-90s driven by the Olympics where Atlanta hit the map worldwide. It wasn’t just that we were a supply and logistics hub. In the late 90s as the dot-com boom really evolved, things happened underground that aren’t as transparent as they should be. Atlanta Gas Light had the largest dark fiber ring in the country surrounding Atlanta. That was built solely with the olympics in mind. We had Georgia Tech working on the next generation of aerospace, and they added computer engineering,&#8221; said Christy Brown, the founder of the Atlanta based non-profit <a href="https://launchpad2x.org/">Launchpad2X</a> and a serial entrepreneur and executive with deep ties to the Atlanta ecosystem.  </span></p>
<p>Atlanta also had its fair share of early successes &#8212; high flying telecom and networking companies that were critical to the evolution of the first dot com era whose later years were either mired in scandal or who were acquired by much larger entities. These are companies like MCI Worldcom and Airtouch Cellular, which was gobbled up by Singular Wireless and would eventually become part of a restructured AT&amp;T.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There were all kinds of tech things happening in the city. A lot of these founders were getting venture on paper which evolved into the dot-bomb,&#8221; said Brown. &#8220;All of this was happening mid to late nineties, when the dot-bomb happened there was a lot of failure in the Atlanta area.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The implosion of early internet companies that came with the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 reverberated through Atlanta&#8217;s tech ecosystem, erasing the early gains that companies made and setting the stage for a decade-long period of reconstruction punctuated by a few successes from holdouts that managed to make their way through the wreckage.</p>

<h2>Through the lean years</h2>
<p>One of those companies was <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>. Launched in 2001, in the early aftermath of the bursting of the tech bubble, the privately held email marketing startup was one of a number of projects at Ben Chestnut&#8217;s and Dan Kurzius&#8217; web development firm.</p>
<p>The two men met at Cox Interactive Media to work on an early MP3 product. When that fizzled both men eventually lost their jobs and went into business together. They built MailChimp off of revenue, bootstrapping the business without venture capital in a model that many other tech founders in the area would seek to replicate.</p>
<p>A few years later, in 2003, another entrepreneur named John Marshall began installing internet hotspots at hospitality businesses, eventually expanding his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirWatch">Wandering WiFi</a> service to include monitoring and managing other kinds of network infrastructure. This foray into startup land would eventually create another big Atlanta tech exit in AirWatch.</p>
<p>For the first six years MailChimp remained a side hustle, a product that the two co-founders continued to work on, but didn&#8217;t devote themselves to full time. It wasn&#8217;t until 2007, when the service hit 10,000 users, that the company became the full-time job for both founders.</p>
<p>Their once-scrappy startup turned them into billionaires. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2018/10/08/the-new-atlanta-billionaires-behind-an-unlikely-tech-unicorn/?sh=31a55a7331a2">A 2018 Forbes profile</a> put the company&#8217;s valuation at $4.2 billion on roughly $600 million in revenue.</p>
<p>If there was a starting gun for the Atlanta tech renaissance, it might be 2006, a few years before the global financial crisis and a time when the broader tech industry was finding itself a less financially precarious prospect for investors. Internet Security Systems, an Atlanta area dot-com darling that <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/56921/Security+Stock+IPO+Sizzles+ISS+Group+Jumps+70+Since+Offer.htm">held an initial public offering in the late 90s</a> sold to IBM for $1.3 billion that year.</p>
<p>Tom Noonan and Chris Klaus, the co-founders at Internet Security Systems, had an equally long road. What had started out as a company built when Klaus <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/2208086/life-after-ibm-is-all-green-for-iss-co-founder-tom-noonan.html">lived above Noonan&#8217;s garage in Atlanta in the mid-90s</a>, morphed into a company pulling in $400 million in annual revenue before its acquisition by IBM.</p>
<p>As capital started flowing into Atlanta and the city regained some of its footing in the tech world, founders who had exited their companies began to reinvest money locally. And the city moved to create more events to foster entrepreneurship. 2006 saw the launch of <a href="https://www.ventureatlanta.org/">Venture Atlanta</a>, a conference designed to showcase early talent and startups coming from the region that served as a launchpad for several entrepreneurs that would shape the future of the city&#8217;s technology industry.</p>

<h2>Setting a new scene</h2>
<p>If 2006 was a big year for exits in Atlanta, it also proved to be the year that opened the floodgates on new entrepreneurial activity, which would give rise over the next decade to what&#8217;s now a thriving startup scene, pumping out a record number of billion dollar tech businesses.</p>
<p>It was the year that David Cummings and Adam Blitzer <a href="https://www.salesforceben.com/the-drip/a-brief-history-of-salesforce-marketing-cloud-and-pardot/">founded Pardot</a>, a marketing and sales automation software developer that grew quickly and attracted the attention of big industry players like ExactTarget. It was also the year that Manhattan Associates executive Alan Dabbiere joined Marshall and <a href="http://www.mobilevillage.com/visionaries-airwatch-john-marshall/">Wandering WiFi became AirWatch</a>, a company providing management and security tech for mobile enterprise networks.</p>
<p>Over the next few years MailChimp would become more active; Cloud Sherpas, founded by the entrepreneurs Michael Cohn and Sean O&#8217;Brien (who are now founders of the investment firm <a href="https://overline.vc/">Overline Ventures</a>) would launch and so would companies like the video streaming tech developer, ClearLeap (<a href="https://pitchbook.com/newsletter/clearleap-acquired-by-ibm#:~:text=IBM%20(NYSE%3A%20IBM)%20has,of%20cloud%2Dbased%20video%20services.&amp;text=Prior%20to%20the%20acquisition%2C%20Clearleap,valued%20it%20at%20%24110%20million.">bought by IBM in 2015 and valued at over $110 million</a>); the security company Damballa would launch (<a href="https://www.securityweek.com/damballa-vanishes-fire-sale-core-security">later acquired by Atlanta neighbor Core Security</a>); and the service powering many of the major banks customer rewards programs, <a href="https://www.cardlytics.com/">Cardlytics</a> (now trading on the Nasdaq <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cardlytics+market+cap&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS896US897&amp;ei=VxxZYNuVLbCb_Qbjj4CYBA&amp;oq=cardlytics+market+cap&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBwgAEEYQ-gE6FAgAELADEIoDELcDENQDEOUCEIsDOgcIABBHELADOgIIADoGCAAQFhAeOgIIJlD8GlicImCaJGgBcAJ4AIABjQGIAfwGkgEDOS4ymAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBArgBAsABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibnefF-8TvAhWwTd8KHeMHAEMQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5">with a $4 billion market cap</a>).</p>
<p>Buoyed by these emerging tech companies, other entrepreneurs would join the fray, with Kabbage (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/amex-acquires-softbank-backed-kabbage-after-tough-2020-for-the-smb-lender/#:~:text=Amex%20acquires%20SoftBank%2Dbacked%20Kabbage%20after%20tough%202020%20for%20the%20SMB%20lender,-Ingrid%20Lunden%40ingridlunden&amp;text=For%20some%20context%2C%20Kabbage%20had,in%202017%2C%20led%20by%20SoftBank.">acquired for $850 million</a>), <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">a $3 billion business as of this year</a>) and the voice identification technology developer <a href="https://www.pindrop.com/">Pindrop</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/pindrop-raises-90m-to-bring-its-voice-fraud-prevention-to-iot-devices-and-europe/">which raised $90 million back in 2018</a>) emerging onto the scene at around the same time.</p>
<p>These companies set the table for what would become a buffet of startups focused primarily on payments and financial services, cloud-based business solutions, and internet security. Gone were the hardware heavy telecom companies and networking companies like Scientific Atlanta, whose business is compared to Hewlett Packard for having brought a high tech industry to the city in the 1950s &#8212; much like HP did in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new generation of investor was moving into the Atlanta orbit, presaged by the 2006 launch of <a href="https://www.bip-capital.com/">BIP Capital</a> &#8212; an event that also proved meaningful for the city&#8217;s budding entrepreneurs.</p>

<h2>Staking claims for Atlanta&#8217;s future</h2>
<p>The rising tide of entrepreneurs coming out of Atlanta also served to revitalize the city&#8217;s moribund investment community. Hit hard by the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the Atlanta-area firms that managed to survive the crash began to look to later stage businesses and outside of the Atlanta tech ecosystem for startups to back, according to data from CrunchBase and several interviews with investors and founders.</p>
<p><a href="https://noromoseley.com/">Noro-Moseley Partners</a>, for instance, is by far the most active investor hailing from Atlanta. Over it&#8217;s long history the firm has done over 123 deals according to Crunchbase, but in the last five years, data indicates only four investment from the firm were made into Atlanta-based companies.</p>
<p>By contrast, the arrivistes at BIP have been deploying capital and raising successively larger funds since they first came to town. Over the last five years the firm has invested in at least 15 Atlanta-area deals, and now, under the moniker of <a href="https://panoramic.vc/">Panoramic Ventures</a>, the firm is targeting a $300 million early stage fund to invest across the southeast and midwest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, access to capital was challenging for founders in Atlanta and the Southeast. In the past, it was considered a disadvantage for a tech business to be based outside of the traditional innovation hubs [in] Silicon Valley or the Northeast because it was more difficult to secure investment capital. This was because the large funds were located inside the hubs and had plenty of opportunities right on their doorsteps for investment,&#8221; wrote Mark Buffington, the co-founder and chief executive of BIP Capital, in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;While the traditional hubs are still key in terms of aggregate capital, the requirement for startups to also be inside the hubs has changed. Increasingly, venture funds are locating themselves in other areas of the country where innovation is occurring. At the same time, the amount of capital available from local and regional investors is growing, in large part due to the influx of dollars into the private markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another member of the new school of investors that&#8217;s changing Atlanta&#8217;s investment scene is Patton; whose work with <a href="https://www.techsquareventures.com/">Tech Square Ventures</a> and <a href="https://www.engage.vc/">Engage</a>, the corporate venture capital investment firm and startup initiative harnessing the power of a number of the biggest companies in Atlanta, also galvanized entrepreneurship and the newfound interest in startup tech companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recent momentum in the region is driven by increased connectivity across the innovation ecosystem and a critical mass of entrepreneurs and talent coming out of the region&#8217;s many successful startups. With corporations focused on digital transformation and innovation, all large companies have to a degree become tech companies and that drives connectivity as talent moves across both startups and tech companies,&#8221; Patton said. &#8220;Perhaps our greatest strength is our diversity and being home to four leading HBCUs, and I hope in the next 5 years the Southeast will emerge as a leader in producing successful startups founded by diverse entrepreneurs and built with diverse teams. It’s not just a moral imperative &#8211; with half the nation’s black population, the Southeast must succeed in engaging under-served entrepreneurs to lead – and you can’t tackle diversity nationally without tackling it in the Southeast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, other ingredients were needed for the resurgence of startup activity in the city. These would be co-workings spaces like David Cummings&#8217; launch of the <a href="https://atlantatechvillage.com/">Atlanta Tech Village</a> in 2012; the continuing relevance of the<a href="https://atdc.org/"> Atlanta Tech Development Center</a>; the Venture Atlanta conference and the co-working space around <a href="https://hypepotamus.com/">Hypepotamus</a> &#8212; which remains the go-to publication for Southern startup activity.</p>
<p>Every entrepreneur and investor mentioned Cummings&#8217; decision to reinvest in the city and launch the Tech Village near Atlanta&#8217;s tony suburb of Buckhead as one of the biggest sparks for the city&#8217;s renewed entrepreneurial fervor. Soon after Cummings sold Pardot he and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlightburn/">David Lightburn</a> established Atlanta Tech Village as a co-working spot for entrepreneurs. It attracted a number of new startup founders whose businesses would become the next wave of big startups. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">When David Cummings sold Pardot he wanted a place for entrepreneurs to have community,&#8221; said one longtime player in the Atlanta tech community. &#8220;They would do these startup chow down lunches and really support entrepreneurs building businesses.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>And just as key was the longtime hub for Georgia Tech-affiliated startups, the Atlanta Tech Development Center, the entrepreneurs and investors noted. Venture Atlanta had a role to play as well, bringing investors from every corner of the country to the city to showcase top talent. Together with <a href="https://create-x.gatech.edu/">CreateX</a>, and the Venture Atlanta program, the four initiatives and workspaces for early stage entrepreneurs planted a number of seeds that would soon blossom into companies like PartPic, Greenlight Financial (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b/">which is now worth $2.3 billion</a>), Kabbage, FullStory and Pindrop.</p>

<h2>A haven for diverse founders and investors</h2>
<p>During those early days of the Atlanta startup ecosystem, there was one spot more welcoming than most for diverse and women-led founders &#8212; the co-working space and offices for Hypepotamus.</p>
<p>Serial entrepreneur Monique Mills was there. So was Jewel Burks Solomon, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/21/how-jewel-burks-solomon-sold-business-to-amazon-and-became-google-exec.html#:~:text=In%20October%2C%202016%2C%20when%20Burks,technology%20became%20as%20Amazon%20PartFinder).">who sold her company, PartPic, to Amazon in 2016</a> and is now the Head of Google for Startups in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first office was at Hypepotamus because they offered free space,&#8221; Burks Solomon recalled. &#8220;And at the time I didn’t have much money. Then when I raised some money the next major one was at ATDC &#8212; the state of Georgia’s incubator. They offered subsidized space and they had an entrepreneur in residence and they had a whole program to help Atlanta-based startups with some kind of technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the Hypepotamus space, and subsequent venues like Opportunity Hub and The Gathering Spot that catalyzed the Black entrepreneurial community in Atlanta, according to several founders and investors.</p>
<p>And if the Hypepotamus space, carved out by National Builder Supply, was one of the catalysts, then the angel investor, Mike Ross, was the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mike has funded many successful Black-led startups in the Atlanta ecosystem and we wouldn’t be where we are today without him,&#8221; entrepreneur Candace Mitchell Harris <a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2021/02/meet-the-investor-behind-atlantas-most-successful-black-led-tech-startups/">told UrbanGeekz</a> in a recent profile. &#8220;When many have faced the run around of false promises or flat out rejections, Mike confidently put his money in and pushed our founders further.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ross, a <a href="https://www.morehouse.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morehouse College alumnus</a>, who made his wealth as a consultant in the construction and contracting industry has backed Black founders and investors including: Luma, Partpic, Monsieur, <a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2020/09/the-first-ever-hbcu-esports-league-kicks-off-in-atlanta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axis Replay</a>, Myavana, <a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2019/04/atlanta-startup-battle-6-0-crowns-two-winners-for-six-figure-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechSquare Labs</a>, <a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2015/02/business-incubator-targets-minority-owned-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Opportunity Hub</a>, and <a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2019/08/atlantas-black-tech-startup-ecosystem-is-gaining-momentum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Gathering Spot</a>.</p>
<p>Investors like Paul Judge and entrepreneurs like Joey Womack, Barry Givens, and Mitchell Harris, all benefited from Ross&#8217; investment largesse.</p>
<p>“Mike was the catalyst for our company’s success as our very first angel investor,” says Mitchell Harris, co-founder and CEO of beauty tech startup Myavana,<a href="https://urbangeekz.com/2021/02/meet-the-investor-behind-atlantas-most-successful-black-led-tech-startups/"> told UrbanGeekz</a>. “I still remember meeting him for the first time at the Black Founders Conference in June 2012, inquisitive and eager to get behind the movement that was beginning in Atlanta in the tech startup scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ross blazed a trail for other investors like the <a href="https://www.fearless.fund/team">Fearless Fund</a>, a group of women investors led by Arian Simone, Ayanna Parsons, and Keshia Knight Pulliam, who launched their first fund in 2019, and Collab Capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs/">which launched last year</a> (and is led by Burks Solomon, Justin Dawkins, and Barry Givens) &#8212; close to a decade after Ross first began investing.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Right now women of color are the most founded but the least funded entrepreneurs,&#8221; Simone said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlanta is a mecca of black entrepreneurship for us to have a venture capital and tech presence here.. I will charge the city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia and the banks that they need to back what we’re doing here.. It is needed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Not only is it needed, but it&#8217;s working. Of the 36 venture capital firms identified as part of TechCrunch&#8217;s research as having a focus on early stage investments in the Atlanta area, 41% met one or more of the following criteria: identification as having a diversity focus across investments, identification as having a diverse fund management team, or both, according to data from Crunchbase.</p>
<p>And through a sample size of 158 startups spanning Pre-Seed, Seed, or Series A in the Atlanta area, which were included in TechCrunch&#8217;s research, 48% met one or more of the following criteria: identification as having a sex-diverse founding team, identification has having a racially-diverse founding team, or both. In many instances, founding teams did not self identify, so the number of diverse founders may be greater than currently documented based on publicly available data.</p>
<p>As UrbanGeekz noted, about 25% of the employees in Atlanta&#8217;s tech industry are black. In San Francisco, by contrast, that figure is 6%.</p>
<div class="freebirdFormviewerViewSubmissionDate">
<p>&#8220;Ten years ago [the Black tech startup ecosystem] was just starting out,&#8221; Ross told UrbanGeekz. &#8220;Now Atlanta is one of the top tech hubs in the country and the ecosystem is probably one of the most diverse.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="freebirdFormviewerViewSubmissionDate">
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>&#8220;I’m really excited about what’s happening now. It’s much more diverse in terms of the people that have the ability to deploy capital. I’m optimistic about what is to come in the tech space,&#8221; said Burks Solomon.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not alone. New firms like Cohn and O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s Overline Ventures, Panoramic, and <a href="https://www.outlanderlabs.com/">Outlander Labs</a>, the firm launched by the former Los Angeles investors Paige and Leura Craig are all signs of investors&#8217; long-term belief in the health of the Atlanta startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think that the Southeast and especially Atlanta has the opportunity to become a key hub for tech startups in the next 5 years. It feels a lot like Los Angeles five years ago. The talent is here but historically the issue has been lack of mentorship, early stage capital, and the later stage capital as they grow and scale,&#8221; wrote Outlander co-founder Leura Craig, in an email. &#8220;However that is all changing given the fact that so many investors are now moving to all parts of the country and are open to investing in areas that they never invested in before. Covid dramatically accelerated the flight from California and New York and the Southeast&#8217;s tech scene is going to be a huge winner as a result of this migration. &#8221;</p>
<p>Major tech companies are also showing their faith in Atlanta&#8217;s startup scene through significant investments into the ecosystem. Most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/apple-announces-new-projects-related-to-its-100-million-pledge-for-racial-equity-and-justice/">Apple has committed nearly $100 million to new projects including the Propel Center,</a> a $25 million bid designed to encourage diversity and entrepreneurship at a site to be built near Atlanta&#8217;s Historically Black Colleges and Universities.</p>
<p>It is going to be both a virtual platform and a physical campus in the Atlanta University Center.</p>
<p>Students will be able to follow different educational tracks focused on artificial intelligence, agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment, app development, augmented reality, design and creative arts and entrepreneurship. This isn’t just a monetary investment for Apple, as employees will help develop curricula and provide mentorship as well. There will be internship opportunities for students.</p>

<p>Apple isn&#8217;t the only big tech company to commit to Atlanta&#8217;s thriving tech community. Facebook is building out a massive, multi-billion dollar extension to data center facilities near the city, and Google committed that the Atlanta area would receive some fo the planned $9 billion investment in job growth across the U.S.</p>
<p>The current growth that Atlanta&#8217;s startup scene is experiencing can serve as a model for other urban areas on the rise. The recipe seems to be a strong technical college, an investment in collaborative startup resources, a network of willing investors to <em>reinvest</em> in the local community, the support of city government through non-profit and promotional activities, and finally an embrace of the diverse history of the city itself. There&#8217;s no need to remake Silicon Valley, but the tools of Silicon Valley can be used to make burgeoning tech communities better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’ve been hearing how “data is the new oil” <a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-should-get-credit-for-the-quote-data-is-the-new-oil">for more than a decade now</a>, and in certain sectors, it’s a maxim that has more than panned out. From marketing and logistics to finance and product, decision-making is now dominated by data at all levels of most big private orgs (and if it isn’t, I’d be getting a résumé put together, stat).</p>
<p>So it might be a something of a surprise to learn that data, which could transform how we respond to the increasingly deadly disasters that regularly plague us, has been all but absent from much of emergency response this past decade. Far from being a geyser of digital oil, disaster response agencies and private organizations alike have for years tried to swell the scope and scale of the data being inputted into disaster response, with relatively meager results.</p>
<p>That’s starting to change though, mostly thanks to the internet of things (IoT), and frontline crisis managers today increasingly have the data they need to make better decisions across the resilience, response, and recovery cycle. The best is yet to come — with drones flying up, simulated visualizations, and artificial intelligence-induced disasters — what we’re seeing today on the frontlines is only the beginning of what could be a revolution in disaster response in the 2020s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2 id="The long-awaited disaster data deluge has finally arrived">The long-awaited disaster data deluge has finally arrived</h2>
<p>Emergency response is a fight against the fog of war and the dreadful ticking of the clock. In the midst of a wildfire or hurricane, everything can change in a matter of seconds — even milliseconds if you aren’t paying attention. Safe roads ferrying evacuees can suddenly become impassable infernos, evacuation teams can reposition and find themselves spread far too thin, and unforeseen conditions can rapidly metastasize to cover the entire operating environment. An operations center that once had perfect information can quickly find it has no ground truth at all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even getting raw data on what’s happening before and during a disaster can be extraordinarily difficult. When we look at the data revolution in business, part of the early success stems from the fact that companies were always heavily reliant on data to handle their activities. Digitalization was and is the key word: moving from paper to computers in order to transform latent raw data into a form that was machine-readable and therefore analyzable. In business, the last ten years was basically upgrading to version two from version one.</p>
<p>In emergency management however, many agencies are stuck without a version at all. Take a flood — where is the water and where is it going? Up until recently, there was no comprehensive data on where waters rose from and where they sloshed to. When it came to wildfires, there were no administrative datasets on where every tree in the world was located and how prone each is to fire. Even human infrastructure like power lines and cell towers often had little interface with the digital world. They stood there, and if you couldn’t see them, they couldn’t see you.</p>

<p>Models, simulations, predictions, analysis: all of these are useless without raw data, and in the disaster response realm, there was no detailed data to be found.</p>
<p>After years of promising an Internet of Things (IoT) revolution, things are finally internet-izing, with IoT sensors increasingly larding up the American and world landscape. Temperature, atmospheric pressure, water levels, humidity, pollution, power, and other sensors have been widely deployed, emitting constant streams of data back into data warehouses ready for analysis.</p>
<p>Take wildfires in the American West. It wasn’t all that long ago that the U.S. federal government and state firefighting agencies had no knowledge of where a blaze was taking place. Firefighting has been “100 years of tradition unimpeded by progress,” Tom Harbour, head of fire response for a decade at the U.S. Forest Service and now chief fire officer at <a href="https://cornea.is">Cornea</a> put it.</p>
<p>And he’s right. After all, firefighting is a visceral activity — responders can see the fires, even feel the burning heat echoing off of their flesh. Data wasn’t useful, particularly in the West where there are millions of acres of land and large swaths are sparsely populated. Massive conflagrations could be detected by satellites, but smoldering fires in the brush would be entirely invisible to the geospatial authorities. There’s smoke over California — exactly what is a firefighter on the ground supposed to do with such valuable information?</p>
<p>Today after a decade of speculative promise, IoT sensors are starting to clear a huge part of this fog. Aaron Clark-Ginsberg, a social scientist at <a href="https://www.rand.org">RAND Corporation</a> who researches community resilience, said that air quality sensors have become ubiquitous since they are “very cheap [and] pretty easy to use” and can offer very fine-grained understandings of pollution — a key signal, for instance, of wildfires. He pointed to the company <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com">Purple Air</a>, which in addition to making sensors, also produces a popular consumer map of air quality, as indicative of the potential these days for technology.</p>
<p>Maps are the critical intersection for data in disasters. Geospatial information systems (GIS) form the basis for most planning and response teams, and no company has a larger footprint in the sector than privately-held <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/home">Esri</a>. Ryan Lanclos, who leads public safety solutions at the company, pointed to the huge expansion of water sensors as radically changing responses to certain disasters. “Flood sensors are always pulsing,“ he said, and with a “national water model coming out of the federal government ,” researchers can now predict through GIS analysis how a flood will affect different communities with a precision unheard of previously.</p>

<p>Cory Davis, the director of public safety strategy and crisis response at Verizon (which, through our parent company Verizon Media, is TechCrunch’s ultimate owner), said that all of these sensors have transformed how crews work to maintain infrastructure as well. “Think like a utility that is able to put a sensor on a power line — now they have sensors and get out there quicker, resolve it, and get the power back up.”</p>
<p>He noted one major development that has transformed sensors in this space the last few years: battery life. Thanks to continuous improvements in ultra-low-power wireless chips as well as better batteries and energy management systems, sensors can last a <i>really</i> long time in the wilderness without the need for maintenance. “Now we have devices that have ten-year battery lives,” he said. That’s critical, because it can be impossible to connect these sensors to the power grid in frontier areas.</p>
<p>The same line of thinking holds true at T-Mobile as well. When it comes to preventative planning, Jay Naillon, senior director of national technology service operations strategy at the telco, said that “the type of data that is becoming more and more valuable for us is the storm surge data — it can make it easier to know we have the right assets in place.” That data comes from flood sensors that can offer real-time warnings signals to planners across the country.</p>
<p>Telecom interest — and commercial interest in general — has been critical to accelerating the adoption of sensors and other data streams around disasters. While governments may be the logical end user of flood or wildfire data, they aren’t the only ones interested in this visibility. “A lot of consumers of that information are in the private sector,” said Jonathan Sury, project director at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the Earth Institute at Columbia University. “These new types of risks, like climate change, are going to affect their bottom lines,” and he pointed to bond ratings, insurance underwriting and other areas where commercial interest in sensor data has been profound.</p>
<p>Sensors may not literally be ubiquitous, but they have offered a window into the ambiguity that emergency managers have never had visibility into before.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the extensive datasets around mobile usage that have become ubiquitous throughout much of the world. <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com">Facebook’s Data for Good project</a>, for instance, provides data layers around connectivity — are users connecting from one place and then later connecting from a different location, indicating displacement? That sort of data from the company and telcos themselves can help emergency planners scout out how populations are shifting in real-time.</p>
<h2 id="Data, data, on the wall — how many AIs can they call?">Data, data, on the wall — how many AIs can they call?</h2>
<p>Rivulets of data have now turned into floods of information, but just like floodwaters rising in cities across the world, the data deluge now needs a response all its own. In business, the surfeit of big data has been wrangled with an IT stack from data warehouses all the way to business intelligence tools.</p>
<p>If only data for disasters could be processed so easily. Data relevant for disasters is held by dozens of different organizations spanning the private, public, and non-profit sectors, leading to huge interoperability problems. Even when the data can be harmonized, there are large challenges in summarizing the findings down to an actual decision a frontline responder can use in their work — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">making AI a tough sale still today</a>, particularly outside of planning. As Davis of Verizon put it, “now that they have this plethora of data, a lot of cities and federal agencies are struggling with how to use it.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, standardization is a challenge at all scales. Globally, countries mostly lack interoperability, although standards are improving over time. Amir Elichai, the founder and CEO of 911 call-handling platform <a href="https://carbyne911.com">Carbyne</a>, said that “from a technology standpoint and a standards standpoint, there is a big difference between countries,” noting that protocols from one country often have to be completely rewritten to serve a different market.</p>
<p>Tom Cotter, director of emergency response and preparedness at health care disaster response organization <a href="https://www.projecthope.org">Project HOPE</a>, said that even setting up communications between responders can be challenging in an international environment. “Some countries allow certain platforms but not others, and it is constantly changing,” he said. “I basically have every single technology communication platform you can possibly have in one place.”</p>
<p>One senior federal emergency management official acknowledged that data portability has become increasingly key in procurement contracts for technology, with the government recognizing the need to buy commercially-available software rather than custom-designed software. That message has been picked up by companies like Esri, with Lanclos stating that “part of our core mission is to be open and … create data and to share that openly to the public or securely through open standards.”</p>
<p>For all its downsides though, the lack of interoperability can be ironically helpful for innovation. Elichai said that the “lack of standards is an advantage — you are not buying into a legacy standard,” and in some contexts where standards are lacking, quality protocols can be built with the assumption of a modern data workflow.</p>
<p>Even with interoperability though, the next challenge becomes data sanitation — and disaster data is dirty as … well, something. While sensor streams can be verified and cross-checked with other datasets, in recent years there has been a heavy increase in the quantity of citizen-submitted information that has to be carefully vetted before it is disseminated to first responders or the public.</p>

Image Credits: TONY KARUMBA/AFP via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Bailey Farren, CEO and co-founder of disaster communications platform <a href="https://perimeterplatform.com">Perimeter</a>, said that “sometimes citizens have the most accurate and real-time information, before first responders show up — we want citizens to share that with …government officials.” The challenge is how to filter the quality goods from the unhelpful or malicious. Raj Kamachee, the CIO of <a href="https://teamrubiconusa.org">Team Rubicon</a>, a non-profit which assembles teams of volunteer military veterans to respond to natural disasters, said that verification is critical, and it’s a key element of the infrastructure he has built at the organization since joining in 2017. “We’ve gotten more people using it so more feedback [and] more data [is] coming through the pipes,” he said. “So creating a self-service, a very collaborative approach.”</p>
<p>With quality and quantity, the AI models should come, right? Well, yes and no.</p>
<p>Sury of Columbia wants to cool down at least some of the hype around AI. “The big caveat with all of these machine learning and big data applications is that they are not a panacea — they are able to process a lot of disparate information, [but] they’re certainly not going to tell us exactly what to do,” he said. “First responders are already processing a lot of information,” and they don’t necessarily need more guidance.</p>
<p>Instead, AI in disasters is increasingly focused on planning and resilience. Sury pointed to <a href="https://oneconcern.com/en/">OneConcern</a>, a resiliency planning platform, as one example of how data and AI can be combined in the disaster planning process. He also pointed to the CDC’s <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html">Social Vulnerability Index</a> and risk tools from FEMA that integrate different data signals into scalar values by emergency planners to optimize their contingency plans.</p>
<p>Yet, almost everyone I talked to was much more hesitant about the power of AI. As I discussed a bit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">in part one of this series regarding the disaster sales cycle</a>, data tools have to be real-time and perfect every time given the lives that are on the line. Kamachee of Team Rubicon noted that when choosing tools, he avoids whiz-bang and instead looks at the pure utility of individual vendors. “We go high tech, but we prepare for low tech,” he said, empathizing that in disaster response, everything must be agile and adaptable to changing circumstances.</p>

<p>Elichai of Carbyne saw this pattern in his sales. There’s a “sensitivity in our market and the reluctance from time to time to adopt” new technologies he said, but acknowledged that “there is no doubt that AI at a certain point will provide benefits.”</p>
<p>Naillon of T-Mobile had similar views from the operator perspective, saying that “I can’t say that we really leverage AI very much” in the company’s disaster planning. Instead of AI as brain, the telecom company simply uses data and forecast modeling to optimally position equipment — no fancy GANs required.</p>
<p>Outside of planning, AI has helped in post-disaster recovery, and specifically around damage assessments. After a crisis transpires, assessments of infrastructure and private property have to be made in order for insurance claims to be filed and for a community to move forward. Art delaCruz, COO and president of Team Rubicon, noted that technology and a flourish of AI has helped significantly around damage assessments. Since his organization often helps rebuild communities in the course of its work, triaging damage is a critical element of its effective response strategy.</p>
<h2 id="There’s a brighter future, other than that brightness from the sun that is going to burn us to a crisp, right?">There’s a brighter future, other than that brightness from the sun that is going to burn us to a crisp, right?</h2>
<p>So AI today is helping a bit with resilience planning and disaster recovery and not so much during emergency response itself, but there is certainly more to come across the entire cycle. Indeed, there is a lot of excitement about the future of drones, which are increasingly being used in the field, but there are concerns long term about whether AI and data will ultimately cause more problems than they solve.</p>
<p>Drones would seem to have an obvious value for disaster response, and indeed, they have been used by teams to get additional aerial footage and context where direct access by responders is limited. Kamachee of Team Rubicon noted that in the Bahamas on a mission, response teams used drones to detect survivors, since major roads were blocked. The drones snapped images that were processed using AI, and helped the team to identify those survivors for evacuation. He described drones and their potential as “sexy; very, very cool.”</p>

Image Credits: Mario Tama/Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Cotter of Project HOPE similarly noted that faster data processing translates to better responses. “Ultimately speed is what saves lives in these disasters,” he said. We’re “also able to manage more responses remotely [and] don’t have to send as many people downrange,” giving response teams more leverage in resource-constrained environments.</p>
<p>“I see more emergency management agencies using drone technology — search and rescue, aerial photography,” Davis of Verizon said, arguing that operators often have a mentality of “send a machine into a situation first.” He continued, arguing, &#8220;artificial intelligence is going to continue to get better and better and better [and] enable our first responders to respond more effectively, but also more efficiently and safer.”</p>
<p>With data flooding in from sensors and drones and processed and verified better than ever, disaster response can improve, perhaps even better than Mother Nature can galvanize her increasingly deadly whims. Yet, there is one caveat: will the AI algorithms themselves cause new problems in the future?</p>
<p>Clark-Ginsburg of RAND, perhaps supplying that typical RANDian alternatives analysis, said that these solutions can also create problems themselves, “technological risks leading to disaster and the world of technology facilitating disaster.” These systems can break, they can make mistakes, and more ominously — they can be sabotaged to increase chaos and damage.</p>
<p>Bob Kerrey, a co-chair of the 9/11 Commission, former senator and governor of Nebraska, and currently the board chairman of Risk &amp; Return, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/risk-and-return/">a disaster response VC fund and philanthropy I profiled recently</a>, pointed to cybersecurity as increasingly a wild card in many responses. “There wasn’t a concept called zero days — let alone a market for zero days — in 2004 [when the 9/11 Commission was doing its work], and now there is.” With the 9/11 terrorist attacks, “they had to come here, they had to hijack planes … now you don’t need to hijack planes to damage the United States,” noting that hackers “can be sitting with a bunch of other guys in Moscow, in Tehran, in China, or even your mother’s basement.”</p>
<p>Data is a revolution in the making for disaster response, but it may well cause a whole second-order set of problems that didn’t exist before. What is giveth is taketh away. The oil gushes, but then the well suddenly runs dry – or simply catches fire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week, we welcome guest Hana Mohan to our podcast Found. Hana is the co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://MagicBell.com">MagicBell</a>, a new startup she created with Josue Montano that just recently graduated from Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2021 cohort. MagicBell is a full-featured, plug-and-play notifications inbox aimed at developers who want to build one into their own product, but don&#8217;t want to have to build one themselves from scratch.</p>
<p>Hana&#8217;s experience as an entrepreneur spans multiple companies, including her last one which she grew to significant success in terms of annual revenue. She&#8217;s also a proud transgender woman, who underwent her transition mid-way through her existing history as a founder and entrepreneur. Hana talks to us about the challenges she faced taking on her transition in an industry where the focus is often exclusively on how hard you&#8217;re hustling and what you&#8217;re building next, and about her origin story as a founder coming from an environment where there weren&#8217;t necessarily many examples with similar life experience to look to for inspiration.</p>
<p>During our chat, Hana also shared lots of insight into YC, and what it provides founders, as well as perspective on what it was like going through the program during a global pandemic in a remote context. Finally, she offers some great context on finding your first investors and customers as a distributed team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We loved talking to Hana, and we hope you love the episode. You can subscribe to <a href="http://apple.co/found">Found in Apple Podcasts</a>, on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0Dqmcq2aDrZkS9v1fITOKV?si=Hfp6dAwAQKyenJnprGxnqg">Spotify</a>, on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9lMmI0QU5vYg?sa=X&amp;ved=0CAMQ4aUDahcKEwiYisj3nZfwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQCQ">Google Podcasts</a> or in <a href="https://pod.link/found">your podcast app of choice</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. If you want it in your inbox every Saturday morning, sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </em><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch isn’t a public-market-focused publication. We care about startups. But public tech companies can, at times, provide interesting insights into how the broader technology market is performing. So we pay what we might call minimum-viable attention to former startups that made it all the way to an IPO.</p>
<p>Then there are the Big Tech companies. In the United States the list is well-known: Facebook, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon. And, in a series of results that could indicate a hot market for startup growth, they had a smashingly good first quarter of 2021. You can read our notes on their results <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-microsoft-pinterest-q1/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/todays-big-tech-earnings-in-a-mere-700-words/">here</a>, but that’s just part of the story.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yes, the Big Tech financial results were good &#8212; as they have been for some time &#8212; but lost amid the usual earnings deluge of numbers is how shockingly accretive Big Tech’s recent performances have proven for their valuations.</p>
<p>Microsoft fell as low as the $135 per-share range last March. Today it’s worth $252 and change. Alphabet traded down to around $1,070 per share. Today the search giant is worth $2,410 per share.</p>
<p>The result of the huge share-price appreciation is that Apple is now worth $2.21 trillion, Microsoft $1.88 trillion, Amazon $1.76 trillion, Alphabet $1.60 trillion and Facebook $0.93 trillion. That’s around $8.4 trillion for the five companies.</p>
<p>Back in July of 2017, I <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/techs-5-biggest-players-now-worth-3-trillion/">wrote a piece</a> noting that their aggregate value had reached the $3 trillion mark. That became <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/the-big-5-worth-4-trillion-heading-into-earnings/">$4 trillion in mid-2018</a>. And then in the next three years or so it more than doubled again.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MylesUdland">Myles Udland</a>, a reporter at our sister publication Yahoo Finance, has at least part of the puzzle in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-are-beating-expectations-at-a-record-rate-morning-brief-100229838.html">a piece he wrote this week</a>. Here’s Udland:</p>
<blockquote><p>And while it seems that almost every earnings story has sort of followed this same arc, data also confirms that this is not just our imagination: corporate earnings have never been this far out of line with expectations.</p>
<p>Data out of the team at Refinitiv published Thursday showed the rate at which companies were beating estimates and the magnitude by which they were beating expectations through Thursday morning&#8217;s results were the best on record.</p></blockquote>
<p>So earnings are beating the street’s guesses more frequently, and at a higher differential, than ever? That makes recent stock-market appreciation less worrisome, I suppose. And it helps explain why startups have been able to raise so much capital lately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results/">in the United States</a>, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/european-vc-soars-in-q1/">they have in Europe</a>, and why private-market investors are pouring so much capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/fintech-startups-set-vc-records-as-the-2021-fundraising-market-continues-to-impress/">into fintech startups</a>. And it’s probably why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/zomato-juice-indian-unicorns-proposed-ipo-could-drive-regional-startup-liquidity/">Zomato is going public</a> and why we’re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/optimism-reigns-at-consumer-trading-services-as-fintech-vc-spikes-and-robinhood-ipo-looms/">still waiting for the Robinhood debut</a>.</p>
<p>This is what a market feels like when the underlying businesses are firing on all cylinders, it appears. Just don’t forget that no business cycle is unending, and no boom is forever.</p>
<h2>An insurtech interlude</h2>
<p>Extending The Exchange’s recent reporting regarding fintech funding, and our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money/">roundup from last week of insurtech startup rounds</a>, a few more notes on the latter startup niche, which can be broadly viewed as part of the larger financial technology world.</p>
<p>This time we’ll hear from <a href="https://accel.com/people/john-locke">Accel’s John Locke</a> regarding his investments in The Zebra &#8212; which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/austins-newest-unicorn-insurtech-the-zebra-raises-150m-after-doubling-revenue-in-2020/">raised even more capital</a> &#8212; and the insurtech space more broadly.</p>
<p>Asked why insurtech marketplaces like The Zebra have been able to raise so very much money in the last year, Locke said that it’s a mix of “insurance carriers [&#8230;] finally embracing marketplaces and willing to design integrated consumer experiences with marketplaces,” along with more consumer “comparison shopping” and, finally, growth and revenue quality.</p>
<p>The Zebra, Locke said, is “still growing north of 100% at ~$120M+ revenue run-rate.” That means it can go public whenever it wants.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Insurtech startups are leveraging rapid growth to raise big money&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money/embed/#?secret=6Ig0DxvFvM" data-secret="6Ig0DxvFvM" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>But on that matter, there has been some weakness in the stock market for some public insurtech companies. Is Locke worried about that? He’s neutral-to-positive, saying that his firm does not “think all the companies in the market will work but still thinks &#8216;insurtechs&#8217; will take market share from incumbents over the next decade.” Fair enough.</p>
<p>And Accel is still considering more deals in the space, as are others. Locke said that the venture market for insurtech investments is “definitely more aggressive” this year than last.</p>
<h2>Various and sundry</h2>
<p>Closing today, a few notes on things that we didn’t get to that matter:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.productboard.com/">Productboard</a> closed a $72 million Series C. First, that’s a huge round. Second, yes, Tiger did lead the deal. Third, the product management software company has around 4,000 customers today. That’s a lot. Add this company to your two-years-from-now IPO list.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Chinese bike-sharing startup Hello is going public in the United States. We are going to get back to this on Monday, but its F-1 filing is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841944/000104746921001022/a2243152zf-1.htm">here</a>. The company turned $926.3 million worth of 2020 revenues into $109.6 million in gross profit, and a net loss of $173.7 million in net losses. Yowza.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.darktrace.com/en/">Darktrace</a> went public this week. I know of it because it sponsors <a href="https://www.darktrace.com/en/mclaren/">an F1 team that I adore</a>, but it enters our world today as a recent U.K.-listed company. And after Deliveroo went kersplat, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/darktrace-ipo-dark-stock-skyrockets-43percent-in-london-debut.html">resounding success</a> of the Darktrace listing could make the U.K. a more attractive place to list than it was a week ago.</li>
<li aria-level="1">And, finally, drone delivery is, maybe, coming at last? U.K.-listed venture capital group Draper Esprit led the $25 million round into <a href="https://www.manna.aero/">Manna</a>, which wants to use unmanned drones in Ireland to deliver grub. “Manna sees a huge appetite for a greener, quieter, safer, and faster delivery service,” <a href="https://www.uktech.news/news/london-vc-draper-esprit-invests-in-manna-20210429">UKTN reports</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A long, weird week. Make sure to follow the second denizen of The Exchange’s writing team: <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca?lang=en">Anna Heim</a>. Okay! Chat next week!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">My mom cuts to the chase when she is describing my beat to others. In her words, I cover companies like Uber before they become companies like Uber. And honestly? I can’t exactly disagree with the description. The best feeling in tech journalism is telling a story about a startup before it becomes a household name. As an early-stage reporter, I honestly bet a lot on the potential of a savvy edtech founder or creative marketplace play. And when I’m doing my job right, I point to the unique insight that will make the startup successful or challenged in the future.</p>
<p>On that note, one of my favorite renewed series at TechCrunch is an EC-1 (Extra Crunch subscription required), a story series that goes through the nitty-gritty of a startup’s story, from its original days to its pivots along the way. I’ve spent the past few months on one of these projects &#8212; and mine is coming out next week! In the meantime, you’ve read packages about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1/">StockX</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">Tonal</a>, and our latest just came out: the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">Klaviyo EC-1</a>:</p>

<p>Enjoy this long-form read and big thanks to<a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton"> Danny Crichton</a>, my Equity co-host and managing editor here at TechCrunch, who has been managing and editing all of these projects.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter we’ll get into All Raise data, the new Miami and a new lineup you don’t want to miss. Follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> for updates throughout the week.</p>
<h2><strong>All (aren’t) Raise(d)</strong></h2>
<p>All Raise, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing the footprint of women founders and funders, has released its annual report for 2020. <a href="https://allraise.org/assets/all-raise-annual-report-2020.pdf">The whole thing</a> is honestly worth a read, but we especially paid attention to how funding has dropped for female founders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round sizes for women + non-binary founders were up to 49% lower than males</li>
<li>85% of venture funding goes to all-male teams</li>
<li>64% of VC firms still don&#8217;t have a single female partner</li>
<li>Black + Latinx female founders receive only 0.64% of VC funding, a slight uptick from the year prior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> On Equity, we talked about how these abysmal metrics were both a predicted but still surprising effect of Zoom investing. This disconnect is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/24/precursor-ventures-charles-hudson-on-the-conversation-no-one-has-during-an-upmarket/">the conversation no one has during an upmarket</a> &#8212; and metrics are one way we can benchmark progress.</p>

<h2><strong>Internet is the new Miami </strong></h2>
<p>To quote Winnie CEO and co-founder Sara Mauskopf, “Internet is the new Miami.” The networks made online &#8212; either through the rise of meme culture or Substack spice &#8212; can be a competitive advantage in the world of investment, as two new funds this week showed us.</p>
<p>Here’s what to know: Ryan Hoover and Vedika Jain announced Weekend Fund 3, which will include a <a href="https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1387034859495956480">$1 million community raise. </a>And Chief Meme Officer Turner Novak finally debuted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/banana-capitals-fund-1-turner-novak/">Banana Capital’s debut fund launched with $9.99 million in funding. </a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ITwUuiaaBX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/banana-capitals-fund-1-turner-novak/">Banana Capital&#8217;s debut fund is for internet-first founders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Banana Capital&#8217;s debut fund is for internet-first founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/banana-capitals-fund-1-turner-novak/embed/#?secret=ITwUuiaaBX" data-secret="ITwUuiaaBX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Novak explained how being internet-first impacts his investments:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“It just kind of happens where [my investments] are people who understand the culture of the internet, to understand memes and understand wit and humor and appreciate that a little bit more,” he said. “Those are probably the people that are more naturally intuitive investments, so it definitely does skew that direction.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>While Novak didn’t share explicit targets or mandates around investment in diverse founders, he pointed to his track record at Gelt VC, in which 41% of capital went to woman CEOs. To date, 65% of Banana Capital’s portfolio founding teams include non-white founders and 50% of the teams include more than one gender.</p>
<ul>
<li>And in the little-known capital lender space, Shopify is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/how-shopify-aims-to-level-the-playing-field-with-its-machine-learning-driven-model-of-lending/ ">using machine learning to lend money</a> to startups.

<h2>And finally</h2>
<p>India is in crisis. It is devastating and heartbreaking to watch this unfold and impact our family and friends and colleagues and people. My colleague Manish Singh, who is based there, wrote up the different ways<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/"> you can donate to help out.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9AImmd2iXQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/">India&#8217;s entrepreneurs and investors are mobilizing to help the nation fight COVID-19 — and you can too</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;India&#8217;s entrepreneurs and investors are mobilizing to help the nation fight COVID-19 — and you can too&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/embed/#?secret=9AImmd2iXQ" data-secret="9AImmd2iXQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I’ll end by quoting Singh:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>With several major industries, including film and sports, going about their lives pretending there is no crisis, entrepreneurs and startups have emerged as a rare beam of hope in recent days, springing to action to help the nation navigate its darkest hours.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s a refreshing change from last year, when thousands of Indian startups themselves were struggling to survive. And while some startups are still severely disrupted, offering a helping hand to the nation has become the priority for most.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Until next week,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sat down with Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska for the first high-level bilateral summit of the new administration, it was not a typical diplomatic meeting. Instead of a polite but restrained diplomatic exchange, the two sides traded pointed barbs for almost two hours. “There is growing consensus that the era of engagement with China has come to an unceremonious close,” <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/competition-with-china-without-catastrophe">wrote</a> Sullivan and Kurt Campbell, the Administration&#8217;s Asia czar also in attendance, back in 2019. How apt that they were present for that moment’s arrival.</p>
<p>A little more than one hundred days into the Biden Administration, there is no shortage of views on how it should handle this new era of Sino-American relations. From a blue-ribbon panel assembled by former Google Chairman Eric Schmidt to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/01/28/china-foreign-policy-long-telegram-anonymous-463120">Politico essay from an anonymous former Trump Administration official</a> that consciously echoes (in both its name and its author’s anonymity) George Kennan’s famous “<a href="https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/116178.pdf">Long Telegram</a>” laying out the theory of Cold War containment, to countless think tank reports, it seems everyone is having their say.</p>
<p>What is largely uncontroversial though is that technology is at the center of U.S.-China relations, and any competition with China will be won or lost in the digital and cyber spheres. “Part of the goal of the Alaska meeting was to convince the Chinese that the Biden administration is determined to compete with Beijing across the board to offer competitive technology,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/20/us/politics/china-russia-biden.html">wrote</a> David Sanger in the <i>New York Times </i>shortly afterward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But what, exactly, does a tech-centered China strategy look like? And what would it take for one to succeed?</p>
<h2>Tech has brought Republicans and Democrats uneasily together</h2>
<p>One encouraging sign is that China has emerged as one of the few issues on which even Democrats agree that President Trump had some valid points. “Trump really was the spark that reframed the entire debate around U.S.-China relations in DC,” says Jordan Schneider, a China analyst at the <a href="https://rhg.com/">Rhodium Group</a> and the host of the <a href="https://chinatalk.substack.com/">ChinaTalk podcast and newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>While many in the foreign policy community favored some degree of cooperation with China before the Trump presidency, now competition – if not outright rivalry – is widely assumed. “Democrats, even those who served in the Obama Administration, have become much more hawkish,” says Erik Brattberg of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Trump has caused “the Overton Window on China [to become] a lot narrower than it was before,” adds Schneider.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146531" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146531" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146531" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231796086.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146531" class="wp-caption-text">The US delegation led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken face their Chinese counterparts at the opening session of US-China talks at the Captain Cook Hotel in Anchorage, Alaska on March 18, 2021.

<p>As the U.S.-China rivalry has evolved, it has become more and more centered around competing philosophies on the use of technology. “At their core, democracies are open systems that believe in the free flow of information, whereas for autocrats, information is something to be weaponized and stifled in the service of the regime,” says Lindsay Gorman, Fellow for Emerging Technologies at the German Marshall Fund. “So it’s not too surprising that technology, so much of which is about how we store and process and leverage information, has become such a focus of the U.S.-China relationship and of the [broader] democratic-autocratic competition around the world.”</p>
<p>Tech touches everything now – and the stakes could not be higher. “Tech and the business models around tech are really ‘embedded ideology,’&#8217; says Tyson Barker of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “So what tech is and how it is used is a form of governance.”</p>
<p>What does that mean in practice? When Chinese firms expand around the world, Barker tells me, they bring their norms with them. So when Huawei builds a 5G network in Latin America, or Alipay is adopted for digital payments in Central Europe, or Xiaomi takes more market share in Southeast Asia, they are helping digitize those economies on Chinese terms using Chinese norms (as opposed to American ones). The implication is clear: whoever defines the future of technology will determine the rest of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>That shifting balance has focused minds in Washington. “I think there is a strong bipartisan consensus that technology is at the core of U.S.-China competition,” says Brattberg. But, adds Gorman, “there’s less agreement on what the prescription should be.” While the Democratic experts now ascendant in Washington agree with Trump’s diagnosis of the China challenge, they believe in a vastly different approach from their Trump Administration predecessors.</p>
<p>Out, for instance, are restrictions on Chinese firms just for being Chinese. “That was one of the problems with Trump,” says Walter Kerr, a former U.S. diplomat who publishes the <i>China Journal Review</i>. “Trump cast broad strokes, targeting firms whether it was merited or not. Sticking it to the Chinese is not a good policy.”</p>
<p>Instead the focus is on inward investment – and outward cooperation.</p>
<h2>Foreign policy is domestic policy</h2>
<p>Democrats are first shoring up America domestically – in short, be strong at home to be strong abroad. “There’s no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy,” President Biden said in his first major foreign policy speech. “Every action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind. Advancing a foreign policy for the middle class demands urgent focus on our domestic economic renewal.”</p>
<p>This is a particular passion of Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security advisor, who immersed himself in domestic policy while he was Hillary Clinton’s chief policy aide during her 2016 presidential campaign. &#8220;We&#8217;ve reached a point where foreign policy is domestic policy, and domestic policy is foreign policy,” he <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/biden-transition-updates/2020/12/30/951280373/why-bidens-national-security-adviser-plans-to-focus-on-the-u-s-middle-class">told</a> NPR during the transition.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146532" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146532" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146532" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231669906.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231669906.jpg 5841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231669906.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231669906.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231669906.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231669906.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231669906.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231669906.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1231669906.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146532" class="wp-caption-text">Jake Sullivan, White House national security adviser, speaks during a news conference Image Credits: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>This is increasingly important for technology, as concern grows that America is lagging behind on research and development. “We’re realizing that we’ve underinvested in the government grants and research and development projects that American companies [need] to become highly innovative in fields like quantum computing, AI, biotechnology, etc,” says Kerr.</p>
<p>“Rebuilding” or “sustaining” America’s “technological leadership” is a major theme of the Longer Telegram and is the very operating premise of the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20463382-final-memo-china-strategy-group-axios-1">report</a> of the China Strategy Group assembled by Eric Schmidt, former executive chairman of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, and the first chair of the Department of Defense’s Innovation Advisory Board. Those priorities have only become more important during the pandemic. It’s a question of “how do we orient the research system to fill in the industrial gaps that have been made very clear by the COVID crisis?” says Schneider of Rhodium.</p>
<p>While it hasn’t gone so far as to adopt a national industrial strategy, the Administration’s most ambitious officials are looking to prod along tech research in critical sectors. To that end, the National Security Council, which Sullivan runs, is reshaping itself around technology issues; Biden appointed the first deputy national security advisor focusing on technology issues as well as a high-profile senior director for technology. Their goal: to harness the same energy that drove the development of Silicon Valley during the Cold War into out-competing China.</p>
<p>That said, the ingredients to American (and Western) innovation aren’t exactly a secret: investment in education, research, and talent. “The West still has [most of] the universities, R&amp;D and leading companies,” says Brattberg. “There’s still a lot of competitiveness and leverage.” Unsurprisingly, investing to retain that edge is a key theme of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/31/upshot/whats-in-bidens-infrastructure-plan.html">Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan</a>, which includes funds for basic research, supply chain support, broadband connectivity, and support for the semiconductor industry.</p>

<p>As almost anyone in Silicon Valley will tell you, a functioning and welcoming immigration system is a crucial ingredient, too. “The U.S. is at its best when it welcomes talent from around the world and gives people the tools to succeed and thrive here,” says Gorman. Whether the Biden Administration can strike a deal with Senate Republicans on comprehensive immigration reform – or even funding basic research – remains an open question, though. And even if it can succeed, American ingenuity is no longer sufficient on its own.</p>
<h2>Team America</h2>
<p>Whether it’s for talent or partnerships, the U.S.-China tech competition will be won overseas. Allies are “the most salient and straightforward way Biden can bring leverage to the table compared to Trump,” says Schneider.</p>
<p>Biden, Blinken, and other senior administration officials have loudly and repeatedly pronounced their preferences to work with democratic partners on international challenges, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. It is no accident that Blinken and Sullivan’s meeting in Anchorage was preceded by a trip to Japan and South Korea, two of America’s closest allies in the region, and that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was the first foreign leader to visit Biden at the White House. “If you add the U.S. to the EU, Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea, you tilt the balance of economic heft and technological prowess back toward us,” he adds.</p>

<p>The ground for Blinken and company is increasingly fertile. Chinese diplomats have been <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7e508af8-0b35-4610-b52d-8c9e3e888a91">aggressive</a>, if not downright condescending, to countries they perceive have slighted China. <a href="https://www.codastory.com/newsletters/china-influence-monitor-april-1/">In one recent example</a>, the Chinese embassy in Dublin sent a series of tweets targeting an Irish-British journalist couple who had been forced to relocate to Taiwan as a result of a harassment campaign over their critical coverage of China’s Uyghur policy in Xinjiang. This so-called ‘wolf warrior’ diplomacy (a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Warrior">a jingoist action film</a>) is prompting a <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/06/china-image-problem-wolf-warrior-international/">backlash</a>, and helping convince many policy elites in countries who had hoped to sit out a U.S.-China conflict that perhaps Washignton’s China skeptics have a point.</p>
<p>This perhaps explains the proliferating alpha-numeric soup of coalitions and alliances being floated to secure a free and democratic internet for the future. There’s the D10, a secure supply chain network floated by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which adds Australia, India, and South Korea to the existing G7 countries (U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan). Schmidt’s report calls for a T-12 (the D10 minus Italy plus Finland, Sweden, and Israel). Others look to expand existing technology-related groupings like the Five Eyes signals intelligence alliance of the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, or harness burgeoning non-technical ones like the Quad. Gorman points to the significance of the news that the Quad itself – Australia, India, Japan, and the US – announced the creation of a working group on emerging technology at its first-ever (virtual) leaders summit in March.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, has <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/8/9/895e0a40-65ee-43cc-8629-450555faefe7/AC6A0E54DB992E1612161C48BB34FC57.democracy-technology-partnership-act-two-pager-explainer.pdf">proposed</a> a technology partnership to be run out of the State Department to coordinate with allies – including a $5 billion fund for research – with the explicit purpose of countering China.</p>
<h2>International tech standards are increasingly not set by the West</h2>
<p>Even if it can shephard its allies, the U.S. still faces stiff international headwinds. The Trump Administration&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal negotiated by the Obama Administration with ten other Pacific Rim countries with the intent of setting trade standards in the Asia-Pacific, was taken as a sign that perhaps the U.S. pivot to Asia was less ambitious than advertised. The pact, rebranded as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), has continued without the U.S.  – and now even China has expressed interest in joining.</p>
<p>Trump’s disdain for working within multilateral forums has also meant that Washington has essentially ceded the field of global technical standard-setting. Beijing has taken advantage, aggressively working the UN system so that Chinese officials now lead four of the 15 specialized UN agencies, including the two most focused on regulating technology: the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which helps set global technical standards, and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which is responsible for protecting intellectual property rights around the world.</p>
<p>China is also backing Russian efforts to rewrite internet governance. With Chinese support, Russia won a UN General Assembly vote in 2019 to start drafting a new cybercrime treaty. Their goal is to replace the U.S-backed 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which was  created by democracies through the Council of Europe, with a treaty that one critic <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/new-un-cybercrime-treaty-way-forward-supporters-open-free-and-secure-internet">said</a> would include provisions “likely to provide cover to authoritarian governments to persecute their political opponents.” Russia and China also unsuccessfully <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/how-russia-and-china-are-attempting-to-rewrite-cyberworld-order/2021/03/30/16030226-9190-11eb-a74e-1f4cf89fd948_story.html">tried</a> to use the (now Chinese-led) ITU to replace the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a private body of experts that governs internet domain names.</p>
<p>These efforts are all part of China Standards 2035, an explicit plan to internationalize standards to Chinese preferences in areas like 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT). As Emily de La Bruyère and Nathan Picarsic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/11/chinas-next-plan-to-dominate-international-tech-standards/">wrote on TechCrunch last year</a>, “Beijing has spent the past two decades establishing influential footholds in multilateral bodies and targeted industrial areas. Now, it is using those footholds to set their rules – with them, to define the infrastructure of the future world.”</p>

<h2>Hawks, doves, and U.S. divisions</h2>
<p>Even within the new consensus on China, there are fissures on how to handle China itself.</p>
<p>On the hawkish side, the Schmidt Report concedes that “some degree of technological bifurcation is in U.S. interests.” But calibrating just how much is a difficult question. “It’s already a reality,” says Barker of the German Council on Foreign Relations. “The question is: how deep does the split have to be?”</p>
<p>Few argue for complete decoupling, Brattberg, the Carnegie scholar who has <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/06/10/forget-g-7-build-d-10-pub-82062">written</a> extensively on tech diplomacy, says. After all, many are loath to concede completely separate ‘free’ and ‘authoritarian’ internets. There are other implications as well: a “bipolar, bifurcated internet … would have some very serious adverse implications in terms of cost [and] a slowdown in innovation,” one former UK intelligence official <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/28/how-huawei-is-dividing-western-nations/">told me</a> last year.</p>
<p>The key is to pinpoint which specific technologies are essential to produce domestically. “To the extent we [decouple from China], we have to do it in a smart way,” says Gorman. “There’s a risk of going too far and hurting potential innovation in the U.S. So the debate going forward is going to be: How do you address true national security vulnerabilities without emulating an authoritarian approach that might say ‘just ban everything from a certain country.’”</p>
<p>And even if we can form a consensus at home, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/28/how-huawei-is-dividing-western-nations/">America’s allies are no less divided</a> as I wrote last year with regards to Huawei. While the debate over the Chinese company’s role in 5G has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/30/huaweis-terrible-week/">evolved</a>, with both France and the U.K. (in a reversal) moving to phase out its kit, the debate over what role China should play economically and technologically in Europe is still very much alive.</p>

<p>The U.K. government is clear-eyed; in its <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/975077/Global_Britain_in_a_Competitive_Age-_the_Integrated_Review_of_Security__Defence__Development_and_Foreign_Policy.pdf">Integrated Review</a> of foreign and defense policy published in March, it acknowledged that China’s “growing international assertiveness … will pose an increasing risk to UK interests” and set an explicit goal for itself to be a third “science and tech superpower.” France, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.institutmontaigne.org/en/blog/franco-german-divergences-indo-pacific-risk-strategic-dilution">laid</a> out an Indo-Pacific strategy backing the principle of a free and open Pacific, an explicit challenge to Chinese preferences.</p>
<p>But many are still equivocal. As Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2020-06-04/lee-hsien-loong-endangered-asian-century">wrote</a> last year in <i>Foreign Affairs, </i>“Asian countries do not want to be forced to choose between the two.” Berlin made clear in its Indo-Pacific strategy last year that it was also reticent to make an outright choice. New Zealand, conscious of its important trade with China, <a href="https://twitter.com/stephendziedzic/status/1383940496779743240">is reluctant</a> to expand the use of Five Eyes beyond intelligence sharing. Meanwhile, Italy endorsed China’s infrastructure-focused Belt and Road Initiative in 2019 and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-italy/italy-says-china-a-key-strategic-partner-despite-u-s-concerns-idUSKBN25L1LR">called</a> the country a “strategic partner” last year. And the European Union moved forward on a trade deal with China late last year despite very public lobbying against it from the United States.</p>
<h2>A world of tradeoffs</h2>
<p>The challenge for the Biden Administration will be to assemble practical coalitions without asking allies and partners to make impossible choices. They will succeed if they can reframe the question. “In Europe, they don&#8217;t like ‘decoupling’ but they do like ‘diversification’,” says Brattberg. They also don’t like the idea of joining a U.S.-led alliance. Instead, he says, Washington should frame cooperation as “coalitions among like-minded democrtaic partners.”</p>
<p>For that to work, the U.S. will have to work out the bilateral issues it has with its allies first. “We need to be much more savvy on engaging directly with the EU on resolving issues like data transfers, digital taxation, and data privacy,” he said. “Digital sovereignty shouldn’t come at the expense of partnership with like-minded partners.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146534" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146534" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146534" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146534" class="wp-caption-text">Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel gives a speech during the press conference at the end of the meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (not pictured) of at The Great Hall Of The People on September 06, 2019 in Beijing, China.

<p>Nimbleness will be key – multiple experts told me it will be far better to create ad hoc coalitions on particular issues than to create a single fixed democratic tech alliance. This would have the benefit of keeping groupings tight without excluding countries with key expertise in particular areas (think Sweden and 5G or Taiwan and semiconductors). Washington should also take a collegiate approach, recognizing and respecting that its allies will not always be in lock-step on every aspect of the relations with China. In other words, the U.S. shouldn’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good, as agreement most of the time on most issues is probably sufficient to create the momentum Washington needs.</p>
<p>The U.S. can still compete globally and widen the circle of like-minded countries, Gorman, the scholar at GMF, tells me, but it has to invest in them if they are going to build out their tech sectors in a way that is aligned with democratic values and standards. “It’s really about providing an attractive counteroffer,” she said.</p>
<p>Even if the United States retains its technological edge for the near future, Americans should start adjusting to a future where Silicon Valley&#8217;s dominance is no longer inevitable. Chinese technologists are pulling ahead in areas like 5G while Chinese firms are competing on price (mobile phones) and increasingly on quality (e-commerce) and innovation (see: TikTok). China also exerts enormous clout through its control of supply chains and <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/31/governments-have-identified-commodities-essential-to-economic-and-military-security">rare earth metals</a> as well as its vast customer base.</p>
<p>Perhaps China’s greatest leverage point is its looming presence over Taiwan. As long as Taiwan remains one of the leading manufacturers of semiconductors (chip giant TSMC <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/05206915-fd73-4a3a-92a5-6760ce965bd9">manufactures</a> 90% of the world’s most advanced chips), the world’s technology industry will be vulnerable to the precarity of cross-Strait relations.</p>
<p>Will technology become just another chip in the geopolitical game the U.S. and China are playing, then? The Biden Administration is more prepared than its predecessor to weigh the tradeoffs, Barker of the German Council on Foreign Relation retells me. But it’s unclear how Washington, so early in this administration, will prioritize technology issues if faced with the prospects of Chinese cooperation on other priorities.</p>
<p>After all, at any given moment, the U.S. (and its allies) must weigh a host of priorities vis-à-vis China. And for all of the downsides to its bellicosity, the Trump Administration&#8217;s fixation on a handful of issues gave it leverage: it was willing to ignore Uyghurs and other human rights abuses in order to get a trade deal (even if it was deeply flawed).</p>
<p>The Biden Administration, on the other hand, has not yet articulated any priorities at all. If the rhetoric from Washington can be believed, the White House thinks it can make progress on climate, Taiwan, trade, human rights, and any number of other areas, all at once. This on its own creates a vulnerability. As historian Niall Ferguson reminded us in a recent Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-03-21/niall-ferguson-a-taiwan-crisis-may-end-the-american-empire">column</a>, then National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger was outmaneuvered when he went to China in 1971 with a multi-issue agenda and China singularly focused on Taiwan.</p>
<p>Beijing’s diplomats, despite their wolf-warrior missteps, are still savvy negotiators. If they are allowed to do so, they will once again try to play different parts of the Administration against each other, conditioning progress on climate, for example, on a softening over geopolitics, as the Brookings scholar Thomas Wright has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/risk-john-kerry-following-his-own-china-policy/617459/">warned</a>. In that light, it simply strains credulity that an ‘all of the above’ approach will work, especially when Biden’s wish list keeps the issues Trump cared about, like trade, 5G, and Taiwan, and adds those he ignored, like human rights, democracy, and climate change.</p>
<p>This is where America’s alliances may prove to be Biden’s hidden ace. If Biden can forge a common-enough front with a wide-enough spectrum of allies, the U.S. will be better able to withstand Chinese pressure to trade progress on one issue against another. Instead, forcing China to negotiate with the U.S. and its allies on an issue-by-issue basis may put Washington in a better position to succeed.</p>
<p>Of all the issues in America’s China portfolio, though, the tech race provides one extra advantage: for all the talk of industrial strategy, alliances, and diplomatic maneuvers, Washington is not the only or even primary actor involved. The Biden Administration can help set the rules, invest in basic research, and defend American interests abroad, but American innovation depends on its innovators – and there are still bountiful numbers of them tinkering away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups constantly talk about being mission-oriented, but it’s hard to take most of those messages seriously when the mission is optimizing cash flow for tax efficiency. However, a new generation of startups is emerging that are taking on some of the largest global challenges and bringing the same entrepreneurial grit, operational excellence, and technical brilliance to bear on actual missions — ones that may well save thousands of lives.</p>
<p>ClimateTech has been a huge beneficiary of this trend in general, but one small specialty has caught my eye: disaster response. It’s a category for software services that’s percolated for years with startups here and there, but now a new crop of founders is taking on the challenges of this space with renewed urgency and vigor.</p>
<p>As the elevator pitch would have it, disaster response is hitting hockey stick growth. 2020 was a brutal year, and in more ways than just the global COVID-19 pandemic. The year also experienced a record number of hurricanes, among the worst wildfire seasons in the Western United States, and several megastorms all across the world. Climate change, urbanization, population growth, and poor response practices have combined to create some of the most dangerous conditions humanity has ever collectively faced.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I wanted to get a sense of what the disaster response market has in store this decade, so over the past few weeks, I have interviewed more than 30 startup founders, investors, government officials, utility execs and more to understand this new landscape and what’s changed. In this four-part series on the future of technology and disaster response, to be published this weekend and next, we’ll look at the sales cycle in this market, how data is finally starting to flow into disaster response, how utilities and particularly telcos are dealing with internet access issues, and how communities are redefining disaster management going forward.</p>
<p>Before we get into all the tech developments in disaster response and resilience though, it’s important to ask a basic question: if you build it, will they come? The resounding answer from founders, investors, and government procurement officials was simple: no.</p>
<p>In fact, in all my conversations for this series, the hell of the emergency management sales cycle came up repeatedly, with more than one individual describing it as possibly the toughest sale that any company could make in the entire world. That view might be surprising in a market that easily runs into the tens of billions of dollars if the budgets for procurement are aggregated across local, state, federal, and international governments. Yet, as we will see, the unique dynamics of this market make almost any traditional sales approach useless.</p>
<p>Despite that pessimism though, that doesn’t mean sales are impossible, and a new crop of startups are piercing the barriers of entry in this market. We’ll look at the sales and product strategies that startups are increasingly relying on today to break through.</p>
<h2 id="The sale from hell">The sale from hell</h2>
<p>Few will be surprised that government sales are hard. Generations of govtech startup founders have learned that slow sales cycles, byzantine procurement processes, cumbersome verification and security requirements, and a general lassitude among contract officers makes for a tough battlefield to close on revenue. Many government agencies now have programs to specifically onboard startups, having discovered just how hard it is for new innovations to run through their gauntlet.</p>
<p>Emergency management sales share all the same problems as other govtech startups, but then they deal with about a half dozen more problems that make the sales cycle go from exhausting to infernal hell.</p>
<p>The first and most painful is the dramatic seasonality of the sales in the emergency space. Many agencies that operate on seasonal disasters — think hurricanes, wildfires, winter storms, and more — often go through an “action” period where they respond to these disasters, and then transition into a “planning” period where they assess their performance, determine what changes are needed for next season, and consider what tools might be added or removed to increase the effectiveness of their responders.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/cornea-eyes-in-on-fighting-wildfires-using-better-data/">Cornea</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go/">Perimeter</a>, two startups in the wildfire response space that I profiled recently. Both of the teams described how they needed to think in terms of fire seasons when it came to product iteration and sales. “We took two fire seasons to beta test our technology … to solve the right problem the right way,” Bailey Farren, CEO and co-founder of Perimeter, said. “We actually changed our focus on beta testing during the [2019 California] Kincaid fire.”</p>
<p>In this way, disaster tech could be compared to edtech, where school technology purchases are often synchronized with the academic calendar. Miss the June through August window in the U.S. education system, and a startup is looking at another year before it will get another chance at the classroom.</p>
<p>Edtech might once have been a tougher sale to make in order to thread that three-month needle, but disaster response is getting more difficult every year. Climate change is exacerbating the length, severity, and damage caused by all types of disasters, which means that responding agencies that might have had six months or more out-of-season to plan in the past are sometimes working all year long just to respond to emergencies. That gives little time to think about what new solutions an agency needs to purchase.</p>
<p>Worse, unlike the standardized academic calendar, disasters are much less predictable these days as well. Flood and wildfire seasons, for instance, used to be relatively concentrated in certain periods of the year. Now, such emergencies can emerge practically year-round. That means that procurement processes can both start and freeze on a moment’s notice as an agency has to respond to its mission.</p>
<p>Seasonality doesn’t just apply to the sales cycle though — it also applies to the budgets of these agencies. While they are transpiring, disasters dominate the eye of the minds for citizens and politicians, but then we forget all about them until the next catastrophe. Unlike the annual consistency of other government tech spending, disaster tech funding often comes in waves.</p>
<p>One senior federal emergency management official, who asked not to be named since he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly, explained that consistent budgets and the ability to spend them quickly is quite limited during “blue sky days” (i.e. periods without a disaster), and agencies like his have to rely on piecing together supplementary disaster funds when Congress or state legislatures authorize additional financing. The best agencies have technological roadmaps on hand so that when extra funding comes in, they can use it immediately to realize their plans, but not all agencies have the technical planning resources to be that prepared.</p>
<p>Amir Elichai, the CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://carbyne911.com">Carbyne</a>, a cloud-native platform for call handling in 911 centers, said that this wave of interest crested yet again with the COVID-19 pandemic last year, triggering huge increases in attention and funding around emergency response capabilities. “COVID put a mirror in front of government faces and showed them that ‘we’re not ready’,” he said.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, next-generation 911 services (typically dubbed NG911), which have been advocated for years by the industry and first responders, is looking at a major financing boost. President Biden’s proposed infrastructure bill <a href="https://urgentcomm.com/2021/03/17/house-proposes-15-billion-for-ng911-funding-in-new-infrastructure-bill/">would add $15 billion to upgrade 911 capabilities in the United States</a> — funding that has been requested for much of the last decade. Just last year, <a href="https://urgentcomm.com/2020/07/03/house-approves-12-billion-for-ng911-funding-in-infrastructure-package-but-bill-unlikely-to-pass-senate/">a $12 billion variant of that bill failed in the Senate after passing the U.S. House of Representatives</a>.</p>
<p>Sales are all about providing proverbial painkillers versus vitamins to customers, and one would expect that disaster response agencies looking to upgrade their systems would be very much on the painkiller side. After all, the fear and crisis surrounding these agencies and their work would seem to bring visceral attention to their needs.</p>
<p>Yet, that fear actually has the opposite effect in many cases, driving attention away from systematic technology upgrades in favor of immediate acute solutions. One govtech VC, who asked not to be named to speak candidly about the procurement process his companies go through, said that “we don’t want to paint the picture that the world is a scary and dangerous place.” Instead, “the trick is to be … focused on the safety side rather than the danger.” Safety is a much more prevalent and consistent need than sporadically responding to emergencies.</p>
<p>When a wave of funding finally gets approved though, agencies often have to scramble to figure out what to prioritize now that the appropriated manna has finally dropped from the legislative heaven. Even when startups provide the right solutions, scrying which problems are going to get funded in a particular cycle requires acute attention to every customer.</p>
<p>Josh Mendelsohn, the managing partner at startup studio and venture fund <a href="https://www.hangar.is">Hangar</a>, said that “the customers have no shortage of needs that they are happy to talk about … the hardest part is how you narrow the funnel — what are the problems that are most meritorious?” That merit can, unfortunately, evolve very rapidly as mission requirements change.</p>
<p>Let’s say all the stars line up though — the agencies have time to buy, they have a need, and a startup has the solution that they want. The final challenge that’s probably the toughest to overcome is simply the lack of trust that new startups have with agencies.</p>
<p>In talking to emergency response officials the past few weeks, reliability unsurprisingly came up again and again. Responding to disasters is mission-critical work, and nothing can break in the field or in the operations center. Frontline responders still use paper and pens in lieu of tablets or mobile phones since they know that paper is going to work every single time and not run out of battery juice. The move fast and break things ethos of Silicon Valley is fundamentally incompatible with this market.</p>
<p>Seasonality, on-and-off funding, lack of attention, procurement scrambling, and acute reliability requirements combine to make emergency management sales among the hardest possible for a startup. That doesn’t even get into all the typical govtech challenges like integrating with legacy systems, the massive fragmentation of thousands of emergency response agencies littered across the United States and globally, and the fact that in many agencies, people aren’t that interested in change in the first place. As one individual in the space described how governments approach emergency technology, “a lot of departments are looking at it as maybe I can hit retirement before I have to deal with it.”</p>

<p>So the sales cycle is hell. Why, then, are VCs dropping money in the sector? After all, we’ve seen emergency response data platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform/">RapidSOS raise $85 million just a few months ago</a>, about the same time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/carbyne-raises-25m-for-a-next-generation-platform-to-improve-emergency-911-responses/">Carbyne raised $25 million</a>. There are quite a few more startups at the earliest phases that have raised pre-seed and seed investment as well.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;RapidSOS raises $85M for a big data platform aimed at emergency responders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform/embed/#?secret=5edu1wQy7e" data-secret="5edu1wQy7e" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The key argument that nearly everyone in this sector agreed on is that founders (and their investors) have to throw away their private-sector sales playbooks and rebuild their approach from the bottom up to sell specifically to these agencies. That means devising entirely different strategies and tactics to secure revenue performance.</p>
<p>The first and most important approach is, in some respects, to not even start with a company at all, but rather to start learning what people in this field actually do. As the sales cycle perhaps indicates, disaster response is unlike any other work. The chaos, the rapidly changing environment, the multi-disciplinary teams and cross-agency work that has to take place for a response to be effective have few parallels to professional office work. Empathy is key here: the responder that uses paper might have nearly lost their life in the field when their device failed. A 911 center operator may have listened to someone perish in real-time as they scrambled to find the right information from a software database.</p>
<p>In short, it’s all about customer discovery and development. That’s not so different from the enterprise world, but patience radiated out of many of my conversations with industry participants. It just takes more time — sometimes multiple seasons — to figure out precisely what to build and how to sell it effectively. If an enterprise SaaS product can iterate to market-fit in six months, it might take two to three years in the government sector to reach an equivalent point.</p>
<p>Michael Martin of RapidSOS said “There is no shortcut to doing customer discovery work in public service.” He noted that “I do think there is a real challenge between the arrogance of the Silicon Valley tech community and the reality of these challenges“ in public safety, a gap that has to be closed if a startup wants to find success. Meanwhile, Bryce Stirton, president and co-founder of public-safety company Responder Corp, said that “The end user is the best way to look at all the challenges … what are all the boxes the end user has to check to use a new technology?”</p>
<p>Mendelsohn of Hangar said that founders need to answer some tough questions in that process. “Ultimately, what are your entry points,” he asked. “Cornea has had to go through that customer discovery process … it all feels necessary, but what are the right things that require the least amount of behavior change to have impact immediately?”</p>
<p>Indeed, that process is appreciated on the other side as well. The federal emergency management official said, “everyone has a solution, but no one asked me about my problem.” Getting the product right and having it match the unique work that takes place in this market is key.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have a great product though — how do you get it through the perilous challenges of the procurement process? Here, answers differed widely, and they offer multiple strategies on how to approach the problem.</p>
<p>Martin of RapidSOS said that “government does not have a good model for procuring new services to solve problems.” So, the company chose to make its services free for government. “In three years, we went from no agencies using our stuff to all agencies using our stuff, and that was based on not making it a procurement problem,” he said. The company’s business model is based on having paid corporate partners who want to integrate their data into 911 centers for safety purposes.</p>
<p>That’s a similar model used by <a href="https://mdally.com">MD Ally</a>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/md-ally-connects-telehealth-alternatives-right-into-911-calls/">received a $3.5 million seed check from General Catalyst this past week</a>. The company adds telehealth referral services into 911 dispatch systems, and CEO and founder Shanel Fields emphasized that she saw an opportunity to create a revenue engine from the physician and mental health provider side of her market while avoiding government procurement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yWp4rUGpeP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/md-ally-connects-telehealth-alternatives-right-into-911-calls/">MD Ally connects telehealth alternatives right into 911 calls</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;MD Ally connects telehealth alternatives right into 911 calls&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/md-ally-connects-telehealth-alternatives-right-into-911-calls/embed/#?secret=yWp4rUGpeP" data-secret="yWp4rUGpeP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Outside of what might be dubbed “Robinhood for government” (aka, just offering a service for free), another approach is to link up with more well-known and trusted brand names to offer a product that has the innovation of a startup but the reliability of an established player. Stirton of Responder said “we learned in [this market] that it takes more than just capital to get companies started in this space.” What he found worked was building private-sector partnerships to bring a joint offering to governments. For instance, he noted cloud providers Amazon Web Services and Verizon have good reputations with governments and can get startups over procurement hurdles (TechCrunch is owned by Verizon Media, which is owned by Verizon).</p>
<p>Elichai of Carbyne notes that much of his sales is done through integration partners, referencing <a href="https://www.centralsquare.com">CenterSquare</a> as one example. For 911 services, “The U.S. market is obviously the most fragmented” and so partners allow the company to avoid selling to thousands of different agencies. “We are usually not selling direct to governments,” he said.</p>
<p>Partners can also help deal with the problem of localism in emergency procurement: many government agencies don’t know precisely what to buy, so they simply buy software that is offered by companies in their own backyard. Partners can offer a local presence while also allowing a startup to have a nimble national footprint.</p>
<p>Another angle on partners is building out a roster of experienced but retired government executives who can give credibility to a startup through their presence and networks. Even more than in enterprise, government officials, particularly in emergency management, have to work and trust one another given the closely-coupled work that they perform. Hearing a positive recommendation from a close contact down the street can readily change the tenor of a sales conversation.</p>
<p>Finally, as much as emergency management software is geared for governments, private sector companies increasingly have to consider much of the same tooling to protect their operations. Many companies have distributed workforces, field teams, and physical assets they need to protect, and often have to respond to disasters in much the same way that governments do. For some startups, it’s possible to bootstrap in the private sector early on while continuing to assiduously develop public sector relationships.</p>
<p>In short, a long-term customer development program coupled with quality partnerships and joint offerings while not forgetting the private sector offers the best path for startups to break through into these agencies.</p>
<p>The good news is that the hard work can be rewarded. Not only are there serious dollars that flow through these agencies, but the agencies themselves know that they need better technology. Tom Harbour, who is chief fire officer at Cornea and formerly national director of fire management at the U.S. Forest Service, notes that “These are billions of dollars we spend … and we know we can be more efficient.” Government doesn’t always make it easy to create efficiency, but for the founders willing to go the distance, they can build impactful, profitable, and mission-driven companies.</p>

<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020.</p>
<p>Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American watches 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This week we&#8217;re looking at the launch of Apple&#8217;s ATT, the Facebook and Spotify team-up and the latest from the EU&#8217;s antitrust investigation against Apple.</p>

<h3>Here Comes ATT</h3>
<p>Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">public debut of App Tracking Transparency</a>, or ATT, is the news of the week and possibly of the year. Through a small pop-up message asking users if the app can track them, Apple has disrupted a multibillion-dollar adtech industry, altered the course of tech giants like Facebook and drawn possible <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">lawsuits</a> and antitrust <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/26/german-advertisers-file-antitrust-complaint-over-apples-app-tracking-transparency?utm_medium=rss">complaints</a>, all in the name of protecting consumer privacy. Apple does believe in privacy and user control &#8212; you can tell that from the way the company has built its technology to do things like on-device processing or permissions toggles that let people decide what their apps can and cannot do.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="o4wmAxOCnW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature has arrived — here&#8217;s what you need to know</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But Apple will also benefit from this particular privacy reform, too. Its own first-party apps can collect data and share it with other first-party apps. That means what you do in apps like the App Store, Apple News, Stocks and others can be used to personalize Apple&#8217;s own ads. And the company is prepared to capitalize on this opportunity too, with the addition of a new ad slot on the App Store (in <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/04/26/german-advertisers-file-antitrust-complaint-over-apples-app-tracking-transparency?utm_medium=rss">the Suggested section</a> on the Search tab.) If it wants to roll out more ads over time to other businesses &#8212; perhaps, those podcasts it got newly interested in after Spotify did? Or in its streaming TV service or fitness solution? Perhaps the ads it sells in Apple News? &#8212; then it would have access to valuable data it could use. Oh and the next time you open the App Store or Apple News, you won&#8217;t be bothered with one of those pesky warnings! Nope &#8212; that&#8217;s only for <em>third</em>-parties, a <em>very</em> important distinction! If you want to turn off Apple&#8217;s own ability to track you across its growing number of apps, that&#8217;s at the VERY bottom of iOS&#8217;s Privacy Settings.</p>

<p>Facebook and Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/facebook-introduces-a-new-miniplayer-that-streams-spotify-within-the-facebook-app/">expanded</a> their partnership this week. The companies had earlier announced their plans to make it easier for Facebook users to stream music and podcasts from the Facebook app. On Monday, this integration began rolling out in the form of a miniplayer experience that allows Facebook users to stream from Spotify through the Facebook app on iOS or Android.</p>
<p>The feature is available to both free and paying Spotify users and will allow them each to hear the full song or podcast episode being shared. However, free users will then be moved into &#8220;shuffle&#8221; mode if they continue to listen after the song plays.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this integration is that it&#8217;s not actually streaming Spotify through Facebook. The miniplayer activates and controls the launch and playback in the Spotify app — which is how the playback is able to continue even as the user scrolls on Facebook or if they minimize the Facebook app altogether. This gives the appearance of Facebook doing the streaming. (Songs on social! Cue Myspace vibes!)</p>
<p>Spotify says users can&#8217;t upgrade to Spotify Premium from the miniplayer directly, so there&#8217;s no rev share there. It&#8217;s also paying the royalties on streams, as usual. But it&#8217;s getting massive distribution through Facebook, driving signups and repeat usage, while Facebook gets a way to keep users on its app longer. Win-win. Not coincidentally, both companies now share a common enemy with Apple, whose <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22254815/facebook-apple-privacy-ios-14-lawsuit">privacy-focused changes</a> are impacting Facebook’s ad business and whose investments in Apple Music and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">Podcasts</a> are a threat to Spotify.</p>

<p><strong>Russia&#8217;s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/russian-competition-watchdog-fines-apple-12-mln-abusing-dominant-position-2021-04-27/">fined Apple $12.1 million</a> for alleged app market abuse</strong>, saying Apple gave its own products a competitive advantage.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The EU is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">charging</a> Apple for its anticompetitive behavior this week</strong>, nearly two years after Spotify filed its first complaint about the App Store and Apple Music. The European Commission last year opened its antitrust investigation into Apple&#8217;s business, which is also now under fire in the U.S. for similar matters.</p>
<p>On Friday, the European regulators stated that Apple has &#8220;abused its dominant position&#8221; in the distribution of music streaming services on the App Store, and called it a &#8220;monopoly.&#8221; The EU doesn&#8217;t think Apple should be able to force developers to use its own in-app purchase mechanism nor should it be able to restrict them from telling users where else they can pay &#8212; like the developer&#8217;s own website, for example.</p>

<p>Apple is correct in pointing out that Spotify has built a massive business &#8212; which to be fair, was built both on and off the App Store. But it&#8217;s claiming a pretty big hand in that. The EU&#8217;s belief, meanwhile, is that Spotify might have been even more successful if Apple hadn&#8217;t imposed the restrictions it did, and that other smaller, streaming competitors are being harmed, too, but don&#8217;t have the power to speak up.</p>

Emoticons and emoji can also no longer be used.

They can&#8217;t use words like &#8220;free&#8221; or best&#8221; either, and must be localized and legible.</p>

<p><strong>A popular Android app for writing JavaScript code, DroidScript, had its Google advertising suspended and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/27/droidscript_google_ban/">was then removed from the Google Play Store</a> for ad fraud</strong>. The founder of the nonprofit DroidScript.org behind the app asked Google for an explanation and got no response, <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/androidscript/c/Mbh5TZ6YYnA">he said</a>. The app was used by over 100K developers, students and professionals.</p>

Google didn&#8217;t offer a reward payout for the finding, saying that system logs haven&#8217;t been readable by unprivileged apps since the early days of Android.</p>

<p>The makers of a popular email app Edison Mail have now launched another email app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onmail-fast-simple-email/id1531381193">OnMail</a>. This new iOS app is designed to solve more difficult email problems, like handling overloaded inboxes and mail that spies on you. The app will automatically block tracking pixels (read receipts), suggest emails to unsubscribe from, index your entire history for faster searches, stop ad targeting, and more. Like Basecamp&#8217;s Hey, users can also decide who can or cannot enter their inbox, too. And when you want to see your promotions, they&#8217;re provided in a visual feed that&#8217;s more engaging.</p>
<p>The service, which is also available on the web, works with OnMail email addresses, as well as other accounts like those from Microsoft, Google and others. It will later introduce an Android app, calendar support, Yahoo and Microsoft Exchange support, and two-factor. The company says your name and email is never shared, but it does use anonymized data as part of its <a href="https://trends.edison.tech/">Edison Trends (digital commerce) research</a> &#8212; users are opted in, but an opt out is available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s an old saw from Mark Twain about how truth is stranger than fiction, and I think it&#8217;s fair to say we&#8217;ve lived through a very strange reality this past year. With all the chaos and change, we&#8217;re led to a foundational question: what&#8217;s the purpose of speculative fiction and its adjacent genres of science fiction and fantasy when so much of our world seems to already embody the fantastical worlds these works depict?</p>
<p>So I got our occasional fictional columnist <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com">Eliot Peper</a> and <a href="https://www.eliotpeper.com/p/blog-page.html">the author of Veil, the three part Analog Series and other speculative fiction novels</a> on the Gmail for an epistolary conversation on digesting 2020, the meaning of speculative fiction, and the future of art.</p>
<p><em>This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed.</em></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Danny Crichton</strong>: I&#8217;m curious about the future of speculative fiction. We just went through a devastating year with the pandemic and a number of major climate disorders – the types of events that are among the fodder for this genre. How do you keep speculating when reality always seems to catch up with the amygdala of our imaginations?</p>
<p><strong>Eliot Peper</strong>: Current events are a painful reminder that unlike fiction, reality needn&#8217;t be plausible. The world is complex and even the wisest of us understand only a tiny sliver of what&#8217;s really going on. Nobody knows what comes next. So while it may feel like we&#8217;re living in a science fiction novel, that&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve <i>always been </i>living in a science fiction novel. Or maybe speculative fiction is more real than so-called realist fiction because the only certainty is that tomorrow will be different from today and from what we expect. Depicting a world without fundamental change has become fantastical.</p>
<p>As a writer of speculative fiction, I&#8217;m an enthusiastic reader of history. And in reading about the past to slake my curiosity and imagine possible futures, I&#8217;ve learned that the present is exceedingly contingent, fascinating, and fleeting. For me, speculative fiction is less about prediction than it is about riffing on how the world is changing like a jazz musician might improvise over a standard. Accuracy only happens by mistake. The most interesting rendition wins because it makes people think, dream, <i>feel</i>. And thanks to technological leverage, to a greater and greater extent people are inventing the future – for better and for worse.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m not worried about reality catching up with speculative fiction because speculative fiction is rooted in the human experience of reality. Every black swan event is simply new material.</p>
<p><strong>Crichton</strong>: So this gets at a challenge that I think blurs the line between realist and speculative fiction and makes these works so hard to categorize. To me, the reality of the pandemic isn&#8217;t the black swan that a novel virus could take hold across the planet (after all, pandemics are actually quite common in history), but rather the black swan of the completely shambolic response that we witnessed, one that was not at all well-coordinated.</p>
<p>If I were designing a speculative fiction scenario, I don&#8217;t think I could come up with &#8220;we develop a cure extremely rapidly thanks to the progress of medical science, but the general day-to-day response of people is to massively inflate the death totals through their own actions.&#8221; When I think speculative, I think spectacular — something exceptional, but this particular black swan shows the power of the mundane actions of our lives to influence the course of events.</p>
<p><strong>Peper</strong>: Speculative fiction is all about asking &#8220;what if?&#8221; What if a lone astronaut got stranded on Mars? What if genetic engineers resurrected dinosaurs and stuck them in an amusement park? What if we are all living in a simulation? The question that sparked my latest novel, <i>Veil</i>, is &#8220;what if a billionaire hijacked the climate with geoengineering?&#8221; These questions are hooks. They capture the imagination and pique curiosity. That&#8217;s all well and good, but it&#8217;s only a starting point.</p>
<p>To pay off a speculative setup, you need to keep the dominos falling as second-, third-, and fourth-order effects ripple out through the story. Momentum builds. Progressive complications tighten the ratchet. Unexpected reversals fling the reader forward. If an earthquake flattens San Francisco in your story, it&#8217;s easy to imagine potential physical consequences: the Bay Bridge collapsing, BART flooding, the power going out, gas leaks, fires, etc. It&#8217;s less obvious but at least as important to imagine the potential social consequences: Do people risk their lives to rescue their neighbors or fight over limited emergency supplies? How do the governor and the president respond given their particular personalities, incentives, and constituencies? How might such an event rework the social fabric of the Bay Area? (Also, crucially, <i>where is Dwayne Johnson?</i>) How people respond to events is integral to how events play out.</p>
<p>Published in April 2020, Lawrence Wright&#8217;s <i>The End of October</i> does an eerily good job extrapolating the messy, cascading social and political reactions to a global pandemic. Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s <i>Galápagos</i> depicts an apocalyptic scenario driven by such mundane, shambolic human shortsightedness that it feels nearly absurd enough to be realistic. While some science fiction overindexes technological change, Ada Palmer&#8217;s brilliant <em>Terra Ignota</em> series imagines the cultural, political, and sociological aspects of a fictional future with extraordinary rigor. So often, human behavior is the X-factor that transforms and amplifies the impacts of the original scenario, shaping a new world in the process.</p>
<p>This hints at a deeper question though: What is fiction for?</p>
<p>When I write fiction, I am not trying to accurately depict or anticipate reality. I&#8217;m trying to create an experience, to take the reader on a journey that is compelling, surprising, and fulfilling. Even though part of the fun might be extrapolating a scenario rooted in a particularly intriguing facet of the real world, success isn&#8217;t getting things right. Success is a reader turning pages deep into the night to find out what happens next in a story they can&#8217;t put down and won&#8217;t soon forget.</p>
<p>Neil Gaiman likes to say that fairy tales are more than true – not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten. When it comes to speculative fiction, I love stories that reveal a deep emotional truth or illuminate an underlying force shaping the course of history even if they are wildly but entertainingly wrong about literal details. That doesn&#8217;t mean that striving for technical accuracy is bad, just that it isn&#8217;t always the point. The point might instead be to make you think, to make you feel, to make you imagine how the world might be different.</p>
<p><strong>Crichton</strong>: So on that last point, I&#8217;m curious how you think about imagination and its power for change. Obviously, art has had a sustained and powerful impact on the imagination of people throughout history, and there are often artistic antecedents to large societal, cultural, and political changes. Part of its power historically though, at least from my perspective, was its rarity and its ability to surprise.</p>
<p>Today, we are just subsumed in imaginative worlds, from video games to movies to streaming television shows to books and graphic novels and on and on. If you read time-use studies, Americans are awash in imaginative contexts for potentially a majority of their waking hours. I feel like I&#8217;ve been increasingly seeing this gap between the extreme breadth of imagination available in our art, but the extreme narrowness for change in our daily lives. Is that a threat to the ability of art to provoke change? Is speculation still an activity that can lead to action?</p>
<p><strong>Peper</strong>: Speculation is part of what it means to be human. Before we make a choice, we imagine the possible consequences. We simulate potential futures in daydreams before committing to them in reality. Our mental projections are often wrong, but they are also often useful. For better and for worse, thought experiment is foundational to our internal lives. This individual dynamic scales to the human collective: Imagining a better future is the first step toward building one.</p>
<p>Art is a vehicle for imagination. A filmmaker codifies their vision in a movie that others can watch and, in watching, exercise their respective imaginations – sometimes even sparking new creative endeavors that spin off into yet more projects that together form what we call culture. Technology has made more movies, books, songs, poems, photos, paintings, comics, podcasts, and games available and accessible to more people than ever before. Imagined worlds are an integral part of the real world as we experience it, layering meaning and possibility onto actual events. We are all interpreting reality for each other all the time, transforming it in the process. The increasing density and intensity of that process is the result of a growing population that is knitting itself together ever more tightly along ever more dimensions.</p>
<p>But technology hasn&#8217;t just made new artistic mediums possible and changed the ways in which people make, discover, and experience art. Technology amplifies the impact of human choices. Hippocrates couldn&#8217;t have invented an mRNA vaccine, Genghis Khan couldn&#8217;t have pressed a button to initiate a nuclear apocalypse, and Odysseus had to build his Trojan Horse out of wood instead of code.</p>
<p>Our tools give us superpowers our ancestors never imagined and the consequences of our decisions scale accordingly. Because technical ingenuity is morally neutral, technological development ratchets up the stakes for timeless questions of human agency – what does it mean to live a good life, to contribute to the greater good, to be a good ancestor? This is the moral geography to which artists offer diverse, imperfect, contradictory, and occasionally invaluable maps. So in a certain sense, the more technology empowers us, the more we need art.</p>
