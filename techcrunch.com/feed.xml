										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of small businesses globally, especially in emerging markets, have stayed offline for the better part of the past decade</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Due to that, most of them still rely on scribbles using pen and paper or ledgers for bookkeeping and storing important information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, some go to the extent of keeping information offhand. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these inefficiencies, asides from being time-consuming, lead to errors and affects cash flow and finance, which is why almost nine out of 10 small businesses in the country fizzle out in the first five years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigerian startup <a href="https://kippa.africa/">Kippa</a>, attempting to improve the life cycle of these small businesses with its finance management app, has raised $3.2 million in pre-seed funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236080" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s new financing round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Berlin-based VC <a href="https://www.targetglobal.vc/">Target Global</a>. Entrée Capital, Alter Global and Rally Cap Ventures are the other participating VCs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> angel investors &#8212; Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda CEO; Sriram Krishnan, an investor in Khatabook; Raffael Johnen, Auxmoney CEO; Chris Bouwer; Kyane Kassiri; Edward Suh of Goodwater Capital; and Sajid Rahman &#8212; invested in the startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kippa works as a simple app where small business owners can keep track of their daily income and expense transactions, create invoices and receipts, manage inventory and generally </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how their businesses ebb and flow over time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the app’s most important features, according to the company, is that it helps merchants keep track of debtors and send automated reminders to them</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company claims that merchants who use Kippa this way “recover debts 3x faster.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these features are geared at onboarding a wide range of businesses in Nigeria to the platform; however, the strategy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to introduce credit and other financial services to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a cultural nuance to this, co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennedyekezie">Kennedy Ekezie</a> tells TechCrunch. The majority of transactions carried out by small businesses are cash-based, and more than 30% of sales happen on credit. So, at its core, the biggest problem businesses face is not the absence of bookkeeping or tools but the dearth of working capital or credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For us, what we do is we have such a unique opportunity to provide financial services to users. For most of them, Kippa is the first B2B SaaS app that they’re using,” said the CEO, who started the company with <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/duke-ekezie-joseph">Duke Ekezie</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/uchejephtah">Jephthah Uche</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And we do have a unique opportunity to help them accept online digital payments, to provide them with working capital, digital savings and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plug them into the financial ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many startups solving various needs of small businesses and startups have launched with bold promises this past year &#8212; a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ll with different approaches; some want to manage bookkeeping, some are keen on connecting small businesses with suppliers, others provide banking and software services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in reality, they all converge at one point, which is providing access to credit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Ekezie says while this holds true, Kippa is “choosing to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> native, rather than pursue the digitization of analogue processes that previous players have done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” And that sets the company apart, according to the founder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Kippa remains free for businesses to use at the moment, the introduction of credit and other financial services will see the company make revenue by taking commission fees or interests off lending or working capital</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bookkeeping and finance app claims to have grown an average of 126% month-on-month since launching in June. With o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ver 130,000 active businesses, ranging from small kiosks and street corner shops to local food vendors and high-end merchants using the app,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kippa claims to have recorded more than $300 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the past five months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For lead investor Target Global, these metrics </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indicate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a strong need for the product in the Nigerian market; consequently, that’s why it invested. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linachong/">Lina Chong</a>, the firm’s investment director, “Our investment in Kippa will enable it to grow and be the first-choice financial management solution for small businesses in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ekezie and his co-founders started Kippa in February 2021. Before Kippa, the trio founded Africave, <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/04/08/africave-feature/">a software talent matching platform</a> in 2019 that shuttered last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ekezie, they moved on from Africave after recognizing imminent supply constraints that would put a cap on the company’s growth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO said the founders sought to solve another problem they felt was perfect for their strengths. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After embarking on a founder-market-fit tour and meeting several small business owners across Nigeria to understand their pain points, Kippa was born</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we saw was a lot of them operating very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">manually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using the ledgers, spending one hour or more at the end of the day balancing their books, making mistakes, cancelling out, complaining of their records being incomplete,” said Ekezie</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And we saw a bigger problem &#8212; which is the biggest problem small businesses face &#8212; the lack of access to credit or financing to run </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">properly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we thought that was an interesting enough problem to solve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team also spoke with founders and some founding team members of similar players in other emerging markets such as India’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/indias-khatabook-raises-100-million-for-its-bookkeeping-platform-for-merchants/">Khatabook</a>, Colombia’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/treinta-announces-500k-in-funding-for-its-microbusiness-financial-app/">Treinta</a>, Indonesia’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/bukuwarung-a-fintech-for-indonesian-msmes-scores-60m-series-a-led-by-valar-and-goodwater/">BukuWarung</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bukukas-gets-50m-from-investors-including-doordashs-gokul-rajaram-and-transferwise-co-founder-taavet-hinrikus/">Bukukas</a> to understand how they scaled their businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though there are some similarities, Ekezie believes he and his team have rewired Kippa to adapt to the needs of businesses in Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, whereas Khatabook and other players are digitizing bookkeeping processes first before anything else, Kippa is solving broader access to finance problems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kippa’s pre-seed round, one of the largest in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa, will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be invested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in growing its merchant base, improving its product, scaling the team, and venturing into financial services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://cron.com">Cron</a>, a new calendar app for the Mac that wants to bring some innovation to this space. The startup directly mentions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sunrise/">Sunrise</a> as an inspiration for those of you who still remember it. Sunrise used to be a popular calendar product that was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/11/microsoft-confirms-sunrise-acquisition-adds-depth-to-it-mobile-productivity-offerings/">acquired</a> by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Cron has attended Y Combinator’s winter back of 2020 and has raised a $3.5 million seed round in March 2020. <a href="https://twitter.com/garrytan">Garry Tan</a> from Initialized Capital is leading the round, with various business angels also participating. Some of those investors include Elad Gil, Figma founder Dylan Field, former LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner and Sunrise co-founder Jeremy Le Van.</p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="https://cron.com">company’s website</a>, there’s no feature page and no download link. “We haven’t really announced the company and the product yet. We’re kinda in semi-stealth,” Cron founder Raphael Schaad told me.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235995" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I haven’t used the app myself, but Schaad shared his screen during a call so that I could see the app with my own eyes. While it isn’t ready for prime time just yet, it already looks like a well-designed calendar app with a couple of nifty features.</p>
<p>More importantly, it feels like a strong foundation for additional features that could differentiate Cron from other calendar apps out there.</p>
<p>“I started scheduling meetings with myself,” Schaad said. “I was thinking I should build a layer on top of the calendar,” he added. But first, he realized he couldn’t build a layer on top of the calendar without a proper calendar app that handles multiple time zones, meetings with other people, notifications, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235999" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235999" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cron-calendar-screenshot2@2x.png" alt="" width="1024" height="683" class="size-full wp-image-2235999" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cron-calendar-screenshot2@2x.png 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cron-calendar-screenshot2@2x.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cron-calendar-screenshot2@2x.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cron-calendar-screenshot2@2x.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cron-calendar-screenshot2@2x.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cron-calendar-screenshot2@2x.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cron-calendar-screenshot2@2x.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cron-calendar-screenshot2@2x.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235999" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cron</p></div></p>
<p>The main Cron window looks like a calendar app with a week view in the center, a tiny month view in the corner and a list of active calendars on the left. If you’ve used Apple Calendar, you’re going to feel right at home.</p>
<p>Cron also features a column on the right side of the main window. When you click on an event, you get details about the event in that column. From there, you can change the time and date, add a participant, add a conference link and more.</p>
<p>Whenever you change the duration of an event or move it to another day, the week view gets updated in real-time so that you can see how it affects your week before hitting Enter.</p>
<p>If you haven’t selected an event, it shows the next event with a button to join the meeting if there’s a video-conferencing URL attached to the event. Cron supports Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Whereby, BlueJeans, Around, Skype and Google Duo. If you&#8217;re a Fantastical user, you&#8217;re probably already using that feature every day.</p>
<p>Cron lets you create an event quickly with a command menu. You can hit a keyboard shortcut and start scheduling the event with natural language. You can also search for events or people from that menu.</p>
<p>There are a couple of features that I find particularly interesting. First, you can share availability in an email conversation or a WhatsApp conversation quite easily.</p>
<p>Most scheduling features in calendar involve generating a link with a bunch of availabilities. It doesn’t work well as you can’t quickly see when someone is available without clicking the link first.</p>
<p>In Cron, you can hit a keyboard shortcut to enter a different mode called ‘Share availability’. After that, you can select time blocks in your calendar directly. It generates a text block that you can copy and paste in Gmail, Messages or whatever you’re using to talk with someone — text is still the most universal protocol after all.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Would 30 mins during any of these times (all Central European Time) work for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Mon Nov 8, 11 AM &#8211; 12:30 PM, or 1:30-4 PM</li>
<li>Tue Nov 9, 8:30-10 AM, or 11 AM &#8211; 12 PM</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And Cron works better as a team as you can see when your coworkers are available from Cron directly. In the sidebar, you can add someone you’re working with. After that, it works pretty much like another calendar.</p>
<p>You can show and hide their calendar to see when they should be available. You can also click on their name in order to drag and drop their name in your calendar to create an event with them.</p>
<p>Schaad has a big vision for his startup. “We want to build the time layer of the internet,” he said. Right now, Cron is available to some users in early access and the app only supports Google accounts. But it should be available soon to everyone with support for Microsoft and iCloud accounts.</p>
<p>It’s still the early days of the company but it’s going to be interesting to follow Cron’s updates to see how it evolves. Some people are still going to prefer <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a> as it’s a polished, native app for Apple platforms. But it’s good to see that there could be an opinionated alternative.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the most popular streaming software makers is in hot water after being called out by top Twitch personalities and the open source project that served as a backbone for the company&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>Streamlabs, formerly Streamlabs OBS, changed its name Wednesday after backlash spread on Twitter against the company over alleged sketchy business practices. The <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Project</a>, short for Open Broadcaster Software, provided the open source technical framework for Streamlabs. But in spite of Streamlabs&#8217; decision to include &#8220;OBS&#8221; in its name, the company and the open source project were apparently never on good terms.</p>
<p>According to a tweet from the OBS Project, the open source group previously asked Streamlabs not to include &#8220;OBS&#8221; in its name at launch. Streamlabs ignored the request, a choice that likely led many of the software&#8217;s users to assume the two products were closely affiliated. To make matters even more confusing, Logitech actually owns Streamlabs, after buying the company for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/logitech-acquires-popular-game-streaming-tool-streamlabs-for-around-89m/">$89 million back in 2019</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236318" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google will roll out support for Hinglish, a mix of Hindi and English, and a range of additional features to its payments app Google Pay in India as the global tech giant makes further push to expand its reach in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>“For technology to truly fulfill its purpose of transforming lives and economies, it’s critical that we never lose sight of building universally helpful products that work for everyone regardless of their preferred language or fluency,” said Ambarish Kenghe, VP of Google Pay, at a virtual event Thursday.</p>
<p>The support for Hinglish, which is spoken by over 350 million people in India, is one of the many new features Google is working to roll out in the South Asian market, said Kenghe. The firm will also ship a feature later this year that will allow users to easily split an expense with friends and family, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236319" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Users will also be able to soon fill details such as bank account information for merchant payments with voice. “You can say it in Hindi or English, we will automatically figure it out,” he said.</p>
<p>Google Pay, launched in India four years ago, has become <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">one of the top peer-to-peer payments apps</a> in the world’s second largest internet market. Catering to merchants and businesses has been one of the major focuses for Google with the payments app, which was formerly known as Tez.</p>
<p>Kenghe said more than 10 million merchants in India today use Google Pay. To make further inroads with this segment, the company announced My Shop that will help merchants create online storefronts on the Google Pay app &#8220;within minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Merchants will be able to use a predefined template to quickly showcase their inventory on the app, he said. They will also be able to add information such as their business hours and delivery offerings.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2236320" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236320" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2236320" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/google-pay-my-shop-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/google-pay-my-shop-india.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/google-pay-my-shop-india.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/google-pay-my-shop-india.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/google-pay-my-shop-india.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/google-pay-my-shop-india.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/google-pay-my-shop-india.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236320" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Having an online storefront on Google Pay will allow merchants to have discoverability on Google Maps and Google Search as well, he said. The feature will roll out later this month in India.</p>
<p>Four years ago, a coalition of retail banks launched a payments infrastructure called UPI in India that supports interoperability and charges no money for transactions. The country, which was already seeing a fast adoption of mobile payments, dramatically accelerated those adoption with UPI.</p>
<p>Today, the system processes 3.6 billion transactions each month &#8212; and Google recommended the U.S. Federal Reserve to implement a similar real-time payments platform in the country in 2019.</p>
<p>“As exhilarating as these last few years have been for digital payments for India, we are still very much at the beginning. As India sets new standards for future payments across the global, we look forward to playing our part and using technology to create greater economic opportunity for everyone in India,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has formed a key partnership to help provide loans to micro and small businesses in India, the firm announced at its annual event for the South Asian market.</p>
<p>The company said it has partnered with Small Industries Development Bank of India, the country’s apex regulatory body for overall licensing and regulation of micro, small and medium enterprise finance, to launch a $15 million financial assistance program to deliver timely micro credit to enterprises.</p>
<p>The loans, which will be disbursed by SIDBI, will be offered at “competitive interest rates,” and its ticket size will range from 25 lakhs Indian rupees ($33,728) to 1 crore ($135,000). Eligible firms will be using the loan to finance purchases of new equipment and machinery, scaling their production infrastructure and fulfilling their working capital needs, said Shalini Puchalapalli, Director of Customer Solutions at Google India, at the event.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236311" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“With today’s announcement, we believe that working with the broader ecosystem we can drive a wide-ranging positive social impact. We also hope that this will encourage more organizations to invest in public-private partnerships and further strengthen our economy,” she said.</p>
<p>The program will prioritize women-owned businesses and those that are engaged in production of equipment for the country’s fight against the pandemic, she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, we feel proud that SIDBl&#8217;s efforts in reviving the sector are backed by a strong collaboration with Google,&#8221; said Sivasubramanian Ramann, Chairman and Managing Director of SIDBI, at the virtual event.</p>
<p>Google, which last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">committed to invest $10 billion in India</a> over the course of five to seven years, is the latest tech giant to explore helping disburse loans to businesses in India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In August, Facebook l<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/facebook-launches-program-to-help-small-and-medium-sized-indian-businesses-secure-loans/">aunched a similar program</a> to help small and medium-sized businesses secure loans in the South Asian market. Facebook has inked tieups with lending partners to grant small ticket loans — ranging between 500,000 Indian rupees ($6,720) to 50,00,000 ($67,200) — at a predefined interest rate of 17%-20% per annum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian fintech giant Paytm, backed by SoftBank and Alibaba, fell by more than 20% after its debut trading on local exchanges Thursday. The firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/paytm-raises-1-1-billion-from-anchor-investors-in-indias-blockbuster-ipo/">raised $2.5 billion in India&#8217;s largest initial public offering</a>, is valued at about $14.9 billion, compared to $20 billion valuation the firm was aiming for.</p>
<p>Shares of One97 Communications, the holding firm of Paytm, traded for as low as 1,591 Indian rupees ($21.4), down from the offer price of 2,150 Indian rupees.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s IPO is the latest in a series of listings by Indian startups as many begin to explore the public markets following years of growth. Indian food delivery startup Zomato, online insurance aggregator Policybazaar, and fashion commerce Nykaa have made stellar debut in the public market this year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236301" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Compared to its peers, the early hours trading for Paytm shares has been disappointing so far. But many industry executives said it&#8217;s too early to judge the performance of Paytm, which offers a range of services including peer-to-peer payments and a digital bank.</p>
<p>Even as One97 Communications started its journey two decades ago, Paytm was something that only arrived in the picture in the past decade.</p>
<p>A decade ago, Vijay Shekhar Sharma flew to Hong Kong to attend an All Things D conference. At the event, he watched Silicon Valley executives Jack Dorsey and Brian Chesky talk about the firms they were building. But the conversation that would change the trajectory of his firm, One97 Communications, was an interview of Alibaba founder Jack Ma.</p>
<p>“That trip taught me what was happening in the mobile payments and commerce spaces in Asia. It was so inspiring to hear Jack Ma speak at the event,” said Sharma in an interview ahead of the listing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the first 10 years of its existence, One97 Communications offered a range of services including domain name registration and VAS for telecom firms. The firm had raised $15 million and was profitable, but Sharma was now convinced that he needed to make a move into payments, he recalled in the interview.</p>
<p>But it was a tough sell for Sharma, as many of his investors wanted him to continue to focus on existing lines of business, according to several people familiar with the matter. After some back and forth with investors, and putting some of his shares on the line, Sharma was given the green light to pursue his ambitious experiment.</p>
<p>That experiment turned out to be a success. Paytm chronicles the mobile payments adoption in India today. “This is not Paytm getting listed. This is India’s youth getting listed,” said Sharma.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The journey for Paytm even after getting the green light wasn’t easy. Over the years, the startup struggled to raise funds and received several buyout offers including from Freecharge and Snapdeal &#8212; all of which it dismissed, according to sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The support I have received from the industry, from users and everyone else has been unbelievable,&#8221; said Sharma.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story, and will be updated throughout the day.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Baidu keeps ramping up its autonomous driving ambitions. The Chinese tech company made its name in search engines and still relies greatly on search ads for revenues. But it&#8217;s hoping that its heavy bet on autonomous driving will pay off down the road.</p>
<p>Apollo Go, Baidu&#8217;s robotaxi service, aims to be in 65 cities by 2025 and 100 cities by 2030, the firm&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Robin Li said on an<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/17/baidu-inc-bidu-q3-2021-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> analyst call Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big batch of licenses that Baidu needs to obtain from local regulators. And eventually, the business&#8217;s sustainability comes down to how many of these permits grant commercial operations to Apollo Go, and how many rides the service could actually garner.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236291" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For now, Li estimated that Baidu is &#8220;probably the largest robotaxi service provider in the world by number of rides.&#8221; In the third quarter alone, Baidu offered 115,000 rides, and Li expected the number for Q4 to be &#8220;much larger than the reported number you can hear anywhere else in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of improving its driving tech, Baidu has so far racked up over 16 million kilometers (10 million miles) of L4, self-driven distance.

<p>These enormous figures, however, have limited substance unless we know how many of these rides actually happen on busy city roads rather than designated routes in enclosed areas.</p>
<p>Like most autonomous vehicle companies in China, Baidu is carving out a commercial robotaxi operation while supplying its advanced driving assistance tech to automakers and OEMs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Baidu has been providing driving solutions to auto companies via its <a href="https://medium.com/apollo-auto/inside-apollo-6-0-a-road-towards-fully-driverless-technology-522b2b4295cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open-sourced Apollo platform</a> since 2017. While the platform has accumulated hundreds of enterprise users, Baidu has fostered closer ties with certain partners. For example, it set up a joint venture with China&#8217;s Geely to form electric vehicle maker Jidu Auto, into which the partners would plow <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-baidus-auto-venture-invest-77-bln-into-smart-cars-over-next-five-years-2021-04-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 billion yuan ($7.7 billion)</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://app.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a>, the popular auto-editing tool for writing, has raised $200 million in funding at a $13 billion valuation from new investors including Baillie Gifford and funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, among others. The company plans to use the investment to accelerate product innovation and team growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this funding round is a great validation of our business strength,&#8221; Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, Grammarly&#8217;s global head of product, told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been cash flow positive from the very early days. The round also validates the strength of our mission to improve lives through improving communication. This funding round comes in the context of product innovation and product scaling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roy-Chowdhury says Grammarly plans to use the funding to continue making investments in its AI technology. The company will also continue to advance its natural language processing and machine learning tech to deliver personalized communication feedback to its users. Roy-Chowdhury also noted that Grammarly plans to make additional investments to earn and strengthen user trust.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235750" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Looking ahead, I see so much potential because, at the end of the day, it always comes back to our mission of improving communication. There&#8217;s so much change in how work gets done with remote-first global teams trying to work together. We see a huge opportunity to help people with these changing scenarios communicate more effectively. This new funding is only going to help us accelerate our efforts to do that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As for the company&#8217;s vision for the future of the service, Roy-Chowdhury noted that Grammarly will move past simply focusing on conciseness, consistency, and correctness. The company plans to add new categories in which to offer suggested improvements, while also working to become more ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Grammarly is already scaling its product offerings and achieving its goal towards ubiquity with the launch of <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/introducing-grammarly-for-mac-windows">Grammarly for Mac and Windows</a> earlier this week. The new desktop application can be used on apps such as Microsoft Office, Slack, Discord, Jira, and more. Roy-Chowdhury says the new desktop app aims to be users&#8217; go-to writing tool wherever they type, as the service is now able to break out of technical barriers associated with browser extensions.</p>

<p>&#8220;With Grammarly for Mac and Windows, we can now tie everything together and help you with the entirety of your communication flow. With this, we are present everywhere you communicate and can help you achieve your outcomes more effectively,&#8221; Roy-Chowdhury stated.</p>
<p>Grammarly also recently announced the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/grammarly-sdk-beta-lets-developers-embed-text-editing-into-any-web-app/">Grammarly for Developers </a>with the rollout of its Text Editor SDK (software development kit), which enables programmers to embed Grammarly text editing functionality into any web application. The beta release of this SDK gives developers access to the full power of Grammarly automated editing with a couple of lines of code. Although users of the target application don’t need to be Grammarly customers, if they do happen to be, they can log into their Grammarly accounts and access all of the functionality that comes with that.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s latest funding round follows Grammarly&#8217;s previous one in October 2019, when it raised $90 million at a valuation of over $1 billion. This round was led by General Catalyst, which had also helped lead its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/08/grammarly-raises-110-million-for-a-better-spell-check/"> only other round, for $110 million in May 2017</a>, with participation from previous investor IVP and other unnamed backers.</p>
<p>Today, Grammarly works across more than 500,000 applications and websites including email clients, enterprise software, and word processors. The company says as more people are connecting across more online platforms, it&#8217;s important to get communication right in order to achieve individual and business goals, which is what it aims to help its users accomplish.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&#8220;</span>As the world has digitized, people communicate more than they ever have—yet it has never been so difficult,” said Peter Singlehurst, head of private companies at Baillie Gifford, in a statement. “Grammarly is one of the few businesses in the world focused on solving this problem. What attracted us is the company’s vision and the team’s ability to drive the product forward to help more people in more situations communicate better. Grammarly’s long-term and ambitious approach also aligns with our approach to investing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grammarly operates on a freemium model, where paid tiers give users more tools beyond grammar and spelling checks to include things like word choice, sentence rewrites, tone adjustments, fluency, formality level, and plagiarism detection. The paid tiers are priced at <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/upgrade?utm_campaign=funnelPremiumPlanComparison&amp;utm_medium=internal&amp;utm_source=funnel">$12, $20, and $30 per month</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab’s reusability program advanced one more step on Wednesday night when the company recovered the booster from its Electron launcher for the third time.</p>
<p>The successful mission comes after a period of delays due to weather, but all went according to plan, with the “Love at First Insight” mission taking off at 8:39 PM EST from the company’s launch facility on New Zealand’s Mahia Peninsula. Separation occurred at around 8:41 PM EST and the first stage splashing down at around 9:24 PM EST, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/Peter_J_Beck/status/1461158303283642373">a tweet from Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck</a>.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab has successfully recovered the first-stage booster twice in its history – the only other company besides SpaceX to achieve reusability. The first successful recovery took place <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/complete-success-rocket-labs-booster-recovery-is-a-big-step-towards-reusability/">November 2020</a> and then again in May 2021, though that latter mission resulted in the destruction of the payload.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236267" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like those flights, this booster made a splashdown via parachute. But the recovery included an additional element: the presence of a helicopter, which hovered near the splashdown area to track and observe the booster as it made its descent. While the helicopter didn’t actually do anything related to the recovery, its presence is significant, as it indicates that Rocket Lab is also a step closer to executing its ultimate reusability plan: using a parachute to slow the velocity of the booster and capturing it mid-air with a helicopter.</p>
<p>The Electron sent two BlackSky Earth geospatial imaging satellites to low Earth orbit, part of a rapid five-launch agreement on behalf of BlackSky between Rocket Lab and launch services provider Spaceflight Inc. These satellites were originally scheduled to go to LEO in August, part of a three-launch schedule that ended up being delayed due to a small resurgence of the coronavirus in New Zealand and subsequent lockdown measures.</p>
<p>The two BlackSky satellites will join seven others already in orbit, as the geospatial intelligence company’s aims to grow its constellation to 14 satellites by the end of this year. Earlier this year, two BlackSky satellites <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/rocket-labs-20th-electron-launch-ends-in-failure-with-the-loss-of-its-payload/">were lost due to a significant anomaly</a> that occurred shortly after the Electron’s second-stage ignited.</p>
<p>This mission marks Rocket Lab’s twenty-second Electron launch and the fifth mission this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A team of Google executives, many of whom worked with one another for years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/next-billion-users-head-caesar-sengupta-is-leaving-google/">left the company earlier this year</a> to launch a startup. The fintech firm, Arbo Works, has raised a financing round led by Sequoia Capital India, the two said Thursday.</p>
<p><a href="http://arbo.works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arbo Works</a>, spearheaded by Caesar Sengupta, said on Thursday 120 angel investors, many from Google, participated in the seed financing round. &#8220;This group includes CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, founders of successful startups, senior executives from tech and financial institutions, and deep practitioners of AI and ML,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup isn’t disclosing the size of the round, but two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that it’s an eight-figure investment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Sengupta, who previously led Google’s Next Billion Users program and is pictured above, told TechCrunch in an interview that the funds give Arbo Works runway for several years. “It’s a very significant round,” he said.</p>
<p>Arbo Works has eight co-founders, all of whom previously worked at Google. In fact, on its website, Arbo Works has listed 21 teammates, 20 of whom previously worked at Google (and many worked on the company’s payments product).</p>
<p>“We all have enjoyed working with each other. It sounds weird to say this, but I would continue to work with them anywhere, even if it is selling bananas,” he said laughingly. “Even as Google is a large company, a lot of this group formed around Sundar (Pichai, the company&#8217;s chief executive), working on Chrome OS. The group stayed together; in fact, many moved to Asia when I came here,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236216" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236216" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236216 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="307" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=150,45 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=300,90 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=768,230 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=680,204 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=1536,460 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=2048,613 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/arbo-works-team.jpg?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236216" class="wp-caption-text">Arbo Works team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Arbo Works</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So what is Arbo, which has set up headquarters in Singapore and the U.S., working on? Sengupta is hesitant to share just yet. But he offered some context around the opportunity the startup sees. Sengupta, who worked and launched peer-to-peer payments app Tez in India, said the startup has identified an open space in the world of consumer finance.</p>
<p>“We think the general world of finance itself can be dramatically improved. With payments, we are seeing a sliver of that getting reinvented, but when you think about your money, the consumer experience there has a lot to be developed. It’s a new space in consumer finance. We want to bring great consumer experiences with deep tech,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are starting with the U.S. market, because the space we are going after is more open there,” he said. “But we are building a global product. We will bring it to India fairly soon.”</p>
<p>Shailendra Singh, managing director at Sequoia India, said Arbo Works has chosen a &#8220;massive unsolved problem in the global fintech space.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Caesar and team are uniquely accomplished in having built multiple cutting-edge products that are used by billions of internet users on the planet. It’s rare that a team with such achievements will join forces to startup. Similar to many other consumer fintech companies we have backed, this one also requires a more user-centric approach, a more delightful user experience and a more seamless and scalable platform than likely exists today. Team Sequoia India and I could not be more grateful to be a part of this journey and join forces with the dozens of ultra talented Arbonauts that are assembling to pursue a very inspiring mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked Sengupta why he couldn’t build what Arbo Works is attempting to create within Google.</p>
<p>“Large companies are a different kind of beast,” he said. “We are product builders. I want to build products rather than deal with complex partner issues, external regulators, political issues. Google is such an iconic company now that it can’t take one step without six people externally having six different opinions.”</p>
<p>“We left [Google] on a very, very friendly note. Sundar is more than a mentor or boss … he is a brother to me and he is always going to stay that way. I owe so much of my life to him,” he said. Has Pichai invested in Arbo Works? Sengupta declined to comment, but said many Google leaders have backed the startup.</p>
<p>Arbo Works is beginning to hire more people and is looking to recruit those who are focused on building a product with a long-term focus and share <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10THTYtuwKCnkqymc4UeLXcB3xhR8sr-RAQ08IqdwN94/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar sensibilities</a>. &#8220;We want people who want to work with amazing people and build something that when they&#8217;re 70 years old, they can look back and say they played a role in building it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has been advancing the development of Starship, the largest ultra-super-heavy reusable launch system ever designed in history, at a jaw-dropping pace — and CEO Elon Musk is “comfortable” it will reach orbit sometime next year.</p>
<p>Musk made the comments — which often veered into the philosophical — at the National Academies’ first virtual joint fall meeting of the Space Studies Board and the Board on Physics and Astronomy. The talk, titled simply “SpaceX Starship Discussion,” and subsequent Q&amp;A session gave Musk the opportunity to respond to questions from Academy members on the next-gen system’s technical and operational details.</p>
<p>Musk is aiming for SpaceX to complete work on the launch pad and launch tower at Starbase, the company’s sprawling facility in Boca Chica, Texas, later this month, with the first orbital launch set for January 2022. That would be followed by possibly a dozen additional launches, possibly more, throughout the rest of 2022, Musk said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236203" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That doesn’t mean Starship will reach orbit in January, however, as Musk was careful to note. “There’s a lot of risk associated with this first launch,” he said. “So I would not say that it is likely to be successful, but I think we will make a lot of progress.”</p>
<p>The other major barrier to a January launch is regulatory approval. SpaceX’s launch activities at Starbase are currently undergoing an environmental assessment with the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA said earlier this week that it would wrap up that review by December 31, so if all goes according to Musk&#8217;s plans, a January launch is the earliest feasible date.</p>
<p>Musk also estimated it could start selling Starship launches at prices cheaper than the Falcon 9 in around two years, which are even earlier than the timeline part of SpaceX’s proposal for NASA’s Human Landing System. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">SpaceX won the sole bid</a> to develop the HLS, which will transport humans to the moon for the first time since the days of the Apollo program, for NASA’s Artemis program. That launch, dubbed Artemis 3, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/crewed-artemis-moon-landing-pushed-back-to-2025-nasa-says/">now scheduled to launch in 2025</a>.)</p>
<h2>Starship is moving fast</h2>
<p>It’s hard to overstate the scale of Starship, which includes the Starship spacecraft and the Super Heavy rocket, compared to all other launch systems in history. Fully assembled, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/spacex-stacks-the-full-starship-launch-system-for-the-first-time-standing-nearly-400-feet-tall/">it stands 394 feet tall</a> (by comparison, NASA’s in-development Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft is 322 feet fully stacked). Starship could have the capacity to repeatedly launch more than 100 tons into orbit and function as what Musk described as “a generalized transport mechanism for the greater solar system.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Musk isn’t aiming to build one, or two, or even 10 Starships; instead, he estimated during the talk that humanity may need around 1,000 launch systems to make life truly multiplanetary. And SpaceX has built a factory to mass manufacture them — or as close to mass manufacturing as you could get.</p>
<p>And the company has been moving fast on its development. Back in May, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/spacex-successfully-launches-and-lands-its-starship-prototype-rocket/">SpaceX flew the 15th prototype of Starship</a>, and the launch vehicle reached around 30,000 feet with a successful upright landing. It was the first time a test concluded with the launch vehicle intact.</p>
<p>“The overarching goal of SpaceX has been to advance space technology such that humanity can become a multiplanet species and ultimately, a spacefaring civilization, and to make true the things that we read about in science fiction, and have them not always be fiction,” he told National Academies&#8217; members.</p>
<p>“I think this is very important for the long-term preservation of the light of consciousness.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a world of copycat companies and investment firms that also increasingly operate in similar ways, Jack Abraham stands out a bit.</p>
<p>His venture firm, <a href="https://atomic.vc/">Atomic</a>, only writes checks to startups it spins up itself. It&#8217;s launching a <em>lot</em> of startups, too. Since founding and selling a company called Milo to eBay in 2010 at the age of 24, Abraham has co-founded dozens of companies with Atomic in recent years. Among them: the tele-health company Hims &amp; Hers, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/telehealth-startup-hims-fell-in-its-public-trading-debut-and-thats-fine-with-its-ceo/">went public</a> last year through a blank-check company; Bungalow, an online marketplace for residential real estate that closed on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-24/bungalow-valuation-soars-over-600-million-as-deer-park-invests?sref=gni836kR">$75 million in funding</a> at a post-money valuation of $600 million in August; and OpenStore, an eight-month-old startup that acquires e-commerce businesses that sell on Shopify and which just today announced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/17/openstore-keith-rabois-raises-75-million-shopify/?sh=7a9e7ffa3bea">$75 million in fresh funding</a> in a deal that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/17/openstore-keith-rabois-raises-75-million-shopify/?sh=7a9e7ffa3bea">reportedly</a> values the company at $750 million.</p>
<p>Altogether, Atomic has produced 14 companies over the last 12 months, and that&#8217;s on top of nine that it formed the year earlier. Notably, it has done this with not enormous amounts of funding (it closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/atomic-which-only-funds-the-startups-it-launches-just-closed-its-newest-fund-with-260-million/">$260 million fund</a> earlier this year). Atomic doesn&#8217;t have a sprawling team, either, though it has made some <a href="https://atomic.vc/blog/#your-co-founding-team">key hires</a> recently that bring its headcount to 50. (It was previously run by roughly 15 people.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235876" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Little wonder that traditional venture firms are starting to wonder if Abraham might be on to something. To get insight into his playbook for their benefit &#8212; and our own &#8212;  we sat down with him late <a href="https://strictlyvcinsf.splashthat.com/">last week</a> while he was in town from Miami, where he relocated from the Bay Area last year. Excerpts from our conversation, edited for length and clarity follow. (You can also catch the full conversation below.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235885" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235885" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235885 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235885" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dani Padgett</p></div></p>
<p><strong>TC: With valuations soaring so high, so fast, more and more VCs are talking about incubating companies in order to own more for a lot less capital. For their benefit, how is the sausage made at Atomic?</strong></p>
<p>JA: I think in reality, it&#8217;s actually pretty difficult to do venture capital and building companies at the same time. You see some firms doing it, where partners might start a company once every two years or three years, and that&#8217;s because when you&#8217;re operating in venture capital, you&#8217;re in a receiving mode. You&#8217;re getting so much email, you&#8217;re getting deal flow, your job is to source, you&#8217;re in meetings all the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At Atomic, we show up every day and play offense with our cofounders to build companies. We&#8217;ve also really worked on scaling up our team [including to bring in experts in marketing, finance, healthcare, and recruiting because] you have to build a team of builders to be able to do this.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t have a billion dollar fund; how do you pay for all that headcount? </strong></p>
<p>A lot of venture capital funds take the fees from the fund and distribute them just to the partners. We&#8217;re really trying to invest in our team to grow the team and support our companies. We have an amazing legal team at Atomic, for example, and rather than get billed $1,200 for talking to someone at a corporate law firm, we have someone who is equal to them who will get charged that cost to the company. There are some resources that are billed at utilization based on how much our companies use them, but completely at cost, and that helps offset some of the costs of those services where our companies might have spent that money elsewhere.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_lZAWf0hS0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;e also saving money obviously by building companies in house and thus avoiding paying a lot for small stake in someone else&#8217;s startup. How do you generate an idea, and how do you think about Atomic&#8217;s ownership percentage over time?</strong></p>
<p>We&#8217;re strong believers that it&#8217;s much better to observe problems in the world and come up with solutions for them … rather than doing brainstorming exercises. Sometimes those can lead to contrived ideas. So we try really hard across our portfolio to find patterns of things that are broken, problems that exist in industries we operate in, where whitespaces could exist, and note those problems. And we now have a list of well over 600 different company ideas that we can draw from. And we have a process for whittling those ideas down, testing them, getting smarter about them them, engaging experts and ultimately choosing which of them we want to build.</p>
<p>One advantage of our model [is] proprietary deal flow. Every company we create, our LPs get to invest in at predefined ownership levels. So by the time our companies come out and raise from venture capitalists, the ownership levels are much higher than most investors would have, which gives us room to play around with other investors and bring them in. We like collaborating with people. We have a lot of repeat customers that like working with us. We&#8217;re happy to be good citizens and figure out the right way to make that work.</p>
<p><strong>It looks from past deals that Founders Fund is one of them. You even co-founded a company this year with Keith Rabois called OpenStore. Before we get to that, I wanted to ask about telemedicine. Atomic&#8217;s first big hit was Hims, which came together in anticipation of ED drug patents expiring, making it possible to sell generic versions. I wonder how replicable that model is and how closely you&#8217;re tracking the many other drugs falling off the patent cliff. Could those be 50 of the 600 business ideas?</strong></p>
<p>[Hims was created in part from] an observation around &#8220;How do you find painful things people are suffering from, and get them treated online for [that condition]?&#8221; And &#8220;are there medications that are underpenetrated that could help those conditions?&#8221; … rather than some master strategy of observing when all drugs are coming off of patent and then tracking them all and seeing what we could build businesses off of. There are still a lot of opportunities in that space, but no, they do not comprise 50 of the 600 ideas.</p>
<p><strong>You have a wide range of companies. Do you think in terms of sectors?</strong></p>
<p>From the outset, in building Atomic, a lot of people told me, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you specialize? Why don&#8217;t you just do one kind of company? Why don&#8217;t you just do e-commerce companies, for example?&#8221; In some ways that would be a lot easier, right? You can build common infrastructure, you can rinse and repeat, and everything can be cookie cutter. [But] Marc Andreessen is one of our investors, and he told me when I was starting Atomic that there are 15 companies that are produced each year that matter.</p>
<p>The odds that those big ideas are going to occur in the same sector over and over again is very, very low. So by definition, we chose to be agnostic. And that has led us into basically everything: healthcare, fintech, education, proptech, commerce, AI, SaaS, consumer products. Nothing is off limits for us. Nothing really scares us. And the world&#8217;s changing so quickly that I actually think you need to have that mindset to catch the next big thing.</p>
<p><strong>How do you find &#8212; and financially motivate &#8212; the founders who you need to lead these companies?</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways that we go about it. We can either start with the person or the people, or we can start with the idea. In the case where we&#8217;re starting with the person or people, we just want to work with them as an individual. We&#8217;re kind of totally agnostic to the idea. So we&#8217;re just like, &#8220;We&#8217;ll work on anything with you. Let&#8217;s find something that we&#8217;re both excited about, and let&#8217;s keep going.&#8221; We&#8217;ll also form companies sometimes where we start with the idea and we build the company up to millions of dollars of revenue, and then bring in the perfect person to run it, and we&#8217;ll still make them a co-founder and we still want to give them a huge amount of equity because we want them to be incentivized but based on where they&#8217;re coming in and how much value they&#8217;re adding that equity split can vary quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve founded many more companies than are listed on your website. Are some operating in stealth mode?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Unfortunately, with some of the success comes copycats. And some of our companies that we&#8217;ve launched, we&#8217;ve had people in other studios literally rip off everything down to the fonts, the copy, the photos, the ad units, the messages in the ads, the pricing, everything. So we kind of have to keep our companies stealth because otherwise people will just copy them early on.</p>
<p>Now that we have a large fund and we can fund the company long enough where it can kind of hopefully hit escape velocity, we would like to do that and then bring it out to market and make it more public once it&#8217;s really hard to copy and it&#8217;s really working and scaling. So we have a few dozen companies that we&#8217;ve started at this point of which maybe half are public and half are still in stealth and crossing that chasm period where they&#8217;re growing, they&#8217;re accelerating, but we just don&#8217;t want to run into those situations if we can avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>It seems like you are more involved with OpenStore than other companies. Why?</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235966" style="width: 2057px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235966" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235966 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg" alt="" width="2047" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2047px) 100vw, 2047px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235966" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dani Padgett</p></div></p>
<p>Keith [Rabois] and I have a great history. Keith was an investor in my first company, Milo. I&#8217;ve known him forever. I think the world of him, and I had this idea for OpenStore [because] there&#8217;s no liquidity for merchants that are creating e-commerce stores outside of Amazon. There are a lot of companies that are buying companies within Amazon. But if you&#8217;re a merchant on Shopify or any of these other players in the ecosystem, there tends to be no one who will acquire your company. You have to first cross a massive chasm and maybe get to $50 million in revenue before you get any offers like that.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this big liquidity gap in that market, and with OpenStore, we built a website that&#8217;s kind of like [the residential real estate company] Opendoor [which Rabois also co-founded] where you can [plug] in your house and get an offer. With OpenStore, you can [provide it] with your store, information on your store, [and] just your Shopify login, and we will underwrite your business and actually give you an offer that same day to sell your company. And we think it can totally change the game in that space. And Keith and I [share the vision] of how big OpenStore can become.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why I was more involved with that one is it was being built at my house, so I literally couldn&#8217;t escape it. It was in the downstairs area, and it was all hours of the day. Eventually, my girlfriend told me that had to stop [laughs], and we stopped that, but now we have our own office and the company&#8217;s doing great.</p>
<p><strong>Any Web3 type ideas percolating?</strong></p>
<p>I think Web3 is a massive opportunity … I think the thing you have to be a little bit careful about with Web3 is it&#8217;s one thing to be an investor in Web3 and it&#8217;s another thing to be a builder because the laws are kind of gray in the United States. And we always want to be careful around that. I think it&#8217;s a little bit easier to create a company with equity than create something in pure crypto. [So] we will be doing that more; it&#8217;s just a question of the degree of our going to do it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 17, 2021! The tech world was abuzz today with news that a crypto startup was buying the naming rights to a stadium that was previously named after an office supply company. You can read that as crypto getting mature or 2021 losing the plot. Regardless, we have lots to talk about! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/beginning-next-year-apple-will-mail-you-parts-and-tools-to-fix-your-iphone-and-mac-at-home/">Apple will now let you fix your own gadgets:</a> </strong>We’re surprised but stoked by news that Apple announced a “new program designed to let users perform common repairs on devices at home.” It’s called Self Service Repair, and, frankly, it’s a bit weird to digest such consumer-friendly news from a megacorp.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/waymo-via-expands-ups-partnership-to-include-autonomous-freight-with-class-8-trucks/"><strong>Waymo extrends freight partnership:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Given how lovely it would be to live in a world where cars would drive us instead of the other way around, I am paying close attention to self-driving news of all sorts. Today’s update that parcel-delivery concern UPS and Alphabet’s Waymo division are extending their partnership was therefore right up my alley.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/unicorns-braze-and-usertesting-begin-public-life-in-diverging-ways/"><strong>Braze, UserTesting go public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>There were <em>two</em> unicorn IPOs today. Braze, a customer engagement software company, and UserTesting, which does what it says on the tin. TechCrunch dug into their respective IPO prices and economics to celebrate. We also caught up with Braze’s CEO, but more on that later.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into <em>startup</em> news, let’s talk about some unicorns. Instacart’s growth rate is reportedly slowing, leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/are-rivals-snacking-on-instacarts-core-grocery-delivery-market/">TechCrunch wondering if its rivals are nibbling on its market share</a>. Instacart, worth tens of billions of dollars, is an obvious 2022 IPO candidate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236018" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/alltrails-raises-150m-after-covid-accelerates-peoples-interest-in-exploring-the-outdoors/"><strong>Tech company makes money on “outside:&#8221;</strong></a><strong> </strong>Depending on where you are in the world today, going outside might sound like a lark or like sheer drudgery. But no matter, because the business of helping people get outside is booming. AllTrails just banked $150 million for its work in helping walkers and bikers and hikers get out and, well, about.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/jiko-announces-partnership-to-a-launch-banking-app-for-the-transgender-community/"><strong>Niche neobanks continue to raise:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Building a neobank tuned for one part of the population or another is an increasingly popular activity. The gist is that building a basic banking service is not <em>that</em> hard in 2021, given the number of off-the-shelf parts. This means that we can have more &#8212; and more specific &#8212; digital banks. For example, Jiko is partnering with Euphoria, “a technology suite for the transgender community that helps alleviate the struggles associated with gender transition, to launch a banking app called Bliss.” I dig it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/with-new-tech-and-3-6m-seed-divigas-aims-to-clean-up-hydrogen-production/"><strong>DiviGas raises $3.6M to clean up hydrogen production:</strong></a><strong> </strong>With a new method of hydrogen diversion under its belt, DiviGas says that it has raised money to keep up with customer demand for its “hollow fiber polymeric membrane” technology. Keep an eye on this company in case it really has cracked a notable tech issue.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/in-game-creation-platform-overwolf-raises-75m-series-d-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/"><strong>Overwolf raises huge capital to help you make in-game content:</strong></a> If you play a game that has a serious modding community, you’re aware that not only big studios can make neat stuff for games. Regular folks can, too. Overwolf, which wants to help individuals make items for games, just raised $75 million for its work. The company’s round is a bet on gaming &#8212; and creators themselves.</li>

<p>E-commerce platform founders may be tempted to set transaction fees just a little higher than they initially planned, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/4-strategies-for-setting-marketplace-take-rates/">greed isn&#8217;t always good. </a></p>
<p>Boosting take rates by a point or two could boost early revenue when it&#8217;s needed most, but there&#8217;s an opportunity cost, since &#8220;a higher take rate typically leads to lower transaction volume,&#8221; according to angel investor and product manager Tanay Jaipuria.</p>
<p>Take rates should directly reflect the stage of your business, he advises, since platforms with higher rates see lower transaction volumes. To learn how different companies use this lever, Jaipura studied take rates for more than 25 marketplaces, including Apple, Shutterstock and OpenSea.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s important for founders to remember that maximizing the take rate of the platform is not the goal,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook, errr Meta, showed off a new prototype haptic feedback glove yesterday, which they detailed could eventually bring a new generation of AR/VR users closer than they&#8217;ve ever been to digital content. Today, a VR startup with that same mission called <a href="https://haptx.com/">HaptX</a> (which we&#8217;ve covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/haptx-grabs-12-million-to-build-a-glove-crammed-with-sensors/">here</a> before) released a fairly aggressive statement accusing Meta of showing off a prototype that was &#8220;substantively identical&#8221; to their own patented technology.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://haptx.com/meta-glove-prototype-response/">statement</a> from HaptX CEO Jake Rubin further detailed that his startup has shown off their technology over the years to &#8220;many engineers, researchers, and executives from Meta,&#8221; and that they were not consulted by the company on this latest project. &#8220;While we have not yet heard from Meta, we look forward to working with them to reach a fair and equitable arrangement that addresses our concerns and enables them to incorporate our innovative technology into their future consumer products,&#8221; Rubin notes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236117" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236117" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236117 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="624" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png 1628w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=1536,936 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236117" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HaptX</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236087" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.</p>
<p>Both HaptX and the recently unveiled Meta prototype use a technology called microfluidic feedback. While your phone or game controller have haptic feedback that uses small motors to simulate buzzing or rumbling, when it comes to simulating deeper sensations across a user&#8217;s entire hand, microfludic feedback behave differently using actuators that control airflow through a network of tubes in a way that can sophisticatedly mimic sensations associated with picking up objects or even feeling unique textures that are all rendered digitally.</p>
<p>Facebook has also showcased a number of AR/VR prototypes over the years showcasing complex technologies that often don&#8217;t end up making their way to the final products but test the cutting edge of a certain technology. HaptX has been building haptic-feedback gloves for enterprise clients for years miniaturizing the tech that has required a backpack-sized pneumatic box that helps manage the sensory feedback of the gloves. It&#8217;s still a very complicated technology that is probably many years of development away from reaching the same mainstream audience that Facebook, now Meta, has been pursuing with the Quest 2.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that Meta&#8217;s team has also made some substantial advances to the technology. In their <a href="https://tech.fb.com/inside-reality-labs-meet-the-team-thats-bringing-touch-to-the-digital-world/">research blog post</a>, Meta detailed that they had created &#8220;the world’s first high-speed microfluidic processor,&#8221; a chipset in the glove that controls these feedback controls. One of the company&#8217;s researchers detailed that his &#8220;goal is to invent soft, lightweight haptic gloves that address both sides of the AR/VR interaction problem — helping the computer to accurately understand and reflect the wearer’s hand movements, and reproducing a range of complex, nuanced sensations for the wearer such as pressure, texture, and vibration to create the effect of feeling a virtual object with your hands.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook has taken plenty of criticism over the years from startups who say their products were unfairly copied by the major tech giant. They have also garnered some major scrutiny from regulators who say they&#8217;ve engaged in anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full statement from HaptX&#8217;s Rubin:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last decade, HaptX has pioneered the field of microfluidic haptic feedback. Our award-winning technology has been widely covered in the popular and technology press, and we’ve worked tirelessly to develop and promote the unique benefits of microfluidics as an approach to high-fidelity haptic feedback. With the longstanding dedication of our engineers, developers, and investors, we have also secured an industry-leading patent portfolio to protect our technology and products.</p>
<p>In interacting with other companies in the VR industry, we have always believed that cooperation is paramount to the development of the industry as a whole. Over the years, we’ve hosted many engineers, researchers, and executives from Meta to demonstrate our groundbreaking haptic technology.</p>
<p>Today, Meta announced their own prototype microfluidic haptic feedback glove. The core components of this prototype, including the silicone-based microfluidic tactile feedback laminate and pneumatic control architecture, appear to be substantively identical to HaptX’s patented technology. We welcome interest and competition in the field of microfluidic haptics; however, competition must be fair for the industry to thrive.</p>
<p>While we have not yet heard from Meta, we look forward to working with them to reach a fair and equitable arrangement that addresses our concerns and enables them to incorporate our innovative technology into their future consumer products.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce and other online businesses are becoming increasingly global in their operations and customer bases, and a startup called <a href="https://www.airwallex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airwallex</a> &#8212; which has built a banking solution that addresses the opportunity to provide cross-border financial services &#8212; has been seeing a massive surge of activity. To capitalize further on that opportunity, today the company is announcing growth funding.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Melbourne-based Airwallex has raised $100 million, capital that it will be using to continue building out its banking and payments businesses into more markets, and to invest expanding its products.</p>
<p>The funding &#8212; which is being led by Lone Pine Capital and joined by 1835i Ventures (the venture arm of <a href="https://www.anz.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANZ</a>, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group) and Sequoia Capital China, all previous investors &#8212; is an extension to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/airwallex-raises-200m-at-a-4b-valuation-to-double-down-on-business-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s Series E that it announced only in September</a>; and it brings the total of the round to $300 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235602" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The valuation is also being extended with this latest injection: Airwallex is now worth $5.5 billion (compared to $4 billion in September). From what we understand, the company was getting term sheets as high as $7 billion from outside investors (that outside interest was what prompted the round in the first place).</p>
<p>Airwallex today has around 20,000 customers spanning areas like e-commerce, tech/SaaS companies and professional services. It also has 500 large platform customers (Papaya Global and GOAT are two examples) that have embedded Airwallex&#8217;s services within their own services to power transactions for their own customers.</p>
<p>That business has seen a big boost of activity as a result of a few key developments in the world.</p>
<p>For starters, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a big shift toward more e-commerce among both consumers and businesses. In turn, businesses have needed to extend their financial infrastructure to accommodate more customers. And because e-commerce has broken down the barriers of where you can do business, they&#8217;ve also had to extend their financial reach to touch customers in ever-wider geographies. COVID-19 has also massively disrupted supply chains, so businesses have also had to become more enterprising in how they manage these: They may now have to work with more partners and potentially be agile enough to pay different people month-to-month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of these present the kinds of use cases that speak to the kinds of services that Airwallex offers. Jack Zhang, Airwallex&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said that revenues at the company grew 100% in Q3 over Q2. Its annualized revenues in that most recent quarter were $100 million. &#8220;We had a target to achieve that at the end of the year, but we delivered it a quarter earlier,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It also means a number of other companies are also looking to serve this need: competitors to Airwallex across its different services include Stripe, PayPal, Revolut (via Revolut Business) and more.</p>
<p>Airwallex built its company originally around business banking &#8212; its thesis was that companies had a lot of banking options when it came to doing business in their own markets, but for those who worked across borders, it offered domestic and international accounts that worked as easily as domestic ones, along with card issuing, transfers and foreign exchange, payouts and so on. More recently, the company has moved into payments to complement that. The plan will be to add more services natively to that stack, as well as integrate with third-party providers by way of an app store that it is now developing. That will launch potentially next year.</p>
<p>Zhang also said some of the funds will be used for M&amp;A, as part of the inevitable consolidation that we&#8217;re going to continue seeing in fintech.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve now raised $800 million in the last 6 years, with $600 million in the last two years, and we still have $600 million in the bank right now,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;A very large part of that is going to be used for M&amp;A purposes.&#8221; Features that Airwallex wants to have as a native part of its stack it might buy instead of building itself include subscription payments; software to automatically calculate stamp duty depending on the market where items are being sold; and more data analytics to help customers analyze their revenues better. &#8220;I think there will be consolidation in the next period. But it won&#8217;t be just two players. The [fintech] space is big enough for a dozen winners.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it looks like Airwallex is setting itself up to be one of those winners. Zhang confirmed to me that Stripe &#8212; which today is a key competitor of Airwallex&#8217;s &#8212; approached the company to acquire it around 2018/2019, when Airwallex was significantly smaller but already developing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/03/airwallex-raises-80m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong presence</a> in Asia Pacific, which is still its biggest market, even as Airwallex moves deeper EMEA and North America. (It would have been a big step for Stripe into the region, which has instead taken on its own steam.)</p>
<p>Zhang said that another big fintech, currently valued at around $20 billion, also approached Airwallex more recently. Nothing has come of that, either &#8212; partly because Airwallex is now too expensive, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are probably too big for others to buy us,&#8221; Zhang added.</p>
<p>As for what is coming next on the liquidity front, an IPO &#8220;is not on the agenda,&#8221; but is something that the company will think about potentially for 2023 or 2024.</p>
<p>“Airwallex’s achievements in the last quarter alone showcase the strength of the company’s business model and its unique ability to meet their customers’ evolving needs in a competitive digital payments market,” said David Craver, co-chief investment office at Lone Pine Capital. “The future is bright for Airwallex, and we look forward to helping its team unlock greater growth opportunities.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I run operations at an early-stage startup, and I’ve been tasked with hiring and other HR responsibilities. </strong><strong>I’m feeling out of my depth with hiring and trying to figure out visa issues for prospective hires. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any advice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Doubling Down in Daly City</strong></p>
<p>Dear Doubling,</p>
<p>I hear a lot from people like you who are in the same situation at early-stage startups. This came up when I chatted recently with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-teter-sphr-1757623/">Erin Teter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lydia-buurma-00693a47/">Lydia Buurma</a> for my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/">podcast</a>. Teter and Buurma are experienced HR professionals who I’ve known for years. They’re currently working in HR at <a href="https://www.linq.com/">LINQ</a>, an edtech company that provides cloud-based administration and finance solutions for states, districts and schools.</p>
<p>“HR is a full-time job,” Buurma said. “When you talk about creating company culture, setting the company’s mission and values, you want to include people in that discussion and you want to get buy-in from core employees and figure out what characteristics future employees that you want to bring in should have.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>The next best option</h2>
<p>If your startup cannot afford to bring on a full-time HR person right now, Teter recommends that your company at least bring in an HR consultant to help evaluate your company’s situation, set up practices and assist with issues.</p>
<p>“Usually consultants are connected with immigration attorneys and other experts who can help you work through the process,” she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Waldo, a photo-sharing platform that has historically targeted businesses, schools, camps, sports leagues and other organizations, is capitalizing on the growing anti-Facebook sentiment to promote its newly launched consumer product.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://waldophotos.com/">Waldo</a>, a photo-sharing platform that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/21/waldo-raises-5-million-for-a-photo-finding-platform-targeting-professional-photographers-events/">historically</a> targeted businesses, schools, camps, sports leagues and other organizations, is capitalizing on the growing anti-Facebook sentiment to promote its newly launched consumer product. The company today is introducing a service aimed at private photo-sharing among family and friends, which it&#8217;s promoting as an &#8220;ad-free, non-toxic&#8221; and private alternative to mainstream social sites, like Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s just Waldo&#8217;s marketing. Consumers, arguably, already <em>have</em> private, ad-free photo-sharing alternatives outside social media. They can create invite-only photo albums on platforms like Google Photos or share privately via Apple&#8217;s iCloud. They can send photos through encrypted mobile messaging apps. Still, Waldo believes there&#8217;s room for a standalone app that&#8217;s available cross-platform and offers a differentiated feature set.</p>
<p>The Waldo app is available on iOS, Android and the web and includes a wireless DSLR uploading feature aimed at photo enthusiasts. Consumers who want to use the service for private sharing can create galleries for their events and then invite people they want to share those photos with. As others join the shared galleries, they can opt in to have Waldo send alerts about any photos they&#8217;re in through push notifications or text alerts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The app also offers closed-loop commenting and reactions that allow the photo owner and the commenter to have a private interaction not seen by anyone else in the album.</p>
<p>The new consumer <a href="https://waldophotos.com/pricing/">plans</a> are offered as either a Plus or Premium subscription at $4.99/mo or $9.99/mo, respectively. The former supports up to five family members and the latter up to 10, with unlimited invites and contributors. Plus also includes 100 GB of storage while Premium offers 200 GB.</p>
<p>These are more expensive plans than offered by Big Tech rivals, however. For comparison, a Google One Basic storage <a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans">plan</a> of 100 GB, which includes photos and files, is $1.99/mo, and 200 GB is $2.99/mo.<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238"> iCloud+</a> is $0.99/mo for 50 GB in the U.S. or $2.99/mo for 200 GB. So Waldo will really need to sell consumers on its feature set of facial recognition-powered smart notifications, private reactions and custom print options.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VXDwVXt0qg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Waldo plans to build on its existing partnerships with professional industries, like camps, schools and churches that use Waldo as a tool to share photos privately with parents and others.</p>
<p>Over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/21/waldo-raises-5-million-for-a-photo-finding-platform-targeting-professional-photographers-events/">past five years</a>, Waldo has slowly grown its footprint outside of the consumer space. Today, it has &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers, including a combination of families and employees of the K-12 institutions and businesses its app serves. Its business customers can use the app&#8217;s facial recognition features (with parents&#8217; permission) to automatically identify and tag their students, campers, event-goers and other attendees. That way, parents don&#8217;t have to look through the hundreds of photos the organization may snap in order to find just those that feature their own child or children.</p>
<p>This paid subscription-based service has been adopted by groups across the U.S. and Canada, but Waldo doesn&#8217;t disclose its revenue.</p>
<p>Waldo tells us the plan is not to pivot from its existing B2B offering, but instead expand to a new group of users.</p>
<p>Because parents and others may already have Waldo installed on their phones, the company sees the potential in shifting them over to its consumer photo-sharing service. And the recipients of the shared photos don&#8217;t necessarily have to download the app to join in &#8212; the service can be used without an app installed from the web browser on any device.</p>
<p>As a user of Waldo through my own child&#8217;s camp, this transition makes sense. Instead of downloading Waldo&#8217;s shared photos to my phone only to then turn around and re-share them with grandparents through another platform, I could see how it may be easier to just join Waldo&#8217;s consumer subscription plan and push a &#8220;camp photos&#8221; albums to a few family members.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to provide our communities with our Waldo Pro solution as it is an important value-add for our families who seek to have all of their family&#8217;s photos, irrespective of who took them, in a single cloud-based, mobile-friendly location, and a huge benefit to our communities who benefit from a safer photo-sharing platform,&#8221; Waldo CEO Rodney Rice told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The launch of Waldo Plus and Premium represents our opening up the platform from only being accessible as a member of one of our &#8216;Waldo-fied&#8217; communities to every consumer being able to use the platform for everyday sharing and all the events in their lives,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A weird thing has happened in the past two years. After years of decline, <a href="https://www.mic.org/#/newsArticle">motorcycle and scooter sales</a> have bounced back. That&#8217;s good news for BMW&#8217;s Motorrad division and its latest electric scooter, the CE 04.</p>
<p>The two-wheel retro-futuristic bike, which was showcased in Los Angeles this week at an event ahead of the LA Auto Show, will be riding a wave of two-wheeled renaissance, which could help usher in larger acceptance of electric scooters.</p>
<p>BMW Motorrad of America&#8217;s vice president Trudy Hardy believes that the two-wheeled EV could come into its own as more than just a cool-looking bike. &#8220;I think what&#8217;s interesting about having a scooter in this category is I think it will start to solve some transportation challenges.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236017" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Set to arrive in showrooms in early 2022, the CE 04 will start at $11,795. Like all things BMW, it carries a premium price tag. Yet, for the feature set and the fact that it&#8217;s electric, it might actually be a solid deal.</p>
<p>The scooter will seat two, has 42 horsepower and an impressive 45 pound-feet of torque. The 8.9-kWh capacity battery pack is targeted to offer 80 miles of range and it supports level 2 charging up to 6.9 kW.</p>
<p>Plus it has that large 10.25-inch TFT display that when paired with the BMW Motorrad app offers up turn-by-turn navigation and can track rider data, like how far over you&#8217;ve leaned in corners, as well as the typical motorcycle information.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236032" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236032" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2236032 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg" alt="BMW CE 04 electric scooter" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2236032" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roberto Baldwin</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s an electric scooter in a world where the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/harley-davidson-spins-out-livewire-into-a-standalone-electric-motorcycle-brand/">Harley-Davidson Livewire</a> exists and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zeros-fxe-offers-electric-motorcycle-fun-in-a-slightly-new-package/">Zero Motorcycle</a> continues to thrive.</p>
<p>Hardy believes that for BMW this is a smart strategy, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to bring new people into the brand that might not have considered a motorcycle, but are going to find this to be a friendly solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bike maker&#8217;s first foray into the U.S. market with electricity was the C-Evolution. It was essentially a pilot program. &#8220;It was really to test the waters a little bit. This is our first endeavor really going into the electrification market,&#8221; Hardy told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Although Hardy is nervous that people tend to generalize scooters as something less than what they are. New customers also mean those new to motorcycles and scooters in general. There will likely be customers that currently ride electric bicycles that step up to an electric scooter like the CE 04 and not quite understand that it&#8217;s more powerful than it looks. It&#8217;s easy to dismiss scooters and see something that&#8217;s underpowered, but the reality is the EV torque that makes electric cars so exhilarating is also here on this scooter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a toy. Fortunately, BMW Motorrad&#8217;s entire lineup comes standard with anti-lock brakes and other safety features.</p>
<p>For new and experienced riders, the CE 04 is offering something a bit new. A compact but spirited EV two-wheeler that could be the answer to city commutes. Hardy sees it as part of an ongoing move by the company as a whole. &#8220;BMW has always been known for the performance side and the technology side and it&#8217;s nice that we&#8217;re now entering that electrified space from four wheels to two wheels, which is great.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also helps that more and more people in the United States are buying new bikes and EVs. That combination might be a win for the funky CE 04.</p>

<p>The first all-electric subcompact crossover is a joint project, like the Subaru BR-Z and the Toyota 86 (formerly the Scion FR-S) was before it, and the crossover is a close sibling, almost twin-like, to the Toyota bZ4X crossover that was announced in April.</p>
<p>The upshot: The Solterra is targeting Americans&#8217; insatiable appetite for crossover and it gives Subaru a foothold in the EV market, with Toyota&#8217;s help.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235913" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The last two years have been very good to Subaru, even with chip shortages crimping the supply chain. The automaker has reported record sales in the U.S.</p>

<p>Known for its all-wheel-drive vehicles, the midsize Forester has been a segment leader in terms of volume, though the company reported that the compact Crosstrek, was the best seller for October of 2021 (by volume). Subaru has said that dealers are having a hard time keeping the more off-road-oriented Wilderness variants of the Outback and Forester on dealer lots, with markups as high as $5,000 above sticker.</p>
<p>Toyota owns 20% of Subaru as of September of 2019, but their partnership goes back to 2005 when GM ended the relationship it had with Subaru. The Toyota-Subaru partnership has been a boon for both companies, as Subaru brings expertise in all-wheel-drive systems to the table while Toyota brings its hybrid and electric powertrains to the smaller automaker. Both Japanese companies tend to be more conservative and considered when pushing into new territory, but the Solterra offers an interesting look into what Subaru thinks the future of electric crossovers with off-road features may look like.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>A shared platform with all-wheel drive</h2>
<p>The Solterra is another joint project that Subaru has done alongside Toyota, which means that some of the design, especially the interior bits, look a lot like Toyota, while the exterior, chassis and the all-wheel-drive system is all Subaru. Toyota also handled the battery sourcing.</p>
<p>That battery is a 71.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack slung low between the axles and paired to two electric motors, one at the front and one at the rear. Subaru estimates the range to be around 220-plus miles and says that the Solterra can be charged from 0-80% in just about 30 minutes using DC fast chargers.</p>
<p>The powertrain makes 250 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque &#8212; much of which is readily available at the low end, potentially making the Solterra a decent soft-roader.</p>

<p>At an offsite unveiling last week, the electric-ute climbed up and over a small rocky path and through a shallow pond before stopping in front of the gathered press for photos, showing off its light off-road prowess.</p>
<p>While this marks Subaru&#8217;s first foray into the EV market, the Solterra will carry Subaru&#8217;s trademark symmetrical all-wheel-drive system, complete with Subaru&#8217;s X-Mode, which offers better traction in low-friction situations. When one wheel is in the air, the system will modulate the brakes to get you up and over the obstacle, according to Subaru, making this a moderately off-roadable EV. The 8.3-inches of ground clearance doesn&#8217;t hurt either, and Subaru made a point at the LA Auto Show unveiling to note that it is better than the VW ID 4 and Tesla model Y.</p>
<p>At last week&#8217;s event, Subaru also ran footage of Solterra testing on off-road obstacles like stairs, and offset ramps, to show just how capable the small-ute could be. It even pitted it against competitors like the Jaguar I-Pace on the same obstacles.</p>
<p>While pricing has yet to be officially announced, Subaru says that buyers can expect it to start around $39,000. Subaru will start selling the 2023 Solterra in mid-2022.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Instacart's growth rate is plateauing. What's going on?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few companies had as good a pandemic run as Instacart. The company&#8217;s service saw huge demand gains, leading to waves of venture capital interest.</p>

<hr />
<p>From a late 2018 funding cycle that valued the U.S. grocery delivery company at around $7.9 billion, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">per PitchBook data</a>, Instacart went on to raise $325 million at a $13.8 billion valuation in July 2020. The pandemic sent many folks home &#8212; and to their phones to order foodstuffs &#8212; to Instacart&#8217;s benefit.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But that was just the start. PitchBook indicates that Instacart raised again in October 2020, adding $200 million more to its accounts at a $17.7 billion valuation. And then in March 2021, Instacart raised a further $265 million at a valuation of around $39 billion. (You can cross-check the PitchBook data <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instacart/company_financials">with Crunchbase here</a>, if you&#8217;d like.)</p>
<p>Few startups reach the $1 billion valuation threshold. Far fewer make it to the $5 billion mark before going public. And only a true handful get to $10 billion or more. A nearly $40 billion pre-money valuation is stupendous, and puts immense pressure on the company to generate the sort of numbers that public-market investors will expect from a richly valued tech company.</p>
<p>But it turns out that Instacart is seeing its growth rate plateau in 2021, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instacart-pushes-off-public-offering-to-focus-on-grocery-services-growth">per reporting at The Information</a>. What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<h2>Instacart&#8217;s growth</h2>
<p>The Information&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/berber_jin1">Berber Jin</a> reports that after Instacart tripled its revenues to $1.5 billion in 2020 when compared to 2019, its growth rate has moderated to around a 10% rate this year. Though, she adds, the company&#8217;s Q3 revenue growth was doing better, up around 20% on a year-over-year basis. <em>[<strong>Update:</strong> This paragraph updated to reflect the correct author of The Information&#8217;s piece.]</em></p>
<p>The Exchange reached out to the company about the various data points, but it declined to comment on the record.</p>
<p>After reading Clark&#8217;s piece, I decided to collect information from the company&#8217;s various competitors. Let&#8217;s talk about Amazon, Walmart, DoorDash and Uber, companies that may be snacking on Instacart&#8217;s core business.</p>
