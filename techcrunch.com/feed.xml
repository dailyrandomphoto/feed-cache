										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FAA today announced that it will be issuing <a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=25541">two new rules</a> for drone pilots in the U.S. The first is the implementation of a long-awaited Remote ID. The system effectively works as a kind of digital license plate for unmanned aircraft, broadcasting identifying details, including the location of the craft.</p>
<p>The full text of the finalized new rule can<a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/media/attachments/RemoteID_Final_Rule.pdf"> be found here</a>. In short, drone operators will have one of three methods for complying:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Operate a standard Remote ID drone that broadcasts identification and location information of the drone and control station;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>2. Operate a drone with a Remote ID broadcast module (may be a separate device attached to the drone), which broadcasts identification, location, and take-off information; or</p>
<p>3. Operate a drone without Remote ID but at specific FAA-recognized identification areas.</p></blockquote>
<p>While some drone operators are likely to be put off by additional regulation, its arrival is understandable given the sheer volume and speed of drone adoption. The FAA says that more than 1.7 million drones have been registered in the U.S., along with around 203,000 certifications for drone pilots. Those numbers will likely only snowball as more drones are deployed for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Notably, the FAA sees the new rules as a method for accelerating drone deliveries in the U.S. “The new rules make way for the further integration of drones into our airspace by addressing safety and security concerns,” FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said in a release tied to the news. “They get us closer to the day when we will more routinely see drone operations such as the delivery of packages.”</p>
<p>Also new is the “Operations Over People and at Night” rule, which, as the name implies, regulates both the ability to fly over people and fly at night. The rule features a number of different qualifications for compliance, including weighing less than 0.55 pounds to fly overhead.</p>
<p>According to the rule, “small unmanned aircraft must not cause injury to a human being that is equivalent to or greater than the severity of injury caused by a transfer of 25 foot-pounds of kinetic energy upon impact from a rigid object, does not contain any exposed rotating parts that could lacerate human skin upon impact with a human being, and does not contain any safety defects.”</p>
<p>In order to fly at night, drones need to sport operational anti-collision lights that can been see for three miles. The rules are set to be officially published next month, officially becoming effective 60 days later. Drone makers will have a year and a half to begin adding Remote ID to their devices. In August, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/amazons-prime-air-drone-delivery-fleet-gains-faa-approval-for-trial-commercial-flights/">FAA granted Amazon permission</a> for delivery trials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Pokémon GO was created to encourage players to explore the world while coordinating impromptu large group gatherings — activities we&#8217;ve all been encouraged to avoid since the pandemic began.</span></p>
<p>And yet, analysts estimate that 2020 was <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pokemon-go-one-billion-revenue-2020">Pokémon GO&#8217;s highest-earning year yet</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			By twisting some knobs and tweaking variables, Pokémon GO became much easier to play without leaving the house.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nianticlabs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nianticlabs">Niantic&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> approach to 2020 was full of carefully considered changes, and I&#8217;ve highlighted many of their key decisions below.</p>
<p>Consider this something of an addendum to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/">the Niantic EC-1</a> I wrote last year, where I outlined things like the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/how-a-google-side-project-evolved-into-a-4b-company/">beginnings as a side project within Google</a>, how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/01/pokemon-go-and-the-april-fools-joke-that-made-billions/">Pokémon Go began as an April Fools&#8217; joke</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/12/harry-potter-the-platform-and-the-future-of-niantic/">the company&#8217;s aim to build the platform that powers the AR headsets of the future</a>.</p>
<h2>Hit the brakes</h2>
<p>On a press call outlining an update <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nianticlabs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nianticlabs">Niantic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> shipped in November, the company put it on no uncertain terms: the roadmap they&#8217;d followed over the last ten-or-so months was <em>not</em> the one they started the year with. Their original roadmap included a handful of new features that have yet to see the light of day. They declined to say what those features <em>were</em> of course (presumably because they still hope to launch them once the world is less broken) — but they just didn&#8217;t make sense to release right now.</p>
<p>Instead, as any potential end date for the pandemic slipped further into the horizon, the team refocused in Q1 2020 on figuring out ways to adapt what already worked and adjust existing gameplay to let players do more while going out less.</p>
<h2>Turning the dials</h2>
<p>As its name indicates, GO was never meant to be played while sitting at home. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/john-hanke" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="john-hanke">John Hanke&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> initial vision for Niantic was focused around finding ways to get people outside and playing together; from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/how-a-google-side-project-evolved-into-a-4b-company/">its very first prototype</a>, Niantic had players running around a city to take over its virtual equivalent block by block. They&#8217;d spent nearly a decade building up a database of real-world locations that would act as in-game points meant to encourage exploration and wandering. Years of development effort went into turning Pokémon GO into more and more of a social game, requiring teamwork and sometimes even flash mob-like meetups for its biggest challenges.</p>
<p>Now it all needed to work from the player&#8217;s couch.</p>
<p>The earliest changes were those that were easiest for Niantic to make on-the-fly, but they had dramatic impacts on the way the game actually works.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Doubling the players &#8220;radius&#8221; for interacting with in-game gyms, landmarks that players can temporarily take over for their in-game team, earning occupants a bit of in-game currency based on how long they maintain control. This change let more gym battles happen from the couch.</li>
<li>Increasing spawn points, generally upping the number of Pokémon you could find at home dramatically.</li>
<li>Increasing &#8220;incense&#8221; effectiveness, which allowed players to use a premium item to encourage even <em>more</em> Pokémon to pop up at home. Niantic phased this change out in October, then quietly reintroduced it in late November. Incense would also last twice as long, making it cheaper for players to use.</li>
<li>Allowing steps taken indoors (read: on treadmills) to count toward in-game distance challenges.</li>
<li>Players would no longer need to walk long distances to earn entry into the online player-versus-player battle system.</li>
<li>Your &#8220;buddy&#8221; Pokémon (a specially designated Pokémon that you can level up Tamagotchi-style for bonus perks) would now bring you more gifts of items you&#8217;d need to play. Pre-pandemic, getting these items meant wandering to the nearby &#8220;Pokéstop&#8221; landmarks.</li>
</ul>
<p>By twisting some knobs and tweaking variables, Pokémon GO became much easier to play without leaving the house — but, importantly, these changes avoided anything that might break the game while being just as easy to reverse once it became safe to do so.</p>
<h2>GO Fest goes virtual</h2>

<p>Thrown by Niantic every year since 2017, GO Fest is meant to be an ultra-concentrated version of the Pokémon GO experience. Thousands of players cram into one park, coming together to tackle challenges and capture previously unreleased Pokémon.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For obvious reasons, many of us are spending the final week of 2020 looking forward. Samsung is hoping some folks are looking far enough ahead to reserve a spot in line for its still-unannounced Galaxy S21 handset (not an official name, mind, but probably a safe guess).</p>
<p>If you’re on the Samsung Mobile mailing list, you may well have received an email, compelling you to <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/">“Get ready to jump to the next Galaxy.”</a> The link takes you to a reservation page that offers up some perks for getting in early on the company’s new flagship, including credits on other Samsung products like Galaxy earbuds.</p>
<p>The company recently noted that it would have more information in January — be it at CES or, more likely, a standalone event. That bucks trends a bit, which have found the company introducing its latest Galaxy S devices closer to Mobile World Congress (the S20 &#8212; pictured above &#8212; was announced February 11). Of course, MWC has been delayed until late June next year and nothing is really normal besides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/not-even-5g-could-rescue-smartphone-sales-in-2020/">noted in a recent piece</a>, 2020 was the roughest in a series of rough years for the smartphone industry, so why not get those pre-orders started a little early? And hey, not everyone got what they wanted for the holiday. Why not treat yourself to a new phone?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2091032" style="width: 670px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2091032" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2091032" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-1608931833-1-12.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="381" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-1608931833-1-12.jpg 660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-1608931833-1-12.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-1608931833-1-12.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Samsung-Galaxy-S21-1608931833-1-12.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2091032" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Winfuture</p></div></p>
<p>The good news is we know a lot about the unannounced phone. Samsung’s never been great at keeping things under wraps and we’re already starting to see some key details leaking out a few weeks ahead of the expected official unveil. Surprisingly, camera specs look to more or less be in line with the last model, after the company promised some big imaging strides in 2021. Perhaps those updates will arrive more in the form of software, instead of straight hardware bumps.</p>
<p><a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html">Specs from Winfuture</a> point to — naturally — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/qualcomms-snapdragon-888-will-land-on-phones-in-q1-2021/">the Snapdragon 888</a> in the U.S., with the Exynos 2100 chip in other locales. The S21 sports a 6.2-inch display and 4000 mAh battery, where as the Plus upgrades things to 6.7 inches and 4,800 mAh, per the leak.</p>
<p>Samsung is expected to make everything official on January 14.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen Group has developed a mobile electric vehicle charger that can autonomously navigate parking areas, power up an EV and then make its way back to its outpost without the intervention of humans.</p>
<p>The prototype, which VW Group Components created, aims to showcase how the automaker will expand charging infrastructure over the next few years to meet the expected demand that will arise as it produces and sells more electric vehicles. VW Group has committed to launching dozens of electric models over the next decade. The group&#8217;s Volkswagen brand plans to build and sell 1.5 million electric cars by 2025.</p>
<p>&#8220;Setting up an efficient charging infrastructure for the future is a central task that challenges the entire sector,&#8221; Volkswagen Group Components CEO Thomas Schmall said in a statement. &#8220;We are developing solutions to help avoid costly stand-alone measures. The mobile charging robot and our flexible quick-charging station are just two of these solutions.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>VW Group is developing a portfolio of different DC charging products, including a DC wallbox that charges up to 22 kilowatts. The automaker began piloting its DC wallbox earlier this month at some of its production sites in Germany. VW Group is also planning to launch a flexible — yet still more stationary — quick-charging station in early 2021.</p>
<p>The mobile charging robot doesn&#8217;t have a release date. The company said now that it has reached prototype status it will be &#8220;comprehensively further developed.&#8221; There is one caveat for the mobile charger. VW said that car-to-X communication, which allows a vehicle to &#8220;talk&#8221; to infrastructure, will be one prerequisite for the mobile charger to reach market maturity.</p>
<p>The charging robot prototype can be started via an app launched by the vehicle owner or car-to-x communication. Once the communication begins, the mobile charger turns on — two digital eyes open on the display — and it steers toward a vehicle. The mobile charger opens the charging socket flap as well as connects or disconnects the plug. The mobile charger is also able to move and then connect the vehicle to an energy storage unit. Once the charging is complete, the robot collects the mobile energy storage unit and takes it back to a central charging station.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global investors are running from Chinese tech stocks in the wake of the government&#8217;s crackdown on Ant Group and Alibaba, two high-flying businesses founded by Ma Yun (Jack Ma) that were once hailed as paragons of China&#8217;s new tech elite.</p>
<p>Shares of major technology companies in the country have fallen sharply in recent days, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-28/alibaba-hikes-share-buyback-plan-to-10-billion-from-6-billion?sref=gni836kR">with Bloomberg calculating</a> that Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com and Meituan have lost around $200 billion in value during a handful of trading sessions.</p>
<p>Already reeling from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">last-minute halt</a> of the public debut of Ant Group, a major Chinese fintech player with deep ties to Alibaba, the e-commerce giant came under new fire, as China&#8217;s markets watchdog <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">opened a probe</a> into its business practices concerning potentially anticompetitive behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ant Group was itself summoned by the government on December 26, leading to a plan that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">will force the company to &#8220;rectify&#8221; its business practices</a>.</p>
<p>Shares of Alibaba are off around 30% from their recent record highs set in late October. Tech shares are also off in the country more broadly, with one <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CQQQ/">Chinese-technology-focused ETC</a> falling around 8% from recent highs, including a 1.5% drop today.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="SHBfpDBPjn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">China postpones Ant&#8217;s colossal IPO after closed-door talk with Jack Ma</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China postpones Ant&#8217;s colossal IPO after closed-door talk with Jack Ma&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/embed/#?secret=SHBfpDBPjn" data-secret="SHBfpDBPjn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The American Depositary Receipts used by traders to invest in Alibaba fell from around $256 per share at the close of Wednesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange to around $222 last Thursday. The company is down another half point today. It was worth more than $319 per share earlier in the quarter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that the rising tensions between China&#8217;s tech giants and the country&#8217;s ruling Communist Party have investors spooked. But Jack Ma&#8217;s relationship with the Chinese government <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-president-xi-jinping-halted-jack-ma-ant-ipo-11605203556">has always been a bit more fraught</a> than that of his peers. Ma Huateng (Pony Ma), the founder of Tencent, and Xu Yong (Eric Yong) and Li Yanhong (Robin Li), the co-founders of Baidu, have kept lower profiles than the Alibaba founder.</p>
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-13/dissecting-china-s-crackdown-on-its-internet-giants-quicktake?sref=AwwRcx4b">has a good synopsis of the state of the market right now</a>. The companies that are most directly in the crosshairs appear to be Ma Yun&#8217;s, but at different times, Tencent has been the focus of Chinese regulators bent on curbing the company&#8217;s influence through gaming.</p>
<p>Specifically for Alibaba things have gone from bad to worse, and a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-28/alibaba-hikes-share-buyback-plan-to-10-billion-from-6-billion?sref=gni836kR">boosted share buyback program</a> was not enough to halt the bleeding.</p>

<p>Whether this new round of regulations is a solitary blip on the radar or the signal of an increasing interest in Beijing tying tech companies closer to national interests remains to be seen. As the tit-for-tat tech conflict between the U.S. and China continues, many companies that had seen their growth as apolitical may become caught in the diplomatic crossfire.</p>
<p>Other tech companies are seeing their fortunes rise, boosted by newfound interest from the central government in Beijing.</p>
<p>This is already apparent in the chip industry, where <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/technology/china-semiconductors.html">China&#8217;s push for self-reliance has brought new riches and capital for new businesses</a>. It&#8217;s true for Liu FengFeng, whose company, Tsinghon, was able to raise $5 million for its attempt at building a new semiconductor manufacturer in the country. Intellifusion, a manufacturer of chipsets focused on machine learning applications, <a href="https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2020/04/03/chinese-ai-chip-maker-intellifusion-completes-141m-pre-ipo-round">was able to raise another $141 million back in April</a>.</p>
<p>Private investors may be less enthused at the prospect of backing Chinese tech upstarts who could face government censure should the regulatory winds shift. Whether other startup markets in the region &#8212; India, Japan, among others &#8212; will benefit from the Chinese regulatory barrage will be interesting to track in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government is appealing the ruling that blocked the Trump administration&#8217;s TikTok ban, according to a new court filing. On December 7, 2020, U.S. District Court Judge Carl Nichols in Washington <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/second-federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administrations-tiktok-ban/">became the second U.S. judge to block</a> the Commerce Department&#8217;s attempt to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat/">stop the TikTok app</a> from being downloaded from U.S. app stores, citing threats to national security.</p>
<p>The Trump administration had raised concerns over the videosharing app due to its Chinese ownership by way of parent company ByteDance and the potential risk of TikTok&#8217;s U.S. user data being accessed by the Chinese government. This ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/tiktok-timeline/">resulted</a> in President Trump&#8217;s decision to use his executive order power to ban TikTok from the U.S. market.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Second federal judge rules against Trump administration&#8217;s TikTok ban&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/second-federal-judge-rules-against-trump-administrations-tiktok-ban/embed/#?secret=zmt4hnb39K" data-secret="zmt4hnb39K" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TikTok, in response, had vowed to fight the order in court while it also entered negotiations with American companies over the potential sell-off of its U.S. operations, in case the order was upheld.</p>
<p>However, prior to the Dec. 7 ruling on the matter, a group of TikTok creators<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/tiktok-stars-got-a-judge-to-block-trumps-tiktok-ban/"> successfully challenged the ban</a>, when U.S. Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Pennsylvania issued an injunction that blocked the restrictions that would have otherwise stopped TikTok from operating in the U.S. The creators said the ban would have caused them to lose their income by way of their brand sponsorships and other opportunities afforded by the platform.</p>
<p>Following that order, Judge Nichols in the separate case led by TikTok ruled that Trump overstepped his authority in trying to ban the app from the U.S., referring to the agency&#8217;s action as &#8220;arbitrary and capricious.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. Commerce Dept. spokesperson said at the time of the ruling it would continue to comply with the injunctions but intended to &#8220;vigorously defend the [executive order] and the Secretary’s implementation efforts from legal challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, it has followed through on that statement with its appeal.</p>
<p>Of course, the decision as to whether the U.S. will continue its attempt to ban TikTok will ultimately reside with the incoming Biden administration.</p>
<p>The news of today&#8217;s filing was first reported by <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-tiktok/us-government-appeals-judges-order-blocking-tiktok-restrictions-idINW1N2H604B">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok declined to comment on the appeal.</p>
<p>A Commerce Dept. spokesperson issued the following statement (12/28/20, 1:14 PM ET):</p>
<blockquote><p>On December 7, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against the enforcement of Executive Order (E.O.) 13942, limited to the Secretary of Commerce’s Identification of Prohibited Transactions with TikTok/ByteDance. The court’s ruling is consistent with the nationwide preliminary injunction granted by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on October 30, 2020. The Department maintains that the E.O. is fully consistent with law and promotes legitimate national security interests. The Government will continue to comply with the injunctions and has taken immediate steps to do so, but intends to vigorously defend the E.O. and the Secretary’s implementation efforts from legal challenges.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When kids today want to learn about a new topic they&#8217;re interested in, they&#8217;ll often turn to YouTube. But the quality of the educational content on the platform can be hit or miss, depending on what specific videos kids happen to come across. <a href="https://www.tappityapp.com/">Tappity</a>, a digital educational startup now backed by $1.3 million in seed funding, aims to offer an alternative. Its video library offers entertaining and interactive live-action videos kids enjoy, while also ensuring the content itself is aligned with current educational standards.</p>
<p>The two-year old startup was co-founded by CEO Chad Swenson, his brother and CTO Tanner Swenson, and CPO Lawrence Tran.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090929" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090929" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2090929" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="227" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg 2067w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=768,256 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=680,227 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=1536,512 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=2048,683 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-founders.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090929" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tappity founders</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As Chad explains, the idea for Tappity emerged from his interest in designing interactive learning experiences, which resulted in a senior project eight years ago where he created an interactive experience to help students learn about evolution. Over the years that followed, he began to experiment with different concepts in this area, but never planned for anything of venture scale.</p>
<p>However, Chad says he later realized there could be an opportunity to develop content based around the <a href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/">Next Generation Science Standards</a> (NGSS) &#8212; the set of K-12 science content standards that were developed by a consortium of multiple U.S. states &#8212; whose adoption across the U.S. is now growing.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of parents were looking for healthier alternatives to YouTube,&#8221; Chad says. &#8220;And I really started to believe this is something that could be much bigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>He found also that the science-based topics kids are generally interested in are often those that are aligned with what the NGSS aims to teach &#8212; like space, dinosaurs, geology and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big inspiration was just looking at the most popular books on Amazon for kids,&#8221; Chad adds, noting that a large number of these books are focused on STEM-related subjects.</p>
<p>Chad met his co-founder Lawrence Tran when consulting for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/12/bill-coms-ipo-pricing-is-good-news-for-unprofitable-startups/">fintech startup Bill.com</a>, and convinced him and his brother Tanner to work on the startup.</p>
<p>Over the course of a couple of years, Tappity has developed tools that make it easier and efficient to produce interactive, educational video content. Today, the library includes over 200 science lessons for kids ages 4 to 10, across thousands of videos.</p>
<p>While the video clips themselves are pre-recorded, they give the kids the feeling of having a one-on-one interaction with the character on the screen. For example, if the teacher is building something and needs a screwdriver, the kids can pass it to her in the app when she asks. But they&#8217;ll also have a lot of other fun options they can do instead, like passing her tape or even throwing pizza at her &#8212; and she&#8217;ll react. The teacher may also engage with kids in other ways, too, like responding to what they drew in the app, among other things.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2090928" style="width: 519px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2090928" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2090928" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?w=509" alt="" width="509" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg 1673w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=224,300 224w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=768,1026 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=509,680 509w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=1149,1536 1149w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=1532,2048 1532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tappity-ipad-over-shoulder-mock.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2090928" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tappity</p></div></p>
<p>Currently, Tappity&#8217;s teacher Haley the Science Gal<a href="https://www.tappityapp.com/team"> (Haley McHugh)</a>, a childhood entertainment expert with over 10 years of experience, is leading the lessons which span topics like space, life science, earth science and physical science.</p>
<p>In addition to the video lessons, kids are engaged with an in-app points system for completing activities. The app also offers follow-up emails for parents so they can track what kids are learning and further engage them.</p>
<p>Due to the COVID pandemic, and the resulting screen fatigue that comes from virtual schooling, Tappity adapted some lessons to include offline activities &#8212; like drawing with paper and pens, for instance. And on Sundays, Tappity offers more involved activities parents and kids can do together &#8212; like baking cookies that you turn into Pangea or making a volcano.</p>
<p>Tappity expects to have over 1,000 hours of video content by the end of next year, and over 4,000 hours by the year after, Chad notes.</p>

<p>When the team of three applied to startup accelerator Y Combinator, Tappity was small but profitable, thanks to its in-app subscription tiers that average around $9 per month.

<p>While the COVID pandemic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/vcs-pour-funding-into-edtech-startups-as-covid-19-shakes-up-the-market/">has inspired VCs to invest in more edtech startups</a>, the longevity of some of these businesses in the post-COVID world remains to be seen.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If ever there was a typically quiet tech industry that seemed to drive massive headlines this year, it was semiconductors. From record-setting M&amp;A purchases to prodigious venture capital financing, the decline of major players and huge international trade fights, semiconductor companies found themselves in the crosshairs of inventors, VCs, regulators, politicians and, well, Apple.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			That’s not to say that there is nothing left to buy in the market, but big players like Nvidia and AMD have made their biggest bets and are unlikely to make any more major acquisitions in the meantime.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>2020 was a banner year, mostly since it was the culmination of patterns we’ve been watching in the industry for years now. It’s dangerous to predict that there will be “less news” in any tech industry, but these patterns have in many ways worked themselves out, and it seems highly probably that 2021 will be a quieter year for semiconductors than the past year has been.</p>
<p>Here’s a snapshot of four of the largest storylines of 2020 and what may happen next as we enter 2021.</p>
<h2 id="Chip consolidation is in process. The question is whether it will all be approved">Chip consolidation is in process. The question is whether it will all be approved</h2>
<p>The biggest story this year in chips was the rapid consolidation of the industry in just the span of a few months. That consolidation was headlined by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/13/nvidia-confirms-40b-purchase-of-arm-bringing-together-two-chip-giants/">Nvidia’s $40 billion purchase offer of Arm</a>, the chip design firm that supplies the blueprint for almost all smartphones and is also starting to encroach on the desktop world with Apple’s launch of its M1 processor.</p>
<p>Nvidia wasn’t unique in throwing around big money to consolidate. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/amd-grabs-xilinx-for-35-billion-as-chip-industry-consolidation-continues/">AMD spent $35 billion to buy Xilinx</a>, which makes reprogrammable chips known as FPGAs that are increasingly vital in tech stacks like 5G, where technologies change faster than silicon can be replaced. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/intel-agrees-to-sell-its-nand-business-to-sk-hynix-for-9-billion/">Intel sloughed off its memory unit to SK Hynix for $9 billion</a> as it fights for survival, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-maxim-intg-m-a-analog-devices/chipmaker-analog-devices-to-buy-rival-maxim-for-about-21-billion-idUSKCN24E14B">Analog Devices bought Maxim for $21 billion</a> in a bid to consolidate the embedded chips market in areas like sensors and power management. Beyond the major headlines of course, there were many smaller acquisitions made across the industry.</p>
<p>The chips industry isn’t unique in its heavy consolidation — plenty of other industries have also taken the M&amp;A route given the relatively lenient antitrust policy in place and the abundant capital from the public markets at their disposal. Yet, there are also unique forces pushing semis to head this direction.</p>
<p>First, the cost of staying competitive in the chip industry have been rising rapidly. For the most high-performance chips, fabs cost tens of billions of dollars to construct and require years of lead time. R&amp;D costs remain high, which is one reason why VC financing of the industry has been limited in the past (although that has changed — read below). It’s just tough to make it in chips if you are small and don’t have the capital to burn to stay competitive.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more importantly though, there has been consolidation on the customer side, and that monopsony is also forcing general consolidation for suppliers. Among the largest buyers of high-performance compute and storage today are the big cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Apple and a few other manufacturers control most of the market in smartphones, and even in embedded systems, the number of buyers is apparently consolidating. Customer consolidation forces supplier consolidation, fighting market demand power with market supply power.</p>
<p>Those two trends have been around for years, but they culminated this year with the M&amp;A frenzy we saw. That’s not to say that there is nothing left to buy in the market, but big players like Nvidia and AMD have made their biggest bets and are unlikely to make any more major acquisitions in the meantime.</p>
<p><b>What to watch for in 2021</b>: The big story next year is which of these massive acquisitions actually receives approval. Antitrust regulators have been remarkably sanguine about consolidation in the sector, but now that consolidation is reaching its logical end, with only a few players — or even just one — existing in their respective markets.</p>
<p>These antitrust concerns are most notable with Nvidia/Arm, which has to receive simultaneous approval from four authorities (United States, Britain, Europe and China). Experts in the industry that I have talked to have been divided on their predictions, with some feeling that the parties can “work out a deal” and others feeling that China in particular is unlikely to approve a deal. We can expect some signs of how this is going in 2021, although approval of the deal might well head into 2022.</p>
<p>AMD/Xilinx has also raised some eyebrows among experts, but hasn’t gotten nearly the press that Nvidia/Arm has. As for Analog Devices and Maxim — which is pretty much classic horizontal consolidation — shareholders approved the merger in October, and the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201008006054/en/Analog-Devices-and-Maxim-Integrated-Shareholders-Approve-Combination">said in its press release</a> then that the period for the U.S. to intervene on antitrust grounds had expired. It still faces regulatory approvals in other regions and could close by summer 2021.</p>
<p>Given the huge spike in antirust concerns in the United States among both Democrats and Republicans around platform companies like Google and Facebook, the big question is whether those concerns spill over into other technology industries like chips. So far, that hasn’t been the case, but the new Biden administration might have other ideas when it sets up shop in January.</p>

<p>2020 was another major year for VC dollars in next-generation silicon, after huge investment in 2019 and 2018. I’ve covered a lot of the exciting startups in the space, including Nuvia (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/nuvia-series-b/">which announced $240 million in September for its Series B</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/sifives-new-pc-is-bringing-open-source-computing-closer-to-reality/">SiFive</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/edgeq-raises-51-million-to-fuse-ai-compute-and-5g-within-a-single-chip/">EdgeQ</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/the-cerebras-cs-1-computes-deep-learning-ai-problems-by-being-bigger-bigger-and-bigger-than-any-other-chip/">Cerebras</a>, and there are even more companies in the sector, including Graphcore and Mythic that are working on exciting products. Aggregate dollars in the sector are hard to calculate, since most chip companies stay very quiet about their funding for years due to concerns about competition. Nonetheless, even just the rounds that have been announced are staggering in scale.</p>

<p>Tesla&#8217;s operations with begin with sales in early 2021 and then “maybe” look at assembling and manufacturing vehicles in the country, India’s transport minister Nitin Gadkari <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/business/nitin-gadkari-confirms-tesla-coming-to-india-in-early-2021-7123238/">told</a> newspaper Indian Express. How early? Definitely not next month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1343094437149229056">tweeted</a> over the weekend.</p>
<p>Tesla has for years expressed interest in expanding to India. But in a 2018 tweet, Musk shared that “some government regulations” in India had emerged as a roadblock.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like elsewhere in the world, Musk has amassed tens of millions of fans in India. A handful of people paid the token amount of $1,000 to pre-order the Model 3 in 2016. Musk later blamed the local regulations for the delay in bringing the cars to customers in India.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’m misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn’t yet exist in India to support that,” he tweeted in 2017.</p>
<p>There are automakers operating in India. Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, salt-to-steel giant Tata, and Mahindra currently command the auto market in India. In the past two years, Tata Motors, Hyundai, Morris Garages and Mercedes have launched new electric car models in the country, including the Mercedes EQC and Tata Nexon EV.</p>
<p>Tesla has long focused on expanding global sales and today has showrooms in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Mexico as well as throughout Europe as well as a final assembly facility that opened in 2013 in Tilburg, Netherlands. However, it wasn&#8217;t until 2019 that the company began producing vehicles outside of the United States. In late 2019, Tesla started producing electric vehicles at its factory in Shanghai. Tesla is constructing another factory in Berlin as well as in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>And by the looks of it 30x (price of the car) by the time it launches in India. Sigh.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>India has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s largest battlegrounds for American, South Korean and Chinese firms, that are looking at the South Asian market to expand their user and customer bases. Facebook and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> both of which identify India as their biggest market by users, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/india-approves-googles-4-5-billion-deal-with-reliances-jio-platforms/">wrote multi-billion checks to Indian telecom giant Jio Platforms</a> this year, for instance. Apple has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/19/apple-puts-contract-partner-wistron-on-probation-after-violence-at-india-plant/">ramped up its local production in the country</a> in recent years to secure a larger smartphone market share &#8212; more than 70% of which is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/samsung-beats-xiaomi-to-reclaim-no-1-spot-in-indian-smartphone-market/">commanded by Chinese smartphone vendors</a>.</p>
<p>New Delhi, which has claimed to abolish more than a 1,000 “archaic laws” in recent years, has previously acknowledged the pain points expressed by Musk. In the past three years, India has proposed billions of dollars in incentive to car companies to switch to electric alternatives and accelerate innovation and manufacturing of batteries in a bid to reduce its spendings on oil and curb air pollution.</p>
<p>India also proposed to ride-hailing firms Uber and Ola to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/india-electric-vehicles-2026-uber-ola/">convert 40% of their fleets in the country to electric by April 2026</a>. It stated that the ride-hailing giants must convert 2.5% of their fleet of cars by 2021, 5% by 2022 and 10% by 2023.</p>
<p>Indian ride-hailing firm Ola, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/ola-electric-acquires-etergo-to-launch-own-line-of-electric-two-wheelers-this-year/">acquired Amsterdam-based Etergo earlier this year,</a> said this month that it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/13/ola-to-invest-327-million-to-set-up-the-worlds-largest-scooter-factory-in-tamil-nadu/">invest about $327 million</a> to set up “the world’s largest scooter factory” in the Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which it said will be able to create 10,000 new jobs and have an initial capacity to produce 2 million electric vehicles in a year.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a proposal drafted by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi-backed think tank Niti Aayog said the country could slash its spendings on oil import by as much as $40 billion in the next 10 years if electric vehicles were to be widely adopted.</p>
<p>Gadkari told the Indian newspaper that he is hopeful that India will emerge as the No. 1 manufacturing hub for auto in five years.</p>

		Ross Lipson is CEO and co-founder at <a href="https://dutchie.com/home">Dutchie</a>, an online cannabis marketplace. Ross possesses more than a decade of experience in advanced and equitable delivery services for a variety of industries, including online food ordering, and has executed two successful business exits.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">To say that COVID-19 has dominated the past year would be an understatement. We’ve seen the pandemic reorient how we interact with businesses, each other and the world around us. It’s accelerated many trends in business — from e-commerce to digital payments — by several years in a matter of months.</p>
<p>The cannabis industry is no exception. Cannabis was already the country’s fastest-growing industry, but 2020 has taken the space to another level. A record-high percentage of Americans now support cannabis legalization.</p>
<p>By all accounts, cannabis was one of the biggest winners on Election Day, with legalization passing in Arizona, Montana, Missouri, New Jersey and South Dakota. More than one-third of the country — over 111 million people — now live in a state with legal recreational cannabis. By 2021, the legal industry is expected to be worth $24.5 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			A record-high percentage of Americans now support cannabis legalization.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Never has it been more clear that cannabis is now a staple in mainstream America. As we look toward 2021, this upward trajectory not only opens new doors for the industry, but the economy as a whole, with greater innovation, investment and employment opportunities flowing into the space.</p>
<h2>A green economy</h2>
<p>More than 57 million Americans have filed for unemployment since March. While the financial and employment opportunities around cannabis are not a silver bullet, they&#8217;re certainly not something we should ignore.</p>
<p>Legal cannabis sales reached nearly $20 billion this past year and are expected to top $40 billion annually within the next four years. As the industry continues to grow, companies are hiring to keep pace. The legal cannabis market supports 243,700 full-time-equivalent American jobs, which are set to multiply by 250% between 2018 and 2028. This makes the cannabis industry America’s largest source for new jobs.</p>
<p>Cannabis can also strengthen state economies and generate opportunities for increased tax revenue, particularly as state and local budgets dwindle. For example, with its new legalization measure, Arizona will issue a 16% tax on cannabis sales that will go toward community colleges, police, fire departments and public health programs.</p>
<h2>Accelerating cannabis e-commerce</h2>
<p>If there’s one point that’s been reinforced this year, it’s that cannabis is a highly demanded and indispensable consumer good.</p>
<p>At the height of widespread shelter-in-place orders this spring, dispensaries were classified as &#8220;essential&#8221; in many states alongside grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies. While people couldn’t shop at department stores or go to the movies, they could still purchase from their local dispensary. This government recognition was a major signal to the market that the space has been elevated to the mainstream.</p>
<p>A resounding response from consumers followed with record cannabis sales. Unprecedented demand forced cannabis retailers to revolutionize the ways they do business and how customers purchase products. To minimize direct person-to-person contact that can potentially spread the virus, dispensaries turned quickly to e-commerce and digital payment solutions to keep employees and consumers safe while modernizing their business.</p>
<p>As a result of these changes across industries, online sales will reach $794.5 billion by the end of the year, far surpassing original estimates. Experts estimate that the pandemic accelerated the shift to e-commerce by five years. At Dutchie, we’ve seen this firsthand. Since March, we’ve experienced a 700% surge in online orders and a 32% increase in average order size.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead to 2021</h2>
<p>These political and business transformations were milestones that we&#8217;ve fast-forwarded to at breakneck speed. So, what comes next?</p>
<p>I see technological innovation at the forefront of the legal industry moving forward. Technology will enable dispensaries to streamline operations in a highly regulated space where compliance is essential. In turn, data will increasingly become more important as retailers will need to better understand their data to make more proactive, informed decisions. This will be a focus for dispensaries of all sizes, but in particular larger businesses that are looking for an increasingly high level of sophistication for their online experiences.</p>
<p>To meet this need, we’re finally seeing new enterprise-level solutions on the market that empower dispensaries to fully leverage their data to design their unique online identity so they can remain competitive as more players join the space.</p>
<p>As legalization continues to spread, wider adoption will further legitimize the industry and de-stigmatize cannabis sales and use. We will likely see cannabis companies attracting more top talent from some of the most notable companies across mainstream industries, and more software platforms, businesses and investors that were formerly hesitant to enter the space begin to work with and invest in cannabis-related businesses. Federal legalization of cannabis also has the potential to enhance liquidity and open the floodgates to more investment deals.</p>
<p>Additionally, as we’ve already begun to see, there will be an increasing trend toward consolidation across the space as retailers continue to make big acquisitions and mergers. More multistate operators will consume smaller players and smaller players will combine forces, creating a space that is more cohesive and less fragmented.</p>
<h2>The future of cannabis</h2>
<p>The cannabis industry is still in its infancy, but its potential is crystal clear.</p>
<p>As more states legalize and the industry grows and matures, we will see the needle move even closer to where we want to be: Where legal cannabis is afforded the same technological and financial resources as other mainstream industries; innovators can more freely come together to develop modern technology solutions to push the space forward; and where consumers and patients can get what they want more conveniently.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">During my five years with Global Founders Capital, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rocket-internet" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rocket-internet">Rocket Internet’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> $1 billion VC arm, I saw more than a hundred of Rocket’s incubated companies attempt to internationalize. For background, Rocket Internet has helped launch some very successful businesses internationally, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hellofresh" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hellofresh">HelloFresh <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> ($12.9 billion market cap), Lazada ($1 billion exit to Alibaba), Jumia ($3.2 billion market cap), Zalando ($21.2 billion market cap) and many others. Rocket often followed the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0791239V7">Blitzscaling</a> model popularized by Reid Hoffman — earning them an appearance in his book of the same name.</p>
<p>After an initial success helping Groupon scale internationally via a merger with Rocket’s incubation firm CityDeal, Rocket’s team have aggressively scaled businesses from Algeria to Zimbabwe — sometimes in a matter of weeks. No surprise, Rocket also has a graveyard of failed companies that were victims of bad internationalization efforts.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Many companies make the costly mistake of launching abroad too soon.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>My personal observations on Rocket’s successes and failures start with this crucial point: These learnings might not apply to your unique combination business model, market and timing. No matter how well you prepare and plan your internationalization, in the end you need to be agile, alert and smart as you dip your toes into your first foreign market.</p>
<h2>Fail fast and cheaply</h2>
<p>Internationalization can be a big driver of growth and consequently enterprise value, which is why investors always push for it. But going abroad can also destroy value just as quickly. As a founder, it’s your job to manage financial and operational risks. Finding the right balance between keeping costs in check and not underinvesting can mean doing things more slowly than your board would like. For example, you might launch new markets sequentially instead of rolling 10 out at the same time.</p>
<p>Adopt a “hire slow, fire fast” mentality for your expansion strategy. Don’t be afraid to pull the plug if things don’t work out.</p>
<p>Our team at <a href="https://www.heartcore.com/">Heartcore Capital</a> use the following framework and learnings to guide internationalization strategies for our portfolio companies. A successful internationalization strategy needs to answer and address the “Four Ws”: <strong>When</strong>, <strong>Where</strong>, <strong>Which</strong> and <strong>With whom</strong> to internationalize. (Regarding the fifth W from journalism, you should not need to ask the “Why” question if you want to build a large business!)</p>
<h2>1. When is the right time to start?</h2>
<p>Many companies make the costly mistake of launching abroad too soon. They look at internationalization as a detached function, isolated from the rest of the business and then launch their second market prematurely. Follow this simple rule: <strong>Wait to internationalize until you hit product/market fit.</strong></p>
<p>How do you know exactly when you’ve reached product/market fit? According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a>, “Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.” <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html">He adds</a> that experienced entrepreneurs can usually feel if they’ve reached this point.</p>
<p>Let’s take the man for his word and move on to the actual argument: Until you have product/market fit, you will not be able to distinguish between what you’ve learned from your business model and what you’ve learned from your in-country experience. Mistakes will compound. Complexities and costs will multiply. I contend that insufficient understanding of their business and operating model is the main reason why companies fail with their expansion strategies.</p>
<p>Founders should also consider the underlying costs of internationalizing before they decide to expand (more about this in the “What” section below). Some companies are global by default — think mobile gaming companies — or simply require language localization. Others need to build new warehouses, hire local teams or build entirely new products. The costs and respective risks of expanding prematurely depend heavily on the business model.</p>
<p>There are edge cases where companies need to move quickly to internationalize for strategic reasons — despite uncertainty about their market fit. For instance, companies like Groupon or those engaged in food delivery face winner-takes-most markets, where opportunities for product differentiation are limited. “Blitzscaling” makes sense in cases like these.</p>
<p>However, you should tread carefully if your only reason to start scaling abroad is a large fundraise or to match a competitor’s internationalization efforts. Scaling prematurely for the wrong reasons might just cost you your entire company.</p>
<p>When Rocket Internet announced it would launch the Homejoy model into European markets with <a href="https://www.helpling.de/">Helpling</a>, the American “original” company launched quickly in Germany in an effort to squash their new competitor. In the early days of “on-demand everything,” a managed marketplace for cleaning services sounded like the next unicorn in the making.</p>
<p>In 2013, Homejoy had a fresh $24 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_A_round">Series A</a> from <a href="https://www.gv.com/">Google Ventures</a> and <a href="http://www.firstround.com/">First Round</a> — considered a huge round at a time when Instacart had just raised an $8 million Series A and Snapchat had done a $13 million Series A round. It must have seemed like a good idea to squash the German competition early.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Homejoy’s product was not yet ready to scale internationally. Just 13 months after launching in Germany, Homejoy had to cease operations globally, while Rocket’s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/helpling" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="helpling">Helpling <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is still alive and kicking. Helpling focused carefully on product, automation and making their unit economics work. A rush to crush an international competitor caused the demise of a would-be unicorn.</p>

Their websites in 2020 show starkly different outcomes. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Homejoy/Helpling</p></div></p>
<h2>2. Where should you internationalize?</h2>
<p>When deciding which new international market to tackle, it is vital to do your homework. Analyze the competitive environment, partner availability, infrastructure, culture, regulation and synergies with your home market.</p>
<p>In the early days of e-commerce, it was rather easy to analyze if a market was an expansion target. In the absence of professional competition, Rocket chose new countries based solely on GDP and internet penetration.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The rivalry between China&#8217;s top online learning apps has become even more intense this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest company to score a significant funding round is <a href="http://www.zybang.com/">Zuoyebang</a>, which <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/sgwmsJTg8ixpYrGtRuXASw">announced toda</a>y (link in Chinese) that it has raised a $1.6 billion Series E+ from investors including Alibaba Group. Other participants included returning investors Tiger Global Management, SoftBank Vision Fund, Sequoia Capital China and FountainVest Partners.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zuoyebang" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zuoyebang">Zuoyebang’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> latest announcement comes just six months after it announced a $750 million Series E led by Tiger Global and FountainVest. The latest financing brings Zuoyebang’s total raised so far to $2.93 billion. The company did not disclose its latest worth, but Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-zuoyebang-fundraising/baidu-backed-online-tutor-zuoyebang-seeks-new-funding-at-10-billion-valuation-sources-idUKKBN26L1DE">reported in September</a> that it was raising at a $10 billion valuation.</p>
<p>One of Zuoyebang’s main competitors is Yuanfudao, which announced in October that it had reached a $15.5 billion valuation after closing a $2.2 billion round led by Tencent. This pushed Yuanfudao ahead of Byju as the world’s most valuable ed-tech company. Another popular online learning app in China is Yiqizuoye, which is backed by Singapore’s Temasek.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Zuoyebang offers online courses, live lessons and homework help for kindergarten to 12th grade students, and claims about 170 million monthly active users, about 50 million of whom use the service each day. In comparison, there were about 200 million K-12 students in 2019 in China, <a href="http://www.moe.gov.cn/jyb_sjzl/sjzl_fztjgb/202005/t20200520_456751.html">according to the Ministry of Education</a> (link in Chinese).</p>
<p>In fall 2020, the total number of students in Zuoyebang’s paid live-stream classes reached more than 10 million, setting an industry record, the company claims. While a lot of the growth was driven by the pandemic, Zuoyebang founder Hou Jianbin said in the company’s funding announcement that it expects online education to continue growing in the longer term, and will invest in K-12 classes and expand its produt categories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What a whirlwind holiday for Jack Ma and his <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aax-b20d">fintech <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> empire. The People&#8217;s Bank of China, the country&#8217;s central bank, summoned Ant Group for regulatory talks on December 26th, announcing a sweeping plan for the fintech firm to &#8220;rectify&#8221; its regulatory violations.</p>
<p>The meeting came less than two months after China&#8217;s financial authorities abruptly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">halted</a> what could have been a record-setting initial public offering of Ant over the firm&#8217;s regulatory compliance issues. The company, which started out as a payments processor for Alibaba&#8217;s online marketplaces and spun out in 2011, lacked a sound governance structure, defied regulatory requirements, illegally engaged in arbitrage, excluded competitors using its market advantage and hurt consumer rights, <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4153479/index.html">said</a> the central bank.</p>
<p>Concurrently, Jack Ma&#8217;s e-commerce giant Alibaba is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">under investigation</a> by China&#8217;s top market regulator over alleged monopolistic behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7riTWQAubq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">China&#8217;s e-commerce titan Alibaba hit with antitrust probe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s e-commerce titan Alibaba hit with antitrust probe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/embed/#?secret=7riTWQAubq" data-secret="7riTWQAubq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The banking authority laid out a five-point compliance agenda for Ant, which is controlled by Alibaba&#8217;s billionaire founder Jack Ma. The fintech company should return to its roots in payments and bring more transparency to transactions; obtain the necessary licenses for its credit businesses and protect user data privacy; establish a financial holding company and ensure it holds sufficient capital; revamp its credit, insurance, wealth management and other financial businesses according to the law; and step up compliance for its securities business.</p>
<p>Following the closed-door meeting, Ant <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bJk4wIywi_aqk4pGD1IZHg">said</a> it has established an internal &#8220;rectification workforce&#8221; to work on all the regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The shakeup could take months to carry out and likely <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ant-group-ipo-suspension/ants-ipo-fiasco-set-to-clip-its-wings-and-dent-its-value-idUSKBN27K1SS">dent Ant&#8217;s valuation</a>, which surpassed $300 billion around the time it was scheduled to go public. For instance, the government recently announced plans to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-lending/update-1-china-issues-draft-rules-to-regulate-online-micro-lending-business-idUSL1N2HP035">raise the bar</a> for third-party technology platforms like Ant to provide loans to consumers, a segment that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">made up about 35%</a> of Ant&#8217;s annual revenue. The proposed change, which is part of Beijing&#8217;s effort to control the country&#8217;s debt risks, also sets a new requirement for online microlenders to provide at least 30% of the loan they fund jointly with banks, which could put pressure on Ant&#8217;s cash flow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ant’s recent interaction with regulatory agencies has shown that regulators are willing to step up on their effort to balance progress with risk by enforcing what it believes to be a sustainable way to de-leverage financial risks,&#8221; Flex Yang, chief executive at <a href="https://babel.finance/">Babel Finance</a>, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency financial services provider, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its products and services may either be taken down or remodeled, which will affect its profitability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some remain optimistic about Ant&#8217;s future. &#8220;[Ant] creates a lot of value. If you take the long view, the temporary suspension of its IPO has a limited impact on its business,&#8221; Bill Deng, founder of cross-border payments operator <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xtransfer">XTransfer</a> and a former executive at Ant, said to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the regulator&#8217;s standpoint, [Ant&#8217;s] lending size is getting so big that it has extended beyond the old regulatory perimeters. To some extent, it has also encroached on the core interests of traditional financial players,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The clampdown on Ant has no doubt sent a warning to the rest of the industry. In a surprising move, JD.com&#8217;s fintech unit, a challenger to Ant, <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-12-22/jdcoms-fintech-unit-reshuffles-executives-ahead-of-ipo-101642174.html">appointed its former chief compliance officer</a> to steer the fintech firm as the new chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Tencent also has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">sprawling fintech business</a>, but it may not receive the same level of scrutiny because the social and gaming giant is &#8220;not nearly as aggressive&#8221; as Ant in its fintech push, said a partner of Tencent&#8217;s overseas fintech business who asked not to be named.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus pandemic &#8212; and a handful of other factors &#8212; slowed dealmaking for startups in India this year.</p>
<p>Compared to their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/29/indian-tech-startups-funding-amount-2019/">record $14.5 billion fundraise last year</a>, Indian startups are ending 2020 with about $9.3 billion. This is the first time since 2016 that startups in India, one of the world’s largest startup communities, has raised less than $10 billion in a year, according to consultancy firm Tracxn.</p>
<p>The number of deals fell from 1,185 last year to 1,088 in 2020. There were fewer larger sized rounds, too. Rounds with dealsize $100 million or larger fell from 26 in 2019 to 20 (these rounds delivered $3.6 billion this year, compared to $7.5 billion last year), and similarly rounds with dealsize $50 million to $100 million fell from 27 to 13. (The figures do not include investments in telecom giant Jio Platforms, which alone raised over $20 billion this year.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the slowdown, Indian startups witnessed a substantial rebound in the second half of this year. In the first half, startups in the world’s second largest internet market had raised just $4.2 billion from about 461 deals, said Tracxn.</p>
<p>Other than the coronavirus, which has impacted startups worldwide, another factor that affected the dealmaking was absence of &#8212; or reduced participation from &#8212; some of the biggest investors.</p>
<p>Chinese giants such as Alibaba &#8212; and its affiliate Ant Group &#8212; and Tencent wrote <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/chinas-alibaba-wont-invest-in-indian-startups-for-at-least-six-months-report-says/">fewer checks this year</a> to Indian startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/">amid tension</a> between the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/india-bans-pubg-and-over-100-additional-chinese-apps/">two neighboring nations</a>. SoftBank also delivered less capital as many of its high-profile portfolio firms including Paytm, Oyo Rooms, and Ola did not raise money.</p>
<p>But the virus also accelerated growth of some startups. Byju’s is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/07/silver-lake-leads-500-million-round-in-indias-byjus/">valued at over $11 billion</a>, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/indian-education-startup-byjus-raises-200m-from-general-atlantic/">$8 billion in January this year</a>. Unacademy, another high-profile startup in the online learning space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indias-online-learning-platform-unacademy-raises-150-million-at-1-45-billion-valuation/">raised two rounds</a> at the height of the pandemic, increasing its valuation from about $500 million in February this year to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/tiger-global-invests-in-india-unacademy-at-2-billion-valuation/">over $2 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Bond, a firm started by Mary Meeker and other high-profile investors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/mary-meekers-bond-invests-in-indian-online-learning-giant-byjus/">backed Byju’s this year</a>. Bond believes that Byju’s will be worth over $30 billion in three years, a person who was briefed by the investment firm told TechCrunch. Several startups in India <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/chargebee-raises-55-million-to-help-businesses-move-to-subscriptions/">operating on a SaaS model</a> and catering to customers worldwide also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/15/sales-readiness-platform-mindtickle-raises-100-million-led-by-softbank-vision-fund-2/">picked up momentum this year</a>.</p>
<p>11 Indian startups including RazorPay, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unacademy" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unacademy">Unacademy, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> DailyHunt, and Glance became a unicorn this year. (On a side note, Google and Facebook wrote several checks to Indian firms this year. Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">backed Glance and DailyHunt last week</a>, while Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/facebook-backs-indian-education-startup-unacademy/">invested in Unacademy</a>. Both the firms also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/india-approves-googles-4-5-billion-deal-with-reliances-jio-platforms/">invested in Jio Platforms this year</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I am old enough (unfortunately!) to have seen the 2001 and 2008 downturns so when Covid hit and there were stories of doom and gloom everywhere, I remembered what I saw happening in the past downturns — a beginning of a new generation of teams who built the next generation of companies,&#8221; said Vaibhav Domkundwar, founder and managing partner at Better Capital. Better Capital, which backs early stage startups in India, wrote 43 investment and follow-on checks this year.</p>
<p>M&amp;A activities also accelerated this year. Byju’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/indias-byjus-acquires-whitehat-jr-for-300-million/">acquired WhiteHat Jr for $300 million</a>, while Unacademy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/unacademy-prepladder-india/">acquired PrepLadder</a>, which offers courses aimed at medical students, for $50 million in July. It also led an investment round of $5 million to acquire a majority stake in Mastree.</p>
<p>Reliance Industries acquired online pharmacy Nedmeds and, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/14/reliance-retail-buys-urban-ladder-for-24-4-million/">in a fire sale, Urban Ladder</a>.</p>
<p>But for the first time, Indian startups are on the verge of seeing another kind of exit. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zomato" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zomato">Zomato, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/flipkart" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="flipkart">Flipkart, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Policybazaar are among some startups that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/indias-zomato-raises-100m-from-tiger-global-says-it-is-planning-to-file-for-ipo-next-year/">plan to go public next year</a>. Analysts at Bernstein have identified Paytm, Byju’s, PhonePe, and Delhivery among those who could also go public by 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/EogHfkW0zbw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Today we sat on the deck with our daughter Ella and her boyfriend Nick. Knowing of my fascination with all things Beatles, Nick gave me a Japanese 45 of Get Back flipped with Don’t Let Me Down. His gift coincided with a 5 minute cut of material from a newly authorized production of a new version of Get Back, the film. A short history follows.</p>
<p>In the waning days of The Beatles’ partnership, the band decided to return to a more slimmed down production style, minus overdubs and plus a live feel. After original sessions in Twickenham Studios, the group decamped to the basement of their Apple headquarters and a hastily rebuilt studio courtesy of their usual producer, George Martin and loaned equipment from EMI Studios.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the years since Sgt. Pepper, Beatles records had begun to retreat from their highly produced studio experiments. The most recent double album, The Beatles (commonly known as the White Album) was largely recorded in single takes, driving a wedge between the group and their producer that fostered a two week holiday where Martin turned the production over to his assistant.</p>
<p>The multiple takes also exacerbated growing tensions between the band members, as hundreds of attempts to perfect Paul McCartney songs like Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da drove Lennon further into his heroin experiments with Yoko Ono. Bickering drove Ringo Starr to quit for two weeks before being lured back with flowers draping his drum kit; George Harrison invited Eric Clapton in to a session in a successful attempt to put the rest on their best behavior. This gambit worked again with Billy Preston in the Get Back sessions four months later in January 1969.</p>
<p>It may be hard to understand the context of these tensions in a world beset with a global pandemic and the worst president in the history of the free world, but this was the middle of the Vietnam War and the first term of Richard Nixon. His landslide reelection in 1972 would preclude the voters turning him out of office, and the Watergate scandal that drove him to resign was only just beginning to unfold. Compare the emotional turmoil of four rock musicians to today’s terror at the actions of an unhinged autocrat being removed from office in what seems like an endless thirty days. But it really sucked then as now.</p>
<p>Part of the problem was the disquieting anxiety on the part of the postwar boomer generation that we didn’t really deserve the respect we weren’t getting from straight society. The silent majority of our parents and peers sneered at our experiments of free love and drug-induced “insights.” The counter culture we labeled ourselves was as lonely a place to be as the Deplorables of 2016. We had no power, no real leaders, and nowhere to go but down when Woodstock collapsed into Altamont, assassination, and addiction.</p>
<p>So we didn’t know what we were talking about and yet here we were owning the ceramics we broke. Our heroes in London were on top of the world, and they couldn’t stand each other. What to do? Let’s make a movie of how we really are. On the plus side, there was real alchemy between these four young men. Even though sick of each other, they loved the results of what they found together. Lennon was haughty but funny, McCartney pleasant but coiled like a big cat. Ringo was Everyman, with an actor’s surprise at his luck and proud of his true role of ignition switch.</p>
<p>Harrison is the crucible, where the steel is forged. In interviews after the breakup and narrating during, George seems to be the one who realizes the true value of the partnership even as he explodes it with solo success. The backlog of his material spilled out in his first album, so successful that its chart topping drove McCartney and Lennon to try and keep up for the next 8 years until Lennon’s death.</p>
<p>Yet of all the others, he was the one to recognize the value, the responsibility, of keeping the door open for what they had together. When Lennon recorded his vicious assault on McCartney, How Do You Sleep, George not only played on the record but provided the emotional power with a surging slide guitar lead he’d only developed when the group was done. During the White Album sessions that produced some of Lennon’s best work, he suggested Lennon change the title from Maharishi to Sexy Sadie to lose the personal attack on the guru for what may have turned out to be a jealous setup by another of the group’s coterie.</p>
<p>In the film fragment released for Christmas 2020, Harrison is seen kicking off Get Back, the first time you can really see the role George played in the propulsion of the track. As with many players, you can best understand this when he drops out for a retake or a tempo adjustment led by Paul; the absence of the guitarist shows how central he is to the mix. In the only footage released prior to this new material, Harrison seemed subdued on the roof concert version of the track. He reportedly was opposed to doing a live concert in general, and only agreed to go out on the roof when Lennon finally committed.</p>
<p>It’s this context that is so striking in the new material. The tensions within the group can be seen not only for the inevitability of their collapse but also their courage to be filmed and displayed for all to consume. As a persistent fan of the band and all of its dynamics at the core of the century, the new footage comes across like The Godfather and its sequels. Like Godfather II, the Beatles studio phase once they abandoned live performance in 1966 transcended their initial success in a way that essentially invented the modern Hollywood business of sequels.</p>
<p>The return to live phase that began with the White Album and continued through the Get Back sessions resolved itself with the last Beatles recording of Abbey Road. In this way the Get Back film apparently includes early recordings of material from Abbey Road as well as Harrison and McCartney tracks never finished by the group. Unlike the Let It Be film that emerged as a director’s cut of the breakdown of the group pre-Abbey Road, this new Get Back film will likely serve as a document of the final phase of the group in both defeat and resolution.</p>
<p>The last Beatles recording of all four plus Billy Preston produced I Want You (She’s So Heavy), the long bluesy track that ends side one of Abbey Road. It’s a tantalizing glimpse into the future that never was of the greatest group there ever was. Like Francis Ford Coppola’s reimagining of the the last Godfather sequel, Get Back is a coda to the tragic highs and lows of the time that was the Sixties. At the time, it was impossible to imagine where we could go from there. Today, we share that same feeling of despair, but perhaps, the hope of what the future could bring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Want this newsletter in your inbox every Saturday morning? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here.</a></em></p>
<p>Remember when it was news that venture capitalists were open for business? Or when Zoom investing was only done by <a href="https://twitter.com/TurnerNovak">that one guy in Ann Arbor </a>(ha, I kid!)? These past few months have felt busier than ever, with no holiday slowdown in sight when it comes to startup growth, hot IPOs and new financings.</p>
<p>Even with a distracting bull market, I wanted to reflect and see how the youngest startups are faring. <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex Wilhem</a> and I dove into data, provided by Pitchbook, to see if the next <strong>DoorDashes</strong> and <strong>Airbnbs</strong> are getting their first financings.</p>
<p>The answer is that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/">seed investing flourished but in a complicated way</a>. COVID-19 shook up which startups were considered attractive by private investors. And that changeup came at risk to certain sectors and people.</p>
<p>Here’s how two investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/">explained the dynamics</a>:</p>
<h3><strong>Freestyle’s Jenny Lefcourt:</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>I think seed prices are being driven up by the larger [venture] firms playing earlier and feeling like <strong>they cannot afford to miss the next DoorDash. </strong>I think the larger firms have so much capital to put to work and feel they are better off burning some [cash] at seed for the upside of being in the right [startups] where they can <strong>double, triple, 10x down on their winners</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<h3><strong>Eniac Ventures’ Nihal Mehta: </strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>Because you can’t meet in person, investors felt way more comfortable investing in ‘proven’ entrepreneurs that had <strong>pre-existing connections to their social circle.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The long-term ramifications of this tunnel vision means that female founders lost out during this time, since social circles in venture capital are largely white and male. From a sector perspective, e-commerce and edtech have had an easy time raising, but at the cost of travel and hospitality.</p>
<p>The data brings a sort of dissonance to startup-land: Even though seed investing has never looked more busy and fruitful, this is good news for some, and bad news for others. It’s a healthy reminder that a boom and bust can be true at the same time.</p>
<p>How’s that for a 2020 sign-off? We’ll be off next week but in the meantime, two bits of homework: take advantage of this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/holiday-sale-save-10-on-extra-crunch-membership/">Extra Crunch holiday sale</a> and send me tips and thoughts to <a href="mailto:natasha.mascarenhas@techcrunch.com">natasha.mascarenhas@techcrunch.com</a> or tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> in between your holiday treats.</p>
<p>I’ll chat with you all in the New Year.</p>

<h2>Edtech’s biggest challenge in 2021</h2>
<p>No sector has had a year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">quite like edtech</a>. The sector attracted $10 billion in funding globally, and remote learning went from a tool to a necessity.</p>
<p>Here are my favorite edtech stories I wrote this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/edtech-investors-are-panning-for-gold/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Edtech investors are panning for gold</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teachers-are-leaving-schools-will-they-come-to-startups-next/">Teachers are leaving schools. Will they come to startups next?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/edtech-is-surging-and-parents-have-some-notes/">Edtech is surging, and parents have some notes </a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/edtech-startups-prepare-to-become-not-just-a-teaching-tool-but-a-necessity/">Edtech startups prepare to become ‘not just a teaching tool but a necessity’ </a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/will-edtech-empower-or-erase-the-need-for-higher-education/"> Will edtech empower or erase the need for higher education</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/to-win-post-pandemic-edtech-needs-to-start-thinking-big/">in my end of year op-ed for TechCrunch</a>, I propose that the ubiquity of remote learning surely brought a boom to new users, but it may have in fact limited the sector’s ability to innovate in lieu of fast, easy scale.</p>
<p>Here’s my biggest tip for the year ahead:</p>
<blockquote><p>For edtech in 2020, flexible and scrappy was a survival tactic that led to profits, growth and most of all, aha moments that technology was needed in the way we learn. Now, as we enter the rest of the decade, the sector will have to shake off its short-term-fix mentality to evolve from tunnel vision to wide-pan ambition.</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>A $16B checkbook for space startups </strong></h2>
<p>Funding for space startups is defying odds &#8211; which is the poetic flair we need once in a while. As part of our TC Sessions: Space 2020 event, a number of TechCrunch reporters dove deep into what kind of money is going into &#8230; the space.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some think that space startup funding didn’t slow, despite the economic downturn, because of government involvement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/despite-economic-downturn-space-startup-funding-defies-gravity/ ">providing a budget buffer</a>.</li>
<li>The man who handles the money for the Air Force’s $16 billion checkbook wants startups to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/the-us-wants-startups-to-get-a-piece-of-the-16-billion-spent-on-space-tech/">slide into the DMs</a>.</li>
<li>Three VCs talk about space junk, sustainability, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/3-vcs-discuss-space-junk-and-what-else-theyre-betting-on-right-now/">the merits of space manufacturing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chris Boshuizen</strong> of the venture firm <strong>DCVC</strong> and a co-founder of <strong>Planet Labs</strong> notably said:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We don’t yet live in the sci-fi future, where you can just fly up, grab a piece of debris and bring it back. That’s really, really hard — I think probably five years away — but something we want to support and see happen.</em></p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>Remembering the startups we lost in 2020 </strong></h2>
<p>Building a startup is always difficult, but the pandemic was a plot twist that led to a not-so-happy ending for many companies this year. So, as part of an annual TechCrunch tradition, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/remember-the-startups-we-lost-in-2020/">paid homage to the startups we lost in 2020. </a></p>
<p>Here are my takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not a fun list. Failure is hard, but you can learn a thing or two when you sort through the ashes. For example? Big names, big plans, and a boatload of money isn&#8217;t a replacement for actually making money.</li>
<li>List includes <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">short-form video app <strong>Quibi</strong>, to lawyer tech startup <strong>Atrium</strong>, to a slew of travel startups which fell apart as the virus dragged on. </span></li>
<li>While some businesses chalked up failure to COVID-19, the cracks and fundamental business flaws were often peeking through far before the pandemic began.<br />

<p>Finally, Equity is ending the year with two holiday episodes. This week, we&#8217;ve got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/equity-venture-capital-surprise-2020/">reflections on this dumpster fire year.</a> I teamed up with <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton"> Danny</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/alex"> Alex</a> to just sit back and think about this eventful year. We also got five venture capitalists who we got to leave us their notes as well.</p>
<p>The goal for this episode was to sit down and think<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/equity-venture-capital-surprise-2020/"> a year that no one could have ever predicted</a>, but with a specific angle, as always, on venture capital and startups.</p>
<p>We asked about the biggest surprise, non-portfolio companies to watch, and trends they got wrong and right. There was also banter on Zoom investing (Alex came up with Zesting, not me) and startup pricing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;The Mandalorian&#8221; just wrapped up its second season on Disney+, with an action-packed and surprise-filled finale.</p>
<p>In many ways, it feels like a seamless continuation of the first season&#8217;s storylines, with the titular bounty hunter searching for a Jedi who can take responsibility for the alien moppet known to the internet as Baby Yoda, while the pair is pursued by the sinister Moff Gideon.</p>
<p>But as we explain on the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, where <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/17/original-content-mandalorian/">the first season</a> of &#8220;The Mandalorian&#8221; felt accessible to anyone, regardless of their level of Star Wars fandom, season two deepens its ties to the rest of the fictional universe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That includes bringing in live action versions of characters from the animated &#8220;Clone Wars&#8221; series, as well as setting up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/disney-investor-day/">the many other Star Wars shows</a> that are in the works for Disney+. This approach prompted very different responses from your podcast hosts — Darrell was delighted since he understood all the Ester Eggs, Jordan was exhausted trying to keep up and Anthony was happy to let many of the references go over his head.</p>
<p>At least the show&#8217;s other virtues remain intact, with enjoyably grungy and tactile space opera settings, spectacular big budget battles and an adorable baby Jedi.</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing &#8220;The Mandalorian,&#8221; we also discuss HBO Max&#8217;s arrival on Roku (which somehow prompts Anthony to explain his disappointment in the new Christopher Nolan movie &#8220;Tenet&#8221;), and Darrell and Jordan offer their latest thoughts on &#8220;The Bachelorette.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>I don’t have a good answer to the question. Knowing full well that I’m talking <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/">back to an algorithm</a> &#8212; even one asking the same question of everyone with a different band mad-libbed in &#8212; doesn’t soften the blow. Am I? Are we? Is anyone, really?</p>
<p>In this case, it’s referring to Waxahatchee. I mean, yeah, I totally listened to a lot of Waxahatchee this year. Waxahatchee is good. Saint Cloud was one of my favorite albums of the year. Katie Crutchfield’s music doesn’t exist in the Elliott Smith, Leonard Cohen bin for me. It’s not time to send up the signal flares when you see the band all over my <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/spotify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="spotify">Spotify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> social feed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Spotify roasting AI that’s been making the rounds this week is a fun exercise in music snobbery. It also may be brushing against some larger truth here. Something I think we all considered at least in passing this year when Spotify offered its annual “Wrapped” year in review.</p>
<p>What’s the soundtrack to the worst year, ever? What do we listen to while the world burns? In 2009, a former CNN intern stumbled across a video tape in the archives labeled with the title, <a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-video-cnn-will-play-when-the-world-ends-1677511538">&#8220;Turner Doomsday Video.”</a> The minute-long video features a band playing, &#8220;Nearer My God To Thee,” believed to be the final song played by the band on the Titanic. It carried the explicit instructions, “HFR [Hold for Release] till end of the world confirmed.”</p>
<p>Barring any sort of last-minute surprise, it seems likely we’ll make it through 2020 shy of a full-on apocalypse (in spite of, perhaps, the best efforts of some). But for me, Spotify’s year in review was a testament to hell year, just as my Apple Watch exercise bars saw a zeroing out in late-March and April, as the pandemic bore down on my home of Queens, New York and I dealt with some personal health issues.</p>
<p>What was pitched as a celebratory aggregation of my listening habits over the previous 12 months exited the machine as a testament to the long stretches of time where engaging with music felt like an impossibility. Ambient music and post-rock got me listening again when lyrics seemed like too much to process. And I’m sure I’m not alone in having listened to some comfort tracks with an alarming frequency.</p>
<p>Looking back is a useful reminder of the role music played in what undoubtedly qualifies as the worst year to date for many. It would be an overstatement to suggest that music saved my life in 2020, but it certainly cushioned the blow of one too many emotional gut punches.</p>
<p>“Music can lift us out of depression or move us to tears – it is a remedy, a tonic, orange juice for the ear,” the late-neurologist, Oliver Sacks wrote. “But for many of my neurological patients, music is even more – it can provide access, even when no medication can, to movement, to speech, to life. For them, music is not a luxury, but a necessity.”</p>
<p>Louis Armstrong put it even more succinctly: “music is life itself.”</p>
<p>It’s a cruel irony that, in a year when music has meant so much to so many, most musicians have struggled to make ends meet. The musical field certainly isn’t unique in that respect this year, but their struggles have been pronounced in an era when streaming revenues offer fractions of cents what musicians make in record sales, and touring has become the most important revenue stream for all but the biggest names. For the past 10 months, that all but dried up.</p>
<p>“The pandemic utterly decimated the live-music industry,” Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeff-tweedy-on-covid-19and-its-impact-on-live-music-11608062400">noted in a recent interview</a>. “There’s been almost an entire year now of absolutely zero revenue.”</p>
<p>In May, a <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/19-per-cent-of-musicians-are-considering-abandoning-their-careers-due-to-lack-of-government-support-during-coronavirus-2670463">survey from the Musician’s Union</a> noted that 19% of musicians said they might end up giving up their careers due to the impact of COVID-19. Seven months later, one wonders whether that figure might have been optimistic.</p>
<p>Tweedy adds, “There will be places to play. But the landscape won’t ever look the same. I imagine that a lot of the more intimate music venues will be gone, just like a lot of small businesses and restaurants.”</p>

<p>Bandcamp has been a beacon for many. The service’s “Bandcamp Fridays,” which waive its revenue cut, have raised $40 million to date. The site has promised to continue offering the feature at least through May of next year.</p>
<p>This year’s struggles have served to highlight concerns over streaming royalties. Spotify has understandably been the focal point for this conversation, all while the company has spent hundreds of millions to bolster its podcast programming. CEO Daniel Ek didn’t do himself any favors in July when he noted, “Some artists that used to do well in the past may not do well in this future landscape, where you can’t record music once every three to four years and think that’s going to be enough.”</p>

<p>In October, Justice at Spotify rep (and Galaxie 500 member) Damon Kurkowski told me “[R]esponse from certain corners of the industry has been as cold as we expected: ‘You’re just musicians and don’t understand business,’ is the basic gist of it. To which I would say: The problem we are calling attention to is precisely that musicians have been left out of the conversation! We always come last in payment and in consultation — even though our work is what the streaming business is built on.”</p>
<p>The struggle to survive on music is nothing new, of course. Jazz genius Thelonious Monk famously had a benefactor in Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter. But just because we’ve failed musicians in the past doesn’t mean we can’t and shouldn’t do better.</p>
<p>Am I okay? I’m still not sure, but listening to music seems to help.</p>
